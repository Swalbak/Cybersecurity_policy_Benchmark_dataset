As a result, the attacker takes  over the account and can receive all the SMS and voice calls intended for the legitimate  subscriber. Fraudsters can perform online banking frauds but also circumvent the two-factor  authentication (2FA) used to secure social media and other online accounts.  In this study, we give an overview of how this attack works, list measures that providers  can take to mitigate the attack and make recommendations for policy makers and  authorities in the telecom sector and other sectors.  Since 2017 there have been several media reports about SIM swapping attacks, targeting  people within the cryptocurrency community1, 2  but also bank accounts 3  and social media and  email accounts4.  To avoid being vulnerable, the subscribers should restrict their personal information exposed on  social media, update passwords regularly, never open messages and attachments from  unknown sources, frequently check their financial statements and avoid associating their phone  number with sensitive online accounts. If possible, other authentication mechanisms available  should be chosen. For more information check ENISA leaflet – How to avoid Mobile SIM  Swapping  Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), banks and authorities have already been collaborating to  mitigate fraudulent SIM swapping. Banks can use an Application Programming Interface (API)  provided by the MNOs to check whether a SIM swap has been recently performed.  • MNOs should reinforce fraudulent SIM swapping detection and blocking mechanisms,  by enhancing the internal processes to provide the customer with a preferably  seamless experience.  • Banking institutions should consistently apply the EU regulations such as the Directive  (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2), and take advantage of the available technical solutions  provided by the telecommunications operators.  • Finally, national authorities should encourage and enhance coordination between the  MNOs and the banking sector. Cooperation with Europol and national Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and law enforcement agencies should  also be promoted. Basic guidelines could be issued to efficiently direct operators,  banks and the public.  1 https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/  2 BlockFi discloses failed hack attempt after SIM swapping incident | ZDNet  3 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/  4 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockfi-discloses-failed-hack-attempt-after-sim-swapping-incident/#:~:text=For%20example,%20in%20January%202020,%20Canadian%20authorities%20charged,gangs,%20one%20in%20Spain%20and%20one%20in%20Romania. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/ https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Promoting the interests of the citizens and consumers of the European Union constitutes one of  the general objectives set out in Article 3, paragraph 2 of the new EU telecom security  legislation: the European Electronic Communications Code5 (the ‘EECC’):  In the context of this Directive, the national regulatory and other competent authorities as well  as BEREC, the Commission and the Member States shall (…)  (d) promote the interests of the citizens of the Union (…) by maintaining the security of networks  and services, by ensuring a high and common level of protection for end-users through the  necessary sector-specific rules.’  The EECC contains specific security requirements for electronic communication providers,  including aspects such as the confidentiality of communications. Most of the security  requirements are set out in articles 40 and 41 of the EECC, though its recitals also provide  guidance on these requirements. For example, recital 94 requires implementation of the state-  of-the-art measures to cover aspects such as handling security incidents, compliance  assessments and monitoring.  Furthermore, under the EECC, more communication services are in scope, particularly the so-  called Over-The-Top (OTT) communications services, such as Gmail, WhatsApp, and Skype.  The EECC aims to protect consumers, irrespective of the chosen communication tool, focusing  on the functionality (electronic communication), rather than on the underlying technology or  implementation choices6.  Security of electronic communications networks and services does not only translate to  minimising the risk of service deterioration or outage, but also to protecting individual  customers, for example against fraud, such as SIM swapping attacks.  1.2 SIM SWAPPING ATTACKS  Similarly, to many other attacks against the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of electronic  communications of individual subscribers, in SIM swapping attacks, the attacker’s objective is to  gain control of the targeted subscriber's mobile account in order to perform a range of actions  associated with his mobile number. This type of attack takes advantage of the ability of the  MNO to transfer a mobile telephone number to a different SIM, a procedure referred to as  ‘number porting’. The attacker’s objective is therefore to take over a mobile subscriber’s account  by changing the affiliation of that account from the original SIM card to a SIM card under the  attacker’s control.  The attacker typically begins a SIM swapping attack by gathering personal details about the  targeted subscriber, for example through social engineering, phishing, malware, exploiting  information from data breaches or doing research on social media. Once the attacker has  obtained enough details to impersonate the targeted subscriber, he may be able to convince the  MNO to port the subscriber's mobile number to a new SIM card under the attacker’s control.  5 Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic  Communications Code, OJ L 321, 17.12.2018, p. 36  6 See, for example, rec. 95.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  6  Should this initial part of the attack be successful, the genuine subscriber’s SIM card will lose  connection to the network. This will enable the attacker to receive all the SMS and voice traffic  intended for the targeted subscriber, such as one-time passwords (OTPs) sent by text or  telephone calls, for example to log into online banking.  The subscriber may discover he has become victim of a fraudulent SIM swap once he is unable  to place or receive calls and SMS, or access his email or social media accounts.  Law enforcement agencies, MNOs, financial institutions and academia have been working on  addressing the problem of fraudulent SIM swapping, including launching awareness campaigns.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  This paper strives to provide guidance to national authorities supervising the implementation of Article 40 of the  EECC. It may also be useful for experts working in the EU telecom sector.  1.4 PREPARATION OF THIS REPORT  The study presented in the report is using a three-tiered methodology consisting of:  • desktop research taking stock of relevant literature on the topic.  • online surveys disseminated to EU MNOs and national competent authorities, which  was answered by 48 MNOs from 22 different countries and by 14 national competent  authorities.  • 11 targeted interviews: 8 interviews with MNOs, 2 with Europol and GSMA experts and  1 with a national security authority representative.  The information derived from the first two steps of the process was used in order to prepare and  further customize the subsequent step. The information collected was analysed, and  consolidated in order to provide tangible results in line with the purpose of this study. The report  was validated with the survey participants and the members of the European Competent  Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications Group (ECASEC EG).  Figure: Methodology of the study  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  7  2. SIM SWAPPING – A  LEGITIMATE CUSTOMER  REQUEST  In order to provide an overview of the SIM swapping process, we begin by briefly describing its  key component: the SIM or the embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM).  The SIM is an application hosted on a piece of hardware called the universal integrated circuit  card (UICC), which contains a chip. The SIM contains an identity that unambiguously identifies  a subscriber within an MNO’s network. The term ‘SIM card’ is commonly used when actually  referring to the UICC. Therefore, for simplicity, we will use the term ‘SIM card’ instead of ‘UICC’  throughout this report.  The eSIM is the embedded form of the SIM, meaning the eSIM does not exist physically on a  device but is virtual. The eSIM is hosted on an ‘embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card’  (eUICC).  SIM swapping is a legitimate procedure performed by a subscriber to change his SIM cards, for  example when:  • the SIM card has been lost, damaged or stolen; or  • the subscriber changes to a new device with another SIM card format.  In order to perform the SIM swap, MNOs commonly follow two processes:  • subscribers go to an MNO’s retail store or to an automatic machine that distributes SIM  cards; or  • subscribers use a remote process, such as an MNO’s mobile application, self-care  portal or a phone call to a customer care service.  Figure 1: How a SIM Swapping attack is performed  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  8  2.1 SIM SWAP INITIATION  Almost all of the MNOs interviewed have an in-store process for the SIM swap (98% of the  respondents). The majority of them also have a remote process in place (79% of the respondents):  Figure 2: SIM swapping initiation process  Whichever process is pursued, customer authentication constitutes its key component. It can be  done either physically (in-store) or remotely.  In-store subscriber authentication mostly relies on an ID check, while in case of remote  authentication MNOs use several mechanisms7, including:  • personal information (e.g. postal address, email address, date and place of birth);  • account information (e.g. last digits of payment card or international bank account  number, activation date, last payment date and amount);  • device information (e.g. International Mobile Equipment Identity - IMEI, Integrated  Circuit Card Identifier-ICCID);  • usage information (e.g. recently called or texted Mobile Station International Subscriber  Directory Number (MSISDN));  • secret information (e.g. personal identification number (PIN) or password, answers to  security questions);  • a ‘possession’ element (e.g. SMS OTP, email OTP);  • any application following Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (the revised payment services  directive (PSD2)), such as Mobile Connect;  • biometrics; or  • call-back procedures.  Most MNOs indicated using personal information to authenticate subscribers over the phone, with  the next-largest numbers using account information and secret information.  7 Subscriber authentication method could also depend on the reason for the SIM swap. For example, number portability  procedure usually has defined checks. Furthermore, a SIM swap request following a device theft may have different  security controls in place than those used for a SIM swap request when needing a different SIM card formats.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  9  Figure 3: Information used by the mobile network operators to authenticate the customers  2.2 SIM SWAP FINALISATION  The ’physical’ finalisation process can be deployed in several ways:  • in-store finalisation:  o the customer is requested to go to the MNO’s retail store to receive either the  physical SIM card or a quick response (QR) code to activate the eSIM;  o alternatively, the customer may be requested to go to an automatic machine  distributing SIM cards.  • postal service finalisation: either the physical SIM card or the QR code to activate the  eSIM is delivered to the declared customer’s postal address.  In cases of eSIMs, following a subscriber’s SIM swap request via the MNO’s self-care portal, the  swap is usually finalised remotely by sending a QR code by email or by SMS to the customer’s  old device.  The subscriber scans the QR code with the new device, which supports the eSIM technology.  This QR code contains the relevant information to connect to the MNO’s network (e.g.  subscription manager data preparation+ address – SM – DP+ address) and will download the  customer’s profile to the new device. The subscriber validates the activation of the eSIM on the  new device.  The subscriber scans the QR code with the new device, which supports the eSIM technology.  This QR code contains the relevant information to connect to the MNO’s network (e.g. SM-DP+  address – Subscription Manager-Data Preparation+) and will download the customer’s profile to  the new device. The subscriber validates the activation of the eSIM on the new device.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  10  Alternatively, activation of the eSIM could be requested of the provider’s customer service by  phone.

SIM SWAPPING ATTACKS  IN EUROPE  In order to create an overview of the attack methods and possible mitigation measures, the  survey disseminated to the MNOs included questions regarding:  • statistics on SIM-swapping attacks (i.e. volumes and trends);  • processes used by the MNOs to swap customer SIMs;  • the services affected in the event of a SIM swap fraud;  • the perception of the SIM-swapping risk and some mitigations already put in place by  the MNOs;  • communication with the customers and the relevant national authorities.  48 MNOs from 22 countries across Europe responded to the online survey. Almost half of the  MNOs surveyed (48%) did not face any SIM swapping incidents in the 12 months prior to the  survey.  Figure 5: MNOs and countries represented in the online survey  Figure 6: Number of MNOs and volume of SIM swapping incidents  Numbers of  fraudulent SIM  swaps vary  across countries  and MNOs  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  12  Furthermore, as depicted in Figure 7, the number of SIM swapping incidents varies substantially  across European countries. Based on our survey, in some countries (France, Switzerland, the  United Kingdom), over 50 fraudulent SIM swapping incidents were reported per MNO, whereas  in other countries MNOs have not reported SIM swapping frauds at all (Austria, Croatia, Cyprus,  Luxemburg, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia). It should be noted, however, that the number of  fraudulenSIM swapping cases may be correlated to the MNO’s customer base.  Figure 6: Distribution of the fraudulent SIM swapping incident volume per country/mobile  network operator  How to read Figure 6: The vertical axis shows the number of MNOs that took part in the online survey, while the horizontal  lists the countries. In Italy, for instance, four MNOs responded to the survey. Among those four, one did not face any  fraudulent SIM swapping incidents (green bar), while two faced between 11 and 30 incidents (red bar) and one faced more  than 50 (yellow bar).  More than half of the MNOs (56 %) reported that the numbers of SIM-swapping frauds are  stable, that is, not increasing or decreasing:  Figure 7: Distribution of fraudulent SIM swapping incidents trends per mobile network operator  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  13  We can note, however, a positive correlation between the use of eSIMs by MNOs and the  number of reported SIM-swapping incidents. For example, six MNOs with eSIM services  reported more than 50 SIM-swapping incidents during the previous year, whereas MNOs that do  not have eSIMs deployed reported a limited number of fraudulent SIM-swapping cases.  Figure 8: Correlation between eSIM use and the volume of SIM swapping frauds  As noted in the interviews, in France, before it applied strict mitigation solutions, 6–7 % of eSIM  swap attempts were fraudulent. It should be stressed, however, that the growth in fraudulent  eSIM swaps is not due to a lack of security of the eSIM technology, but one reason behind  these figures could be that the eSIM swap processes employed by some MNOs are still  relatively new.  As shown in Figure 10, the majority of MNOs perceive the level of SIM-swapping fraud risk as low.  Figure 9: SIM swapping risk assessment  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  14  This could be either because most MNOs have not faced any fraudulent SIM-swapping  incidents lately or because they perceive their SIM-swapping processes as strong enough to  avoid such incidents.  As reported in our survey, almost all MNOs deployed risk mitigation measures to prevent SIM-  swapping frauds (Figure 10).  Figure 10: Deployment of SIM swap fraud risk mitigation measures  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  15  3.1 PERFORMING THE ATTACK  3.1.1 Step 1 – accessing the subscriber’s personal data  In order to perform a fraudulent SIM swap, the fraudster needs to have access to some of the  subscriber’s personal data. This is because specific personal details are typically requested by  the MNO for authentication purposes, as part of the SIM swapping procedure.  Table 1 provides a brief description of potential methods used by attackers in order to obtain  personal data, which can be used to facilitate fraudulent SIM swapping.  The estimated likelihoods provided in the table are subjective and based on the experience of  the MNOs interviewed.  Table 1: Accessing the subscribers’ personal data  Obtaining access to  subscribers’ personal data  Description  Estimated  likelihood  Social Engineering on  Customers (Phishing)  Customers might be contacted by fraudsters using SMS, email, social  media messaging or phone calls, impersonating an MNO’s or other type of  service provider’s employee in order to retrieve their personal information  (e.g. name, date and place of birth, postal address and bank account  identifier), including subscriber’s credentials to the MNO’s online portal  HIGH  Social Engineering on Mnos’  Employees (Phishing)  MNOs’ employees might be contacted by fraudsters using SMS, email,  social media messaging or phone calls. The goal is to retrieve personal  information regarding a customer (e.g. name, date and place of birth,  postal address and bank account identifier)  MEDIUM  Bribing or Threatening  Mnos’ Employees  MNOs’ employees might be bribed or threatened to give away personal  information of the targeted customer. Furthermore, in February 2021, an  employee of a telecommunications operator was charged with accepting a  bribe from fraudsters who stole cryptocurrencies (*)  LOW  Cyberattacks on  Infrastructure  Fraudsters might lead cyberattacks on MNOs’ infrastructure (e.g. IT  Systems, network) in order to retrieve personal data or hack subscribers’  online accounts  LOW  Placing Fraudsters in Stores  or Customer Care Centres  MNOs’ employees become accomplices in fraudsters’ activities. They can  have easy access to customers’ personal information  LOW  (*) https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/former-phone-company-employee-charged-rolein-sim-swap-scam-targeted-least-19-customers  3.1.2 Step 2 – Carrying out a fraudulent SIM swap  Depending on the type of SIM swap (regular SIM swap or eSIM swap), having obtained the  necessary personal data and having identified the MNO’s SIM swapping process(as described  in section 2), the attacker:  • presents falsified identification documents in-store,  • successfully responds to the challenges (authentication questions) presented by the  representative over the phone, or  • gains access to the subscriber’s account on the MNO’s portal, initiates an eSIM swap  and then scans the QR code, which is usually displayed on that portal.  https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/former-phone-company-employee-charged-rolein-sim-swap-scam-targeted-least-19-customers  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  16  3.2 SERVICES AFFECTED  Intercepting SMSs, including OTPs for financial transactions, is one of the basic goals of the  attackers. While attackers may also intercept the OTP SMS using more elaborate attack  methods (such as exploiting SS7 protocol vulnerabilities), SIM swapping appears to be the  easiest way of intercepting SMS to perform banking frauds, as it does not require complex or  expensive technical tools.  In the banking sector, the OTP SMS has been used for more than a decade to authenticate  customers when they are shopping online or transferring funds. Most banks make use of two-  factor authentication because it adds a cost-efficient and consumer-friendly layer of security to  the authentication process behind online banking, while complying with the strong customer  authentication rules under PSD28.  According to the survey respondents, online banking is the service most affected by fraudulent  SIM swapping. As early as April 2016, British media reported a bank account being emptied as  a result of a SIM-swapping attack9. Less frequently, SIM swaps have also been used for taking  over the victims’ accounts and for placing international and premium rate service calls.  Figure 11: Customer services affected by fraudulent SIM swapping  Based on our desktop research, the compromise of two-factor authentication and subsequent  access to victims’ accounts can also enable a number of follow-up crimes:  • Interception of calls and messages – account takeover: the attackers receive the calls  and messages intended for their victim, and can also place calls and messages in their  stead, since the actual subscriber loses access to the mobile network and services.  • Making international or premium number calls: the fraudster can place calls to  international or premium destinations.  • Hacking social media accounts: as some social media accounts also require a phone  number to authenticate the customer, the fraudster can log into them in the victim’s  stead. For example, in August 2018, a number of Instagram accounts were hijacked10.  Furthermore, in 2019, even the chief executive of Twitter had his Twitter account  hijacked by hackers11.  • Targeting the cryptocurrency community: for example, in May 2020, a cryptocurrency  platform disclosed a case in which fraudsters attempted to steal funds from the  platform’s users 12.  8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_19_5555  9  https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/16/sim-swap-fraud-mobile-banking-fraudsters  10 https://mashable.com/2018/08/13/instagram-hack-locked-out-of-account/?europe=true and https://www.wired.com/story/sim-  swap-attack-defend-phone/  11 https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/13/sim-swap-is-on-the-rise-how-can-you-stop-it-happening-to-you  12 https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockfi-discloses-failed-hack-attempt-after-sim-swapping-incident/  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_19_5555 https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/16/sim-swap-fraud-mobile-banking-fraudsters https://mashable.com/2018/08/13/instagram-hack-locked-out-of-account/?europe=true https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/ https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/ https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/13/sim-swap-is-on-the-rise-how-can-you-stop-it-happening-to-you https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockfi-discloses-failed-hack-attempt-after-sim-swapping-incident/  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  17  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  4.1 FOR MOBILE NETWORK OPERATORS  Stricter controls for customer authentication and SIM swaps  Measures that can be applied to mitigate the attack include internal checks on aspects such as  limiting staff access to customer information and the ability to perform SIM swaps; back-end  system validations before executing changes; enforcement of time-based restrictions on  account changes; checks, based on location of subscriber; notification of changes to customers  (call-back verification); and the use of passwords and PINs by customers to access their  accounts.  Performing background checks on the subscriber using a back-office team could also prove to  be an effective countermeasure. Such background checks could include checking the most  recently provided postal address, cross-checking the ID card presented in store with previous  copies maintained under the subscriber’s profile and examining the customer’s recent contacts  with customer representatives.  Regular and targeted training of employees  While technical controls can minimize the risk of SIM swapping, the human factor is the one that  needs to be constantly managed.  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape 2020 13, 84 % of cyberattacks rely on social  engineering. As highlighted in this report, SIM swapping relies greatly on social engineering of  MNOs’ employees (see Table 1).  MNOs should provide regular cybersecurity awareness training for both their own and third-  party employees to ensure they can recognise and appropriately deal with the SIM-swapping  threat. The security awareness programme should be tailored to the audience and focused on  the specific topic. For example, employees should know and understand how spear phishing  and other social engineering attacks work, what they should take into account when authorising  a SIM swap and the actions they should take to minimise the risk of fraud.  There should be well-documented and checked processes that are regularly communicated and  followed with vigilance. Moreover, records of the training courses and those who attended  should be maintained.  API between Mobile Network Operators and banks  Several initiatives have been launched across Europe for wider cooperation between the MNOs  and banks. Specifically, banks can use an application programming interface (API) provided by  the MNOs to check whether a SIM swap has been recently performed.  Such an API has been developed in several EU countries as a cross-MNO initiative. In Italy, for  instance, the national regulatory authority, AGCOM (14), has been coordinating a trial in which  participated representatives of the Bank of Italy, the Italian Data Protection Authority, the  Ministry of Economic Development, the police (including financial police), banks, operators that  offer messaging services to the banks and MNOs. The trial involves MNOs informing banks of  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents  14 https://www.agcom.it/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents https://www.agcom.it/  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  18  the latest SIM swap, either through the subscriber’s IMSI or hashed IMSI or by sending  information about the time of the latest SIM swap.  In summary, the API works as follows.  • Step 1: the customer initiates a fund transfer on their mobile banking application or on  a computer.  • Step 2: the bank interrogates the customer’s MNO’s database through an API.  • Step 3: the customer’s MNO checks whether a SIM swap has recently occurred on the  customer’s MSISDN. Alternatively, the bank sets the timing threshold (e.g. 24 hours)  and the MNO responds if a SIM swap occurred in less than the timing threshold.  • Step 4: if no recent SIM swap has been detected on the customer’s MSISDN, the  customer’s MNO communicates this piece of information to the bank as a response in  the API.  If a recent SIM swap has been detected on the customer’s MSISDN, the information is  sent from the MNO to the bank and the bank performs additional checks in order to  authorize the transaction.  • Step 5: the bank can proceed with the fund transfer following the bank’s process (e.g.  sending an OTP SMS to the customer).  Figure 12: API check process for a legitimate banking transaction  Instead of using an API, two other alternatives have also been considered:  • The MNO sends to the bank the timestamp of the most recent SIM Swap through the  SMPP protocol, after having received a relevant request from the bank.  • The MNO provides the customer’s IMSI (or hashed IMSI), using the standard protocol –  SS7/MAP (through the answer to Send request Info For SM)  In Annex A, are presented in more detail the alternatives used for communication of the sim swap  information from the MNOs to the banks.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  19  Avoid remote SIM swapping processes  According to the MNOs interviewed, regardless of the initial request (in store or remote), SIM-  swapping frauds are usually avoided when a physical finalisation process is set up. Therefore, if  there is no solution deployed for strong remote customer authentication, the best solution is to  have a mandatory in-store SIM swap procedure, or to perform the finalisation of the process  using regular post (e.g. recorded delivery). We note that these solutions also require designing  specific, well-thought-out processes for authenticating the customer and verifying their postal  address.  For example, interview respondents highlighted that attacks were successfully prevented with  the use of alerting mechanisms in the shops’ network in case of suspicious SIM swap attempts.  For example, in the event of a failed attempt at a fraudulent SIM swap in a retail store, the  targeted MSISDN is flagged and the neighbouring retail stores are alerted.  In countries where ID cards are still in paper format without any embedded security measures,  machine-based verification of the identity documents presented is more effective in recognising  counterfeit versions.  Naturally, using the postal service to deliver the new SIM card to the customer entails longer  waiting periods for the conclusion of the SIM swap procedure.  Reach out to the public  Conducting public awareness campaigns, informing subscribers about the threats, advising  them on when to spot a potential incident and proposing simple mitigation solutions could  contribute greatly to reducing the number of attacks and minimising their impact.  Awareness campaigns could be generic (a post on the MNO’s website or social media account,  a TV/radio spot) or more targeted communication could be employed (e.g. sending SMS and  emails to all subscribers).  The majority of the survey respondents (i.e. 72 %)15 noted that they had not yet communicated  on this topic to their customers.  Figure 13: Subscriber communications  15 Please note that this percentage is calculated excluding 1 MNO that did not provide a response  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  20  Restrict the provision of ‘empty’ SIM cards  During our research, we came across fraud cases with the attacker using an inactive SIM card  and managing to perform a fraudulent SIM swap.  To address this threat, MNOs could consider not authorising SIM swaps without knowing the  origin of the new SIM card. SIM cards should be provided only through the MNOs’ logistics  centres, while usage of existing stocks at the subscriber’s disposal should be discouraged.  Additional internal controls may be implemented within the mobile network operators:  • keeping an inventory of the blank SIM cards;  • strong controls on the issuance and activation of blank SIM cards; and  • activation of the SIM cards only when the order and/or delivery is confirmed by the  customer.  Artificial intelligence and behavioural analysis  Artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to perform automatic behavioural analysis of subscribers’  activities. The AI engine could store several habits of each customer (e.g. connection history, IP  addresses’ locations) in order to have a basis for comparison at the time of a requested SIM  swap.  If abnormal behaviour is detected (e.g. sudden change of the IP address location, several  concurrent connections from different IP addresses), the MNO is alerted in real time in order to  block the SIM-swapping process.  However, the use of AI for detecting fraudulent SIM swaps should be very carefully applied,  considering the regulatory context in the light of confidentially of communications data and  personal data protection. Specific guidance from the competent authorities, review mechanisms  and strong controls are necessary to avoid unnecessary retention and analysis of  communication and personal data.  4.2 FOR THE BANKS  API between MNOs and banks  Banks have the possibility to check whether a SIM swap has been recently performed with the  use of an API provided by the MNOs. We discuss the use of such APIs in section 4.1 of this  report.  Migrate from SMS two-factor authentication to app-based two-factor authentication  The latest banking frauds related to SIM swapping suggest that SMS two-factor authentication  (2FA) may not provide a sufficient level of security.  App-based 2FA relies on biometric, PIN or password-based authentication of the customer, and  thus does not pose a risk of the SMS OTP being intercepted. We note that such app-based 2FA  is already used by many banks to authorise transactions, replacing the SMS 2FA process.  Reach out to the public  Banks, along with the MNOs, can carry out awareness campaigns towards their customers, in  order to warn them about SIM-swapping attacks. For example, Alpha bank Greece has  developed a web page including information on the SIM Swapping fraud. In this page, the bank  explains how the fraud works, and includes advice for the clients to self-protect. On its website,  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  21  the bank also lists measures it takes to mitigate the risk of sim swapping frauds16. Similarly,  Bank Millennium in Poland warns its customers against SIM swapping attacks17.  We also provide more general examples of consumer outreach activities performed by banks in  our upcoming report entitled ‘Cybersecurity Outreach About Cybersecurity Threats by Telecom  Providers’. For example, on their websites, banks already advise of some of the latest types of  fraud (such as delivery and cryptocurrency scams), the steps customers can take when they  feel they may become victim of one, and the channels they can use to contact the bank.  Analogous information could be provided to decrease the risk of successful SIM swapping  attacks.  4.3 FOR THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES  Guidelines for secure authentication  Customer authentication is at the heart of the SIM swapping process, no matter the channel  used (e.g. store, phone, chat bot, mobile application).  Competent authorities could contribute to fulfilling this objective by issuing appropriate  guidelines for the MNOs. Specifically, they could recommend putting in place a set of  challenges for subscribers initiating a SIM swapping process. This list of mandatory challenges  could be different from one MNO to another, but the competent authority could nevertheless  consider recommending a basic common set of challenges used in the SIM swapping process.  In this context, the Italian competent authority, AGCOM, carried out a public consultation on  increasing security on the part of the customer as well in all cases of SIM swaps, including  mobile number portability. This could also be useful in mitigating the attack in cases other than  banking fraud.  The new regulation following the consultation is included in Deliberation No 86/21/CIR18.  Mechanisms have been introduced to prevent and combat fraud attempts, including by  modifying the law on mobile number portability. The user will be able to confirm to the MNO that  it should continue the SIM card replacement (or portability) process, or instruct it to stop.  SIM swapping process assessment  The competent national authorities may perform ad-hoc audits to examine the existing SIM  swapping processes employed by the MNOs and assess whether they are secure and actually  followed by the MNOs’ employees.  Providing recommendations to enhance specific processes could contribute to the mitigation of  the threat.  Promoting communication and active collaboration among stakeholders  Establishing frequent communication between public authorities, MNOs and banks, sharing  general information about incidents and discussing fraud prevention measures could all  significantly contribute to building up risk mitigation know-how.  Furthermore, launching intuitive public awareness campaigns could contribute greatly to  decreasing the threat of attacks occurring and minimising their impact.  16 https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping  17 https://www.bankmillennium.pl/bankowosc-elektroniczna/bezpieczenstwo.  18https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_ p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column- 1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_IN STANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document  https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping https://www.bankmillennium.pl/bankowosc-elektroniczna/bezpieczenstwo https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  22  Specifically, regarding general communication with the relevant national authorities, the survey  respondents said they communicated mostly with the local law enforcement agencies (40 %)  followed by the national cybersecurity agency (25 %). It should be noted however, that the  response provided by 5 MNOs was “I don’t know” and wasn’t considered in the respective  percentages and graph.  Figure 14:  Communication with the national competent authorities  However, more than half of the MNOs who responded to the online survey (53%)19 noted that  they did not share any information on specific SIM swapping incidents with their competent  national authority.

In this case, subscribers are strongly recommended to contact their MNO without any delay.  Also, subscribers are recommended to check their banking transactions frequently for any  suspicious activities and, if there are any, contact the bank and their MNO immediately.  Finally, subscribers should act fast in case of any unrecognized activity in their social media  or email accounts. They should contact their MNO and change their account passwords.  Generic self-protection advice  SIM-swapping fraud usually begins with phishing and/or social engineering against subscribers.  To avoid phishing attacks subscribers should take the following precautions.  • Be cautious with the information shared on social media networks.  • Never open any suspicious internet hyperlinks or attachments received through email  or messages.  • Avoid providing any personal information by email or by phone when called by  someone claiming to be the MNO’s representative. A real customer representative will  never request personal details such as credit card details or 2FA SMS content. In  some cases, MNOs can send an OTP SMS for finalising a SIM swap. This OTP  password must never be communicated to anyone, even to persons who call the  customers and claim to be an MNO’s employee.  • Update account passwords on a regular basis.

As a result, the attacker takes  over the account and can receive all the SMS and voice calls intended for the legitimate  subscriber. Fraudsters can perform online banking frauds but also circumvent the two-factor  authentication (2FA) used to secure social media and other online accounts.  In this study, we give an overview of how this attack works, list measures that providers  can take to mitigate the attack and make recommendations for policy makers and  authorities in the telecom sector and other sectors.  Since 2017 there have been several media reports about SIM swapping attacks, targeting  people within the cryptocurrency community1, 2  but also bank accounts 3  and social media and  email accounts4.  To avoid being vulnerable, the subscribers should restrict their personal information exposed on  social media, update passwords regularly, never open messages and attachments from  unknown sources, frequently check their financial statements and avoid associating their phone  number with sensitive online accounts. If possible, other authentication mechanisms available  should be chosen. For more information check ENISA leaflet – How to avoid Mobile SIM  Swapping  Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), banks and authorities have already been collaborating to  mitigate fraudulent SIM swapping. Banks can use an Application Programming Interface (API)  provided by the MNOs to check whether a SIM swap has been recently performed.  • MNOs should reinforce fraudulent SIM swapping detection and blocking mechanisms,  by enhancing the internal processes to provide the customer with a preferably  seamless experience.  • Banking institutions should consistently apply the EU regulations such as the Directive  (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2), and take advantage of the available technical solutions  provided by the telecommunications operators.  • Finally, national authorities should encourage and enhance coordination between the  MNOs and the banking sector. Cooperation with Europol and national Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and law enforcement agencies should  also be promoted. Basic guidelines could be issued to efficiently direct operators,  banks and the public.  1 https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/  2 BlockFi discloses failed hack attempt after SIM swapping incident | ZDNet  3 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/  4 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card https://www.zdnet.com/article/wave-of-sim-swapping-attacks-hit-us-cryptocurrency-users/ https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockfi-discloses-failed-hack-attempt-after-sim-swapping-incident/#:~:text=For%20example,%20in%20January%202020,%20Canadian%20authorities%20charged,gangs,%20one%20in%20Spain%20and%20one%20in%20Romania. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/ https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/technology/sim-swap-jack-dorsey-hack.html  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Promoting the interests of the citizens and consumers of the European Union constitutes one of  the general objectives set out in Article 3, paragraph 2 of the new EU telecom security  legislation: the European Electronic Communications Code5 (the ‘EECC’):  In the context of this Directive, the national regulatory and other competent authorities as well  as BEREC, the Commission and the Member States shall (…)  (d) promote the interests of the citizens of the Union (…) by maintaining the security of networks  and services, by ensuring a high and common level of protection for end-users through the  necessary sector-specific rules.’  The EECC contains specific security requirements for electronic communication providers,  including aspects such as the confidentiality of communications. Most of the security  requirements are set out in articles 40 and 41 of the EECC, though its recitals also provide  guidance on these requirements. For example, recital 94 requires implementation of the state-  of-the-art measures to cover aspects such as handling security incidents, compliance  assessments and monitoring.  Furthermore, under the EECC, more communication services are in scope, particularly the so-  called Over-The-Top (OTT) communications services, such as Gmail, WhatsApp, and Skype.  The EECC aims to protect consumers, irrespective of the chosen communication tool, focusing  on the functionality (electronic communication), rather than on the underlying technology or  implementation choices6.  Security of electronic communications networks and services does not only translate to  minimising the risk of service deterioration or outage, but also to protecting individual  customers, for example against fraud, such as SIM swapping attacks.  1.2 SIM SWAPPING ATTACKS  Similarly, to many other attacks against the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of electronic  communications of individual subscribers, in SIM swapping attacks, the attacker’s objective is to  gain control of the targeted subscriber's mobile account in order to perform a range of actions  associated with his mobile number. This type of attack takes advantage of the ability of the  MNO to transfer a mobile telephone number to a different SIM, a procedure referred to as  ‘number porting’. The attacker’s objective is therefore to take over a mobile subscriber’s account  by changing the affiliation of that account from the original SIM card to a SIM card under the  attacker’s control.  The attacker typically begins a SIM swapping attack by gathering personal details about the  targeted subscriber, for example through social engineering, phishing, malware, exploiting  information from data breaches or doing research on social media. Once the attacker has  obtained enough details to impersonate the targeted subscriber, he may be able to convince the  MNO to port the subscriber's mobile number to a new SIM card under the attacker’s control.  5 Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic  Communications Code, OJ L 321, 17.12.2018, p. 36  6 See, for example, rec. 95.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  6  Should this initial part of the attack be successful, the genuine subscriber’s SIM card will lose  connection to the network. This will enable the attacker to receive all the SMS and voice traffic  intended for the targeted subscriber, such as one-time passwords (OTPs) sent by text or  telephone calls, for example to log into online banking.  The subscriber may discover he has become victim of a fraudulent SIM swap once he is unable  to place or receive calls and SMS, or access his email or social media accounts.  Law enforcement agencies, MNOs, financial institutions and academia have been working on  addressing the problem of fraudulent SIM swapping, including launching awareness campaigns.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  This paper strives to provide guidance to national authorities supervising the implementation of Article 40 of the  EECC. It may also be useful for experts working in the EU telecom sector.  1.4 PREPARATION OF THIS REPORT  The study presented in the report is using a three-tiered methodology consisting of:  • desktop research taking stock of relevant literature on the topic.  • online surveys disseminated to EU MNOs and national competent authorities, which  was answered by 48 MNOs from 22 different countries and by 14 national competent  authorities.  • 11 targeted interviews: 8 interviews with MNOs, 2 with Europol and GSMA experts and  1 with a national security authority representative.  The information derived from the first two steps of the process was used in order to prepare and  further customize the subsequent step. The information collected was analysed, and  consolidated in order to provide tangible results in line with the purpose of this study. The report  was validated with the survey participants and the members of the European Competent  Authorities for Secure Electronic Communications Group (ECASEC EG).  Figure: Methodology of the study  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  7  2. SIM SWAPPING – A  LEGITIMATE CUSTOMER  REQUEST  In order to provide an overview of the SIM swapping process, we begin by briefly describing its  key component: the SIM or the embedded subscriber identity module (eSIM).  The SIM is an application hosted on a piece of hardware called the universal integrated circuit  card (UICC), which contains a chip. The SIM contains an identity that unambiguously identifies  a subscriber within an MNO’s network. The term ‘SIM card’ is commonly used when actually  referring to the UICC. Therefore, for simplicity, we will use the term ‘SIM card’ instead of ‘UICC’  throughout this report.  The eSIM is the embedded form of the SIM, meaning the eSIM does not exist physically on a  device but is virtual. The eSIM is hosted on an ‘embedded Universal Integrated Circuit Card’  (eUICC).  SIM swapping is a legitimate procedure performed by a subscriber to change his SIM cards, for  example when:  • the SIM card has been lost, damaged or stolen; or  • the subscriber changes to a new device with another SIM card format.  In order to perform the SIM swap, MNOs commonly follow two processes:  • subscribers go to an MNO’s retail store or to an automatic machine that distributes SIM  cards; or  • subscribers use a remote process, such as an MNO’s mobile application, self-care  portal or a phone call to a customer care service.  Figure 1: How a SIM Swapping attack is performed  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  8  2.1 SIM SWAP INITIATION  Almost all of the MNOs interviewed have an in-store process for the SIM swap (98% of the  respondents). The majority of them also have a remote process in place (79% of the respondents):  Figure 2: SIM swapping initiation process  Whichever process is pursued, customer authentication constitutes its key component. It can be  done either physically (in-store) or remotely.  In-store subscriber authentication mostly relies on an ID check, while in case of remote  authentication MNOs use several mechanisms7, including:  • personal information (e.g. postal address, email address, date and place of birth);  • account information (e.g. last digits of payment card or international bank account  number, activation date, last payment date and amount);  • device information (e.g. International Mobile Equipment Identity - IMEI, Integrated  Circuit Card Identifier-ICCID);  • usage information (e.g. recently called or texted Mobile Station International Subscriber  Directory Number (MSISDN));  • secret information (e.g. personal identification number (PIN) or password, answers to  security questions);  • a ‘possession’ element (e.g. SMS OTP, email OTP);  • any application following Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (the revised payment services  directive (PSD2)), such as Mobile Connect;  • biometrics; or  • call-back procedures.  Most MNOs indicated using personal information to authenticate subscribers over the phone, with  the next-largest numbers using account information and secret information.  7 Subscriber authentication method could also depend on the reason for the SIM swap. For example, number portability  procedure usually has defined checks. Furthermore, a SIM swap request following a device theft may have different  security controls in place than those used for a SIM swap request when needing a different SIM card formats.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  9  Figure 3: Information used by the mobile network operators to authenticate the customers  2.2 SIM SWAP FINALISATION  The ’physical’ finalisation process can be deployed in several ways:  • in-store finalisation:  o the customer is requested to go to the MNO’s retail store to receive either the  physical SIM card or a quick response (QR) code to activate the eSIM;  o alternatively, the customer may be requested to go to an automatic machine  distributing SIM cards.  • postal service finalisation: either the physical SIM card or the QR code to activate the  eSIM is delivered to the declared customer’s postal address.  In cases of eSIMs, following a subscriber’s SIM swap request via the MNO’s self-care portal, the  swap is usually finalised remotely by sending a QR code by email or by SMS to the customer’s  old device.  The subscriber scans the QR code with the new device, which supports the eSIM technology.  This QR code contains the relevant information to connect to the MNO’s network (e.g.  subscription manager data preparation+ address – SM – DP+ address) and will download the  customer’s profile to the new device. The subscriber validates the activation of the eSIM on the  new device.  The subscriber scans the QR code with the new device, which supports the eSIM technology.  This QR code contains the relevant information to connect to the MNO’s network (e.g. SM-DP+  address – Subscription Manager-Data Preparation+) and will download the customer’s profile to  the new device. The subscriber validates the activation of the eSIM on the new device.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  10  Alternatively, activation of the eSIM could be requested of the provider’s customer service by  phone.

SIM SWAPPING ATTACKS  IN EUROPE  In order to create an overview of the attack methods and possible mitigation measures, the  survey disseminated to the MNOs included questions regarding:  • statistics on SIM-swapping attacks (i.e. volumes and trends);  • processes used by the MNOs to swap customer SIMs;  • the services affected in the event of a SIM swap fraud;  • the perception of the SIM-swapping risk and some mitigations already put in place by  the MNOs;  • communication with the customers and the relevant national authorities.  48 MNOs from 22 countries across Europe responded to the online survey. Almost half of the  MNOs surveyed (48%) did not face any SIM swapping incidents in the 12 months prior to the  survey.  Figure 5: MNOs and countries represented in the online survey  Figure 6: Number of MNOs and volume of SIM swapping incidents  Numbers of  fraudulent SIM  swaps vary  across countries  and MNOs  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  12  Furthermore, as depicted in Figure 7, the number of SIM swapping incidents varies substantially  across European countries. Based on our survey, in some countries (France, Switzerland, the  United Kingdom), over 50 fraudulent SIM swapping incidents were reported per MNO, whereas  in other countries MNOs have not reported SIM swapping frauds at all (Austria, Croatia, Cyprus,  Luxemburg, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia). It should be noted, however, that the number of  fraudulenSIM swapping cases may be correlated to the MNO’s customer base.  Figure 6: Distribution of the fraudulent SIM swapping incident volume per country/mobile  network operator  How to read Figure 6: The vertical axis shows the number of MNOs that took part in the online survey, while the horizontal  lists the countries. In Italy, for instance, four MNOs responded to the survey. Among those four, one did not face any  fraudulent SIM swapping incidents (green bar), while two faced between 11 and 30 incidents (red bar) and one faced more  than 50 (yellow bar).  More than half of the MNOs (56 %) reported that the numbers of SIM-swapping frauds are  stable, that is, not increasing or decreasing:  Figure 7: Distribution of fraudulent SIM swapping incidents trends per mobile network operator  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  13  We can note, however, a positive correlation between the use of eSIMs by MNOs and the  number of reported SIM-swapping incidents. For example, six MNOs with eSIM services  reported more than 50 SIM-swapping incidents during the previous year, whereas MNOs that do  not have eSIMs deployed reported a limited number of fraudulent SIM-swapping cases.  Figure 8: Correlation between eSIM use and the volume of SIM swapping frauds  As noted in the interviews, in France, before it applied strict mitigation solutions, 6–7 % of eSIM  swap attempts were fraudulent. It should be stressed, however, that the growth in fraudulent  eSIM swaps is not due to a lack of security of the eSIM technology, but one reason behind  these figures could be that the eSIM swap processes employed by some MNOs are still  relatively new.  As shown in Figure 10, the majority of MNOs perceive the level of SIM-swapping fraud risk as low.  Figure 9: SIM swapping risk assessment  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  14  This could be either because most MNOs have not faced any fraudulent SIM-swapping  incidents lately or because they perceive their SIM-swapping processes as strong enough to  avoid such incidents.  As reported in our survey, almost all MNOs deployed risk mitigation measures to prevent SIM-  swapping frauds (Figure 10).  Figure 10: Deployment of SIM swap fraud risk mitigation measures  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  15  3.1 PERFORMING THE ATTACK  3.1.1 Step 1 – accessing the subscriber’s personal data  In order to perform a fraudulent SIM swap, the fraudster needs to have access to some of the  subscriber’s personal data. This is because specific personal details are typically requested by  the MNO for authentication purposes, as part of the SIM swapping procedure.  Table 1 provides a brief description of potential methods used by attackers in order to obtain  personal data, which can be used to facilitate fraudulent SIM swapping.  The estimated likelihoods provided in the table are subjective and based on the experience of  the MNOs interviewed.  Table 1: Accessing the subscribers’ personal data  Obtaining access to  subscribers’ personal data  Description  Estimated  likelihood  Social Engineering on  Customers (Phishing)  Customers might be contacted by fraudsters using SMS, email, social  media messaging or phone calls, impersonating an MNO’s or other type of  service provider’s employee in order to retrieve their personal information  (e.g. name, date and place of birth, postal address and bank account  identifier), including subscriber’s credentials to the MNO’s online portal  HIGH  Social Engineering on Mnos’  Employees (Phishing)  MNOs’ employees might be contacted by fraudsters using SMS, email,  social media messaging or phone calls. The goal is to retrieve personal  information regarding a customer (e.g. name, date and place of birth,  postal address and bank account identifier)  MEDIUM  Bribing or Threatening  Mnos’ Employees  MNOs’ employees might be bribed or threatened to give away personal  information of the targeted customer. Furthermore, in February 2021, an  employee of a telecommunications operator was charged with accepting a  bribe from fraudsters who stole cryptocurrencies (*)  LOW  Cyberattacks on  Infrastructure  Fraudsters might lead cyberattacks on MNOs’ infrastructure (e.g. IT  Systems, network) in order to retrieve personal data or hack subscribers’  online accounts  LOW  Placing Fraudsters in Stores  or Customer Care Centres  MNOs’ employees become accomplices in fraudsters’ activities.

While attackers may also intercept the OTP SMS using more elaborate attack  methods (such as exploiting SS7 protocol vulnerabilities), SIM swapping appears to be the  easiest way of intercepting SMS to perform banking frauds, as it does not require complex or  expensive technical tools.  In the banking sector, the OTP SMS has been used for more than a decade to authenticate  customers when they are shopping online or transferring funds. Most banks make use of two-  factor authentication because it adds a cost-efficient and consumer-friendly layer of security to  the authentication process behind online banking, while complying with the strong customer  authentication rules under PSD28.  According to the survey respondents, online banking is the service most affected by fraudulent  SIM swapping. As early as April 2016, British media reported a bank account being emptied as  a result of a SIM-swapping attack9. Less frequently, SIM swaps have also been used for taking  over the victims’ accounts and for placing international and premium rate service calls.  Figure 11: Customer services affected by fraudulent SIM swapping  Based on our desktop research, the compromise of two-factor authentication and subsequent  access to victims’ accounts can also enable a number of follow-up crimes:  • Interception of calls and messages – account takeover: the attackers receive the calls  and messages intended for their victim, and can also place calls and messages in their  stead, since the actual subscriber loses access to the mobile network and services.  • Making international or premium number calls: the fraudster can place calls to  international or premium destinations.  • Hacking social media accounts: as some social media accounts also require a phone  number to authenticate the customer, the fraudster can log into them in the victim’s  stead. For example, in August 2018, a number of Instagram accounts were hijacked10.  Furthermore, in 2019, even the chief executive of Twitter had his Twitter account  hijacked by hackers11.  • Targeting the cryptocurrency community: for example, in May 2020, a cryptocurrency  platform disclosed a case in which fraudsters attempted to steal funds from the  platform’s users 12.  8 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_19_5555  9  https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/16/sim-swap-fraud-mobile-banking-fraudsters  10 https://mashable.com/2018/08/13/instagram-hack-locked-out-of-account/?europe=true and https://www.wired.com/story/sim-  swap-attack-defend-phone/  11 https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/13/sim-swap-is-on-the-rise-how-can-you-stop-it-happening-to-you  12 https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockfi-discloses-failed-hack-attempt-after-sim-swapping-incident/  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_19_5555 https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/16/sim-swap-fraud-mobile-banking-fraudsters https://mashable.com/2018/08/13/instagram-hack-locked-out-of-account/?europe=true https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/ https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/ https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/13/sim-swap-is-on-the-rise-how-can-you-stop-it-happening-to-you https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockfi-discloses-failed-hack-attempt-after-sim-swapping-incident/  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  17  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  4.1 FOR MOBILE NETWORK OPERATORS  Stricter controls for customer authentication and SIM swaps  Measures that can be applied to mitigate the attack include internal checks on aspects such as  limiting staff access to customer information and the ability to perform SIM swaps; back-end  system validations before executing changes; enforcement of time-based restrictions on  account changes; checks, based on location of subscriber; notification of changes to customers  (call-back verification); and the use of passwords and PINs by customers to access their  accounts.  Performing background checks on the subscriber using a back-office team could also prove to  be an effective countermeasure. Such background checks could include checking the most  recently provided postal address, cross-checking the ID card presented in store with previous  copies maintained under the subscriber’s profile and examining the customer’s recent contacts  with customer representatives.  Regular and targeted training of employees  While technical controls can minimize the risk of SIM swapping, the human factor is the one that  needs to be constantly managed.  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape 2020 13, 84 % of cyberattacks rely on social  engineering. As highlighted in this report, SIM swapping relies greatly on social engineering of  MNOs’ employees (see Table 1).  MNOs should provide regular cybersecurity awareness training for both their own and third-  party employees to ensure they can recognise and appropriately deal with the SIM-swapping  threat. The security awareness programme should be tailored to the audience and focused on  the specific topic. For example, employees should know and understand how spear phishing  and other social engineering attacks work, what they should take into account when authorising  a SIM swap and the actions they should take to minimise the risk of fraud.  There should be well-documented and checked processes that are regularly communicated and  followed with vigilance. Moreover, records of the training courses and those who attended  should be maintained.  API between Mobile Network Operators and banks  Several initiatives have been launched across Europe for wider cooperation between the MNOs  and banks. Specifically, banks can use an application programming interface (API) provided by  the MNOs to check whether a SIM swap has been recently performed.  Such an API has been developed in several EU countries as a cross-MNO initiative. In Italy, for  instance, the national regulatory authority, AGCOM (14), has been coordinating a trial in which  participated representatives of the Bank of Italy, the Italian Data Protection Authority, the  Ministry of Economic Development, the police (including financial police), banks, operators that  offer messaging services to the banks and MNOs. The trial involves MNOs informing banks of  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents  14 https://www.agcom.it/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2020-main-incidents https://www.agcom.it/  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  18  the latest SIM swap, either through the subscriber’s IMSI or hashed IMSI or by sending  information about the time of the latest SIM swap.  In summary, the API works as follows.  • Step 1: the customer initiates a fund transfer on their mobile banking application or on  a computer.  • Step 2: the bank interrogates the customer’s MNO’s database through an API.  • Step 3: the customer’s MNO checks whether a SIM swap has recently occurred on the  customer’s MSISDN. Alternatively, the bank sets the timing threshold (e.g. 24 hours)  and the MNO responds if a SIM swap occurred in less than the timing threshold.  • Step 4: if no recent SIM swap has been detected on the customer’s MSISDN, the  customer’s MNO communicates this piece of information to the bank as a response in  the API.  If a recent SIM swap has been detected on the customer’s MSISDN, the information is  sent from the MNO to the bank and the bank performs additional checks in order to  authorize the transaction.  • Step 5: the bank can proceed with the fund transfer following the bank’s process (e.g.  sending an OTP SMS to the customer).  Figure 12: API check process for a legitimate banking transaction  Instead of using an API, two other alternatives have also been considered:  • The MNO sends to the bank the timestamp of the most recent SIM Swap through the  SMPP protocol, after having received a relevant request from the bank.  • The MNO provides the customer’s IMSI (or hashed IMSI), using the standard protocol –  SS7/MAP (through the answer to Send request Info For SM)  In Annex A, are presented in more detail the alternatives used for communication of the sim swap  information from the MNOs to the banks.  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  19  Avoid remote SIM swapping processes  According to the MNOs interviewed, regardless of the initial request (in store or remote), SIM-  swapping frauds are usually avoided when a physical finalisation process is set up. Therefore, if  there is no solution deployed for strong remote customer authentication, the best solution is to  have a mandatory in-store SIM swap procedure, or to perform the finalisation of the process  using regular post (e.g. recorded delivery). We note that these solutions also require designing  specific, well-thought-out processes for authenticating the customer and verifying their postal  address.  For example, interview respondents highlighted that attacks were successfully prevented with  the use of alerting mechanisms in the shops’ network in case of suspicious SIM swap attempts.  For example, in the event of a failed attempt at a fraudulent SIM swap in a retail store, the  targeted MSISDN is flagged and the neighbouring retail stores are alerted.  In countries where ID cards are still in paper format without any embedded security measures,  machine-based verification of the identity documents presented is more effective in recognising  counterfeit versions.  Naturally, using the postal service to deliver the new SIM card to the customer entails longer  waiting periods for the conclusion of the SIM swap procedure.  Reach out to the public  Conducting public awareness campaigns, informing subscribers about the threats, advising  them on when to spot a potential incident and proposing simple mitigation solutions could  contribute greatly to reducing the number of attacks and minimising their impact.  Awareness campaigns could be generic (a post on the MNO’s website or social media account,  a TV/radio spot) or more targeted communication could be employed (e.g. sending SMS and  emails to all subscribers).  The majority of the survey respondents (i.e. 72 %)15 noted that they had not yet communicated  on this topic to their customers.  Figure 13: Subscriber communications  15 Please note that this percentage is calculated excluding 1 MNO that did not provide a response  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  20  Restrict the provision of ‘empty’ SIM cards  During our research, we came across fraud cases with the attacker using an inactive SIM card  and managing to perform a fraudulent SIM swap.  To address this threat, MNOs could consider not authorising SIM swaps without knowing the  origin of the new SIM card. SIM cards should be provided only through the MNOs’ logistics  centres, while usage of existing stocks at the subscriber’s disposal should be discouraged.  Additional internal controls may be implemented within the mobile network operators:  • keeping an inventory of the blank SIM cards;  • strong controls on the issuance and activation of blank SIM cards; and  • activation of the SIM cards only when the order and/or delivery is confirmed by the  customer.  Artificial intelligence and behavioural analysis  Artificial intelligence (AI) may be used to perform automatic behavioural analysis of subscribers’  activities. The AI engine could store several habits of each customer (e.g. connection history, IP  addresses’ locations) in order to have a basis for comparison at the time of a requested SIM  swap.  If abnormal behaviour is detected (e.g. sudden change of the IP address location, several  concurrent connections from different IP addresses), the MNO is alerted in real time in order to  block the SIM-swapping process.  However, the use of AI for detecting fraudulent SIM swaps should be very carefully applied,  considering the regulatory context in the light of confidentially of communications data and  personal data protection. Specific guidance from the competent authorities, review mechanisms  and strong controls are necessary to avoid unnecessary retention and analysis of  communication and personal data.  4.2 FOR THE BANKS  API between MNOs and banks  Banks have the possibility to check whether a SIM swap has been recently performed with the  use of an API provided by the MNOs. We discuss the use of such APIs in section 4.1 of this  report.  Migrate from SMS two-factor authentication to app-based two-factor authentication  The latest banking frauds related to SIM swapping suggest that SMS two-factor authentication  (2FA) may not provide a sufficient level of security.  App-based 2FA relies on biometric, PIN or password-based authentication of the customer, and  thus does not pose a risk of the SMS OTP being intercepted. We note that such app-based 2FA  is already used by many banks to authorise transactions, replacing the SMS 2FA process.  Reach out to the public  Banks, along with the MNOs, can carry out awareness campaigns towards their customers, in  order to warn them about SIM-swapping attacks. For example, Alpha bank Greece has  developed a web page including information on the SIM Swapping fraud. In this page, the bank  explains how the fraud works, and includes advice for the clients to self-protect. On its website,  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  21  the bank also lists measures it takes to mitigate the risk of sim swapping frauds16. Similarly,  Bank Millennium in Poland warns its customers against SIM swapping attacks17.  We also provide more general examples of consumer outreach activities performed by banks in  our upcoming report entitled ‘Cybersecurity Outreach About Cybersecurity Threats by Telecom  Providers’. For example, on their websites, banks already advise of some of the latest types of  fraud (such as delivery and cryptocurrency scams), the steps customers can take when they  feel they may become victim of one, and the channels they can use to contact the bank.  Analogous information could be provided to decrease the risk of successful SIM swapping  attacks.  4.3 FOR THE NATIONAL AUTHORITIES  Guidelines for secure authentication  Customer authentication is at the heart of the SIM swapping process, no matter the channel  used (e.g. store, phone, chat bot, mobile application).  Competent authorities could contribute to fulfilling this objective by issuing appropriate  guidelines for the MNOs. Specifically, they could recommend putting in place a set of  challenges for subscribers initiating a SIM swapping process. This list of mandatory challenges  could be different from one MNO to another, but the competent authority could nevertheless  consider recommending a basic common set of challenges used in the SIM swapping process.  In this context, the Italian competent authority, AGCOM, carried out a public consultation on  increasing security on the part of the customer as well in all cases of SIM swaps, including  mobile number portability. This could also be useful in mitigating the attack in cases other than  banking fraud.  The new regulation following the consultation is included in Deliberation No 86/21/CIR18.  Mechanisms have been introduced to prevent and combat fraud attempts, including by  modifying the law on mobile number portability. The user will be able to confirm to the MNO that  it should continue the SIM card replacement (or portability) process, or instruct it to stop.  SIM swapping process assessment  The competent national authorities may perform ad-hoc audits to examine the existing SIM  swapping processes employed by the MNOs and assess whether they are secure and actually  followed by the MNOs’ employees.  Providing recommendations to enhance specific processes could contribute to the mitigation of  the threat.  Promoting communication and active collaboration among stakeholders  Establishing frequent communication between public authorities, MNOs and banks, sharing  general information about incidents and discussing fraud prevention measures could all  significantly contribute to building up risk mitigation know-how.  Furthermore, launching intuitive public awareness campaigns could contribute greatly to  decreasing the threat of attacks occurring and minimising their impact.  16 https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping  17 https://www.bankmillennium.pl/bankowosc-elektroniczna/bezpieczenstwo.  18https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_ p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column- 1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_IN STANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document  https://www.alpha.gr/en/retail/support-center/security/apati-sim-swapping https://www.bankmillennium.pl/bankowosc-elektroniczna/bezpieczenstwo https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document https://www.agcom.it/documentazione/documento?p_p_auth=fLw7zRht&p_p_id=101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_col_id=column-1&p_p_col_count=1&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_struts_action=%2Fasset_publisher%2Fview_content&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_assetEntryId=23785406&_101_INSTANCE_FnOw5lVOIXoE_type=document  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  22  Specifically, regarding general communication with the relevant national authorities, the survey  respondents said they communicated mostly with the local law enforcement agencies (40 %)  followed by the national cybersecurity agency (25 %). It should be noted however, that the  response provided by 5 MNOs was “I don’t know” and wasn’t considered in the respective  percentages and graph.  Figure 14:  Communication with the national competent authorities  However, more than half of the MNOs who responded to the online survey (53%)19 noted that  they did not share any information on specific SIM swapping incidents with their competent  national authority.

In this case, subscribers are strongly recommended to contact their MNO without any delay.  Also, subscribers are recommended to check their banking transactions frequently for any  suspicious activities and, if there are any, contact the bank and their MNO immediately.  Finally, subscribers should act fast in case of any unrecognized activity in their social media  or email accounts. They should contact their MNO and change their account passwords.  Generic self-protection advice  SIM-swapping fraud usually begins with phishing and/or social engineering against subscribers.  To avoid phishing attacks subscribers should take the following precautions.  • Be cautious with the information shared on social media networks.  • Never open any suspicious internet hyperlinks or attachments received through email  or messages.  • Avoid providing any personal information by email or by phone when called by  someone claiming to be the MNO’s representative. A real customer representative will  never request personal details such as credit card details or 2FA SMS content. In  some cases, MNOs can send an OTP SMS for finalising a SIM swap. This OTP  password must never be communicated to anyone, even to persons who call the  customers and claim to be an MNO’s employee.  • Update account passwords on a regular basis.

All changes of IMSI are detected.  Necessity for the bank to create a  database for the IMSIs, to be able to  compare the received IMSI with the  last stored one.  If SMS are not frequently sent –  information may be not accurate  enough.  If SMS are too  frequent, cost of service may  represent an issue. In fact,  comparison between IMSIs doesn’t  not provide the information on when  the change occurred. It is required  that all operations work on real time.  Data protection related restrictions if  not hashed IMSI sent  May not work with 5G  For the MNOs, need for process to  communicate IMSIs to the banks  Hashed IMSI requires previous  development  COUNTERING SIM-SWAPPING  December 2021  27  B ANNEX: HOW TO AVOID SIM  SWAPPING? - LEAFLET  T P  -0 1  -2 1  -3 5  3 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

    "abstract": "In this study, we give an overview of how SIM-Swapping attacks work, list measures that providers can take to mitigate the attack and make recommendations for policy makers and authorities in the telecom sector and other sectors. Security of electronic communications networks and services does not only translate to minimising the risk of service deterioration or outage, but also to protecting individual customers, for example against fraud, such as SIM swapping attacks"

It provides an approach to 87  help management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or identify 88  and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metric development and implementation 89  process and how it can also be used to adequately justify security control investments. The 90  results of an effective metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of 91  information security resources and should simplify the preparation of performance-related 92  reports. 93  Keywords 94  information security; metrics; measures; security controls; performance; reports. 95  Reports on Computer Systems Technology 96  The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and 97  Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical 98  leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test 99  methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance 100  the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 101  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 102  the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in 103  federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, 104  guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities 105  with industry, government, and academic organizations. 106  Note to Reviewers 107  We seek input on the changes being proposed to SP 800-55. New sections are noted as new 108  additions to SP 800-55. Many are also marked by a “Note to Reviewer” with a request for 109  feedback. These questions are meant to facilitate discussion and should not discourage input on 110  any other topics within this annotated outline. There are three additional questions for reviewer 111  consideration. These questions are:  112  1) CIOs and CISOs: What measurement and metrics guidance would benefit your program? 113  2) How to best communicate information security measurement needs up and down the 114  organizational structure? 115  3) Examples: What kinds of measures and metrics examples or templates could this 116  publication provide that would be helpful in your work? 117  This working draft also has sections with only minor planned changes marked as “intentionally 118  left out of this review cycle” to allow for readers to focus on the more substantial proposed 119  changes. The Initial Public Draft will include the full proposed text for all sections of the 120  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  ii  document. Feedback is still welcome on the sections not highlighted in this Initial Working 121  Draft.  122  A virtual public forum will be held on December 13, 2022, to introduce the working draft of SP 123  800-55 and highlight the various questions for reviewers within the document through a panel of 124  practitioners across different sectors.  125  126  127  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2022/12/cybersecurity-measurement-workshop  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  iii  Call for Patent Claims 128  This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use 129  would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information 130  Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication).

Terminology 251  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will establish how 252  words will be used within the document 253  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  3  • Information security: The protection of information and systems from unauthorized 254  access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction to provide confidentiality, 255  integrity, and availability. [FIPS200] 256  • Measurement: The process of experimentally obtaining one or more quantity values that 257  can be reasonably attributed to a quantity. [MetricsMeasures] 258  • Measures: An objective and concrete attribute. Should be quantifiable and observable. 259  Used as the basis for metrics. [MetricsMeasures] 260  • Metrics: Tools designed to facilitate decision-making and improve performance and 261  accountability through collecting, analyzing, and reporting relevant performance-related 262  data. More abstract, higher-level, or subjective than measures. [MetricsMeasures] 263  • Quantitative Assessment: Use a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risks 264  based on the use of numbers where the meanings and proportionality of values are 265  maintained inside and outside the context of the assessment. [SP800-30] 266  • Qualitative: Use of a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based on 267  nonnumerical categories or levels. [SP800-30] 268  • Semi-Quantitative: Use of a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based 269  on bins, scales, or representative numbers whose values and meanings are not maintained 270  in other contexts. [SP800-30] 271  272  Any additional input on this section is welcome.  273  2.1.2. Definition 274  This section only has minor updates from [3.1 Definition] in the current 275  [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle. 276  Summary: Information security measures facilitate decision making and improve performance 277  and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting relevant performance-related data. 278  The purpose of measure performance is to monitor the status of measured activities and facilitate 279  improvement by applying corrective actions based on observable measurements. Measures 280  should be:  281  • Possible to obtain at different levels within an organization 282  • Based on information security performance goals and objectives 283  • Information security measures monitor the accomplishment of goals and objectives by 284  quantifying the implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness of security controls. 285  • Data required for calculating measures must be readily obtainable, and the process under 286  consideration needs to be measurable. 287  • Allow for tracking performance and directing resources. 288  Note to Reviewers: We seek to define terms as used in this document. We welcome  suggestions of terminology that may need further clarity.  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  4  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 289  Benefits of Using Measures 290  This section only has minor updates from [3.2 Benefits of Using 291  Measures] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 292  review cycle.  293  Summary: An information security measurement program provides several organizational and 294  financial benefits:  295  • Increase Accountability 296  • Improve Information Security Effectiveness 297  • Demonstrate Compliance 298  • Provide Quantifiable Inputs for Resource Allocation Decisions 299  New Additions:  300  • Manage Risk 301  • Continuous Analysis 302  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 303  Critical Success Factors 304  This section only has minor updates from [1.4 Critical Success Factors] 305  in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review 306  cycle.  307  Summary: An information security measurement program within an organization should include 308  four interdependent components:  309  • Foundation of strong upper-level management support 310  • Practical information security policies & procedures 311  • Quantifiable performance measures 312  • Results-oriented measures and analysis 313  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  5  314  Fig. 1.

Implementation Measures 328  This section only has minor updates from [3.3.1 Implementation 329  Measures] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 330  review cycle.  331  Summary: Implementation measures demonstrate progress in implementing information security 332  programs, specific security controls, and associated policies and procedures. Implementation 333  measures can also examine system-level areas. These measures require data obtained using 334  common means of documenting and tracking information security program activities. 335  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 336  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  7  2.4.2. Effectiveness/Efficiency Measures 337  This section only has minor updates from [3.3.2 Effectiveness/Efficiency 338  Measures] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 339  review cycle.  340  Summary: Effectiveness/Efficiency measures are used to monitor if program-level processes and 341  system- level security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the 342  desired outcome. These measures concentrate on the evidence and results of assessments and 343  may require multiple data points quantifying the degree to which information security controls 344  are implemented and the resulting effect(s) on the organization’s information security posture. 345  Effectiveness/efficiency measures address two aspects of security control implementation 346  results: the robustness of the result itself, referred to as effectiveness, and the timeliness of the 347  result, referred to as efficiency. 348  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 349  2.4.3. Impact Measures 350  This section only has minor updates from [3.3.3 Impact Measures] in the 351  current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.  352  Summary: Impact measures articulate the impact of information security on an organization’s 353  mission. These measures are inherently organization-specific and combine information about the 354  results of security controls implementation with information about resources. Resource 355  information across an organization is tied directly to information security activity and events that 356  must be tracked to assess impact measures. 357  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 358  Measurement Considerations 359  This section only has minor updates from [3.4 Measurement 360  Considerations] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of 361  this review cycle.  362  Summary: Organizations embarking on information security performance measurement should 363  be aware of several considerations for helping their program succeed. These include specific 364  organizational structures and processes. Successful information security performance 365  measurement also requires understanding budget, personnel, and time resources. 366  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 367  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  8  2.5.1. Organizational Considerations 368  This section only has minor updates from [3.4.1 Organizational 369  Considerations] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of 370  this review cycle.  371  Summary: The development of information security metrics and program implementation 372  requires the involvement of appropriate stakeholders across various organizational elements that 373  interact with information security. Each stakeholder should provide inputs to the measures 374  development effort to ensure that the collected measures are meaningful yield impact and 375  outcome findings and provide results necessary to address performance gaps.  376  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 377  2.5.2. Manageability 378  This section only has minor updates from [3.4.2 Manageability] in the 379  current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.  380  Summary: Any information security measurement program must be manageable for the 381  implementing organization. As resources are limited organizations should prioritize 382  measurement requirements to ensure that a limited number of measures are gathered. As the 383  program matures and target levels of measurement are reached, obsolete measures should be 384  phased out and new ones that measure completion and effectiveness of more current items 385  should be used.  386  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 387  2.5.3. Data Management Concerns 388  This section only has minor updates from [3.4.3 Data Management 389  Concerns] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 390  review cycle.  391  Summary: To ensure the quality and validity of data, data collection methods and data 392  repositories used for measures data should be standardized. Although substantial amounts of data 393  may be collected, not all data will be useful for an information security measurement program 394  and any given point in time. Data collection should be as nonintrusive as possible. The 395  operational and vulnerability information contained in information security data repositories 396  needs to be protected appropriately due to the sensitive nature of the data.  397  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 398  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  9  2.5.4.

Stakeholder interests will differ 487  depending on their roles and position within the organization. Each stakeholder may require an 488  additional set of customized measures that give insight into their area of responsibility.  489  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 490  Goals and Objective Definition 491  This section only has minor updates from [5.2 Goals and Objective 492  Definition] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 493  review cycle.  494  Summary: Phase 2 is identifying and documenting information security program goals and 495  objectives that would guide security control implementation. Information security program goals 496  can also be derived from enterprise-level goals and objectives in support of the overall 497  organization’s mission.  498  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 499  3.2.1. Governance and Compliance 500  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will explore how goals 501  and objectives may be determined by goals created outside of the 502  information security program, including: 503  • Governance structures 504  • Laws and regulations 505  • Industry guidance  506  • Various requirements from outside the organizational structure, such as:  507  o Insurance 508  o Auditors 509  o Accreditation bodies 510  o Compliance reviews 511  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  13  512  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 513  Information Security Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures Review 514  This section only has minor updates from [5.3 Information Security 515  Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures Review] in the current [SP800-55] 516  and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.  517  Summary: Phase 3 focuses on reviewing organization-specific security practices that define a 518  baseline for information security practices. These policies, guidelines, and procedures should be 519  reviewed during the measures development process and periodically afterward.  520  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 521  Information Security Measurement Program Implementation Review 522  This section only has minor updates from [5.4 Information Security 523  Program Implementation Review] in the current [SP800-55] and is 524  intentionally left out of this review cycle.  525  Summary: Phase 4 consists of reviewing any existing measures or data repositories that could be 526  used to derive measures. The retirement of existing measures and development of new measures 527  will continue as the information security measures program evolves. 528  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 529  Measures Development and Selection 530  This section only has minor updates from [5.5 Measures Development 531  and Selection] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of 532  this review cycle.  533  Summary: Phase 5, 6, and 7 involves developing measures that track the implementation, 534  efficiency/effectiveness, and business impact of an information security program.  535  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 536  Note to Reviewers: We seek input on how organizations address and balance goals and  objectives required by outside entities as opposed to internal information security program  goals and objectives.  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  14  3.5.1. Measures Development Approach 537  This section only has minor updates from [5.5.1 Measures Development 538  Approach] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 539  review cycle.  540  Summary: The scope of the measurement effort informs if the development of information 541  security measures should focus on gauging the security performance of a specific security 542  control, a group of security controls, or a security program. 543  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 544  3.5.2. Measures Prioritization and Selection 545  This section has significant updates from [5.5.2 Measures Prioritization 546  and Selection] in the current [SP800-55].  547  There is a huge number of possible measures for an organization to monitor. Measures 548  prioritization ensures that the set selected for initial implementation has the following qualities: 549  • Facilitates improvement of high priority security control implementation as selected 550  using a risk-based approach 551  • Uses data from existing sources and data repositories 552  • Measures existing and established processes 553  o Inconsistent processes will not provide meaningful data about information 554  security performance, but measurements may still be used to establish a baseline 555  for continuous monitoring purposes 556  At this point in the process, a weighing scale may be used to assign values to each measure. 557  Organizations should use a weighing scale that fits their needs while ensuring consistency across 558  the process. The process of developing a weighing scale may utilize the following techniques:  559  • Event Probability 560  o Setting baselines 561  o Leverage in-house knowledge and data about existing systems. 562  o Organizational assessments, audits, interviews, surveys, and studies are all 563  options. 564  o Convert qualitative metrics to quantitative metrics. 565  o Examine external data and knowledge. 566  o Use raw data to augment existing measurements or to achieve targeted 567  knowledge/metrics. 568  • Event Probability Models 569  o Decomposition theorems for probability density 570  o Bayesian methods for probability analysis  571  o Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo for performance 572  metrics and propagating uncertainty 573  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  15  o Copula methods for correlation between risks 574  o Event Tree analysis 575  o Machine learning and predictive models 576  • Consequences 577  o Establish a consequence model by looking at potential events and their outcomes. 578  o Outliers and unexampled events may come up over time. An organization can 579  prepare for these issues using horizon scanning, stress tests, and system resilience. 580  • Consequence Modeling 581  o Expected shortfall  582  o Value at risk – statistical analysis of historical market trends 583  o If a consequence model has already been determined as part of a risk management 584  strategy, the organization should leverage that research. 585  586  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 587  3.5.3. Establishing Performance Targets 588  This section only has minor updates from [5.5.2 Establishing 589  Performance Targets] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left 590  out of this review cycle.  591  Performance targets establish a benchmark by which success is measured. Implementation 592  measures targets are set for 100 percent completion of assigned tasks. However, 593  effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures will require qualitative and subjective reasoning to 594  determine appropriate and acceptable performance levels. Performance targets and risk tolerance 595  should be determined by upper-level management or even at the board level. These targets and 596  benchmarks require periodic reexamination to ensure appropriate target levels.  597  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 598  Defining Evaluation Methods 599  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will look at evaluation 600  methods for measuring effectiveness, efficiency, and the impact of risk 601  reduction. The focus will be on observable functionalities and outcomes:  602  • Assessing against baselines and acceptable ranges 603  • Component testing [SP800-84] 604  • Monitoring for anomalies 605  Note to Reviewers: We seek reviewer input on the prioritization, selection, modeling, and  weighing of measures.

Fields of reporting 632  may include: 633  o Measure ID 634  o Goal 635  o Measure 636  o Type 637  o Formula 638  o Target 639  Note to Reviewers: We seek reviewer input on additional functionalities, controls, or  indicators that could be represented here.  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  17  o Implementation evidence 640  o Frequency 641  o Responsible parties 642  o Data source 643  o Reporting format 644  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 645  Feedback Within the Development Process 646  This section only has minor updates from [5.7 Feedback Within the 647  Development Process] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left 648  out of this review cycle. 649  Summary: Measures that are ultimately selected for implementation will be useful for:  650  o Measuring performance 651  o Identifying causes of unsatisfactory performance 652  o Pinpointing improvement areas 653  o Facilitating consistent policy implementation 654  o Effecting security policy changes 655  o Redefining goals and objectives 656  o Supporting continuous improvement 657  These are shown as the feedback arrows in Figure 3-1 as goal/objective redefinition, policy 658  update, and continuous improvement. 659  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 660  Information Security Measurement Program Implementation 661  This section only has minor updates from [6. Information Security 662  Measurement Implementation] in the current [SP800-55] and is 663  intentionally left out of this review cycle.  664  Summary: Information security measurement implementation involves applying measures for 665  monitoring information security control performance and using the results to initiate 666  performance improvement actions. The information security measurement program 667  implementation process consists of six phases that – when fully executed – will ensure the 668  continued use of these measures for security control performance monitoring and improvement. 669  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  18  670  Fig. 4. Information Security Measurement Program Implementation Process 671  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 672  Prepare for Data Collection 673  This section only has minor updates from [6.1 Prepare for Data 674  Collection] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 675  review cycle.  676  Summary: Phase 1 involves creating an implementation plan, with definitions including:  677  o Audience for the plan 678  o Measurement roles and responsibilities  679  o Process of measures collection, analysis and reporting 680  o Details of coordination within the office of the CIO 681  o Details of coordination between the CISO and other functions within the agency to 682  ensure measures data collection is streamlined and non-intrusive. 683  o Creation or selection of data collection and tracking tools 684  o Modification of data collection and tracking tools 685  o Measures summary reporting formats 686  o Provisions for continuous monitoring  687  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 688  Collect Data and Analyze Results 689  This section only has minor updates from [6.2 Collect Data and Analyze 690  Results] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 691  review cycle.  692  Summary: Phase 2 involves activities essential for ensuring that the collected measures are used 693  to gain understanding of information security and identify appropriate actions. These activities 694  include:  695  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  19  o Collect measures data according to the processes in the Measurement Program 696  Implementation Plan 697  o Aggregate measures as appropriate to derive higher-level measures 698  o Consolidate collected data and store in a format conducive to data analysis and reporting 699  o Conduct gap analysis to compare measurements with targets and identify gaps between 700  actual and desired performance 701  o Identify causes of poor performance 702  o Identify areas that require improvement 703  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 704  4.2.1. Data Collection and Reporting 705  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will explore how 706  continuous monitoring provides the necessary feedback for calibrating 707  measures and determining the information security program’s 708  effectiveness.  709  Measures data is considered fully automated when all data is gathered by automated data sources 710  without human involvement or intervention.  Automation can facilitate continuous monitoring 711  processes of both:  712  o Measurement data collection 713  o Measurement data reporting 714  Detailed information on building a continuous monitoring program can be found in [SP800-715  137A]. 716  Data may also need to be collected manually in instances where automation of data collection is 717  not a practical option.  718  o Explores semi-automated and non-automated processes that need humans to facilitate 719  collection or reporting.  720  o Manual data collection and reporting may also include developing questionnaires, 721  conducting interviews, and administering surveys with the organization’s staff.  722  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 723  Identify Corrective Actions 724  This section only has minor updates from [6.3 Identify Corrective 725  Actions] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 726  review cycle.  727  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  20  Summary: Phase 3 consists of developing a plan to serve as the roadmap for closing the 728  implementation gaps identified in Phase 2. This may include:  729  o Determining the range of corrective actions 730  o Prioritizing actions based on overall risk mitigation goals 731  o Selecting the most appropriate corrective actions 732  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 733  Develop a Business Case and Obtain Resources 734  This section only has minor updates from [6.4 Development Business 735  Case and Obtain Resources] in the current [SP800-55] and is 736  intentionally left out of this review cycle. 737  Summary: Phase 4 and 5 addresses the budgeting cycle for acquiring resources needed to 738  implement the corrective actions identified in Phase 3. A business case analysis should feature 739  the results from the previous phases of the information security measurement process. The level 740  of effort for building a business case should correspond with the size and scope of the funding 741  requests. When drafting the business case, it is vital to remember only the organization can 742  establish appetite and tolerance for risk. 743  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 744  Apply Corrective Actions 745  This section only has minor updates from [6.5 Apply Corrective Actions] 746  in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review 747  cycle.  748  Summary: Phase 6 involves implementing corrective actions in the information security program 749  or the technical, managerial, or operational areas of security controls. From here the cycle goes 750  back to Phase 2, where data is collected and analyzed. This iterative process allows for the 751  monitoring of progress in the measurement program and ensures corrective actions are 752  influencing information security control implementation in an intended way. Frequent 753  performance measurement will flag actions that are not implemented as planned or not having 754  the desired effects. This enables quick course correction with an organization to avoid problems 755  that could be uncovered in audits, C&A efforts, or to related activities. 756  References 757  [CSF]  National Institute of Standards and Technology (2018) Framework for Improving Critical 758  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1.

It provides an approach to 87  help management decide where to invest in additional security protection resources or identify 88  and evaluate nonproductive controls. It explains the metric development and implementation 89  process and how it can also be used to adequately justify security control investments. The 90  results of an effective metric program can provide useful data for directing the allocation of 91  information security resources and should simplify the preparation of performance-related 92  reports. 93  Keywords 94  information security; metrics; measures; security controls; performance; reports. 95  Reports on Computer Systems Technology 96  The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and 97  Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical 98  leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test 99  methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance 100  the development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 101  development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 102  the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in 103  federal information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, 104  guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities 105  with industry, government, and academic organizations. 106  Note to Reviewers 107  We seek input on the changes being proposed to SP 800-55. New sections are noted as new 108  additions to SP 800-55. Many are also marked by a “Note to Reviewer” with a request for 109  feedback. These questions are meant to facilitate discussion and should not discourage input on 110  any other topics within this annotated outline. There are three additional questions for reviewer 111  consideration. These questions are:  112  1) CIOs and CISOs: What measurement and metrics guidance would benefit your program? 113  2) How to best communicate information security measurement needs up and down the 114  organizational structure? 115  3) Examples: What kinds of measures and metrics examples or templates could this 116  publication provide that would be helpful in your work? 117  This working draft also has sections with only minor planned changes marked as “intentionally 118  left out of this review cycle” to allow for readers to focus on the more substantial proposed 119  changes. The Initial Public Draft will include the full proposed text for all sections of the 120  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  ii  document. Feedback is still welcome on the sections not highlighted in this Initial Working 121  Draft.  122  A virtual public forum will be held on December 13, 2022, to introduce the working draft of SP 123  800-55 and highlight the various questions for reviewers within the document through a panel of 124  practitioners across different sectors.  125  126  127  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/events/2022/12/cybersecurity-measurement-workshop  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  iii  Call for Patent Claims 128  This public review includes a call for information on essential patent claims (claims whose use 129  would be required for compliance with the guidance or requirements in this Information 130  Technology Laboratory (ITL) draft publication).

[FIPS200] 256  • Measurement: The process of experimentally obtaining one or more quantity values that 257  can be reasonably attributed to a quantity. [MetricsMeasures] 258  • Measures: An objective and concrete attribute. Should be quantifiable and observable. 259  Used as the basis for metrics. [MetricsMeasures] 260  • Metrics: Tools designed to facilitate decision-making and improve performance and 261  accountability through collecting, analyzing, and reporting relevant performance-related 262  data. More abstract, higher-level, or subjective than measures. [MetricsMeasures] 263  • Quantitative Assessment: Use a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risks 264  based on the use of numbers where the meanings and proportionality of values are 265  maintained inside and outside the context of the assessment. [SP800-30] 266  • Qualitative: Use of a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based on 267  nonnumerical categories or levels. [SP800-30] 268  • Semi-Quantitative: Use of a set of methods, principles, or rules for assessing risk based 269  on bins, scales, or representative numbers whose values and meanings are not maintained 270  in other contexts. [SP800-30] 271  272  Any additional input on this section is welcome.  273  2.1.2. Definition 274  This section only has minor updates from [3.1 Definition] in the current 275  [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle. 276  Summary: Information security measures facilitate decision making and improve performance 277  and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting relevant performance-related data. 278  The purpose of measure performance is to monitor the status of measured activities and facilitate 279  improvement by applying corrective actions based on observable measurements. Measures 280  should be:  281  • Possible to obtain at different levels within an organization 282  • Based on information security performance goals and objectives 283  • Information security measures monitor the accomplishment of goals and objectives by 284  quantifying the implementation, efficiency, and effectiveness of security controls. 285  • Data required for calculating measures must be readily obtainable, and the process under 286  consideration needs to be measurable. 287  • Allow for tracking performance and directing resources. 288  Note to Reviewers: We seek to define terms as used in this document. We welcome  suggestions of terminology that may need further clarity.

Implementation Measures 328  This section only has minor updates from [3.3.1 Implementation 329  Measures] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 330  review cycle.  331  Summary: Implementation measures demonstrate progress in implementing information security 332  programs, specific security controls, and associated policies and procedures. Implementation 333  measures can also examine system-level areas. These measures require data obtained using 334  common means of documenting and tracking information security program activities. 335  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 336  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  7  2.4.2. Effectiveness/Efficiency Measures 337  This section only has minor updates from [3.3.2 Effectiveness/Efficiency 338  Measures] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 339  review cycle.  340  Summary: Effectiveness/Efficiency measures are used to monitor if program-level processes and 341  system- level security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the 342  desired outcome. These measures concentrate on the evidence and results of assessments and 343  may require multiple data points quantifying the degree to which information security controls 344  are implemented and the resulting effect(s) on the organization’s information security posture. 345  Effectiveness/efficiency measures address two aspects of security control implementation 346  results: the robustness of the result itself, referred to as effectiveness, and the timeliness of the 347  result, referred to as efficiency. 348  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 349  2.4.3. Impact Measures 350  This section only has minor updates from [3.3.3 Impact Measures] in the 351  current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.  352  Summary: Impact measures articulate the impact of information security on an organization’s 353  mission. These measures are inherently organization-specific and combine information about the 354  results of security controls implementation with information about resources. Resource 355  information across an organization is tied directly to information security activity and events that 356  must be tracked to assess impact measures. 357  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 358  Measurement Considerations 359  This section only has minor updates from [3.4 Measurement 360  Considerations] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of 361  this review cycle.  362  Summary: Organizations embarking on information security performance measurement should 363  be aware of several considerations for helping their program succeed. These include specific 364  organizational structures and processes. Successful information security performance 365  measurement also requires understanding budget, personnel, and time resources. 366  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 367  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  8  2.5.1. Organizational Considerations 368  This section only has minor updates from [3.4.1 Organizational 369  Considerations] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of 370  this review cycle.  371  Summary: The development of information security metrics and program implementation 372  requires the involvement of appropriate stakeholders across various organizational elements that 373  interact with information security. Each stakeholder should provide inputs to the measures 374  development effort to ensure that the collected measures are meaningful yield impact and 375  outcome findings and provide results necessary to address performance gaps.  376  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 377  2.5.2. Manageability 378  This section only has minor updates from [3.4.2 Manageability] in the 379  current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.  380  Summary: Any information security measurement program must be manageable for the 381  implementing organization. As resources are limited organizations should prioritize 382  measurement requirements to ensure that a limited number of measures are gathered. As the 383  program matures and target levels of measurement are reached, obsolete measures should be 384  phased out and new ones that measure completion and effectiveness of more current items 385  should be used.  386  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 387  2.5.3. Data Management Concerns 388  This section only has minor updates from [3.4.3 Data Management 389  Concerns] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 390  review cycle.  391  Summary: To ensure the quality and validity of data, data collection methods and data 392  repositories used for measures data should be standardized. Although substantial amounts of data 393  may be collected, not all data will be useful for an information security measurement program 394  and any given point in time. Data collection should be as nonintrusive as possible. The 395  operational and vulnerability information contained in information security data repositories 396  needs to be protected appropriately due to the sensitive nature of the data.  397  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 398  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  9  2.5.4.

Information security measures can be applied to organizational units, sites, 436  or other organizational constructs. Organizations should be carefully defining the scope of their 437  information security measurement program based on specific stakeholder needs, strategic goals 438  and objectives, operating environments, risk priorities, and information security program 439  maturity. 440  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 441  2.6.1. System Level 442  This section only has minor updates from [3.5.1 Individual Information 443  Systems] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 444  review cycle.  445  Summary: Information security measurement can be applied at the system level to provide 446  quantifiable data regarding the implementation, effectiveness/efficiency, or impact of required or 447  desired security controls. Information security measurement can support certification and 448  accreditation, FISMA reporting, or capital planning activities. Any additional input on this 449  section is welcome. 450  2.6.2. Enterprise-wide Program 451  This section only has minor updates from [3.5.3 Enterprise-Wide 452  Program] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 453  review cycle.  454  Summary: Information security measurement can be implemented on an enterprise-wide level to 455  monitor an organization’s information security activities. Enterprise-level measures can be 456  derived by aggregating multiple system-level measures or developed by using the entire 457  enterprise as the scope. These aggregated and individual information security measurements are 458  then used to inform decisions made on an enterprise level.  459  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 460  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  11  Measures Development Process 461  This section only has minor updates from [5. Measures Development 462  Process] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 463  review cycle.  464  Summary: Overview of considerations when selecting appropriate measures for an organization 465  to pursue. This illustrates an iterative process with two major activities:  466  • Identify and define the current information security measurement program 467  • Develop and select specific measures to gauge the implementation, 468  effectiveness/efficiency, and impact of the organization’s security controls.  469  This development process is a way to think about measures and identify measures tailored to 470  organizational needs, not as a sequential guide. The information security measure development 471  process includes seven phases:  472  1. Stakeholders and interests 473  2. Goals and objectives 474  3. Information security policies, guidelines, and procedures 475  4. Information security program implementation 476  5. Level of implementation 477  6. Program results 478  7. Business/mission impact  479  480  Fig. 3.

Stakeholder interests will differ 487  depending on their roles and position within the organization. Each stakeholder may require an 488  additional set of customized measures that give insight into their area of responsibility.  489  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 490  Goals and Objective Definition 491  This section only has minor updates from [5.2 Goals and Objective 492  Definition] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 493  review cycle.  494  Summary: Phase 2 is identifying and documenting information security program goals and 495  objectives that would guide security control implementation. Information security program goals 496  can also be derived from enterprise-level goals and objectives in support of the overall 497  organization’s mission.  498  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 499  3.2.1. Governance and Compliance 500  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will explore how goals 501  and objectives may be determined by goals created outside of the 502  information security program, including: 503  • Governance structures 504  • Laws and regulations 505  • Industry guidance  506  • Various requirements from outside the organizational structure, such as:  507  o Insurance 508  o Auditors 509  o Accreditation bodies 510  o Compliance reviews 511  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  13  512  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 513  Information Security Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures Review 514  This section only has minor updates from [5.3 Information Security 515  Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures Review] in the current [SP800-55] 516  and is intentionally left out of this review cycle.  517  Summary: Phase 3 focuses on reviewing organization-specific security practices that define a 518  baseline for information security practices. These policies, guidelines, and procedures should be 519  reviewed during the measures development process and periodically afterward.  520  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 521  Information Security Measurement Program Implementation Review 522  This section only has minor updates from [5.4 Information Security 523  Program Implementation Review] in the current [SP800-55] and is 524  intentionally left out of this review cycle.  525  Summary: Phase 4 consists of reviewing any existing measures or data repositories that could be 526  used to derive measures. The retirement of existing measures and development of new measures 527  will continue as the information security measures program evolves. 528  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 529  Measures Development and Selection 530  This section only has minor updates from [5.5 Measures Development 531  and Selection] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of 532  this review cycle.  533  Summary: Phase 5, 6, and 7 involves developing measures that track the implementation, 534  efficiency/effectiveness, and business impact of an information security program.  535  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 536  Note to Reviewers: We seek input on how organizations address and balance goals and  objectives required by outside entities as opposed to internal information security program  goals and objectives.  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  14  3.5.1. Measures Development Approach 537  This section only has minor updates from [5.5.1 Measures Development 538  Approach] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 539  review cycle.  540  Summary: The scope of the measurement effort informs if the development of information 541  security measures should focus on gauging the security performance of a specific security 542  control, a group of security controls, or a security program. 543  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 544  3.5.2. Measures Prioritization and Selection 545  This section has significant updates from [5.5.2 Measures Prioritization 546  and Selection] in the current [SP800-55].  547  There is a huge number of possible measures for an organization to monitor. Measures 548  prioritization ensures that the set selected for initial implementation has the following qualities: 549  • Facilitates improvement of high priority security control implementation as selected 550  using a risk-based approach 551  • Uses data from existing sources and data repositories 552  • Measures existing and established processes 553  o Inconsistent processes will not provide meaningful data about information 554  security performance, but measurements may still be used to establish a baseline 555  for continuous monitoring purposes 556  At this point in the process, a weighing scale may be used to assign values to each measure. 557  Organizations should use a weighing scale that fits their needs while ensuring consistency across 558  the process. The process of developing a weighing scale may utilize the following techniques:  559  • Event Probability 560  o Setting baselines 561  o Leverage in-house knowledge and data about existing systems. 562  o Organizational assessments, audits, interviews, surveys, and studies are all 563  options. 564  o Convert qualitative metrics to quantitative metrics. 565  o Examine external data and knowledge. 566  o Use raw data to augment existing measurements or to achieve targeted 567  knowledge/metrics. 568  • Event Probability Models 569  o Decomposition theorems for probability density 570  o Bayesian methods for probability analysis  571  o Binomial distribution, Poisson distribution and Monte Carlo for performance 572  metrics and propagating uncertainty 573  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  15  o Copula methods for correlation between risks 574  o Event Tree analysis 575  o Machine learning and predictive models 576  • Consequences 577  o Establish a consequence model by looking at potential events and their outcomes. 578  o Outliers and unexampled events may come up over time. An organization can 579  prepare for these issues using horizon scanning, stress tests, and system resilience. 580  • Consequence Modeling 581  o Expected shortfall  582  o Value at risk – statistical analysis of historical market trends 583  o If a consequence model has already been determined as part of a risk management 584  strategy, the organization should leverage that research. 585  586  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 587  3.5.3. Establishing Performance Targets 588  This section only has minor updates from [5.5.2 Establishing 589  Performance Targets] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left 590  out of this review cycle.  591  Performance targets establish a benchmark by which success is measured. Implementation 592  measures targets are set for 100 percent completion of assigned tasks. However, 593  effectiveness/efficiency and impact measures will require qualitative and subjective reasoning to 594  determine appropriate and acceptable performance levels. Performance targets and risk tolerance 595  should be determined by upper-level management or even at the board level. These targets and 596  benchmarks require periodic reexamination to ensure appropriate target levels.  597  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 598  Defining Evaluation Methods 599  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will look at evaluation 600  methods for measuring effectiveness, efficiency, and the impact of risk 601  reduction. The focus will be on observable functionalities and outcomes:  602  • Assessing against baselines and acceptable ranges 603  • Component testing [SP800-84] 604  • Monitoring for anomalies 605  Note to Reviewers: We seek reviewer input on the prioritization, selection, modeling, and  weighing of measures.

Fields of reporting 632  may include: 633  o Measure ID 634  o Goal 635  o Measure 636  o Type 637  o Formula 638  o Target 639  Note to Reviewers: We seek reviewer input on additional functionalities, controls, or  indicators that could be represented here.  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  17  o Implementation evidence 640  o Frequency 641  o Responsible parties 642  o Data source 643  o Reporting format 644  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 645  Feedback Within the Development Process 646  This section only has minor updates from [5.7 Feedback Within the 647  Development Process] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left 648  out of this review cycle. 649  Summary: Measures that are ultimately selected for implementation will be useful for:  650  o Measuring performance 651  o Identifying causes of unsatisfactory performance 652  o Pinpointing improvement areas 653  o Facilitating consistent policy implementation 654  o Effecting security policy changes 655  o Redefining goals and objectives 656  o Supporting continuous improvement 657  These are shown as the feedback arrows in Figure 3-1 as goal/objective redefinition, policy 658  update, and continuous improvement. 659  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 660  Information Security Measurement Program Implementation 661  This section only has minor updates from [6. Information Security 662  Measurement Implementation] in the current [SP800-55] and is 663  intentionally left out of this review cycle.  664  Summary: Information security measurement implementation involves applying measures for 665  monitoring information security control performance and using the results to initiate 666  performance improvement actions. The information security measurement program 667  implementation process consists of six phases that – when fully executed – will ensure the 668  continued use of these measures for security control performance monitoring and improvement. 669  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  18  670  Fig. 4. Information Security Measurement Program Implementation Process 671  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 672  Prepare for Data Collection 673  This section only has minor updates from [6.1 Prepare for Data 674  Collection] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 675  review cycle.  676  Summary: Phase 1 involves creating an implementation plan, with definitions including:  677  o Audience for the plan 678  o Measurement roles and responsibilities  679  o Process of measures collection, analysis and reporting 680  o Details of coordination within the office of the CIO 681  o Details of coordination between the CISO and other functions within the agency to 682  ensure measures data collection is streamlined and non-intrusive. 683  o Creation or selection of data collection and tracking tools 684  o Modification of data collection and tracking tools 685  o Measures summary reporting formats 686  o Provisions for continuous monitoring  687  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 688  Collect Data and Analyze Results 689  This section only has minor updates from [6.2 Collect Data and Analyze 690  Results] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 691  review cycle.  692  Summary: Phase 2 involves activities essential for ensuring that the collected measures are used 693  to gain understanding of information security and identify appropriate actions. These activities 694  include:  695  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  19  o Collect measures data according to the processes in the Measurement Program 696  Implementation Plan 697  o Aggregate measures as appropriate to derive higher-level measures 698  o Consolidate collected data and store in a format conducive to data analysis and reporting 699  o Conduct gap analysis to compare measurements with targets and identify gaps between 700  actual and desired performance 701  o Identify causes of poor performance 702  o Identify areas that require improvement 703  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 704  4.2.1. Data Collection and Reporting 705  This section is a new addition to [SP800-55] and will explore how 706  continuous monitoring provides the necessary feedback for calibrating 707  measures and determining the information security program’s 708  effectiveness.  709  Measures data is considered fully automated when all data is gathered by automated data sources 710  without human involvement or intervention.  Automation can facilitate continuous monitoring 711  processes of both:  712  o Measurement data collection 713  o Measurement data reporting 714  Detailed information on building a continuous monitoring program can be found in [SP800-715  137A]. 716  Data may also need to be collected manually in instances where automation of data collection is 717  not a practical option.  718  o Explores semi-automated and non-automated processes that need humans to facilitate 719  collection or reporting.  720  o Manual data collection and reporting may also include developing questionnaires, 721  conducting interviews, and administering surveys with the organization’s staff.  722  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 723  Identify Corrective Actions 724  This section only has minor updates from [6.3 Identify Corrective 725  Actions] in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this 726  review cycle.  727  NIST SP 800-55r2 iwd (Initial Working Draft)  Performance Measurement Guide for  December 2022  Information Security  20  Summary: Phase 3 consists of developing a plan to serve as the roadmap for closing the 728  implementation gaps identified in Phase 2. This may include:  729  o Determining the range of corrective actions 730  o Prioritizing actions based on overall risk mitigation goals 731  o Selecting the most appropriate corrective actions 732  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 733  Develop a Business Case and Obtain Resources 734  This section only has minor updates from [6.4 Development Business 735  Case and Obtain Resources] in the current [SP800-55] and is 736  intentionally left out of this review cycle. 737  Summary: Phase 4 and 5 addresses the budgeting cycle for acquiring resources needed to 738  implement the corrective actions identified in Phase 3. A business case analysis should feature 739  the results from the previous phases of the information security measurement process. The level 740  of effort for building a business case should correspond with the size and scope of the funding 741  requests. When drafting the business case, it is vital to remember only the organization can 742  establish appetite and tolerance for risk. 743  Any additional input on this section is welcome. 744  Apply Corrective Actions 745  This section only has minor updates from [6.5 Apply Corrective Actions] 746  in the current [SP800-55] and is intentionally left out of this review 747  cycle.  748  Summary: Phase 6 involves implementing corrective actions in the information security program 749  or the technical, managerial, or operational areas of security controls. From here the cycle goes 750  back to Phase 2, where data is collected and analyzed. This iterative process allows for the 751  monitoring of progress in the measurement program and ensures corrective actions are 752  influencing information security control implementation in an intended way. Frequent 753  performance measurement will flag actions that are not implemented as planned or not having 754  the desired effects. This enables quick course correction with an organization to avoid problems 755  that could be uncovered in audits, C&A efforts, or to related activities. 756  References 757  [CSF]  National Institute of Standards and Technology (2018) Framework for Improving Critical 758  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, Version 1.1.

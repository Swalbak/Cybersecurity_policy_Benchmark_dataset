Phishing: so that users may detect and react to the most common attack against individuals.  2. Ransomware: so that users become aware of the threat, learn how to identify it and react to it, and realise  its severity by getting to know its consequences.  The target audience of the campaign, employees between 45-65 years old, was decided as an attempt to address the  gap that exists between younger and older generations, as far as digitalisation is concerned, but also because  ransomware is a predominant threat with great potential for damage to corporations.  What is more, the campaign was coupled with the commemoration of the ECSM’s 10th anniversary in 2022, which  was celebrated – among others – with the production of a “crowdsourcing” video that brought together the  testimonies of people from all MS & organisations that have made the ECSM possible over the years.  The specifics of the campaign included an additional motto “Choose To Be Safe Online”, which was used, along  with the existing ones, in order to convey the above. Several videos were produced for both themes, as it has been  found that they have significant impact on the public and encourage the retention of ideas.  These were included in the landing pages created within the ECSM website for the two themes, along with a series of  tips and informational data, presented in visual format, and a quiz that tested the knowledge that users acquired  during the campaign.  For the ECSM 2022, an evaluation study with the inclusion of behavioural metrics was conducted in order to measure  behaviour change. Surveys are seen as the most feasible ways to measure behavioural change (ENISA, 2021),  supporting the notion that refocus of cybersecurity behaviour change evaluation should be directed towards  behavioural metrics in surveys, which is a better measurement than compliance rates which merely indicate  completion, not a long term, conscious effect on behaviour (Jacobs et al., 2022). Data collected after the campaign  was compared to data from before the campaign, in order to assess the impact of the awareness raising attempts on  cybersecurity behaviour. Successfully, data has shown a significant increase in self-reported cybersecurity behaviour  post-campaign and among people who saw information related to the campaigns about the “Phishing” and  “Ransomware” themes.  The campaign also had another profound impact, which extends towards perceptions of cybersecurity risks, attitudes  towards cybersecurity, social norms around it and beliefs in control over users’ appropriate responses to incidents  which are all relevant aspects when aiming for cybersecurity behaviour change.  Some key findings of the campaign’s evaluation and behavioural research were:  • MS participated broadly in the ECSM 2022 and provided positive feedback for the campaign.  • Dissemination of the campaign through social media was effective and a sustained growth of ENISA’s social  media reach was observed.  • Users interacted much more with the content compared to the interaction that resulted from the previous  ECSM campaign. Furthermore, the ECSM 2022 generated a lot of interest outside Europe.  • The campaign had a positive impact on cybersecurity behaviour compliance, as people who saw the  campaign report to perform cybersecurity behaviour more than those who did not.  • Data shows that all the cybersecurity behaviour types (related to email, password management, software  updates, and network usage) have significantly increased in the target group after the campaign.  • Most participants claimed the campaign was easy to understand, although some said they were  overwhelmed at first.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  3  • The majority of people used the words “helpful”, “meaningful” and “informative” to describe the campaign  and appreciated the applicableness of the offered guidance in avoiding the threats.  • Respondents did not feel that the campaign needed much improvement, they believed the content was fairly  comprehensive and informative already, although participants suggested that it would be beneficial to include even  more examples from the real world.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE ECSM STORY – CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF CAMPAIGNS  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the European Commission  jointly coordinate the ECSM campaign every year, with the aim to promote cybersecurity  among European citizens and organisations through awareness-raising activities and  materials created specifically for this purpose.  Supporting these campaigns are numerous EU Member States and hundreds of different  partners (including governmental entities, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional  associations and private sector companies) from Europe and around the world.  The representatives of the Member States and the different partners function as Ambassadors  of this campaign. Their mission is to support and promote the campaign internally in their  countries. They complement their own national cybersecurity-related campaigns with all the  materials, activities and events created by ENISA, thus making it easier for ECSM content to  reach all EU countries in a way that is closer and more specific to the citizens of each one.  1.1.1 ECSM evolution through the years  In 2011, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity was asked to study and assess the idea of creating a  pan-European cybersecurity campaign for the Cybersecurity Month, October.  In 2012, the ECSM pilot project was launched across Europe. It involved the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Norway,  Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, where several events and activities took place. It was  supported and endorsed by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the European Commission.  In 2013, the ECSM aimed to increase the number of Member States involved, in order to focus on specific issues and  start shaping the activities of this campaign across the European Union, which might have a global impact as well.  In 2014, a total of 184 activities took place in 30 different countries, targeting different audiences such as employees,  digital users, students, and IT experts, and focusing on different topics, including updates, privacy and encryption.  In 2015, the number of activities reached more than 200 and two more countries joined the campaign. Activities were  developed around the themes of cybersecurity culture, cloud solutions and the Digital Single Market.  In 2016, ECSM activities doubled the ones of the previous year, all related to the themes of Cyber Security in  Banking, Cyber Training, Cyber Safety and Mobile Malware.  In 2017, the number of activities continued to grow from EU to EFTA countries, as 5 more countries joined, with the  ECSM being represented in 37 different nations. The themes selected for that year were Cybersecurity in the  Workplace, Governance, Privacy and Data Protection, Cybersecurity in the Home, and Skills in Cybersecurity.  Two countries dropped out in 2018, when the themes were Cyber Hygiene, Digital Skills and Education, Recognize  Cyberscams, and Emerging Technologies and Privacy. Another country joined again in 2019, when Cyber Hygiene  and Emerging Technologies were once more the themes.  COVID-19 burst into our lives in 2020, forcing a change in the approach of the ECSM during that year. Thus, a very  powerful campaign was created under the umbrella concept \"Think Before You Click\", which centred around Cyber  scams and Digital Skills and achieved a much higher outreach than in previous years.  The European  Union Agency for  Cybersecurity  (ENISA) and the  European  Commission  jointly coordinate  the ECSM  campaign every  year, with the  aim to promote  cybersecurity  among European  citizens and  organisations.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  7  It is notable that, in 2021, 73% of the  Member States surveyed stated that  the campaign had helped them  reduce the number of cyber  incidents. The campaign that year  focused on the “Be Cyber Secure  from Home” and “Cyber First Aid”  themes (the first time that a theme  focused on the aftermath of  becoming a victim of a cyber- attack).  For the 2022 ECSM, the whole  issue of cyber security at home,  which was largely driven by the  pandemic, was set aside to focus on  the attacks themselves, with this  year's themes being phishing (as  the main entry vector exploited by  cyber criminals when targeting  people, rather than system  vulnerabilities) and ransomware  (as the most prolific and potentially  damaging cyber-attack).  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE OF THE 2022 CAMPAIGN  We live in a hyper-connected society, where digital transformation has been accelerated by  the pandemic caused by Covid-19, and technological progress is rapid and unstoppable. These  facts have given cybercriminals a much larger attack surface, therefore it is imperative that  the European society is prepared to deal with such attacks.  The main target audience of the Phishing campaign was people over 45 and up to 65  years of age, who are still employed. These people's everyday lives are largely digital, as  they generally use technology for their professional tasks, but also in their personal sphere, with  mobile phones, tablets, smart devices, etc. This is coupled with an expected low or limited  level of knowledge of the cybersecurity domain and, unfortunately, together these  characteristics render them an ideal target for cyberattacks, as well as the most easily  exploitable entry vector for larger-scale attacks.  In addition, in order to assure that the campaign would achieve to reach this type of audience, it  was designed with a view to creating in them the feeling of \"this could be me\" and empowering  their active involvement in cybersecurity, so that they would become human firewalls for their  organisations and homes.  In the Ransomware behavioural-change campaign, the target audience was 45+ year-old  employees of European companies and organisations. Those are the most exploited entry  points for cyberattacks, as they are unaware of the threats and seem used to delegating  responsibility to the IT Department or higher. This is why the campaign was created in a simple  and understandable language, in order to alert them to a plain message: Anyone in your  company could be hit by ransomware.  Figure 1. 10th Anniversary Logo  The target  audience of the  Phishing  campaign was  people over 45  and up to 65  years of age, who  are still  employed.  The target  audience for the  Ransomware  campaign was 45+  year old  employees or  European  companies and  organisations.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  8  2. CAMPAIGN TARGET & CONTENT  2.1 ECSM 2022 VISION & OBJECTIVES  The mission of all entities that participated in ECSM 2022, was to establish a Cybersecure European space by raising  awareness and providing EU citizens with tools and practical advice that would help them adopt more cybersecure  routines and become “Human Firewalls”, consequently boosting the resilience of their professional place as well.  The key objectives of the 2022 ECSM campaign were to:  • Raise cybersecurity awareness in the European Society and create a more secure European Cyberspace,  among EU citizens and organisations.  • Create and disseminate awareness raising materials that provided the target audience with up-to-date online  security information.  • Coordinate and conduct awareness raising activities and events.  • Encourage continuous behavioural change towards cybersecurity.  • Help reduce the occurrence of cybersecurity attacks, establishing users as elements of defence rather than  vulnerabilities.  • Encourage the delivery of key awareness messages, via optimal channels, audio-visual designs and formats.  • Create engaging content on the chosen topics, suitable for the chosen target audience.  • Make use of efficient monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess campaign impact.  • Engage relevant stakeholders and increase the participation of EU Member States, European and  International partners.  • Launch a pre and post-campaign research study in order to assess behavioural change in EU citizens’  cybersecurity posture, as a result of the ECSM campaign.  2.2 ECSM AWARDS: A 2022 NOVELTY  In 2022, ENISA launched a joint action with the national ECSM Coordinators Group: the ECSM  awards. The aim was, on the one hand, to increase visibility of the excellent and creative material  the MS produced in the past years under the ECSM umbrella, and, on the other, to increase  engagement and potential synergies.  MS representatives involved in the process are to vote every year for the most innovative and  impressive materials produced for past ECSM campaigns. Thus, MS were asked to vote from  a list of campaign material submitted to the competition.  The concept was piloted for the 1st time in 2022 and it came to stay. Member States’ national  coordinators were called to submit their candidatures and upload material on three categories:  • Best video  • Best infographic  • Best educational material.  The winning material was translated in all EU languages and promoted anew within the year’s campaign.  ENISA aims to organise this competition every year. The winners - which were announced by VIPs during the ECSM  Campaign kick-off – were:  • Best infographic:  Ireland: Become your own cyber security investigator, announced by European  Commissioner Johannes Hahn  • Best teaching material: Greece: Treasure hunt games for primary school, announced by European  Commission Director for Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity, Lorena Boix Alonso.  In the 2022 ECSM  Awards Ireland  won best  infographic;  Greece, best  teaching material;  Slovenia &  Belgium, best  video.  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/awards https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYl4qNp9oY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLYl4qNp9oY https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/awards https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGVJVoBbC8s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGVJVoBbC8s  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  9  • Best video:  Slovenia: Darko wants to take his girlfriend on a trip and Belgium: Passwords are a thing of the  past. Protect your online accounts with two-factor-authentication, announced by ENISA Executive Director, Juhan  Lepassaar.  2.3 ECSM 10TH ANNIVERSARY  2022 marked the ECSM’s 10th year anniversary and special activities were put to place for its  celebration.  • Anniversary-edition logo: a 10th-anniversary badge was added to the ECSM logo and  used in all material and activities of the year  • Crowdsourcing video: 19 MS-members of the ECSM Coordinators’ Group, EUIBAs  and the people who initiated the ECSM shared their stories and experience from the past 10  years in a potpourri video, which was aired during the ECSM Interinstitutional Launch event  and promoted throughout October.  • Thank-you bespoke gifts and cards were created and sent to all contributing MS, EUIBAs & individuals.  • Anniversary pop-up: created for the ECSM website.  • Interviews and articles were delivered by ENISA on the ECSM story and mission.  Special  activities were  prepared for the  ECSM 10th  Anniversary  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/awards https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/awards https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/awards https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wCQFI4YcbUo https://www.youtube.com/shorts/wCQFI4YcbUo  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  10  3. CAMPAIGN DESIGN  The ECSM Coordinators’ Group decided that the 2022 campaign would focus on Phishing and Ransomware, as  they both are the most prolific threats in Europe and worldwide.  In order to maximize results and focus on the audiences that seem most vulnerable, it was decided that the  campaigns would target people between the ages of 45 and 65. In particular, the Phishing campaign would focus  more on the attacks that these people may suffer in their personal sphere and the Ransomware campaign on  employees, as Ransomware is an attack much more directed towards companies.  To give the campaigns more “packaging”, the (temporary) motto \"Choose To Be Safe Online\" was added to the  other two ECSM slogans/hashtags, \"Think Before You Click\" and “CyberSecMonth\".  Figure 2. Motto Choose To Be Safe Online  3.1 ECSM 2022 THEMES  3.1.1 Phishing  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape 20211, phishing is the most commonly used  attack, on its own and as an entry vector for the perpetration of other, larger cyberattacks. It is  so common that all of us have encountered it at numerous instances in our everyday lives.  Moreover, it is a threat with a wide variety of representation, as it can be sent in numerous  formats, such as email, instant messages, phone calls, or messages on other instant messaging  platforms.  In 2021, the number of phishing attacks tripled, in comparison to the beginning of 2020,  and in the first quarter of 2022 a new record was set, as it was the first quarter in which  the number of phishing attacks exceeded one million (at EU level). What is more, phishing  is responsible for 90% of data breaches and the most common gateway used by cyber  criminals to perpetrate other attacks of greater potential impact, such as ransomware.  3.1.2 Ransomware  The need for the creation of a communication campaign on ransomware lies in the fact that the impact and  consequences of such attacks are very serious and sometimes even lead to the bankruptcy of companies. The  threats posed by ransomware have continued to grow, advance and develop along with technology, and increasingly  pose an even more sophisticated and damaging risk. In 2021 there was a 234% increase of ransomware in Europe  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  The ECSM  2022  Campaign  focused on  Phishing and  Ransomware  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  11  and the average downtime after a ransomware attack is 21 days. The theme was heavily related with the ENISA  Ransomware Threat Landscape published in October 20212.  3.2 ECSM 2022 TARGET AUDIENCE PERSONAS  From the outset, it was clear that the campaign would focus on the so-called “digital immigrants\". These are people  who make extensive use of technology, but whose technology literacy is assumed and expected to be lower than that  of the rest of the population. In addition, not many cybersecurity awareness campaigns focus on them, leaving them  largely untouched.  It was therefore decided that the target audience for the phishing campaign would be the population between 45-65  years of age.  The target audience of the ransomware campaign would also be people 45 to 65, but this time employees of  European companies and large organisations.  3.3 ECSM 2022 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS  Various communication channels were used for this ECSM campaign:  • Landing pages within the ECSM website for each of the campaigns, where all the materials produced were  made available.  • The ECSM website (https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/) for the promotion of its 10th anniversary.  • Organic (Facebook & Twitter) and paid (Facebook, Twitter & YouTube) social media posts for the  promotion of both campaigns and anniversary activities.  • A new hashtag #Choose2BeSafeOnline was added to the existing ones, in order to increase distribution  potential.  • All content was created and produced in English and subtitled in all EU official languages, to increase  the potential impact of the message in non-English-speaking countries.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  12  4. CAMPAIGN EXECUTION  4.1 CONTENT CALENDAR  The campaign was structured around a content calendar for social networks, which was communicated to the MS  prior to its start, so that they would also follow it alongside ENISA. The first half of October was dedicated to phishing  and the second half to ransomware, with initial posts being made as follows and new content being published daily on  all channels, afterwards.  • 21-28 September: teasers  • 30 September: pre-launch  • 1 October: launch alongside airing of the Anniversary Video  • 2 October: second launch posts.  4.2 LAUNCH OF THE ECSM 2022  On Sep 27, the European Cybersecurity Month kick-off event was organised by the EU Council, titled: “A decade  promoting cybersecurity awareness”. The event was structured around two sessions:  • Growing ransomware trends: are the EU institutions ready?  A high-level political debate on the impact of growing ransomware trends, the preparedness of the EU institutions,  and the forthcoming Cybersecurity Regulation - against the background of increasing hybrid threats.  • Cybersecurity awareness inside the EU institutions  The debate on cybersecurity translates into concrete programmes for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as  they aim to increase awareness among their staff. This session focused on testimonials and best practices with an  aim to inspire organisations to up their game.  On Sep 30 a Press release was published simultaneously across the EU, announcing the launch of the European  Cybersecurity Month 2022 and the celebration of its 10th anniversary. Special video messages were delivered by EC  officials: European Commission Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life Margaritis Schinas,  European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Internal Market and  Services Thierry Breton, European Cabinet of Commissioner for Financial Budget Juhannes Hahn, Director for Digital  Society, Trust and Cybersecurity in Directorate General for Communications Networks Content and Technology (DG  CONNECT) Lorena Boix Alonso and ENISA Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, who also announced the winners  of the ECSM Awards.  4.3 CAMPAIGN MATERIALS AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT  ECSM 2022 materials were developed around the “Choose to Be Safe Online” concept, illustrated in the image of  a shield that transforms into a human firewall,  Figure 3. “Choose To Be Safe Online” concept  and included the following:  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/events-gsc/european-cybersecurity-month-2022/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/events-gsc/european-cybersecurity-month-2022/  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  13  • Landing pages were created on the ECSM website. They were used as platforms to deploy a story for each  theme and included all related materials.  • Social media images: a series of social media posts and one accompanying video, images, and infographic.  • Infographics: three infographics per theme, providing insight to the current cybersecurity status in Europe.  • Downloadable posters raising awareness on the threats of phishing and ransomware. They were translated  into 24 languages which resulted in a total of 150 versions in both PDF and editable, open format.  • \"Prevention Response for Ransomware Attacks\" downloadable handbook: a comprehensive document  for managers of small and medium sized organizations to distribute to their employees and train them on how to  prevent and deal with a ransomware attack.  • Ambassadors’ kit.  Materials produced per theme:  • 1 main video  • 3 complementary videos (capsules)  • 3 illustrations with statistical data  • 8 illustrations with the main tips to protect oneself against phishing and ransomware  • 3 downloadable posters  • 3 Photos  • 1 quiz  • Infographics  • 1 post linking to the Cyber First Aid map.  Additionally, for the 10-year anniversary:  • A 14-minute video was produced via crowdsourcing testimonials from Member States, EU Agencies and  individuals who contributed to the ECSM over the years.  • A 10th-anniversary badge was added to the ECSM logo.  • Special social media posts.  • Engraved gift and thank-you card.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  14  5. CAMPAIGN EVALUATION  5.1 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY  The ECSM 2022 campaign was evaluated on the basis of the following:  • Member State activities: each Member State provided their campaign “history”, including Partnerships and  Ambassadors, target audience (if different from the general one), all national events and activities within the ECSM  framework, material used, their own results and conclusions, etc.  • ENISA central social media activities: total number of mentions, total number of followers & their  demographic data, top keywords, top hashtags, paid post results, etc.  • ECSM Web Analytics: number of visits, unique visitors, views, actions per visitor, time spent per visit,  number of downloads,  • Events: time, place & theme of national events and activities within the ECSM.  • Media monitoring: each Member State provided statistics for all the channels or media used during their  campaign.  • Evaluation Questionnaire: qualitative assessment of MS perceptions about the ECSM campaign.  5.2 MS QUESTIONNAIRE  Participating Member States were asked to fill-in an 11-question feedback survey as well as data reports, to improve  European Cybersecurity Month efforts and coordination:  1.

Additionally:  • 84% of MS assess that the ECSM campaign had an impact on the reduction of cyber  incidents.  • The majority of MS perceived that the change in attitude after the implementation of  the ECSM campaign was more positive.  • Campaign’s main strength: the materials created and the collaboration between the  MS and ENISA.  • Campaign’s main weakness: contents are very concentrated in October - users need  more materials throughout the year.  • Average score of 7.1 for the effectiveness of the ECSM 2022 campaign to raise the  belief that cybersecurity behaviours can actually prevent cybersecurity threats.  • Average score of 6.2 for campaign effectiveness in changing the perception that  security compliance is a waste of time and not very productive.  5.3 ASSESMENT OF WEB RESULTS  5.3.1 ECSM website  The metrics indicate a very high level of awareness and that all objectives set for the period  were met and exceeded.  • Visits to ECSM website increased over the previous period by an average of 27%,  with the total visits being 31.8% more.  • Visitors stayed 6.7% longer on the ECSM website and the bounce rate was reduced  by almost 12%.  • In October 2022, the ECSM website had 28.3% more page views than the monthly  average of 2021.  • Downloads of materials increased by almost 10% and out links increased by 78%.  • The most visits were made during weekdays.  • 76% of the traffic flow to the ECSM website was generated by social media posts on  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.  • ECSM website: 53% of users were redirected from Facebook, 10% from Twitter,  9.6% from LinkedIn, and 5.7% from YouTube.  5.3.2 Cyber First Aid Map  The ECSM Cyber First Aid Map was included in this year’s campaign too, as it provides users  with information about the organisations to contact in case of a cyber incident, according to their  geolocation. A link to the map was embedded in the landing pages for the two themes.  MS feedback for  the ECSM 2022  Campaign was  positive, with  most variables  scoring above  80%  Users of the  ECSM website  interacted much  more with its  content than  previous year.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  16  Figure 4. Cyber First Aid Map link  5.3.3 Media monitoring  To improve the impact on offline channels, a press release dedicated to the Ten Years of Raising Cyber  Awareness Throughout Europe was published.  This press release had a significant impact in the media, owing to the use of hashtags dedicated to improving  messages.  As a result, some 2,288 appearances in press media were found in the press clipping with a total daily audience of  675,155,981 readers. The impact in these media would have an advertising value of 7.5 million euros.  More facts about the press release:  • Keywords:  A SEO strategy was set originally, containing the keywords below to undermine the text:  − European Cybersecurity Month  − #CyberSecMonth  − #ThinkB4UClick  − #Choose2BeSafeOnline  − ENISA  • Period:  The analysis period used for the follow-up of the press release was approximately two months. It was not limited to  October, i.e. the period immediately after its release but stretched to November as well. With this technique, it was  possible to find a correlation between the increase in the organisation’s shares and the exposure of the press release  on the European Cybersecurity Month website.  • Territories:  The following countries were analysed: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,  Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.  • Press Sentiment:  According to the subject matter of the content and the algorithm's capacity to identify details of tone, 947 posts were  identified as positive tone, 1125 were identified as neutral tone and 141 were negative.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/european-cybersecurity-month-2022-ten-years-of-raising-cyber-awareness-throughout-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/european-cybersecurity-month-2022-ten-years-of-raising-cyber-awareness-throughout-europe  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  17  Figure 5.

Social Media Views & Clicks  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  19  5.4 BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE ANALYSIS  In the context of the ECSM 2022 campaign, ENISA launched, for the first time, a pre and post campaign survey  to measure the resulting behavioural change and impact. In brief, the following results and recommendations  were drawn from the study:  Results  • The studied sample reported higher engagement in cybersecurity behaviour (self-reported cybersecurity  behaviour) after the campaign, than that reported by the sample before the campaign.  • Respondents who declared to have seen information related to the campaign’s themes were observed to  score higher on cybersecurity behaviour score than respondents in the pre-campaign phase.  • The higher the intentions towards performing cybersecurity behaviour, the more likely people are to perform it.  • In order to increase vulnerability, it is important to increase awareness about cyber threats and focus on the  efficacy of users’ actions.  • When people think that performing appropriate security behaviours to protect their data is a good idea, a  necessity or beneficial, this translates into a willingness to perform the behaviour and, in the end, to execute it.  • When respondents believed that their immediate environment - such as friends, family, colleagues and  managers - think they should follow cybersecurity guidelines, it makes them more likely to adhere to them.  • Performing cybersecurity behaviour compliant with guidelines depends on people’s perceptions of  cybersecurity.  • People’s perception of how effectively a response can prevent a threat and their confidence in their skills  greatly contributes to the willingness to perform cybersecurity behaviour.  • Normative beliefs were found to be a key factor for cybersecurity behaviour.  • The campaign’s target audience - people over 45 years old – were observed to be significantly more likely to  perform cybersecurity behaviour compared to younger people.  • Cybersecurity behaviour was observed to vary depending on occupation.  • Overall, participants indicated that the campaigns helped protect them from “Phishing” slightly more than  “Ransomware”.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  20  6. CONCLUSIONS &  RECOMMENDATIONS  Upon analysis of the results presented above, the following conclusions were drawn for the ECSM 2022 Campaign.  Of the countries that responded to the survey:  • MS participated broadly in the ECSM, by sharing content and organising different activities.  • Overall feedback from MS was positive, with most variables scoring above 80%.  • Short videos were the type of material that generated the most views and user interactions.  • Users of the ECSM website interacted much more with its content, therefore it is deemed that the target  audience was reached more efficiently.  Regarding social media:  • A sustained growth was observed throughout the campaign.  • Most of the people who accessed the ECSM website were redirected from the social networks. Therefore, it is  considered that dissemination through social media was effective.  • The target audience that was receptive to the messages on the social networks was likewise responsive to the  contents of the website.  Finally, the findings of the behavioural study indicated the factors on which awareness campaigns should forcus, in  order to result in far-reaching cybersecurity behaviour compliance:  • Inform and inspire audiences by providing real-world examples and illustrating the way cyber threats can  affect them, as this helps them understand better and endure being careful and alert in the future.  • Provide practical, concise, and easy to execute instructions and advice that individuals can apply in their  interactions with software, networks, and information infrastructures.  • Facilitate discussion and sharing of information with others, as it was found that nationwide and international  campaigns influence the behavior of indivduals but also of people in organisations.  • Consider various constructs related to cybersecurity behaviour, when designing campaign and awareness  communication, for a comprehensive influence and profound impact.  • Critical investigation needs to be undertaken, at an organisational and national level, to understand barriers to  motivation, e.g., organisational or technological issues, as well as the level of security culture and risk of  insider threat.  • When designing campaigns for behaviour change, one must consider the indirect effects of the campaign  occurring through word of mouth, as well as the measurable self-reported individual behaviour.  None of above factors is sufficient by itself, but their combination can facilitate effective targeting.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  21  ANNEX  1.

Phishing: so that users may detect and react to the most common attack against individuals.  2. Ransomware: so that users become aware of the threat, learn how to identify it and react to it, and realise  its severity by getting to know its consequences.  The target audience of the campaign, employees between 45-65 years old, was decided as an attempt to address the  gap that exists between younger and older generations, as far as digitalisation is concerned, but also because  ransomware is a predominant threat with great potential for damage to corporations.  What is more, the campaign was coupled with the commemoration of the ECSM’s 10th anniversary in 2022, which  was celebrated – among others – with the production of a “crowdsourcing” video that brought together the  testimonies of people from all MS & organisations that have made the ECSM possible over the years.  The specifics of the campaign included an additional motto “Choose To Be Safe Online”, which was used, along  with the existing ones, in order to convey the above. Several videos were produced for both themes, as it has been  found that they have significant impact on the public and encourage the retention of ideas.  These were included in the landing pages created within the ECSM website for the two themes, along with a series of  tips and informational data, presented in visual format, and a quiz that tested the knowledge that users acquired  during the campaign.  For the ECSM 2022, an evaluation study with the inclusion of behavioural metrics was conducted in order to measure  behaviour change. Surveys are seen as the most feasible ways to measure behavioural change (ENISA, 2021),  supporting the notion that refocus of cybersecurity behaviour change evaluation should be directed towards  behavioural metrics in surveys, which is a better measurement than compliance rates which merely indicate  completion, not a long term, conscious effect on behaviour (Jacobs et al., 2022). Data collected after the campaign  was compared to data from before the campaign, in order to assess the impact of the awareness raising attempts on  cybersecurity behaviour. Successfully, data has shown a significant increase in self-reported cybersecurity behaviour  post-campaign and among people who saw information related to the campaigns about the “Phishing” and  “Ransomware” themes.  The campaign also had another profound impact, which extends towards perceptions of cybersecurity risks, attitudes  towards cybersecurity, social norms around it and beliefs in control over users’ appropriate responses to incidents  which are all relevant aspects when aiming for cybersecurity behaviour change.  Some key findings of the campaign’s evaluation and behavioural research were:  • MS participated broadly in the ECSM 2022 and provided positive feedback for the campaign.  • Dissemination of the campaign through social media was effective and a sustained growth of ENISA’s social  media reach was observed.  • Users interacted much more with the content compared to the interaction that resulted from the previous  ECSM campaign. Furthermore, the ECSM 2022 generated a lot of interest outside Europe.  • The campaign had a positive impact on cybersecurity behaviour compliance, as people who saw the  campaign report to perform cybersecurity behaviour more than those who did not.  • Data shows that all the cybersecurity behaviour types (related to email, password management, software  updates, and network usage) have significantly increased in the target group after the campaign.  • Most participants claimed the campaign was easy to understand, although some said they were  overwhelmed at first.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  3  • The majority of people used the words “helpful”, “meaningful” and “informative” to describe the campaign  and appreciated the applicableness of the offered guidance in avoiding the threats.  • Respondents did not feel that the campaign needed much improvement, they believed the content was fairly  comprehensive and informative already, although participants suggested that it would be beneficial to include even  more examples from the real world.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 THE ECSM STORY – CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF CAMPAIGNS  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the European Commission  jointly coordinate the ECSM campaign every year, with the aim to promote cybersecurity  among European citizens and organisations through awareness-raising activities and  materials created specifically for this purpose.  Supporting these campaigns are numerous EU Member States and hundreds of different  partners (including governmental entities, universities, think tanks, NGOs, professional  associations and private sector companies) from Europe and around the world.  The representatives of the Member States and the different partners function as Ambassadors  of this campaign. Their mission is to support and promote the campaign internally in their  countries. They complement their own national cybersecurity-related campaigns with all the  materials, activities and events created by ENISA, thus making it easier for ECSM content to  reach all EU countries in a way that is closer and more specific to the citizens of each one.  1.1.1 ECSM evolution through the years  In 2011, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity was asked to study and assess the idea of creating a  pan-European cybersecurity campaign for the Cybersecurity Month, October.  In 2012, the ECSM pilot project was launched across Europe. It involved the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Norway,  Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom, where several events and activities took place. It was  supported and endorsed by the EU Agency for Cybersecurity and the European Commission.  In 2013, the ECSM aimed to increase the number of Member States involved, in order to focus on specific issues and  start shaping the activities of this campaign across the European Union, which might have a global impact as well.  In 2014, a total of 184 activities took place in 30 different countries, targeting different audiences such as employees,  digital users, students, and IT experts, and focusing on different topics, including updates, privacy and encryption.  In 2015, the number of activities reached more than 200 and two more countries joined the campaign. Activities were  developed around the themes of cybersecurity culture, cloud solutions and the Digital Single Market.  In 2016, ECSM activities doubled the ones of the previous year, all related to the themes of Cyber Security in  Banking, Cyber Training, Cyber Safety and Mobile Malware.  In 2017, the number of activities continued to grow from EU to EFTA countries, as 5 more countries joined, with the  ECSM being represented in 37 different nations. The themes selected for that year were Cybersecurity in the  Workplace, Governance, Privacy and Data Protection, Cybersecurity in the Home, and Skills in Cybersecurity.  Two countries dropped out in 2018, when the themes were Cyber Hygiene, Digital Skills and Education, Recognize  Cyberscams, and Emerging Technologies and Privacy. Another country joined again in 2019, when Cyber Hygiene  and Emerging Technologies were once more the themes.  COVID-19 burst into our lives in 2020, forcing a change in the approach of the ECSM during that year. Thus, a very  powerful campaign was created under the umbrella concept \"Think Before You Click\", which centred around Cyber  scams and Digital Skills and achieved a much higher outreach than in previous years.  The European  Union Agency for  Cybersecurity  (ENISA) and the  European  Commission  jointly coordinate  the ECSM  campaign every  year, with the  aim to promote  cybersecurity  among European  citizens and  organisations.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  7  It is notable that, in 2021, 73% of the  Member States surveyed stated that  the campaign had helped them  reduce the number of cyber  incidents. The campaign that year  focused on the “Be Cyber Secure  from Home” and “Cyber First Aid”  themes (the first time that a theme  focused on the aftermath of  becoming a victim of a cyber- attack).  For the 2022 ECSM, the whole  issue of cyber security at home,  which was largely driven by the  pandemic, was set aside to focus on  the attacks themselves, with this  year's themes being phishing (as  the main entry vector exploited by  cyber criminals when targeting  people, rather than system  vulnerabilities) and ransomware  (as the most prolific and potentially  damaging cyber-attack).  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE OF THE 2022 CAMPAIGN  We live in a hyper-connected society, where digital transformation has been accelerated by  the pandemic caused by Covid-19, and technological progress is rapid and unstoppable. These  facts have given cybercriminals a much larger attack surface, therefore it is imperative that  the European society is prepared to deal with such attacks.  The main target audience of the Phishing campaign was people over 45 and up to 65  years of age, who are still employed. These people's everyday lives are largely digital, as  they generally use technology for their professional tasks, but also in their personal sphere, with  mobile phones, tablets, smart devices, etc. This is coupled with an expected low or limited  level of knowledge of the cybersecurity domain and, unfortunately, together these  characteristics render them an ideal target for cyberattacks, as well as the most easily  exploitable entry vector for larger-scale attacks.  In addition, in order to assure that the campaign would achieve to reach this type of audience, it  was designed with a view to creating in them the feeling of \"this could be me\" and empowering  their active involvement in cybersecurity, so that they would become human firewalls for their  organisations and homes.  In the Ransomware behavioural-change campaign, the target audience was 45+ year-old  employees of European companies and organisations. Those are the most exploited entry  points for cyberattacks, as they are unaware of the threats and seem used to delegating  responsibility to the IT Department or higher. This is why the campaign was created in a simple  and understandable language, in order to alert them to a plain message: Anyone in your  company could be hit by ransomware.  Figure 1. 10th Anniversary Logo  The target  audience of the  Phishing  campaign was  people over 45  and up to 65  years of age, who  are still  employed.  The target  audience for the  Ransomware  campaign was 45+  year old  employees or  European  companies and  organisations.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  8  2. CAMPAIGN TARGET & CONTENT  2.1 ECSM 2022 VISION & OBJECTIVES  The mission of all entities that participated in ECSM 2022, was to establish a Cybersecure European space by raising  awareness and providing EU citizens with tools and practical advice that would help them adopt more cybersecure  routines and become “Human Firewalls”, consequently boosting the resilience of their professional place as well.  The key objectives of the 2022 ECSM campaign were to:  • Raise cybersecurity awareness in the European Society and create a more secure European Cyberspace,  among EU citizens and organisations.  • Create and disseminate awareness raising materials that provided the target audience with up-to-date online  security information.  • Coordinate and conduct awareness raising activities and events.  • Encourage continuous behavioural change towards cybersecurity.  • Help reduce the occurrence of cybersecurity attacks, establishing users as elements of defence rather than  vulnerabilities.  • Encourage the delivery of key awareness messages, via optimal channels, audio-visual designs and formats.  • Create engaging content on the chosen topics, suitable for the chosen target audience.  • Make use of efficient monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to assess campaign impact.  • Engage relevant stakeholders and increase the participation of EU Member States, European and  International partners.  • Launch a pre and post-campaign research study in order to assess behavioural change in EU citizens’  cybersecurity posture, as a result of the ECSM campaign.  2.2 ECSM AWARDS: A 2022 NOVELTY  In 2022, ENISA launched a joint action with the national ECSM Coordinators Group: the ECSM  awards. The aim was, on the one hand, to increase visibility of the excellent and creative material  the MS produced in the past years under the ECSM umbrella, and, on the other, to increase  engagement and potential synergies.  MS representatives involved in the process are to vote every year for the most innovative and  impressive materials produced for past ECSM campaigns. Thus, MS were asked to vote from  a list of campaign material submitted to the competition.  The concept was piloted for the 1st time in 2022 and it came to stay. Member States’ national  coordinators were called to submit their candidatures and upload material on three categories:  • Best video  • Best infographic  • Best educational material.  The winning material was translated in all EU languages and promoted anew within the year’s campaign.  ENISA aims to organise this competition every year. The winners - which were announced by VIPs during the ECSM  Campaign kick-off – were:  • Best infographic:  Ireland: Become your own cyber security investigator, announced by European  Commissioner Johannes Hahn  • Best teaching material: Greece: Treasure hunt games for primary school, announced by European  Commission Director for Digital Society, Trust and Cybersecurity, Lorena Boix Alonso.

CAMPAIGN DESIGN  The ECSM Coordinators’ Group decided that the 2022 campaign would focus on Phishing and Ransomware, as  they both are the most prolific threats in Europe and worldwide.  In order to maximize results and focus on the audiences that seem most vulnerable, it was decided that the  campaigns would target people between the ages of 45 and 65. In particular, the Phishing campaign would focus  more on the attacks that these people may suffer in their personal sphere and the Ransomware campaign on  employees, as Ransomware is an attack much more directed towards companies.  To give the campaigns more “packaging”, the (temporary) motto \"Choose To Be Safe Online\" was added to the  other two ECSM slogans/hashtags, \"Think Before You Click\" and “CyberSecMonth\".  Figure 2. Motto Choose To Be Safe Online  3.1 ECSM 2022 THEMES  3.1.1 Phishing  According to the ENISA Threat Landscape 20211, phishing is the most commonly used  attack, on its own and as an entry vector for the perpetration of other, larger cyberattacks. It is  so common that all of us have encountered it at numerous instances in our everyday lives.  Moreover, it is a threat with a wide variety of representation, as it can be sent in numerous  formats, such as email, instant messages, phone calls, or messages on other instant messaging  platforms.  In 2021, the number of phishing attacks tripled, in comparison to the beginning of 2020,  and in the first quarter of 2022 a new record was set, as it was the first quarter in which  the number of phishing attacks exceeded one million (at EU level). What is more, phishing  is responsible for 90% of data breaches and the most common gateway used by cyber  criminals to perpetrate other attacks of greater potential impact, such as ransomware.  3.1.2 Ransomware  The need for the creation of a communication campaign on ransomware lies in the fact that the impact and  consequences of such attacks are very serious and sometimes even lead to the bankruptcy of companies. The  threats posed by ransomware have continued to grow, advance and develop along with technology, and increasingly  pose an even more sophisticated and damaging risk. In 2021 there was a 234% increase of ransomware in Europe  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  The ECSM  2022  Campaign  focused on  Phishing and  Ransomware  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  11  and the average downtime after a ransomware attack is 21 days. The theme was heavily related with the ENISA  Ransomware Threat Landscape published in October 20212.  3.2 ECSM 2022 TARGET AUDIENCE PERSONAS  From the outset, it was clear that the campaign would focus on the so-called “digital immigrants\". These are people  who make extensive use of technology, but whose technology literacy is assumed and expected to be lower than that  of the rest of the population. In addition, not many cybersecurity awareness campaigns focus on them, leaving them  largely untouched.  It was therefore decided that the target audience for the phishing campaign would be the population between 45-65  years of age.  The target audience of the ransomware campaign would also be people 45 to 65, but this time employees of  European companies and large organisations.  3.3 ECSM 2022 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS  Various communication channels were used for this ECSM campaign:  • Landing pages within the ECSM website for each of the campaigns, where all the materials produced were  made available.  • The ECSM website (https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/) for the promotion of its 10th anniversary.  • Organic (Facebook & Twitter) and paid (Facebook, Twitter & YouTube) social media posts for the  promotion of both campaigns and anniversary activities.  • A new hashtag #Choose2BeSafeOnline was added to the existing ones, in order to increase distribution  potential.  • All content was created and produced in English and subtitled in all EU official languages, to increase  the potential impact of the message in non-English-speaking countries.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-for-ransomware-attacks  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  12  4. CAMPAIGN EXECUTION  4.1 CONTENT CALENDAR  The campaign was structured around a content calendar for social networks, which was communicated to the MS  prior to its start, so that they would also follow it alongside ENISA. The first half of October was dedicated to phishing  and the second half to ransomware, with initial posts being made as follows and new content being published daily on  all channels, afterwards.  • 21-28 September: teasers  • 30 September: pre-launch  • 1 October: launch alongside airing of the Anniversary Video  • 2 October: second launch posts.  4.2 LAUNCH OF THE ECSM 2022  On Sep 27, the European Cybersecurity Month kick-off event was organised by the EU Council, titled: “A decade  promoting cybersecurity awareness”. The event was structured around two sessions:  • Growing ransomware trends: are the EU institutions ready?  A high-level political debate on the impact of growing ransomware trends, the preparedness of the EU institutions,  and the forthcoming Cybersecurity Regulation - against the background of increasing hybrid threats.  • Cybersecurity awareness inside the EU institutions  The debate on cybersecurity translates into concrete programmes for the EU institutions, bodies and agencies, as  they aim to increase awareness among their staff. This session focused on testimonials and best practices with an  aim to inspire organisations to up their game.  On Sep 30 a Press release was published simultaneously across the EU, announcing the launch of the European  Cybersecurity Month 2022 and the celebration of its 10th anniversary. Special video messages were delivered by EC  officials: European Commission Vice-President for Promoting our European Way of Life Margaritis Schinas,  European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, European Commissioner for Internal Market and  Services Thierry Breton, European Cabinet of Commissioner for Financial Budget Juhannes Hahn, Director for Digital  Society, Trust and Cybersecurity in Directorate General for Communications Networks Content and Technology (DG  CONNECT) Lorena Boix Alonso and ENISA Executive Director, Juhan Lepassaar, who also announced the winners  of the ECSM Awards.  4.3 CAMPAIGN MATERIALS AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT  ECSM 2022 materials were developed around the “Choose to Be Safe Online” concept, illustrated in the image of  a shield that transforms into a human firewall,  Figure 3. “Choose To Be Safe Online” concept  and included the following:  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/events-gsc/european-cybersecurity-month-2022/ https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/events-gsc/european-cybersecurity-month-2022/  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  13  • Landing pages were created on the ECSM website. They were used as platforms to deploy a story for each  theme and included all related materials.  • Social media images: a series of social media posts and one accompanying video, images, and infographic.  • Infographics: three infographics per theme, providing insight to the current cybersecurity status in Europe.  • Downloadable posters raising awareness on the threats of phishing and ransomware. They were translated  into 24 languages which resulted in a total of 150 versions in both PDF and editable, open format.  • \"Prevention Response for Ransomware Attacks\" downloadable handbook: a comprehensive document  for managers of small and medium sized organizations to distribute to their employees and train them on how to  prevent and deal with a ransomware attack.  • Ambassadors’ kit.  Materials produced per theme:  • 1 main video  • 3 complementary videos (capsules)  • 3 illustrations with statistical data  • 8 illustrations with the main tips to protect oneself against phishing and ransomware  • 3 downloadable posters  • 3 Photos  • 1 quiz  • Infographics  • 1 post linking to the Cyber First Aid map.  Additionally, for the 10-year anniversary:  • A 14-minute video was produced via crowdsourcing testimonials from Member States, EU Agencies and  individuals who contributed to the ECSM over the years.  • A 10th-anniversary badge was added to the ECSM logo.  • Special social media posts.  • Engraved gift and thank-you card.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  14  5. CAMPAIGN EVALUATION  5.1 EVALUATION METHODOLOGY  The ECSM 2022 campaign was evaluated on the basis of the following:  • Member State activities: each Member State provided their campaign “history”, including Partnerships and  Ambassadors, target audience (if different from the general one), all national events and activities within the ECSM  framework, material used, their own results and conclusions, etc.  • ENISA central social media activities: total number of mentions, total number of followers & their  demographic data, top keywords, top hashtags, paid post results, etc.  • ECSM Web Analytics: number of visits, unique visitors, views, actions per visitor, time spent per visit,  number of downloads,  • Events: time, place & theme of national events and activities within the ECSM.  • Media monitoring: each Member State provided statistics for all the channels or media used during their  campaign.  • Evaluation Questionnaire: qualitative assessment of MS perceptions about the ECSM campaign.  5.2 MS QUESTIONNAIRE  Participating Member States were asked to fill-in an 11-question feedback survey as well as data reports, to improve  European Cybersecurity Month efforts and coordination:  1.

Additionally:  • 84% of MS assess that the ECSM campaign had an impact on the reduction of cyber  incidents.  • The majority of MS perceived that the change in attitude after the implementation of  the ECSM campaign was more positive.  • Campaign’s main strength: the materials created and the collaboration between the  MS and ENISA.  • Campaign’s main weakness: contents are very concentrated in October - users need  more materials throughout the year.  • Average score of 7.1 for the effectiveness of the ECSM 2022 campaign to raise the  belief that cybersecurity behaviours can actually prevent cybersecurity threats.  • Average score of 6.2 for campaign effectiveness in changing the perception that  security compliance is a waste of time and not very productive.  5.3 ASSESMENT OF WEB RESULTS  5.3.1 ECSM website  The metrics indicate a very high level of awareness and that all objectives set for the period  were met and exceeded.  • Visits to ECSM website increased over the previous period by an average of 27%,  with the total visits being 31.8% more.  • Visitors stayed 6.7% longer on the ECSM website and the bounce rate was reduced  by almost 12%.  • In October 2022, the ECSM website had 28.3% more page views than the monthly  average of 2021.  • Downloads of materials increased by almost 10% and out links increased by 78%.  • The most visits were made during weekdays.  • 76% of the traffic flow to the ECSM website was generated by social media posts on  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.  • ECSM website: 53% of users were redirected from Facebook, 10% from Twitter,  9.6% from LinkedIn, and 5.7% from YouTube.  5.3.2 Cyber First Aid Map  The ECSM Cyber First Aid Map was included in this year’s campaign too, as it provides users  with information about the organisations to contact in case of a cyber incident, according to their  geolocation. A link to the map was embedded in the landing pages for the two themes.  MS feedback for  the ECSM 2022  Campaign was  positive, with  most variables  scoring above  80%  Users of the  ECSM website  interacted much  more with its  content than  previous year.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  16  Figure 4. Cyber First Aid Map link  5.3.3 Media monitoring  To improve the impact on offline channels, a press release dedicated to the Ten Years of Raising Cyber  Awareness Throughout Europe was published.  This press release had a significant impact in the media, owing to the use of hashtags dedicated to improving  messages.  As a result, some 2,288 appearances in press media were found in the press clipping with a total daily audience of  675,155,981 readers. The impact in these media would have an advertising value of 7.5 million euros.  More facts about the press release:  • Keywords:  A SEO strategy was set originally, containing the keywords below to undermine the text:  − European Cybersecurity Month  − #CyberSecMonth  − #ThinkB4UClick  − #Choose2BeSafeOnline  − ENISA  • Period:  The analysis period used for the follow-up of the press release was approximately two months. It was not limited to  October, i.e. the period immediately after its release but stretched to November as well. With this technique, it was  possible to find a correlation between the increase in the organisation’s shares and the exposure of the press release  on the European Cybersecurity Month website.  • Territories:  The following countries were analysed: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia,  Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,  Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.  • Press Sentiment:  According to the subject matter of the content and the algorithm's capacity to identify details of tone, 947 posts were  identified as positive tone, 1125 were identified as neutral tone and 141 were negative.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/european-cybersecurity-month-2022-ten-years-of-raising-cyber-awareness-throughout-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/european-cybersecurity-month-2022-ten-years-of-raising-cyber-awareness-throughout-europe  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  17  Figure 5.

Social Media Views & Clicks  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  19  5.4 BEHAVIOURAL CHANGE ANALYSIS  In the context of the ECSM 2022 campaign, ENISA launched, for the first time, a pre and post campaign survey  to measure the resulting behavioural change and impact. In brief, the following results and recommendations  were drawn from the study:  Results  • The studied sample reported higher engagement in cybersecurity behaviour (self-reported cybersecurity  behaviour) after the campaign, than that reported by the sample before the campaign.  • Respondents who declared to have seen information related to the campaign’s themes were observed to  score higher on cybersecurity behaviour score than respondents in the pre-campaign phase.  • The higher the intentions towards performing cybersecurity behaviour, the more likely people are to perform it.  • In order to increase vulnerability, it is important to increase awareness about cyber threats and focus on the  efficacy of users’ actions.  • When people think that performing appropriate security behaviours to protect their data is a good idea, a  necessity or beneficial, this translates into a willingness to perform the behaviour and, in the end, to execute it.  • When respondents believed that their immediate environment - such as friends, family, colleagues and  managers - think they should follow cybersecurity guidelines, it makes them more likely to adhere to them.  • Performing cybersecurity behaviour compliant with guidelines depends on people’s perceptions of  cybersecurity.  • People’s perception of how effectively a response can prevent a threat and their confidence in their skills  greatly contributes to the willingness to perform cybersecurity behaviour.  • Normative beliefs were found to be a key factor for cybersecurity behaviour.  • The campaign’s target audience - people over 45 years old – were observed to be significantly more likely to  perform cybersecurity behaviour compared to younger people.  • Cybersecurity behaviour was observed to vary depending on occupation.  • Overall, participants indicated that the campaigns helped protect them from “Phishing” slightly more than  “Ransomware”.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  20  6. CONCLUSIONS &  RECOMMENDATIONS  Upon analysis of the results presented above, the following conclusions were drawn for the ECSM 2022 Campaign.  Of the countries that responded to the survey:  • MS participated broadly in the ECSM, by sharing content and organising different activities.  • Overall feedback from MS was positive, with most variables scoring above 80%.  • Short videos were the type of material that generated the most views and user interactions.  • Users of the ECSM website interacted much more with its content, therefore it is deemed that the target  audience was reached more efficiently.  Regarding social media:  • A sustained growth was observed throughout the campaign.  • Most of the people who accessed the ECSM website were redirected from the social networks. Therefore, it is  considered that dissemination through social media was effective.  • The target audience that was receptive to the messages on the social networks was likewise responsive to the  contents of the website.  Finally, the findings of the behavioural study indicated the factors on which awareness campaigns should forcus, in  order to result in far-reaching cybersecurity behaviour compliance:  • Inform and inspire audiences by providing real-world examples and illustrating the way cyber threats can  affect them, as this helps them understand better and endure being careful and alert in the future.  • Provide practical, concise, and easy to execute instructions and advice that individuals can apply in their  interactions with software, networks, and information infrastructures.  • Facilitate discussion and sharing of information with others, as it was found that nationwide and international  campaigns influence the behavior of indivduals but also of people in organisations.  • Consider various constructs related to cybersecurity behaviour, when designing campaign and awareness  communication, for a comprehensive influence and profound impact.  • Critical investigation needs to be undertaken, at an organisational and national level, to understand barriers to  motivation, e.g., organisational or technological issues, as well as the level of security culture and risk of  insider threat.  • When designing campaigns for behaviour change, one must consider the indirect effects of the campaign  occurring through word of mouth, as well as the measurable self-reported individual behaviour.  None of above factors is sufficient by itself, but their combination can facilitate effective targeting.  ECSM 2022 CAMPAIGN REPORT  March 2023  21  ANNEX  1.

    "abstract": "The campaign was coupled with the commemoration of the ECSM 10th anniversary in 2022 and focused on two of the most prominent threats: 1. Phishing: so that users may detect and react to the most common attack against individuals. 2. Ransomware: so that users become aware of the threat, learn how to identify it and react to it, and realise its severity by getting to know its consequences."

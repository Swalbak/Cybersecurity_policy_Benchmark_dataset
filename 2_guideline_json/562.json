The reform was transposed by most EU Member States halfway 2011.  Article 13a concerns security and integrity of electronic communications networks and services. The  first part of Article 13a requires that providers of networks and services manage security risks and take  appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) of  these networks and services. The second part of Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to report  about significant security breaches and losses of integrity to competent national authorities, who  should report about these security incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Ministries and Electronic Communications National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve  an efficient and harmonised implementation of Article 13a across the EU. The Article 13a Expert Group  now comprises experts from NRAs from all EU countries and some EFTA and EU candidate countries.  Meetings (telephonic or physical) are organized and chaired by technical experts from ENISA. The  European Commission participates as an observer in these meetings. The Article 13a Expert Group  reached consensus about two non-binding technical guidelines for NRAs: the “Technical Guideline on  Incident Reporting” and the “Technical Guideline on Security Measures” (this document).  This document, the Technical Guideline for Security Measures, provides guidance to NRAs about the  technical details of implementing paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a: how to ensure that providers  assess risks and take appropriate security measures. This document contains a list of 25 high-level  security objectives, grouped in 7 domains. Per security objective we list the security measures which  could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. The measures are grouped in 3 levels of  increasing sophistication. We also list types of evidence, which could be taken into account by a  supervisor or an auditor when assessing if security measures are in place. The overall structure of  security objectives and security measures is depicted in the diagram below:  Dx Security domain  Dx Security domain Security measures a. ensure that ... b. have a procedure  c. set a policy ...  SO x: Security objective  ...  ...  Security objective  1  2  3  7 domains 25 security objectives  ...  ...  Evidence · key personnel knows ... · policy/procedure covering... · tools/mechanisms for…  · ...  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  One size does not fit all: Neither the high-level security objectives nor the detailed security measures  should be seen as binding recommendations about which are appropriate security measures for  providers to take. The reason is that the electronic communications sector is very diverse; large  incumbents, small service providers, black fibre operators, virtual mobile network operators, ISPs  offering only DSL, et cetera. In each setting the risks are different and it is up to the providers to assess  the risks and decide which are appropriate security measures to take. This document is intended as a  tool for NRAs who supervise the sector. It could be used as a structure for self-assessments, audits  and audit reports, guidance for providers, or as a mapping to international network and information  security standards used in the electronic communications sector.

This document is drafted by a working group comprising experts from NRAs and representatives of  the EC, supported by technical experts from ENISA (see Preface): the Article 13a Working Group.  Target audience  This document is addressed to experts from national ministries and NRAs in European Member States  tasked with the implementation of Article 13a.  This document may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications sector  and for experts working in the network and information security and cyber security field.  Goal  This document is published by ENISA to provide guidance to NRAs about the security measures  described in paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a.  Versions and changes  ENISA updates this guideline periodically, when necessary, and in agreement with the NRAs.  This version is an update of Version 1.0 of the Guideline on Minimum Security Measures. The security  domains did not change, and also the structure of the high-level security objectives remained the same  (except for minor changes, see below).  List of changes:  · SD5.3 Incident response and escalation processes was combined with SD5.2 Incident  detection capability (now SO17). Hence v2.0 has 25 security objectives, instead of 26 in v1.0.  · Removed quotes and snippets from standards which served as examples.  · Renamed security measures to security objectives.  · Added, per security objective, detailed security measures which could be taken by providers  to reach the security objective, and also desctiptions of evidence which auditors/supervisors  could take into account when assessing if the security measures are in place.  · Added guidance on different methods NRAs could use in their supervision of the security  measures. This replaces the short section on implementation in version 1.0.  · Updated the mapping in Section 6 to the 2013 version of ISO270001/2.  Structure of this document  In Section 2 we summarize the role and objectives of ENISA related to the implementation of Article  13a. In Section 3 we introduce Article 13a, the scope and the terminology used in this document. In  Section 4 we list 25 security objectives, divided in 7 domains, and we provide details about security  measures and evidence. In Section 5 we give guidance for a number of regulatory activities NRAs could  deploy to assess compliance to the security measures required by Article 13a. In Section 6 we provide  a mapping from the security measures in this guideline to some well-known international standards.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  2  2 Background  In this section we summarize the EU policy context and we discuss ENISA’s role and objectives.  EU policy context  This guideline concerns Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by  Directive 2009/140/EC). There are a number of other initiatives (legal or otherwise) addressing the  security of public electronic communications networks and services.  · In 2006, the EC issued a strategy for a secure information society – dialogue, partnership and  empowerment (COM (2006) 251), which was endorsed the next year by the European  Council (Council Resolution 2007/068/01). One of the main actions of the strategy is a multi- stakeholder dialogue on the security and resilience of networks and information systems:  the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).  · In 2009, the EC adopted, in March 2009, a communications and action plan on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), called Protecting Europe from Large Scale  Cyber-Attacks and Disruptions: Enhancing Preparedness, Security and Resilience (COM (2009)  149).  This communication focuses on “prevention, preparedness, and awareness” and  defines an immediate action plan to strengthen the security and resilience of CIIs.  · The Council Conclusion on CIIP issued in May 2011, taking stock of the results achieved since  the adoption of the CIIP action plan in 2009, was launched to strengthen the security and  resilience of vital Information and Communication Technology Infrastructures.  The European Commission has also published a European Cyber Security Strategy and a proposed  directive on network and information security (NIS). The strategy, the directive and speeches from  the EC contain explicit references to Article 13a and they mention the possibility of extending Article  13a to other sectors of the society.  For an overview of several security articles, which address security measures and incident reporting,  we refer to the ENISA paper Cyber incident reporting in the EU which summarizes and compares  Article 13a of the Framework directive, Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, Article 15 of the proposed  e-Trust/e-ID regulation and the reporting requirements in the proposed data protection reform.  ENISA’s role  We briefly describe ENISA’s role and objectives in the implementation of the Framework directive  (2002/21/EC as amended by 2009/140/EC) and Article 13a in particular.  ENISA is mentioned in the preambles of the Framework directive:  · Preamble 44 of the Framework directive asks ENISA to contribute to enhancing the level of  security of electronic communications by, among other things, \"providing expertise and  advice, and promoting the exchange of best practice”.  · Preamble 44 of the Framework directive mentions that ENISA should have the means to  carry out the relevant duties and the powers “to obtain sufficient information to assess the  level of security of networks and services”.  · Preamble 46 of the Framework directive asks ENISA to contribute to the “harmonisation of  security measures by providing expert advice”.  ENISA is also mentioned in Article 13a of the Framework directive:  · Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to, when appropriate, inform NRAs in other  Member States and ENISA about security incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0251en01.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:HTML http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/l33260_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-94_en.htm http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  3  · Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to submit annual summary reports on the received  security notifications to both the European commission and ENISA.  · Article 13a mentions that the European commission may decide to adopt technical  implementing measures with a view to harmonisation of the implementation of paragraphs  1, 2, and 3 of Article 13a. Article 13a mentions that in this case the European commission  will take into account the opinion of ENISA.  ENISA’s objectives  ENISA’s first objective is to implement the incident reporting mandated in Article 13a, i.e. to agree  with the Member States on an efficient implementation of pan-European incident reporting, including  the processes of ad-hoc reporting about cross-border incidents as well as the annual summary  reporting.  Secondly, ENISA aims to support NRAs with the task of ensuring that providers take appropriate  security measures and the supervision activities in general, including collecting incident reports  nationally, following up on incidents, analysing and mitigating common root causes, providing  guidance to the providers, and so on.  In this way ENISA supports an efficient and harmonized implementation of Article 13a across the EU.  Harmonized implementation of legislation is important to create a level playing field and makes it  easier for providers and users to operate across different EU countries.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  4  3 Article 13a and terminology  In this section we introduce the relevant parts of Article 13a and the related terms used in this  document.  3.1 Paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a  For the sake of reference, we reproduce the text of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a here.  “1. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or  publicly available electronic communications services take appropriate technical and organisational  measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services. Having regard  to the state of the art, these measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented.  In particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users  and interconnected networks.  2. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks take all  appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply  of services provided over those networks. […]”  3.2 Terminology  In the interest of brevity, we use the following abbreviations in this document:  · Provider: The term “provider” is used to refer to an “undertaking providing public  communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services”.  · NRA: The term “NRA” is used to refer to the competent authority on Article 13a i.e. the  “national regulatory authority” as mentioned in Article 13a, which could be a ministry, or a  government agency, depending on the national situation.  · Networks and communications services: The term “networks and communications services”  is used to abbreviate the term “public communications networks or publicly available  electronic communications services” as mentioned in Article 13a. This includes telecom  operators, mobile network operators, internet service providers, et cetera.  3.2.1 Security, integrity, continuity  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a contain two different requirements:  · Paragraph 1 requires NRAs to ensure that providers “take appropriate technical and  organisational measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks  and services”, and that they take measures “to prevent and minimise the impact of security  incidents on users and interconnected networks”.  · Paragraph 2 requires NRAs to ensure that providers “take all appropriate steps to guarantee  integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.  The use of the term integrity (of networks1) in the article text may be confusing to some readers. In  technical literature about networks and network inter-connections2, the term integrity is defined as  “the ability of the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and functionality”.  The term integrity in the article text might be called “resilience” or “continuity” in other information  security literature.  1 And not integrity of data.  2 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  5  In this document we address both security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) by providing a  single set of ‘security measures’, which include the “technical and organisational measures” in the  first paragraph and the steps mentioned in the second paragraph of the article.  In this document, to be more in line with the majority of literature on network and information  security, we use the terms “security” and “continuity” to cover these requirements, or simply  “security” (because in most information security literature continuity is seen as an aspect of security).  3.2.2 Security incidents  Article 13a mentions ‘security incidents’, ‘security breaches’ and ‘integrity losses’:  · Paragraph 1 requires “that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of  security incidents on users and interconnected networks”  · Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their  networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.  · Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of  security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services”  In this guideline we only use the term “security incidents” with the following definition:  Security incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the  operation of electronic telecommunications networks and services.  This is the same definition as the one used in the ‘Technical Guidelines on Incident Reporting’3.  3 Note that only a subset of these incidents have to be reported to ENISA and the EC, namely those incidents  that actually had a significant impact on the operation of services.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  6  4 Security measures  In this section we provide a list of 25 security objectives NRAs should take into account when assessing  compliance of providers to Article 13a with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a.  We stress that this guideline is a guideline for NRAs and that it is at the discretion of NRAs as to  whether they mandate or recommend different security objectives, or different security measures,  only some of the security measures and/or additional security measures.  Note that some of the security objectives or security measures may not be relevant or appropriate in  all settings for all types of providers, depending on the type of networks or services offered4.  4.1 Assets in scope and risk assessment  The scope of the security measures is defined as follows.  Assets in scope: All assets of the provider which, when breached and/or failing, can have a negative  impact on the security or continuity of electronic communications networks or services.  Providers should perform risk assessments, specific for their particular setting, to determine which  assets are in scope and which security measures are appropriate. Risk assessments need updating, to  address changes and past incidents, because risks change over time. Note that this guideline does not  address risk assessment in detail. There are several standard methodologies providers could use for  this (see References).  Remark on enterprise risk management: It is good to mention here that there is a lot of information  security literature which focusses on how an organization can manage the information security risks  related to the use of network and information security: the field is called enterprise risk management.  A well-known example is ISO27001. Article 13a, however, only mentions risks for the users who rely on  the networks and communications services provided by the provider, and not the risks for the provider.  This means in practice that, while enterprise risk management methodologies are very helpful, they  cannot be used for Article 13a without adaptation.  4.1.1 Primary and secondary assets  In some literature there is a distinction  between primary assets and secondary  (supporting) assets. In this context (Article  13a) the primary assets are the electronic  communication networks and services  provided by the provider (see diagram to the  right).  In this document when we speak about assets  we mean the secondary assets i.e. the systems  and processes supporting the provision of  electronic communications networks and  services (such as base stations, routers,  registers, power supply, etc.).  4 For example, in the case of black fibre providers certain security measures may not be applicable because these  providers do not directly deal with subscribers and do not have much staff.

Critical assets should (obviously) be protected with priority.  4.1.3 Key personnel  In this document we use the term “key personnel” to refer to the key roles in the organization with  respect to security and continuity. Now providers are not all the same and organizations and job  profiles are different, but typically this would include roles like the CEO, the CIO, the CISO, the business  continuity manager and system administrators of critical systems.  4.1.4 Third parties and outsourcing  In this document we use the term “third parties” to refer to parties (organizations, individuals) the  provider works with to deliver the services, i.e. vendors the provider buys products from, suppliers,  consultants who advise the provider, auditors auditing the provider, companies the provider  outsources work to, and so on5.  Third parties and third party assets are in scope just as if they were assets of the providers. In other  words, even if certain processes are outsourced, the provider remains responsible for ensuring that  appropriate security measures are taken to protect the security and continuity of the communication  networks and services it is providing.  4.2 Structure of the security measures  This document lists 25 security objectives6 which have been derived from a set of international and  national standards that are commonly used by providers in the EU’s electronic communication sector  (see References). For each of the security objectives we list more detailed  security measures which  could be implemented by providers to reach the security objective. Per security objective we also list  detailed evidence which could indicate that the measure is in place. Note that the security measures  or the evidence should not be seen as a baseline or list of minimum requirements for providers (see  the remark below).  The security measures are grouped in 3 different sophistication levels, defined as follows.  Description of sophistication levels  Sophistication level 1 (basic):  · Basic security measures that could be implemented to reach the security objective.  · Evidence that basic measures are in place.  Sophistication level 2 (industry standard):  · Industry standard security measures to reach the objective and an ad-hoc review of the  implementation, following changes or incidents.  · Evidence of industry standard measures and evidence of reviews of the implementation  following changes or incidents.  5 So in this document the term third parties does not refer to customers, the public, or government or regulatory  authorities.  6 In information security governance literature these are also sometimes referred to as control objectives  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  8  Sophistication level 3 (state of the art):  · State of the art (advanced) security measures, and continuous monitoring of implementation,  structural review of implementation, taking into account changes, incidents, tests and  exercises, to proactively improve the implementation of security measures.  · Evidence of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review  process, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security measures.  The levels are cumulative. In other words, at level 2 we do not repeat the security measures and the  evidence for level 1, for the sake of brevity, but they are understood to be included (accumulated).  And similarly at level 3 the security measures are understood to include the ones of levels 1 and 2. If  the measures at level 1 are not (fully) implemented than this could be called level 0, but we do not  explicitly mention level 0 in this document.  The overall structure of the security objectives and security measures is depicted in Figure 1.

SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  Figure 1 Structure of the security objectives and security measures.  Remark about profiles: The levels of sophistication can be used to create profiles of providers, showing  the sophistication of security measures across the board. Such profiles could be used by NRAs, for  example when evaluating the state of implementation of security measures across the sector. We  elaborate on supervision methods in Section 5 and we give an example of two profiles there.  Remark about minimum security measures; Neither the high-level security objectives in this document  nor the detailed security measures should be seen as binding recommendations about which are  appropriate security measures for providers to take. So, for example, the security measures at level 1  are not to be considered “the minimum” for the sector. Risks are different for different providers and  it depends on the specifics (the setting, the type of provider, the type of services offered, the assets in  question, etc.) which security objectives are important and which measures are appropriate.  Remark about separate measures: We list security measures separately per security objective, but this  should not be seen as a recommendation to split activities into separate parts, or to keep separate  documents or files. For example, a single inventory of assets could be used for risk assessment, but also  to support change management and asset management procedures.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  9  4.3 Security objectives and security measures  Below we list 25 high-level security objectives (SO1, SO2, …), grouped in 7 domains (D1, D2, … ). Per  security objective we list security measures which could be implemented by the provider to achieve  the security objective, as well as the type of evidence that could be taken into consideration by a  supervisor or an auditor when assessing if measures are in place (see the previous paragraph).

The most common regulatory activities of NRAs regarding supervision of security measures are 10:  · Mandating or recommending a security standard  · Assessing compliance across the market  · Taking a staged approach to supervision  · Auditing providers (periodically, at random, and/or post-incident)  In the remainder of this section we discuss the technical aspects of each of these activities.  5.1 Mandating or recommending a security standard  There could be several reasons for mandating or recommending a standard of security measures:  · to provide guidance about what security measures should be implemented, for example by  explaining high-level objectives or detailed security measures.  · to provide a terminology for discussing about security objectives or security measures.  · to provide a structure for supervision and auditing, by dividing security in different domains.  · to provide a baseline, i.e. a minimum set of security measures that must be in place, for  example because without basic security measures it may be difficult to conduct an audit,  because key evidence, like logs, records about incidents, et cetera may be missing.  · to provide a mapping between different existing standards, for example, to be able to  compare compliance and audit reports which are based on different standards.  Below we go into detail about the different options.  5.1.1 Mandating versus recommending a security standard  When discussing the supervision of security legislation by government authorities there is often a  discussion about whether or not the government authority should mandate a specific list of security  measures, strongly recommend them, or just recommend them as guidance. One could argue that  mandating a standard would create clarity about what providers need to do to be compliant. On the  other hand, one could also argue that in most settings the sector, the organizations involved, the  technology used, is just too diverse to allow for a single checklist of minimum security measures for  the entire sector. Often only very high-level security standards could be reasonably applied to a wider  number of organizations. Inevitably such high-level standards leave a lot of important technical details  unaddressed. So it is hard to capture all the security requirements of Article 13a comprehensively in  one standard. At the same time for specific settings or specific issues the NRA could mandate specific  security measures to be taken. For instance, an NRA could ask all providers to provide the NRA with a  9 Supervision of security measures is not an easy task, because network and information technology changes  rapidly, because capabilities of attackers change rapidly, and because the effectiveness of security measures  often depends on technical implementation details. In addition, supervision by the NRA is further complicated  by the fact that in most EU countries the electronic communications sector consists of a wide range of different  types of providers, including very small providers, incumbents, black fibre operators, et cetera.  10 We asked NRAs across the EU, via a survey, which are the activities they are deploying or planning to deploy.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  27  contact point in case of contingencies, or ask all providers to have 4 hours of backup power for their  base station controllers.  Note that when mandating security measures for specific aspects, it is important that NRAs discuss  with providers about effectiveness and feasibility beforehand. Such discussions could be triggered by  large incidents or focus  happened in the past period, frequent root causes, and/or other common  issues (for example, about software vulnerabilities in common IT equipment).  Best practices in network and information security are rapidly changing, because information  technology changes rapidly and because the capability of attackers changes rapidly. The NRA is in a  unique role to support and foster the exchange of and discussion about best practices between  experts of different providers. In this way the NRA supports that best practices are adopted across the  sector. Especially providers with less experience and less expertise could benefit greatly from such  discussions and exchanges.  5.1.2 Using the ENISA guideline as a recommendation  NRAs could use this ENISA guideline to provide guidance to providers. The ENISA guideline consists of  25 high level security objectives derived from different standards (see References). To reach the  security objectives, providers should choose appropriate technical security measures. This document  lists detailed security measures which providers could take to reach the security objectives. The  security measures are split in three (sophistication) levels ranging from 1) basic, to 2) industry  standard, to 3) state of the art. Providers should assess the risks to their communications networks  and services to understand which security measures are appropriate.  5.1.3 Using the ENISA guideline as a mapping  Many (especially larger) providers already have a security standard or a security governance  framework in place, often based on international standards. This ENISA guideline could be used as a  neutral mapping to different standards in use by the industry. Such a mapping would allow providers  to continue use existing international standards, and it would avoid incurring unnecessary costs for  providers when complying with the requirements of Article 13a.  In practice, for example, providers could show compliance to Article 13a by providing audit reports or  certification against existing industry standards, combined with a mapping from these standards to  this ENISA guideline. In Section 6 we provide an example of such a mapping to some well-known  international security standards.  5.1.4 Using existing national or international standards or best practices  NRAs could refer to existing national or international standards or requirements, either as a baseline  requirement or as a recommendation. An overview of standards widely used in the industry is included  in the section References. NRAs should take into account national circumstances when choosing an  appropriate set of standards or best practices. We would like to make three remarks in this regard:  · NRAs should take into account that some (especially the large) providers may operate in  several EU countries, and that it would be cumbersome for these providers to adopt  different standards in different countries. In this respect it could be useful to allow providers  to use international standards which are widely used across the EU and in this way reduce  compliance costs for these providers.  · In most countries the electronic communications sector is large (hundreds of providers) and  contains both large providers (>10% of market share) and very small ones (<1% of market  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  28  share)11. NRAs should also take into account the differences between the providers in their  country. What might work for large providers may well be overwhelming for smaller  providers, and vice versa, what might work for one provider might be inappropriate for  another provider.  · Finally, NRAs should take into account that best practices in network and information  security are rapidly changing, because information technology changes rapidly and because  the capability of attackers changes rapidly. This makes it hard to capture the high-level  security requirement of Article 13a comprehensively in a list of detailed security measures.  In this light,  NRAs should focus first on supervising that providers assess risks and  proactively take appropriate security measures, rather than on trying to cast detailed  security measures in stone.  5.2 Assessing compliance across the market  Self-assessments could be used to get an overview of the kind of security measures taken by providers,  across the sector. The security objectives and measures listed in Section 4 can be used directly in self- assessment forms. The sophistication levels (see Section 4) would allow providers to indicate, per  security objective, what kind of security measures are in place. Used in this way the sophistication  levels would yield a profile of a provider, allowing for a quick comparison between providers across  the sector.  Figure 2: Two different profiles with different sophistication of measures for each security objective.  In figure 2 we show two example profiles in one diagram. The vertical axis spans the sophistication  levels and the horizontal axis spans the security objectives. Dark red indicates a provider with more  sophisticated security measures. The light red indicates a provider with less sophisticated security  measures. The difference in sophistication could be explained, for example, by a difference in the type  of communication services or networks being offered by the two providers.  Depending on the motivation behind the self –assessment the NRA could focus on a subset of security  objectives. For example, an NRA could be interested in a domain like business continuity or specific  security objectives around change management.  NRAs could also restrict self-assessments to a subset of the sector, for instance providers with a certain  number of users (more than 10% market share e.g.), a certain service (mobile networks, e.g.), or  providers offering certain critical services (communications for ports and airports e.g.).  11 We asked NRAs across the EU, via a survey, about the type of providers in their sector, looking at market share.  0  1  2  3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  So p  h is  ti ca  ti o  n  le  ve l  o f  se cu  ri ty  m ea  su re  s  Security objectives  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  29  We provide two simplified examples of how an NRA could set up a self-assessment form. In the first  example, the NRA assesses security measures across all providers in the sector, but with a focus on a  subset of the security objectives.  Example: The NRA of country D has organized a self-assessment focussed on governance and risk  management (domain D1 in the ENISA guideline). Self-assessment forms are emailed to all  providers:  Indicate your estimate market share: (choose from <1%, >10%, >10%)  Indicate which service you are offering:  (fixed/mobile telephony, fixed/mobile internet)  Per security objective, indicate the level of sophistication and if you can produce evidence.  SO1: Information security policy  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO2: Governance and risk management framework  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO3: Security roles and responsibilities  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO4: Managing third party networks or services  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  In the second example the NRA focusses on a subset of security measures and a subset of providers:  Example: The NRA in country E wants to focus on the issues behind a number of large mobile  network outages in the past year which are caused by power cuts, cable cuts, and natural disasters.  The NRA focusses on the security measures which are most relevant in this context. Self-assessment  forms are sent only to mobile network operators with large market share (>10%). Questions are a  combination of multiple choice and open questions for a description of security measures in place,  and open questions for the type of evidence that the provider can produce to substantiate answers.  For each of the security objectives SO9 (Physical and environmental security), SO10 (Security of  supplies), SO19 (Service continuity strategy and contingency plans), SO20 (Disaster recovery  capabilities), SO22 (Exercise contingency plans), indicate the level of sophistication, on a scale  from 0 to 4 (0 none, 1 basic, 2 industry standard, 3 state-of-the-art):  Describe the security measures in place to reach the objective: (max 200 words)  Describe the evidence you could provide to the NRA which could substantiate that measures are in  place: (0 none, 1 internal documentation, 2 audit report from external auditor)  Remark about confidentiality: Self-assessment results or profiles could be sensitive and it is important  to ensure confidentiality of results from other providers and/or the public. It is important to explain  clearly the purpose of the assessment (for example, by explaining that there are no regulatory  consequences) and to give explicit guarantees to providers about confidentiality of the results.  5.3 Taking a staged approach  Depending on the national circumstances, NRAs might want to adopt a staged approach in supervising  (and enforcing) compliance to the security requirements of Article 13a. For example, in case some  providers do not (yet) have appropriate security measures in place (or if they cannot provide evidence  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  30  of this), NRAs might want to give providers some time to comply, in stages. NRAs could use this  guideline to adopt a staged approach. We discuss some possible options for staging:  · Services or assets in scope: One could first focus on a subset of services (for example mobile  networks) or a subset of assets (for example, core network), and deal with other services  later.  Example: The NRA in country A wants to focus first on the mobile networks, because they  are (nationally) the most critical. The NRA starts with a self-assessment across providers of  mobile networks. The scope of the assessment is ‘assets supporting mobile networks’. Other  services are out of scope initially, as well as providers who do not offer mobile telephony  networks.  · Providers in scope: One could first focus on a subset of providers, for example providers  with a large market share, and look at other providers at a later stage.  Example: The NRA in country B wants to focus first on the providers with large market share,  because here a lot of users are at stake. The NRA starts with collecting self-assessment  reports from the main providers (>10% of market share). The survey is followed up by a  series of workshops where the main causes of incidents are discussed. Next year the NRA  will start a separate supervision program for smaller providers (focussed more on guidance).  · Security domains: One could first focus on a subset of security objectives, business  continuity for example, and focus on other objectives at a later stage.  Example: The NRA in country C wants to focus first on the main incidents, taking into  account the incidents reported by providers. Since last year in country A the incidents were  mostly due to natural disasters, in the supervision the NRA focusses first on the measures  SO9, SO10, SO19, SO20, SO22. The NRA will address other security measures at a later stage.  · Sophistication levels and baselines:  NRAs could first focus on ensuring that all providers  have taken the basic security measures, for example level 1 as defined in this guideline, and  only later focus on ensuring that providers take more sophisticated security measures. We  should stress here that such an approach would have limitations: particularly when the  sector has both large and small providers: For large providers basic security measures may  be insufficient, while for small providers they could be more than enough. It would be better  to take differences across the sector into account and define different baselines for  providers of different size.  Example: The NRA in country D defines two profiles as baselines.  o The first profile contains the basic security measures for only the domains D1  Governance and risk management, D2 Human resource security, D3 Security of  systems and facilities, – it is the baseline for small providers (<10% market share.  o The second profile contains  industry standard security measures for all domains  (D1, … D7)– it is the baseline for large providers (>10% of market share).  At a later stage the NRA will review the profiles, and where needed raise the requirements  in some areas or define different baselines for other types of providers (IXPs e.g.).  5.4 Auditing providers  Depending on the setting, NRAs might want to require providers to undergo an audit. Depending on  the setting and the goal of auditing different types of audits may be needed. In this section we discuss  different options for auditing providers.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  31  Note that auditing is not always easy because network and information systems are often complex.  To understand if specific subsystems are working correctly, an auditor may need to have deep  knowledge and expertise: in security the devil is in the details. To give one simple example: An auditor  may find there is a firewall in place to protect certain systems, but the detailed firewall rules determine  greatly the effectiveness of the firewall. One rule with one mistake may make the entire firewall  useless.  Remark about audit costs: NRAs should take into account the costs of third-party audits for providers,  particularly the smaller providers. Self-assessments (see previous section) may be a more light-weight  approach.  Remark about efficiency of audits: A frequent complaint from organizations subject to information  security audits is that auditing often forces them to generate a lot of paper work, and that this is not  only useless but that it also diverts resources from the actual task at hand: making the network and  information systems secure. NRAs should take into account that some providers are already partaking  in compliance or certification programs (voluntarily or in the context of different legislation) and are  already undergoing (internal or external) audits. If auditing is needed, it is important to leverage where  possible existing audit reports and compliance evidence.  Remark about language and international operators: When requesting documentation or evidence  from providers, NRAs should take into account that providers may keep certain relevant  documentation (manuals, policies, procedures, et cetera) in the English language for efficiency reasons,  because the provider operates in several countries or because the operator employs personnel from  abroad.  5.4.1 Assessment types  An audit involves different types of assessments, for example a review of security policies or an  interview with the CISO about contingency planning. Audits usually consist of a combination of  different types of assessments. We discuss the different types below:  · Document review: Document review is essential in any audit. Relevant documents may  include descriptions of policies, roles and responsibilities, descriptions of processes and  procedures, systems architecture and design, test procedures and actual test results.  Chapter 4 of this guideline includes descriptions of evidence which could be considered  when assessing the implementation of security measures.  · Interviews: In addition to document review, a lot of information may be collected by  interviewing service provider employees. At small providers it may be enough to speak to  one or two persons with commercial and technical responsibility. At large providers, typical  roles to be interviewed are C-level managers (CIO), chief security officers (CSO or CISO),  tactical/operational security officers, NOC managers, internal CERT team, product managers,  and system administrators responsible for critical processes or systems.  · System evaluation: Besides documentation, certification, and interviews, the ultimate check  to see if the networks and information systems are secure, and if policy/procedures are  being applied in practice, is by inspecting or testing the systems itself. In some settings  system review may be needed, for example to understand how a security incident could  have happened. System evaluation should focus on critical systems because it can be time- consuming.  5.4.2 Auditor types  Auditing can be carried out by different parties.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  32  · Self-assessment: In self-assessments there is really no auditor, but the personnel of the  provider assesses and reports about compliance. Although self-assessment reports may be  biased, they can provide useful information for providers and NRAs. An advantage of self- assessments is that self-assessments are relatively cheap for providers. Earlier in this  document, in  Section 5.2, we discuss self-assessments in more detail.  · Internal auditor: In large organizations, a provider could ask an internal security role or  internal audit department to do an audit of certain systems or parts of the organization.  Compared to self-assessments, an internal auditor may be less biased. An advantage is that  internal auditors often know the organization inside out. Also internal auditors could more  easily leverage the deep knowledge about the network and information systems at the  provider.  · External auditor: An audit report from an external auditor is even less biased. The only issue  here may be that the external auditor may not know all the details about the organization  and/or the network and information systems. This would make the entire audit more costly,  because on the one hand the external auditor would need to dedicate a lot of time to study  the setting and systems at the provider, and the provider would also need to dedicate a lot  of time to providing the necessary information to the auditor.  · NRA as auditor: The NRA could carry out an audit of a provider, by using internal staff with  auditing expertise, or by outsourcing the auditing to an auditing firm.  · Certifying auditor: In certification a licensed auditor checks compliance to a specific  standard. The audit report results in a certificate of compliance issued by a certifying  authority. For example it is quite common for large providers to be ISO270001 certified.  Certification is often refreshed yearly, following a yearly re-audit. NRAs could require  certification, and ask providers to submit their certificates as a way to show compliance. By  requiring certification  · Specialist auditor: In special cases the NRA may want to designate a specific auditor, for a  specific purpose or following a specific incident. For example, an NRA could mandate  providers to undergo a security scan of systems by a security scanning specialist.  · Pool of auditors: The NRA could designate a pool of external auditors. Criteria for auditors  could be based on past experience (a track record of audits, or security tests) or be based on  examination criteria. For example, NRAs could start with a list of licensed auditors12 and  offer them a yearly training which focusses on Article 13a requirements for the sector, in this  way creating a pool of auditors.  5.4.3 Audit timing and objectives  The frequency and objectives of auditing varies. We distinguish two types of audits.  · Preventive audits: Preventive audits are usually done at fixed intervals, periodically. In the  case of certification (see above) audits are carried out yearly or bi-yearly. Preventive audits  often do not have a specific scope, however it is good practice to set-up preventive periodic  audits according to a multi-year plan and focus first on certain (important) issues and only  later on other issues in subsequent audits. The frequency of auditing should take into  account that providers may need some time to address deficiencies found in previous audits.  12 In most countries, for example, there are organizations that license auditors to carry out IT audits.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  33  Example: The NRA in country H mandates providers to undergo yearly (preventive) audits by  3rd party auditors. To simplify matters and to reduce the burden for providers, the NRA  works according to a 3 year supervision plan, focussing on urgent issues first: In the first year  the scope of audits is restricted to business continuity, natural disasters and power cuts  (measures SM9, SM10, SM19, SM20, SM22). In the second year the focus is on the storage  and retention of customer data. In the third year all security measures will be audited.  · Post-incident audits: Post-incident auditing by an NRA is usually done ad-hoc, depending on  the type of incident and the setting. Post-incident audits have a specific focus – and usually  they are aimed at assessing if security measures are in place to prevent the incident from re- occurring. The audit in this case has a specific scope (the services affected by the incident,  the assets affected) and regards specific security measures (measures failing during the  incident, or measures which could prevent re-occurrence).  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  34  6 Mapping to international standards  6.1 It is important to stress that the security measures described in this  document have been derived from existing international network and  information security standards. This guideline is not intended to replace  existing standards or frameworks in use by providers. Providers could  map the standards they use (internally) to the security measures in  Section 4, and in this way show compliance with Article 13a. In this  section we give two examples of such a mapping. Mapping security  domains  Below, as an example, we map the security domains of Section 4 to a number of international  standards frequently used by providers. We map to the following standards:  · ISO 27001:2013, a standard for information security management,  · ISO 27002:2013, a catalogue of information security controls,  · ISO 27005:2011, a standard for information security risk management, and,  · ISO 22301:2012, a standard for business continuity management.  Security domains Addressed in  Details  D1: Governance and  risk management  ISO 27001,  ISO 27002, and  ISO 27005.  ISO 27001 provides a standard for governance of  information security risks.  ISO 27005 provides a standard for risk management.  ISO 27002 Chapter 5 covers Information security  policies.  ISO 27002 Chapter 7 covers information security roles  and responsibilities.  ISO 27002 Chapter 15 covers relationships with  suppliers.  D2: Human resources  security  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 7 covers background screening,  information security roles and responsibilities, security  knowledge and training, and personnel changes.  D3: Security of  systems and facilities  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 11 covers  physical and  environmental security.  ISO 27002 Chapter 9 covers access control to  information systems and facilities.  ISO 27002 Chapter 13 covers network security.  D4: Operations  management  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 12 covers operational procedures  and change management.  ISO27002 Chapter 8 covers asset management.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  35  D5: Incident  management  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 16 covers management of  information security incidents, as well as  communications about security events.  D6: Business  continuity  management  ISO 22301 ISO 22301 covers Business Continuity Management  D7: Monitoring and  security testing  ISO 27002  Monitoring is covered in ISO 27002 Chapters 12 and  15. Security testing and compliance reviews are  covered in ISO 27002 Chapters 14 and 18.  We have used ISO standards in this example, but a similar mapping could be made to other national  or international standards. For example, the mapping would look similar if, instead of ISO27001 and  ISO27005, we would map to the ITU standards X.1051 (information security management) and X.1055  (risk management).  6.2 Mapping security objectives  One could also make a more detailed mapping. Below, as an example, we map the security objectives  in Section 4 to individual control objectives in the annex of ISO 27001:2013.

The reform was transposed by most EU Member States halfway 2011.  Article 13a concerns security and integrity of electronic communications networks and services. The  first part of Article 13a requires that providers of networks and services manage security risks and take  appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) of  these networks and services. The second part of Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to report  about significant security breaches and losses of integrity to competent national authorities, who  should report about these security incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Ministries and Electronic Communications National  Regulatory Authorities (NRAs), initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve  an efficient and harmonised implementation of Article 13a across the EU. The Article 13a Expert Group  now comprises experts from NRAs from all EU countries and some EFTA and EU candidate countries.  Meetings (telephonic or physical) are organized and chaired by technical experts from ENISA. The  European Commission participates as an observer in these meetings. The Article 13a Expert Group  reached consensus about two non-binding technical guidelines for NRAs: the “Technical Guideline on  Incident Reporting” and the “Technical Guideline on Security Measures” (this document).  This document, the Technical Guideline for Security Measures, provides guidance to NRAs about the  technical details of implementing paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a: how to ensure that providers  assess risks and take appropriate security measures. This document contains a list of 25 high-level  security objectives, grouped in 7 domains. Per security objective we list the security measures which  could be taken by providers to reach the security objective. The measures are grouped in 3 levels of  increasing sophistication. We also list types of evidence, which could be taken into account by a  supervisor or an auditor when assessing if security measures are in place. The overall structure of  security objectives and security measures is depicted in the diagram below:  Dx Security domain  Dx Security domain Security measures a. ensure that ... b. have a procedure  c. set a policy ...  SO x: Security objective  ...  ...  Security objective  1  2  3  7 domains 25 security objectives  ...  ...  Evidence · key personnel knows ... · policy/procedure covering... · tools/mechanisms for…  · ...  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  One size does not fit all: Neither the high-level security objectives nor the detailed security measures  should be seen as binding recommendations about which are appropriate security measures for  providers to take. The reason is that the electronic communications sector is very diverse; large  incumbents, small service providers, black fibre operators, virtual mobile network operators, ISPs  offering only DSL, et cetera. In each setting the risks are different and it is up to the providers to assess  the risks and decide which are appropriate security measures to take. This document is intended as a  tool for NRAs who supervise the sector. It could be used as a structure for self-assessments, audits  and audit reports, guidance for providers, or as a mapping to international network and information  security standards used in the electronic communications sector.

This document is drafted by a working group comprising experts from NRAs and representatives of  the EC, supported by technical experts from ENISA (see Preface): the Article 13a Working Group.  Target audience  This document is addressed to experts from national ministries and NRAs in European Member States  tasked with the implementation of Article 13a.  This document may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications sector  and for experts working in the network and information security and cyber security field.  Goal  This document is published by ENISA to provide guidance to NRAs about the security measures  described in paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a.  Versions and changes  ENISA updates this guideline periodically, when necessary, and in agreement with the NRAs.  This version is an update of Version 1.0 of the Guideline on Minimum Security Measures. The security  domains did not change, and also the structure of the high-level security objectives remained the same  (except for minor changes, see below).  List of changes:  · SD5.3 Incident response and escalation processes was combined with SD5.2 Incident  detection capability (now SO17). Hence v2.0 has 25 security objectives, instead of 26 in v1.0.  · Removed quotes and snippets from standards which served as examples.  · Renamed security measures to security objectives.  · Added, per security objective, detailed security measures which could be taken by providers  to reach the security objective, and also desctiptions of evidence which auditors/supervisors  could take into account when assessing if the security measures are in place.  · Added guidance on different methods NRAs could use in their supervision of the security  measures. This replaces the short section on implementation in version 1.0.  · Updated the mapping in Section 6 to the 2013 version of ISO270001/2.  Structure of this document  In Section 2 we summarize the role and objectives of ENISA related to the implementation of Article  13a. In Section 3 we introduce Article 13a, the scope and the terminology used in this document. In  Section 4 we list 25 security objectives, divided in 7 domains, and we provide details about security  measures and evidence. In Section 5 we give guidance for a number of regulatory activities NRAs could  deploy to assess compliance to the security measures required by Article 13a. In Section 6 we provide  a mapping from the security measures in this guideline to some well-known international standards.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  2  2 Background  In this section we summarize the EU policy context and we discuss ENISA’s role and objectives.  EU policy context  This guideline concerns Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as amended by  Directive 2009/140/EC). There are a number of other initiatives (legal or otherwise) addressing the  security of public electronic communications networks and services.  · In 2006, the EC issued a strategy for a secure information society – dialogue, partnership and  empowerment (COM (2006) 251), which was endorsed the next year by the European  Council (Council Resolution 2007/068/01). One of the main actions of the strategy is a multi- stakeholder dialogue on the security and resilience of networks and information systems:  the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP).  · In 2009, the EC adopted, in March 2009, a communications and action plan on Critical  Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), called Protecting Europe from Large Scale  Cyber-Attacks and Disruptions: Enhancing Preparedness, Security and Resilience (COM (2009)  149).  This communication focuses on “prevention, preparedness, and awareness” and  defines an immediate action plan to strengthen the security and resilience of CIIs.  · The Council Conclusion on CIIP issued in May 2011, taking stock of the results achieved since  the adoption of the CIIP action plan in 2009, was launched to strengthen the security and  resilience of vital Information and Communication Technology Infrastructures.  The European Commission has also published a European Cyber Security Strategy and a proposed  directive on network and information security (NIS). The strategy, the directive and speeches from  the EC contain explicit references to Article 13a and they mention the possibility of extending Article  13a to other sectors of the society.  For an overview of several security articles, which address security measures and incident reporting,  we refer to the ENISA paper Cyber incident reporting in the EU which summarizes and compares  Article 13a of the Framework directive, Article 4 of the e-Privacy directive, Article 15 of the proposed  e-Trust/e-ID regulation and the reporting requirements in the proposed data protection reform.  ENISA’s role  We briefly describe ENISA’s role and objectives in the implementation of the Framework directive  (2002/21/EC as amended by 2009/140/EC) and Article 13a in particular.  ENISA is mentioned in the preambles of the Framework directive:  · Preamble 44 of the Framework directive asks ENISA to contribute to enhancing the level of  security of electronic communications by, among other things, \"providing expertise and  advice, and promoting the exchange of best practice”.  · Preamble 44 of the Framework directive mentions that ENISA should have the means to  carry out the relevant duties and the powers “to obtain sufficient information to assess the  level of security of networks and services”.  · Preamble 46 of the Framework directive asks ENISA to contribute to the “harmonisation of  security measures by providing expert advice”.  ENISA is also mentioned in Article 13a of the Framework directive:  · Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to, when appropriate, inform NRAs in other  Member States and ENISA about security incidents.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0251en01.pdf http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:HTML http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/l33260_en.htm http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0149:FIN:EN:PDF http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/11/st10/st10299.en11.pdf http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-94_en.htm http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting-in-the-eu  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  3  · Paragraph 3 of Article 13a requires NRAs to submit annual summary reports on the received  security notifications to both the European commission and ENISA.  · Article 13a mentions that the European commission may decide to adopt technical  implementing measures with a view to harmonisation of the implementation of paragraphs  1, 2, and 3 of Article 13a. Article 13a mentions that in this case the European commission  will take into account the opinion of ENISA.  ENISA’s objectives  ENISA’s first objective is to implement the incident reporting mandated in Article 13a, i.e. to agree  with the Member States on an efficient implementation of pan-European incident reporting, including  the processes of ad-hoc reporting about cross-border incidents as well as the annual summary  reporting.  Secondly, ENISA aims to support NRAs with the task of ensuring that providers take appropriate  security measures and the supervision activities in general, including collecting incident reports  nationally, following up on incidents, analysing and mitigating common root causes, providing  guidance to the providers, and so on.  In this way ENISA supports an efficient and harmonized implementation of Article 13a across the EU.  Harmonized implementation of legislation is important to create a level playing field and makes it  easier for providers and users to operate across different EU countries.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  4  3 Article 13a and terminology  In this section we introduce the relevant parts of Article 13a and the related terms used in this  document.  3.1 Paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a  For the sake of reference, we reproduce the text of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a here.  “1. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or  publicly available electronic communications services take appropriate technical and organisational  measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services. Having regard  to the state of the art, these measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented.  In particular, measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users  and interconnected networks.  2. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks take all  appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply  of services provided over those networks. […]”  3.2 Terminology  In the interest of brevity, we use the following abbreviations in this document:  · Provider: The term “provider” is used to refer to an “undertaking providing public  communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services”.  · NRA: The term “NRA” is used to refer to the competent authority on Article 13a i.e. the  “national regulatory authority” as mentioned in Article 13a, which could be a ministry, or a  government agency, depending on the national situation.  · Networks and communications services: The term “networks and communications services”  is used to abbreviate the term “public communications networks or publicly available  electronic communications services” as mentioned in Article 13a. This includes telecom  operators, mobile network operators, internet service providers, et cetera.  3.2.1 Security, integrity, continuity  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a contain two different requirements:  · Paragraph 1 requires NRAs to ensure that providers “take appropriate technical and  organisational measures to appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks  and services”, and that they take measures “to prevent and minimise the impact of security  incidents on users and interconnected networks”.  · Paragraph 2 requires NRAs to ensure that providers “take all appropriate steps to guarantee  integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.  The use of the term integrity (of networks1) in the article text may be confusing to some readers. In  technical literature about networks and network inter-connections2, the term integrity is defined as  “the ability of the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and functionality”.  The term integrity in the article text might be called “resilience” or “continuity” in other information  security literature.  1 And not integrity of data.  2 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  5  In this document we address both security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) by providing a  single set of ‘security measures’, which include the “technical and organisational measures” in the  first paragraph and the steps mentioned in the second paragraph of the article.  In this document, to be more in line with the majority of literature on network and information  security, we use the terms “security” and “continuity” to cover these requirements, or simply  “security” (because in most information security literature continuity is seen as an aspect of security).  3.2.2 Security incidents  Article 13a mentions ‘security incidents’, ‘security breaches’ and ‘integrity losses’:  · Paragraph 1 requires “that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of  security incidents on users and interconnected networks”  · Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their  networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.  · Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of  security or loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services”  In this guideline we only use the term “security incidents” with the following definition:  Security incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the  operation of electronic telecommunications networks and services.  This is the same definition as the one used in the ‘Technical Guidelines on Incident Reporting’3.  3 Note that only a subset of these incidents have to be reported to ENISA and the EC, namely those incidents  that actually had a significant impact on the operation of services.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  6  4 Security measures  In this section we provide a list of 25 security objectives NRAs should take into account when assessing  compliance of providers to Article 13a with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a.  We stress that this guideline is a guideline for NRAs and that it is at the discretion of NRAs as to  whether they mandate or recommend different security objectives, or different security measures,  only some of the security measures and/or additional security measures.  Note that some of the security objectives or security measures may not be relevant or appropriate in  all settings for all types of providers, depending on the type of networks or services offered4.  4.1 Assets in scope and risk assessment  The scope of the security measures is defined as follows.  Assets in scope: All assets of the provider which, when breached and/or failing, can have a negative  impact on the security or continuity of electronic communications networks or services.  Providers should perform risk assessments, specific for their particular setting, to determine which  assets are in scope and which security measures are appropriate. Risk assessments need updating, to  address changes and past incidents, because risks change over time. Note that this guideline does not  address risk assessment in detail. There are several standard methodologies providers could use for  this (see References).  Remark on enterprise risk management: It is good to mention here that there is a lot of information  security literature which focusses on how an organization can manage the information security risks  related to the use of network and information security: the field is called enterprise risk management.  A well-known example is ISO27001. Article 13a, however, only mentions risks for the users who rely on  the networks and communications services provided by the provider, and not the risks for the provider.  This means in practice that, while enterprise risk management methodologies are very helpful, they  cannot be used for Article 13a without adaptation.  4.1.1 Primary and secondary assets  In some literature there is a distinction  between primary assets and secondary  (supporting) assets. In this context (Article  13a) the primary assets are the electronic  communication networks and services  provided by the provider (see diagram to the  right).  In this document when we speak about assets  we mean the secondary assets i.e. the systems  and processes supporting the provision of  electronic communications networks and  services (such as base stations, routers,  registers, power supply, etc.).  4 For example, in the case of black fibre providers certain security measures may not be applicable because these  providers do not directly deal with subscribers and do not have much staff.

Critical assets should (obviously) be protected with priority.  4.1.3 Key personnel  In this document we use the term “key personnel” to refer to the key roles in the organization with  respect to security and continuity. Now providers are not all the same and organizations and job  profiles are different, but typically this would include roles like the CEO, the CIO, the CISO, the business  continuity manager and system administrators of critical systems.  4.1.4 Third parties and outsourcing  In this document we use the term “third parties” to refer to parties (organizations, individuals) the  provider works with to deliver the services, i.e. vendors the provider buys products from, suppliers,  consultants who advise the provider, auditors auditing the provider, companies the provider  outsources work to, and so on5.  Third parties and third party assets are in scope just as if they were assets of the providers. In other  words, even if certain processes are outsourced, the provider remains responsible for ensuring that  appropriate security measures are taken to protect the security and continuity of the communication  networks and services it is providing.  4.2 Structure of the security measures  This document lists 25 security objectives6 which have been derived from a set of international and  national standards that are commonly used by providers in the EU’s electronic communication sector  (see References). For each of the security objectives we list more detailed  security measures which  could be implemented by providers to reach the security objective. Per security objective we also list  detailed evidence which could indicate that the measure is in place. Note that the security measures  or the evidence should not be seen as a baseline or list of minimum requirements for providers (see  the remark below).  The security measures are grouped in 3 different sophistication levels, defined as follows.  Description of sophistication levels  Sophistication level 1 (basic):  · Basic security measures that could be implemented to reach the security objective.  · Evidence that basic measures are in place.  Sophistication level 2 (industry standard):  · Industry standard security measures to reach the objective and an ad-hoc review of the  implementation, following changes or incidents.  · Evidence of industry standard measures and evidence of reviews of the implementation  following changes or incidents.  5 So in this document the term third parties does not refer to customers, the public, or government or regulatory  authorities.  6 In information security governance literature these are also sometimes referred to as control objectives  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  8  Sophistication level 3 (state of the art):  · State of the art (advanced) security measures, and continuous monitoring of implementation,  structural review of implementation, taking into account changes, incidents, tests and  exercises, to proactively improve the implementation of security measures.  · Evidence of state of the art (advanced) implementation, evidence of a structural review  process, and evidence of pro-active steps to improve the implementation of security measures.  The levels are cumulative. In other words, at level 2 we do not repeat the security measures and the  evidence for level 1, for the sake of brevity, but they are understood to be included (accumulated).  And similarly at level 3 the security measures are understood to include the ones of levels 1 and 2. If  the measures at level 1 are not (fully) implemented than this could be called level 0, but we do not  explicitly mention level 0 in this document.  The overall structure of the security objectives and security measures is depicted in Figure 1.

SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  SO x: Security objective  Figure 1 Structure of the security objectives and security measures.  Remark about profiles: The levels of sophistication can be used to create profiles of providers, showing  the sophistication of security measures across the board. Such profiles could be used by NRAs, for  example when evaluating the state of implementation of security measures across the sector. We  elaborate on supervision methods in Section 5 and we give an example of two profiles there.  Remark about minimum security measures; Neither the high-level security objectives in this document  nor the detailed security measures should be seen as binding recommendations about which are  appropriate security measures for providers to take. So, for example, the security measures at level 1  are not to be considered “the minimum” for the sector. Risks are different for different providers and  it depends on the specifics (the setting, the type of provider, the type of services offered, the assets in  question, etc.) which security objectives are important and which measures are appropriate.  Remark about separate measures: We list security measures separately per security objective, but this  should not be seen as a recommendation to split activities into separate parts, or to keep separate  documents or files. For example, a single inventory of assets could be used for risk assessment, but also  to support change management and asset management procedures.

In this section we discuss the technical details of supervising that  providers take appropriate security measures9.  The most common regulatory activities of NRAs regarding supervision of security measures are 10:  · Mandating or recommending a security standard  · Assessing compliance across the market  · Taking a staged approach to supervision  · Auditing providers (periodically, at random, and/or post-incident)  In the remainder of this section we discuss the technical aspects of each of these activities.  5.1 Mandating or recommending a security standard  There could be several reasons for mandating or recommending a standard of security measures:  · to provide guidance about what security measures should be implemented, for example by  explaining high-level objectives or detailed security measures.  · to provide a terminology for discussing about security objectives or security measures.  · to provide a structure for supervision and auditing, by dividing security in different domains.  · to provide a baseline, i.e. a minimum set of security measures that must be in place, for  example because without basic security measures it may be difficult to conduct an audit,  because key evidence, like logs, records about incidents, et cetera may be missing.  · to provide a mapping between different existing standards, for example, to be able to  compare compliance and audit reports which are based on different standards.  Below we go into detail about the different options.  5.1.1 Mandating versus recommending a security standard  When discussing the supervision of security legislation by government authorities there is often a  discussion about whether or not the government authority should mandate a specific list of security  measures, strongly recommend them, or just recommend them as guidance. One could argue that  mandating a standard would create clarity about what providers need to do to be compliant. On the  other hand, one could also argue that in most settings the sector, the organizations involved, the  technology used, is just too diverse to allow for a single checklist of minimum security measures for  the entire sector. Often only very high-level security standards could be reasonably applied to a wider  number of organizations. Inevitably such high-level standards leave a lot of important technical details  unaddressed. So it is hard to capture all the security requirements of Article 13a comprehensively in  one standard. At the same time for specific settings or specific issues the NRA could mandate specific  security measures to be taken. For instance, an NRA could ask all providers to provide the NRA with a  9 Supervision of security measures is not an easy task, because network and information technology changes  rapidly, because capabilities of attackers change rapidly, and because the effectiveness of security measures  often depends on technical implementation details. In addition, supervision by the NRA is further complicated  by the fact that in most EU countries the electronic communications sector consists of a wide range of different  types of providers, including very small providers, incumbents, black fibre operators, et cetera.  10 We asked NRAs across the EU, via a survey, which are the activities they are deploying or planning to deploy.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  27  contact point in case of contingencies, or ask all providers to have 4 hours of backup power for their  base station controllers.  Note that when mandating security measures for specific aspects, it is important that NRAs discuss  with providers about effectiveness and feasibility beforehand. Such discussions could be triggered by  large incidents or focus  happened in the past period, frequent root causes, and/or other common  issues (for example, about software vulnerabilities in common IT equipment).  Best practices in network and information security are rapidly changing, because information  technology changes rapidly and because the capability of attackers changes rapidly. The NRA is in a  unique role to support and foster the exchange of and discussion about best practices between  experts of different providers. In this way the NRA supports that best practices are adopted across the  sector. Especially providers with less experience and less expertise could benefit greatly from such  discussions and exchanges.  5.1.2 Using the ENISA guideline as a recommendation  NRAs could use this ENISA guideline to provide guidance to providers. The ENISA guideline consists of  25 high level security objectives derived from different standards (see References). To reach the  security objectives, providers should choose appropriate technical security measures. This document  lists detailed security measures which providers could take to reach the security objectives. The  security measures are split in three (sophistication) levels ranging from 1) basic, to 2) industry  standard, to 3) state of the art. Providers should assess the risks to their communications networks  and services to understand which security measures are appropriate.  5.1.3 Using the ENISA guideline as a mapping  Many (especially larger) providers already have a security standard or a security governance  framework in place, often based on international standards. This ENISA guideline could be used as a  neutral mapping to different standards in use by the industry. Such a mapping would allow providers  to continue use existing international standards, and it would avoid incurring unnecessary costs for  providers when complying with the requirements of Article 13a.  In practice, for example, providers could show compliance to Article 13a by providing audit reports or  certification against existing industry standards, combined with a mapping from these standards to  this ENISA guideline. In Section 6 we provide an example of such a mapping to some well-known  international security standards.  5.1.4 Using existing national or international standards or best practices  NRAs could refer to existing national or international standards or requirements, either as a baseline  requirement or as a recommendation. An overview of standards widely used in the industry is included  in the section References. NRAs should take into account national circumstances when choosing an  appropriate set of standards or best practices. We would like to make three remarks in this regard:  · NRAs should take into account that some (especially the large) providers may operate in  several EU countries, and that it would be cumbersome for these providers to adopt  different standards in different countries. In this respect it could be useful to allow providers  to use international standards which are widely used across the EU and in this way reduce  compliance costs for these providers.  · In most countries the electronic communications sector is large (hundreds of providers) and  contains both large providers (>10% of market share) and very small ones (<1% of market  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  28  share)11. NRAs should also take into account the differences between the providers in their  country. What might work for large providers may well be overwhelming for smaller  providers, and vice versa, what might work for one provider might be inappropriate for  another provider.  · Finally, NRAs should take into account that best practices in network and information  security are rapidly changing, because information technology changes rapidly and because  the capability of attackers changes rapidly. This makes it hard to capture the high-level  security requirement of Article 13a comprehensively in a list of detailed security measures.  In this light,  NRAs should focus first on supervising that providers assess risks and  proactively take appropriate security measures, rather than on trying to cast detailed  security measures in stone.  5.2 Assessing compliance across the market  Self-assessments could be used to get an overview of the kind of security measures taken by providers,  across the sector. The security objectives and measures listed in Section 4 can be used directly in self- assessment forms. The sophistication levels (see Section 4) would allow providers to indicate, per  security objective, what kind of security measures are in place. Used in this way the sophistication  levels would yield a profile of a provider, allowing for a quick comparison between providers across  the sector.  Figure 2: Two different profiles with different sophistication of measures for each security objective.  In figure 2 we show two example profiles in one diagram. The vertical axis spans the sophistication  levels and the horizontal axis spans the security objectives. Dark red indicates a provider with more  sophisticated security measures. The light red indicates a provider with less sophisticated security  measures. The difference in sophistication could be explained, for example, by a difference in the type  of communication services or networks being offered by the two providers.  Depending on the motivation behind the self –assessment the NRA could focus on a subset of security  objectives. For example, an NRA could be interested in a domain like business continuity or specific  security objectives around change management.  NRAs could also restrict self-assessments to a subset of the sector, for instance providers with a certain  number of users (more than 10% market share e.g.), a certain service (mobile networks, e.g.), or  providers offering certain critical services (communications for ports and airports e.g.).  11 We asked NRAs across the EU, via a survey, about the type of providers in their sector, looking at market share.  0  1  2  3  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25  So p  h is  ti ca  ti o  n  le  ve l  o f  se cu  ri ty  m ea  su re  s  Security objectives  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  29  We provide two simplified examples of how an NRA could set up a self-assessment form. In the first  example, the NRA assesses security measures across all providers in the sector, but with a focus on a  subset of the security objectives.  Example: The NRA of country D has organized a self-assessment focussed on governance and risk  management (domain D1 in the ENISA guideline). Self-assessment forms are emailed to all  providers:  Indicate your estimate market share: (choose from <1%, >10%, >10%)  Indicate which service you are offering:  (fixed/mobile telephony, fixed/mobile internet)  Per security objective, indicate the level of sophistication and if you can produce evidence.  SO1: Information security policy  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO2: Governance and risk management framework  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO3: Security roles and responsibilities  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  SO4: Managing third party networks or services  Sophistication level: (choose from 0, 1, 2, 3). Evidence exists: (choose from yes, no).  In the second example the NRA focusses on a subset of security measures and a subset of providers:  Example: The NRA in country E wants to focus on the issues behind a number of large mobile  network outages in the past year which are caused by power cuts, cable cuts, and natural disasters.  The NRA focusses on the security measures which are most relevant in this context. Self-assessment  forms are sent only to mobile network operators with large market share (>10%). Questions are a  combination of multiple choice and open questions for a description of security measures in place,  and open questions for the type of evidence that the provider can produce to substantiate answers.  For each of the security objectives SO9 (Physical and environmental security), SO10 (Security of  supplies), SO19 (Service continuity strategy and contingency plans), SO20 (Disaster recovery  capabilities), SO22 (Exercise contingency plans), indicate the level of sophistication, on a scale  from 0 to 4 (0 none, 1 basic, 2 industry standard, 3 state-of-the-art):  Describe the security measures in place to reach the objective: (max 200 words)  Describe the evidence you could provide to the NRA which could substantiate that measures are in  place: (0 none, 1 internal documentation, 2 audit report from external auditor)  Remark about confidentiality: Self-assessment results or profiles could be sensitive and it is important  to ensure confidentiality of results from other providers and/or the public. It is important to explain  clearly the purpose of the assessment (for example, by explaining that there are no regulatory  consequences) and to give explicit guarantees to providers about confidentiality of the results.  5.3 Taking a staged approach  Depending on the national circumstances, NRAs might want to adopt a staged approach in supervising  (and enforcing) compliance to the security requirements of Article 13a. For example, in case some  providers do not (yet) have appropriate security measures in place (or if they cannot provide evidence  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  30  of this), NRAs might want to give providers some time to comply, in stages. NRAs could use this  guideline to adopt a staged approach. We discuss some possible options for staging:  · Services or assets in scope: One could first focus on a subset of services (for example mobile  networks) or a subset of assets (for example, core network), and deal with other services  later.  Example: The NRA in country A wants to focus first on the mobile networks, because they  are (nationally) the most critical. The NRA starts with a self-assessment across providers of  mobile networks. The scope of the assessment is ‘assets supporting mobile networks’. Other  services are out of scope initially, as well as providers who do not offer mobile telephony  networks.  · Providers in scope: One could first focus on a subset of providers, for example providers  with a large market share, and look at other providers at a later stage.  Example: The NRA in country B wants to focus first on the providers with large market share,  because here a lot of users are at stake. The NRA starts with collecting self-assessment  reports from the main providers (>10% of market share). The survey is followed up by a  series of workshops where the main causes of incidents are discussed. Next year the NRA  will start a separate supervision program for smaller providers (focussed more on guidance).  · Security domains: One could first focus on a subset of security objectives, business  continuity for example, and focus on other objectives at a later stage.  Example: The NRA in country C wants to focus first on the main incidents, taking into  account the incidents reported by providers. Since last year in country A the incidents were  mostly due to natural disasters, in the supervision the NRA focusses first on the measures  SO9, SO10, SO19, SO20, SO22. The NRA will address other security measures at a later stage.  · Sophistication levels and baselines:  NRAs could first focus on ensuring that all providers  have taken the basic security measures, for example level 1 as defined in this guideline, and  only later focus on ensuring that providers take more sophisticated security measures. We  should stress here that such an approach would have limitations: particularly when the  sector has both large and small providers: For large providers basic security measures may  be insufficient, while for small providers they could be more than enough. It would be better  to take differences across the sector into account and define different baselines for  providers of different size.  Example: The NRA in country D defines two profiles as baselines.  o The first profile contains the basic security measures for only the domains D1  Governance and risk management, D2 Human resource security, D3 Security of  systems and facilities, – it is the baseline for small providers (<10% market share.  o The second profile contains  industry standard security measures for all domains  (D1, … D7)– it is the baseline for large providers (>10% of market share).  At a later stage the NRA will review the profiles, and where needed raise the requirements  in some areas or define different baselines for other types of providers (IXPs e.g.).  5.4 Auditing providers  Depending on the setting, NRAs might want to require providers to undergo an audit. Depending on  the setting and the goal of auditing different types of audits may be needed. In this section we discuss  different options for auditing providers.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  31  Note that auditing is not always easy because network and information systems are often complex.  To understand if specific subsystems are working correctly, an auditor may need to have deep  knowledge and expertise: in security the devil is in the details. To give one simple example: An auditor  may find there is a firewall in place to protect certain systems, but the detailed firewall rules determine  greatly the effectiveness of the firewall. One rule with one mistake may make the entire firewall  useless.  Remark about audit costs: NRAs should take into account the costs of third-party audits for providers,  particularly the smaller providers. Self-assessments (see previous section) may be a more light-weight  approach.  Remark about efficiency of audits: A frequent complaint from organizations subject to information  security audits is that auditing often forces them to generate a lot of paper work, and that this is not  only useless but that it also diverts resources from the actual task at hand: making the network and  information systems secure. NRAs should take into account that some providers are already partaking  in compliance or certification programs (voluntarily or in the context of different legislation) and are  already undergoing (internal or external) audits. If auditing is needed, it is important to leverage where  possible existing audit reports and compliance evidence.  Remark about language and international operators: When requesting documentation or evidence  from providers, NRAs should take into account that providers may keep certain relevant  documentation (manuals, policies, procedures, et cetera) in the English language for efficiency reasons,  because the provider operates in several countries or because the operator employs personnel from  abroad.  5.4.1 Assessment types  An audit involves different types of assessments, for example a review of security policies or an  interview with the CISO about contingency planning. Audits usually consist of a combination of  different types of assessments. We discuss the different types below:  · Document review: Document review is essential in any audit. Relevant documents may  include descriptions of policies, roles and responsibilities, descriptions of processes and  procedures, systems architecture and design, test procedures and actual test results.  Chapter 4 of this guideline includes descriptions of evidence which could be considered  when assessing the implementation of security measures.  · Interviews: In addition to document review, a lot of information may be collected by  interviewing service provider employees. At small providers it may be enough to speak to  one or two persons with commercial and technical responsibility. At large providers, typical  roles to be interviewed are C-level managers (CIO), chief security officers (CSO or CISO),  tactical/operational security officers, NOC managers, internal CERT team, product managers,  and system administrators responsible for critical processes or systems.  · System evaluation: Besides documentation, certification, and interviews, the ultimate check  to see if the networks and information systems are secure, and if policy/procedures are  being applied in practice, is by inspecting or testing the systems itself. In some settings  system review may be needed, for example to understand how a security incident could  have happened. System evaluation should focus on critical systems because it can be time- consuming.  5.4.2 Auditor types  Auditing can be carried out by different parties.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  32  · Self-assessment: In self-assessments there is really no auditor, but the personnel of the  provider assesses and reports about compliance. Although self-assessment reports may be  biased, they can provide useful information for providers and NRAs. An advantage of self- assessments is that self-assessments are relatively cheap for providers. Earlier in this  document, in  Section 5.2, we discuss self-assessments in more detail.  · Internal auditor: In large organizations, a provider could ask an internal security role or  internal audit department to do an audit of certain systems or parts of the organization.  Compared to self-assessments, an internal auditor may be less biased. An advantage is that  internal auditors often know the organization inside out. Also internal auditors could more  easily leverage the deep knowledge about the network and information systems at the  provider.  · External auditor: An audit report from an external auditor is even less biased. The only issue  here may be that the external auditor may not know all the details about the organization  and/or the network and information systems. This would make the entire audit more costly,  because on the one hand the external auditor would need to dedicate a lot of time to study  the setting and systems at the provider, and the provider would also need to dedicate a lot  of time to providing the necessary information to the auditor.  · NRA as auditor: The NRA could carry out an audit of a provider, by using internal staff with  auditing expertise, or by outsourcing the auditing to an auditing firm.  · Certifying auditor: In certification a licensed auditor checks compliance to a specific  standard. The audit report results in a certificate of compliance issued by a certifying  authority. For example it is quite common for large providers to be ISO270001 certified.  Certification is often refreshed yearly, following a yearly re-audit. NRAs could require  certification, and ask providers to submit their certificates as a way to show compliance. By  requiring certification  · Specialist auditor: In special cases the NRA may want to designate a specific auditor, for a  specific purpose or following a specific incident. For example, an NRA could mandate  providers to undergo a security scan of systems by a security scanning specialist.  · Pool of auditors: The NRA could designate a pool of external auditors. Criteria for auditors  could be based on past experience (a track record of audits, or security tests) or be based on  examination criteria. For example, NRAs could start with a list of licensed auditors12 and  offer them a yearly training which focusses on Article 13a requirements for the sector, in this  way creating a pool of auditors.  5.4.3 Audit timing and objectives  The frequency and objectives of auditing varies. We distinguish two types of audits.  · Preventive audits: Preventive audits are usually done at fixed intervals, periodically. In the  case of certification (see above) audits are carried out yearly or bi-yearly. Preventive audits  often do not have a specific scope, however it is good practice to set-up preventive periodic  audits according to a multi-year plan and focus first on certain (important) issues and only  later on other issues in subsequent audits. The frequency of auditing should take into  account that providers may need some time to address deficiencies found in previous audits.  12 In most countries, for example, there are organizations that license auditors to carry out IT audits.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  33  Example: The NRA in country H mandates providers to undergo yearly (preventive) audits by  3rd party auditors. To simplify matters and to reduce the burden for providers, the NRA  works according to a 3 year supervision plan, focussing on urgent issues first: In the first year  the scope of audits is restricted to business continuity, natural disasters and power cuts  (measures SM9, SM10, SM19, SM20, SM22). In the second year the focus is on the storage  and retention of customer data. In the third year all security measures will be audited.  · Post-incident audits: Post-incident auditing by an NRA is usually done ad-hoc, depending on  the type of incident and the setting. Post-incident audits have a specific focus – and usually  they are aimed at assessing if security measures are in place to prevent the incident from re- occurring. The audit in this case has a specific scope (the services affected by the incident,  the assets affected) and regards specific security measures (measures failing during the  incident, or measures which could prevent re-occurrence).  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  34  6 Mapping to international standards  6.1 It is important to stress that the security measures described in this  document have been derived from existing international network and  information security standards. This guideline is not intended to replace  existing standards or frameworks in use by providers. Providers could  map the standards they use (internally) to the security measures in  Section 4, and in this way show compliance with Article 13a. In this  section we give two examples of such a mapping. Mapping security  domains  Below, as an example, we map the security domains of Section 4 to a number of international  standards frequently used by providers. We map to the following standards:  · ISO 27001:2013, a standard for information security management,  · ISO 27002:2013, a catalogue of information security controls,  · ISO 27005:2011, a standard for information security risk management, and,  · ISO 22301:2012, a standard for business continuity management.  Security domains Addressed in  Details  D1: Governance and  risk management  ISO 27001,  ISO 27002, and  ISO 27005.  ISO 27001 provides a standard for governance of  information security risks.  ISO 27005 provides a standard for risk management.  ISO 27002 Chapter 5 covers Information security  policies.  ISO 27002 Chapter 7 covers information security roles  and responsibilities.  ISO 27002 Chapter 15 covers relationships with  suppliers.  D2: Human resources  security  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 7 covers background screening,  information security roles and responsibilities, security  knowledge and training, and personnel changes.  D3: Security of  systems and facilities  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 11 covers  physical and  environmental security.  ISO 27002 Chapter 9 covers access control to  information systems and facilities.  ISO 27002 Chapter 13 covers network security.  D4: Operations  management  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 12 covers operational procedures  and change management.  ISO27002 Chapter 8 covers asset management.  Technical Guideline on Security Measures  Technical guidance on the security measures in Article 13a  Version 2.0, October 2014  Page  35  D5: Incident  management  ISO 27002  ISO 27002 Chapter 16 covers management of  information security incidents, as well as  communications about security events.  D6: Business  continuity  management  ISO 22301 ISO 22301 covers Business Continuity Management  D7: Monitoring and  security testing  ISO 27002  Monitoring is covered in ISO 27002 Chapters 12 and  15. Security testing and compliance reviews are  covered in ISO 27002 Chapters 14 and 18.  We have used ISO standards in this example, but a similar mapping could be made to other national  or international standards. For example, the mapping would look similar if, instead of ISO27001 and  ISO27005, we would map to the ITU standards X.1051 (information security management) and X.1055  (risk management).  6.2 Mapping security objectives  One could also make a more detailed mapping. Below, as an example, we map the security objectives  in Section 4 to individual control objectives in the annex of ISO 27001:2013.

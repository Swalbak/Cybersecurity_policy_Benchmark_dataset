The ACSC has developed this guide to assist Australian’s to understand the risks of deploying iOS 14 and the security  requirements that need to be met to allow iOS 14 to handle sensitive or classified data. This security configuration  guide does not replace the Information Security Manual (ISM), however, where a technical conflict arises the most  current document shall take priority.  Audience  This guide is for users and administrators of devices running iOS 14. These devices include iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad.  Note that although tvOS, watchOS and macOS have many similarities, they have not been subject to evaluation under  the Common Criteria or an ASD Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE).  To use this guide, readers should be familiar with basic networking concepts, be an experienced mobile device system  administrator and be or have access to an experienced network administrator.  Parts of this guide will make reference to product features that will require the engagement of other software,  networking equipment or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. While every effort has been made to ensure  content involving any third-party vendor products is correct at the time of writing, organisations should always check  with these vendors when planning their system implementation. Note, mention of third-party products is not a specific  endorsement of that vendor over another and are used for illustrative purposes only.  Some security configuration instructions within this guide are complex, and if implemented incorrectly could reduce the  security of devices, networks or an organisation’s overall security posture. These instructions should only be  implemented by experienced systems administrators and should be used in conjunction with thorough testing.  Purpose  This guide provides information for Australian organisations on the security of Apple iOS 14 devices sold in Australia,  and their risks, which should be considered before they are introduced into an organisation’s mobile fleet.  This guide provides a summary of features and associated risks for the Apple iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad running iOS  14. Throughout this guide, devices and combinations of software are referred to as the ‘iOS platform’.  The advice in this guide has been written for the use of the iOS platform within Australia. Organisations and individuals  seeking to use devices overseas should also refer to the ACSC’s Travelling Overseas With Electronic Devices  publication.  Implementing the settings advised in this guide can significantly reduce system functionality and user experience.  Authorising officers are encouraged to consider the balance of user requirements and security, as not all advice may be  appropriate for every user, environment or deployment.  Organisations should seek approval from their authorising officer to allow for the formal acceptance of the risks. Refer  to the applying a risk-based approach to cyber security section of the ISM for more information.  This guide is aligned with the ISM, however, not all ISM guidance can be implemented on the Apple iOS 14 platform. In  these cases, risk mitigation measures are provided in the Advice to authorising officers section.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices  2  Evaluation status  Since April 2014, ASD has endorsed the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) with specified  optional mitigations as a key component in all mobile device evaluations. The MDFPP, as defined by the United States  National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), outlines the security requirements for a mobile device for use in an  enterprise. Earlier versions of iOS have been evaluated against MDFPP, and completed an ASD Cryptographic Evaluation  (ACE).  This guide is based on the findings of ASD and provides guidance that must be enforced for OFFICIAL: Sensitive and  PROTECTED deployments. Guidance in this publication will also assist organisations to comply with existing policies  when deploying devices at lower classifications.  Under the Common Criteria, iOS 12.2 has undergone evaluation against the Protection Profile for MDFPP version 3.1.  Apple has also obtained a broad range of additional certifications for their devices.  https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=468&id=468  3  General advice  Introduction to mobile device security  In this guide, mobile device security advice centres on the three security tenets of:   device integrity   data at rest   data in transit.  ASD evaluates cryptographic implementations to determine configurations necessary to reduce handling requirements  of devices used for processing, storing or communicating sensitive or classified data. It is each organisation’s  responsibility to configure devices according to ASD advice, and assess that available cryptographic protections are  used appropriately.  Configuration advice regarding device integrity aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive or classified  mobile devices, assuming an adversary has physical access to devices while they are powered on and in a locked state.  Configuration advice draws upon an assessment of:   key hierarchy and architecture   cryptographic implementation   operating system architecture   configuration under typical deployment scenarios.  It is each organisation’s responsibility to configure devices according to this advice in order to achieve the desired  integrity outcomes.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data at rest aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive  or classified data stored on an iOS platform. This advice assumes an adversary has physical access to devices while they  are powered on and in a locked state. Configuration advice draws upon configuration assessments and details of  application implementations, including availability of security features.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data in transit aims to provide a suitable level of protection for  sensitive or classified data traversing a network, while assuming an adversary is able to intercept this traffic. It is each  organisation’s responsibility to configure devices according to ASD advice and maintain appropriate Virtual Private  Network (VPN) infrastructure to support VPN tunnels, noting such infrastructure is out of scope for this guide.  iOS updates  Apple typically releases a beta version of new major iOS versions in June each year, and the release becomes generally  available in September. New iOS devices can only run new versions of iOS, but there is scope for the upgrade of  supervised devices to be explicitly controlled.  For organisations with existing or planned iOS deployments, ASD advises:   Actively test beta versions of iOS under AppleSeed for IT and Developer Preview Programs.   Upgrade to the latest iOS version. This is consistent with ASD’s advice to install the latest versions of software and  patch operating system security vulnerabilities, as communicated in the ISM and the Strategies to Mitigate  Cyber Security Incidents.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  4   Implement any interim guidance contained in ACSC documents, such as this guide. In particular, organisations  should take note of advice relating to new features and changed functionality introduced by Apple in new iOS  versions. This advice is the result of in-house technical testing by ASD, experiences shared by other organisations  and based on consultation with the vendor.  Details of new iOS security updates are released concurrently with new iOS versions, addressing security vulnerabilities.  The Apple security updates webpage contains more information. This information may help organisations quantify the  risk posed by not updating.  iOS encryption  The iOS platform uses encryption and data protection measures to secure the hardware, software and data. Details of  the encryption and data protection measures can be accessed from Apple’s Platform Security Guide.  When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the following classes of data protection are available:   Class A: When the device is locked, data afforded ‘Class A’ data protection is suitably encrypted and inaccessible  (note: there is a 10 second window at device lock before the ephemeral key [cryptographic key that is generated  for each new session] is discarded).   Class B: When the device is locked and the file is closed, data afforded ‘Class B’ data protection is suitably  encrypted and inaccessible.   Class C: When the device is turned off, or powered on and a user has not yet authenticated to the device, data  afforded ‘Class C’ data protection is encrypted and inaccessible.   Class D: Data encrypted on the device is afforded ‘Class D’ data protection. However, the nature of the encryption  and key handling means that the data is considered accessible.  ASD recommends that all sensitive or classified data handled by devices uses Class A data protection. In general, basic  iOS functionality that would be used by organisations, such as email, attachment viewing and file storage all use Class A  data protection by default.  Emails that are stored on devices are afforded Class A data protection, except in the case where an email is  downloading or being received while the device is in a locked state. In this situation, the email and any attachments are  afforded Class B data protection, which means the data is encrypted with an ephemeral key that is not generated from  user credentials. Once the device is unlocked, and a suitable user credential-derived key is generated, the email and any  attachments are then re-encrypted to Class A data protection standard.  Supervised devices  ASD guidance advises that devices handling sensitive or classified data (OFFICIAL: Sensitive and above) be supervised,  including for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). Supervision is managed through Apple Business Manager and further  configured via an MDM, as outlined later in this guide. Supervision of devices handling sensitive or classified data is  necessary to ensure that the correct policies and configurations are applied throughout the lifecycle of the devices.  Organisations will need to register with Apple to create Business Manager Accounts and Apple IDs. For high-risk  implementations of devices, and cases where registering with Apple is neither desirable nor technically feasible, advice  may be sought from ASD on potential alternatives.  The need for supervision of BYOD is a serious consideration for individuals wishing to work using their own devices, as it  effectively hands control of devices over to an organisation. Therefore, a detailed discussion about the need for BYOD  should be held between the user and authorising officer, with appropriate policy developed to support this  requirement.  https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201222 https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf  5  Advice to authorising officers  The ACSC has developed the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  to help organisations and their  authorising officers mitigate caused by various cyber threats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are  known as the Essential Eight. While the strategies were developed for Microsoft Windows workstations and servers,  much of this is applicable to modern smartphones.  iOS 14 and the Essential Eight  Application control   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, iOS 14 implements application control that is enforced via  cryptographic signatures. iOS platform application control provides sufficient granularity to allow an administrator  to approve specific versions of applications.  Patch applications   Patches for applications are made available to devices as soon as they are released. When configured in  accordance with ASD guidance, system administrators are able to remotely apply patches to organisation-owned  and supervised devices.  Configure Microsoft Office macros settings   The iOS platform does not support high-risk features such as Microsoft Office macros.   However, new versions of Microsoft Office for iOS may introduce macro functionality and will not be separated  from bundled security enhancement patches. Authorising officers will need to be aware that further configuration  and reassessment of their exposure to this risk may be required in the future.  User application hardening   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, at risk applications such as web browsers are secured by not  supporting Java and by using content blocker solutions.  Restrict administration privileges   The iOS platform restricts administrator permissions by default for both the user and applications.  Patch operating systems   iOS platform operating system patches are made available directly to devices as soon as they are released. When  configured in accordance with ASD guidance, system administrators are able to remotely apply patches to  organisation-owned and supervised devices.  Multi-factor authentication   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, devices and user identities are authenticated through  multiple authentication factors.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  6  Daily backups   The iOS platform supports remote backups of some content to solutions approved by organisations. Further  decisions can be made beyond ASD guidance to further improve the maturity level of daily backup solutions.  7  iOS 14 platform feature summary and risk  considerations  Supervised Mode (Applicability: Organisation-owned device)  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Without this mode, devices may not always comply with an organisation’s controls and misplaced devices cannot be  secured remotely.  All organisation-owned devices are required to be supervised. Supervision of devices enables an organisation to enforce  broader device policy, monitor the status of devices, manage Activation Lock and enable Lost Mode. Devices that  handle sensitive or classified data, or interact with an organisation’s systems, are required to use Supervised Mode via  Apple Business Manager and an MDM.  The use of Supervised Mode prevents users from being able to sync or backup device contents to home computers and  ensures that users cannot easily sidestep restrictions without erasing all data from devices. Additionally, iOS forensic  recovery utilities will not be able to recover data from devices without the use of a jailbreak.  Supervised Mode increases the difficulty of a number of attacks that rely upon the USB host-pairing protocol.  Supervised Mode also allows an MDM to manage Activation Lock.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Organisation-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM.  Supervised Mode (Applicability: Bring Your Own Device)  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Without this mode, devices may not always comply with an organisation’s controls and misplaced devices cannot be  secured remotely. Organisations will also have a reduced ability to enforce security, audit and monitoring of non- supervised BYOD.  An organisation’s BYOD deployment model will impact upon the residual risk of the deployment. As such, organisations  should decide whether BYODs are to be supervised. Supervision of devices enables an organisation to enforce broader  device policy, monitor the status of devices, manage Activation Lock and enable Lost Mode. BYODs that handle  sensitive or classified data, or interact with the organisation’s systems, should use Supervised Mode via Apple Business  Manager and an MDM.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Privately-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM.  8  Device passcode  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  ASD provides guidance on creating strong passwords/passphrases. Should this not be followed, the encryption strength  afforded to data at rest will be significantly diminished where devices are lost or stolen.  A sufficiently long and complex device passphrase ensures that devices are appropriately protected while locked, by  ensuring that passcodes are both difficult to guess and that enough entropy is generated by the user credentials to  derive adequate ephemeral keys.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Single-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  Biometric device unlock  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not allowed  Risks  When supported by a sufficiently strong device passcode, there is no difference in risk between using TouchID and  FaceID. Deployments of iOS devices using biometrics should consider the practicality and privacy of users, and tailor  advice surrounding these features to best suit the deployment scenario. Authorising officers should seek ASD guidance  to assess these considerations where a tangible practical demand for biometrics is identified.  The biometric mechanisms of the iOS platform have not undergone an ACE, and the security claims of the feature are  difficult to assess. The use of TouchID and FaceID to protect sensitive or classified data may be considered for OFFICIAL:  Sensitive deployments, however, must not be used when the device handles PROTECTED data.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Authentication hardening’ section in the ISM.  Non-native applications  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Applications that do not handle sensitive or classified data appropriately, or afford a suitable level of encryption, are at  risk of disclosing or mishandling of sensitive or classified data.  Non-native applications are applications that are purchased for use on the iOS platform, or developed internally by an  organisation for specific use on the iOS platform. Such non-native applications are sourced from the App Store (either  the public App Store or Custom Apps), or from an internal organisational source that uses Apple Developer Enterprise  Program.  9  Organisations considering the deployment of non-native applications should carefully review the data at rest and data  in transit mechanisms offered by the developer to ensure that appropriate encryption mechanisms are implemented.  Data at rest solutions must make use of ‘Class A’ data protection for PROTECTED deployments.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Mobile Device Management  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  Without an MDM solution, devices may not always comply with an organisation’s controls and misplaced devices  cannot be secured remotely.  The iOS platform allows organisations to automatically manage device enrolment through the Apple Business Manager  platform. MDM solutions allow for configuration management, deeper inspection and auditing of devices, as well as  device content such as applications and documents. In certain limited circumstances, it may also be appropriate to use  Apple Configurator as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, a dedicated MDM solution. Using an MDM solution  allows an organisation to vet and deploy applications without user action or by using iTunes.  Through MDM solutions, notifications can be muted for managed applications and only allowed to be active under  given circumstances (e.g. only allow notifications when an application is active). It is recommended that notifications  only appear for managed applications when devices are unlocked. This recommendation is applied at the OFFICIAL:  Sensitive and PROTECTED levels. It is recommended that managed applications be configured through a MDM solution  to not be removable, to avoid users inadvertently uninstalling allowed applications.  Organisations implementing MDM solutions are encouraged to select products evaluated against the MDM Agent  module of NIAP’s MDFPP.  Organisations operating in higher risk situations are encouraged to engage with ASD when developing and  implementing MDM solutions.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Mobile Device Management’ topic in the ISM.  Bring Your Own Device  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  BYODs have a higher risk of inadvertently introducing malware into an organisation’s networks, and are at higher risk of  infection with malicious applications or software before they are configured for handling sensitive or classified data.  Therefore, organisations should understand the risks around allowing privately-owned devices onto their networks, and  ensure they follow ASD guidance.  As long as a device is enrolled in an MDM and is appropriately configured, devices handling OFFICIAL: Sensitive data  can be BYOD.  https://www.niap-ccevs.org/profile/Info.cfm?PPID=441&id=441  10  Additional information can be found under the ‘Privately-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM and in the ACSC’s Risk  Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device  publication.  Managed Open-In  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Devices not correctly configured for Managed Open-In, risk allowing un-assessed applications from being loaded onto  devices. These applications may not meet data at rest and data in transit requirements for handling sensitive or  classified data.  Managed Open-In is built into the iOS platform and configured by MDM solutions. Managed Open-In allows  organisations to decide which applications or accounts configured on devices can access sensitive or classified data.  Even if devices are configured in a ‘work only’ mode with no personal enablement, Managed Open-In can be used to  ensure PROTECTED data is only held in, and moved between, applications that have appropriate data at rest and data  in transit protections implemented.  In-app accounts will need to be managed properly as users can manually switch from an enterprise account to a  personal account of a managed Open-In application.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application control’ and ‘Hardening application configurations’ topics in  the ISM.  Virtual Private Network  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Not using a VPN risks exposing data (and metadata) in transit to increased visibility by any entities on the networks the  data traverses. This may increase an organisation’s attack surface, as alternatives may require servers to be directly  connected to the internet.  All data communicated by devices handling sensitive or classified data must be through a VPN. Typically BYOD and  Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) configurations will use a ‘per-app’ VPN, but some deployments will  have a risk profile where they are required to use a whole device ‘always on’ VPN configuration. The built-in IPsec IKEv2  VPN client can be configured via profile for either type. This can be changed dynamically to suit the deployment  requirements.  ‘Per-account’ VPN allows managed accounts to be channelled through a specific VPN tunnel. This allows multiple email  accounts to be pushed by MDM through separate VPN tunnels, yet still be inside the Managed Open-In boundary. For  example, Microsoft Exchange has two emails accounts (one for OFFICIAL and another for PROTECTED) each one  connected through a separate VPN tunnel on the same device.  ‘Per-app, per protocol’ VPN allows exceptions from either per-app VPN or always on VPN, through MDM policy. The  primary use-case is for Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) / Unified communications (UC) applications that use User  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device  11  Datagram Protocol (UDP), but could apply to downloading public data such as mapping data outside of a VPN tunnel.  Misconfigurations of the per-app, per protocol VPN can potentially introduce a security vulnerability into deployments.  Addition information can be found under the ‘Connecting mobile devices to the internet’ topic in the ISM.  Backups  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Without regular backups, sensitive or classified data may be irrecoverable should only a local copy of the data exist and  become inaccessible. However, with unapproved backup solutions, sensitive or classified data may be extracted and  then stored on, or transit over, systems that are not suitable for the sensitivity or classification of the data.  The configuration of devices is set by an MDM solution, and is restored whenever a device is enrolled. Whether  backups are necessary depends on the nature of applications in use on devices. For example, email or chat applications  are almost always synchronised with backend server storage, and thus do not require a backup from devices.  If data of organisational value is being created on devices, careful application selection or development can negate the  need for organisational data to require backup explicitly from devices, because it is synchronised to servers implicitly  (such as using a Content Management System that has a client with a File Sharing Extension). Note that in BYOD or  COPE configurations, backup of personal content is generally desirable for users but covered by consumer solutions  such as iCloud backup. Managed applications and accounts containing sensitive or classified data can be excluded from  the backups of personal content using appropriate configuration from a MDM solution.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Data backup and restoration’ section in the ISM.  Email applications  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Devices may over-classify all emails if they aren’t able to be marked individually by the originator, as they may be set to  the maximum sensitivity or classification by default. Alternatively, devices may under-classify all emails if there is no  protective marking set by email clients or servers.  If an email client does not support the application of protective markings to emails, organisations should consider  configuring email servers to allow for manual protective marking of emails by users. In some cases, installing a managed  keyboard, to simplify marking of emails, will be more convenient for users than manually typing out protective  markings.  The native email client on iOS is approved for PROTECTED data when configured in accordance with ASD guidance. See  the iOS Encryption section for more details.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Email usage’ section in the ISM.  12  Microsoft Office for iOS  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  iOS devices do not currently run Microsoft Office macros and therefore many of the risks associated with handling  Office documents are not relevant at this time. As this is a feature of a third-party vendor, continual monitoring of this  risk will need to be undertaken.  Organisations looking to implement Microsoft Office for iOS should refer to the ‘Application hardening’ section in the  ISM.  iOS Calendar  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not Recommended  Risks  Should there be sensitive or classified data in iOS Calendar data and metadata, these will not be stored with sufficient  protection for sensitive or classified data.  iOS Calendar allows synchronising calendar entries across accounts and devices. The iOS Calendar interacts with other  applications to detect dates and times and suggest entries to be submitted to the calendar.  When using the iOS Calendar, attachments are afforded Class A data protection, but calendar data and metadata (such  as the title of an event and any notes or details) are afforded only Class C protection. Therefore, authorising officers  should make an informed risk decision about the use of the iOS Calendar for OFFICIAL: Sensitive data, and should not  include PROTECTED data in any iOS Calendar event other than within calendar attachments.  iOS Contacts  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  iOS Contacts does not store details with sufficient protection for sensitive or classified data.  iOS Contacts implements specific controls set by a MDM solution for the flow of contact information between managed  and unmanaged spaces. For example, whether a managed contact can be used to display a person’s name at the lock  screen, instead of their phone number for an incoming call.  iOS Contacts data is stored on the device in a Class C container and, if names and phone numbers are considered  PROTECTED data by an organisation, consideration should be given to using a dedicated application to manage such  contacts.  13  iOS Camera  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  Photos and videos taken with iOS Camera are stored locally and may be transferred automatically to locations that do  not have sufficient protection for sensitive or classified data.  In BYOD and COPE devices, or deployments where photographs may be considered PROTECTED data, consider using a  dedicated purpose-built camera app that stores photos in a Class A container.  iOS Camera uses Class C data protection to store photographs, and depending on the configuration set by a MDM  solution, may be allowed to synchronise data to iCloud Photo Stream or to a user’s personal unmanaged device.  iOS Books  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  iOS Books does not store data with sufficient protection for sensitive or classified data.  A MDM solution can push iBook, ePub and PDF documents into iOS Books on devices. Such documents are considered  managed by built-in controls and are not included in backups, nor can they be moved to unmanaged destinations or  synchronised to iCloud. However, any PROTECTED documents must use a dedicated application that uses Class A data  protection.  iOS Books uses Class C data protection, so it is only suitable for OFFICIAL: Sensitive or below documents.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Location services  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Through the use of location services, information based on devices’ physical location is obtained and used by Apple and  third-party applications for various location-based services. To determine the location of devices, location services can  use GPS, Bluetooth, crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular tower locations.  Configuration by a MDM solution can control when location services are used (e.g. allow once, allow when active and  always allow) and accuracy (precise or approximate).  Additional information can be found under the ‘Radio Frequency devices’ topic in the ISM.  14  Multi-factor authentication  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Recommended Recommended  Risks  If multi-factor authentication is not implemented for application accounts on devices, compromised login credentials  would allow unauthorised access to devices. Multi-factor authentication, when using biometrics, also provides an  additional layer of security that strongly binds the identity of the user to a device. Note however, the authentication of  the user to a MDM solution only occurs at device enrolment.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Multi-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  Domain Name System  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Recommended Recommended  Risks  The protection of the Domain Name System (DNS) service is critical for the translation of Uniform Resource Locator  (URL) addresses to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Starting from iOS 13, new features around the use of a DNS proxy  to channel all DNS resolution via a secure channel, or using encrypted DNS, were introduced.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Host-based intrusion prevention system’ and ‘Software firewall’ topics  in the ISM.  Additional considerations  iOS 14 introduces a number of new security features to the Apple iOS platform. For example, iOS 14 will attempt to  randomise the MAC address when there is a network probe from a new network. Through MDM configuration, this  feature can be disabled for instances when the iOS platform is connecting to an organisation owned and controlled  network. In addition, as of iOS 14, Siri now processes user requests locally and single sign-on (SSO) extensions, used for  authentication, will support per application VPN connections allowing a list of associated and excluded domains to  interact with particular per application VPN configurations.  15  Glossary of cyber security terms  Term Meaning  application control An approach in which only an explicitly defined set of approved  applications permitted to execute on systems.

The ACSC has developed this guide to assist Australian’s to understand the risks of deploying iOS 14 and the security  requirements that need to be met to allow iOS 14 to handle sensitive or classified data. This security configuration  guide does not replace the Information Security Manual (ISM), however, where a technical conflict arises the most  current document shall take priority.  Audience  This guide is for users and administrators of devices running iOS 14. These devices include iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad.  Note that although tvOS, watchOS and macOS have many similarities, they have not been subject to evaluation under  the Common Criteria or an ASD Cryptographic Evaluation (ACE).  To use this guide, readers should be familiar with basic networking concepts, be an experienced mobile device system  administrator and be or have access to an experienced network administrator.  Parts of this guide will make reference to product features that will require the engagement of other software,  networking equipment or Mobile Device Management (MDM) vendors. While every effort has been made to ensure  content involving any third-party vendor products is correct at the time of writing, organisations should always check  with these vendors when planning their system implementation. Note, mention of third-party products is not a specific  endorsement of that vendor over another and are used for illustrative purposes only.  Some security configuration instructions within this guide are complex, and if implemented incorrectly could reduce the  security of devices, networks or an organisation’s overall security posture. These instructions should only be  implemented by experienced systems administrators and should be used in conjunction with thorough testing.  Purpose  This guide provides information for Australian organisations on the security of Apple iOS 14 devices sold in Australia,  and their risks, which should be considered before they are introduced into an organisation’s mobile fleet.  This guide provides a summary of features and associated risks for the Apple iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad running iOS  14. Throughout this guide, devices and combinations of software are referred to as the ‘iOS platform’.  The advice in this guide has been written for the use of the iOS platform within Australia. Organisations and individuals  seeking to use devices overseas should also refer to the ACSC’s Travelling Overseas With Electronic Devices  publication.  Implementing the settings advised in this guide can significantly reduce system functionality and user experience.  Authorising officers are encouraged to consider the balance of user requirements and security, as not all advice may be  appropriate for every user, environment or deployment.  Organisations should seek approval from their authorising officer to allow for the formal acceptance of the risks. Refer  to the applying a risk-based approach to cyber security section of the ISM for more information.  This guide is aligned with the ISM, however, not all ISM guidance can be implemented on the Apple iOS 14 platform. In  these cases, risk mitigation measures are provided in the Advice to authorising officers section.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/ism https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/travelling-overseas-electronic-devices  2  Evaluation status  Since April 2014, ASD has endorsed the Mobile Device Fundamentals Protection Profile (MDFPP) with specified  optional mitigations as a key component in all mobile device evaluations. The MDFPP, as defined by the United States  National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), outlines the security requirements for a mobile device for use in an  enterprise. Earlier versions of iOS have been evaluated against MDFPP, and completed an ASD Cryptographic Evaluation  (ACE).  This guide is based on the findings of ASD and provides guidance that must be enforced for OFFICIAL: Sensitive and  PROTECTED deployments. Guidance in this publication will also assist organisations to comply with existing policies  when deploying devices at lower classifications.  Under the Common Criteria, iOS 12.2 has undergone evaluation against the Protection Profile for MDFPP version 3.1.  Apple has also obtained a broad range of additional certifications for their devices.  https://www.niap-ccevs.org/Profile/Info.cfm?PPID=468&id=468  3  General advice  Introduction to mobile device security  In this guide, mobile device security advice centres on the three security tenets of:   device integrity   data at rest   data in transit.  ASD evaluates cryptographic implementations to determine configurations necessary to reduce handling requirements  of devices used for processing, storing or communicating sensitive or classified data. It is each organisation’s  responsibility to configure devices according to ASD advice, and assess that available cryptographic protections are  used appropriately.  Configuration advice regarding device integrity aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive or classified  mobile devices, assuming an adversary has physical access to devices while they are powered on and in a locked state.  Configuration advice draws upon an assessment of:   key hierarchy and architecture   cryptographic implementation   operating system architecture   configuration under typical deployment scenarios.  It is each organisation’s responsibility to configure devices according to this advice in order to achieve the desired  integrity outcomes.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data at rest aims to provide a level of protection suitable for sensitive  or classified data stored on an iOS platform. This advice assumes an adversary has physical access to devices while they  are powered on and in a locked state. Configuration advice draws upon configuration assessments and details of  application implementations, including availability of security features.  Configuration advice regarding the protection of data in transit aims to provide a suitable level of protection for  sensitive or classified data traversing a network, while assuming an adversary is able to intercept this traffic. It is each  organisation’s responsibility to configure devices according to ASD advice and maintain appropriate Virtual Private  Network (VPN) infrastructure to support VPN tunnels, noting such infrastructure is out of scope for this guide.  iOS updates  Apple typically releases a beta version of new major iOS versions in June each year, and the release becomes generally  available in September. New iOS devices can only run new versions of iOS, but there is scope for the upgrade of  supervised devices to be explicitly controlled.  For organisations with existing or planned iOS deployments, ASD advises:   Actively test beta versions of iOS under AppleSeed for IT and Developer Preview Programs.   Upgrade to the latest iOS version. This is consistent with ASD’s advice to install the latest versions of software and  patch operating system security vulnerabilities, as communicated in the ISM and the Strategies to Mitigate  Cyber Security Incidents.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  4   Implement any interim guidance contained in ACSC documents, such as this guide. In particular, organisations  should take note of advice relating to new features and changed functionality introduced by Apple in new iOS  versions. This advice is the result of in-house technical testing by ASD, experiences shared by other organisations  and based on consultation with the vendor.  Details of new iOS security updates are released concurrently with new iOS versions, addressing security vulnerabilities.  The Apple security updates webpage contains more information. This information may help organisations quantify the  risk posed by not updating.  iOS encryption  The iOS platform uses encryption and data protection measures to secure the hardware, software and data. Details of  the encryption and data protection measures can be accessed from Apple’s Platform Security Guide.  When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, the following classes of data protection are available:   Class A: When the device is locked, data afforded ‘Class A’ data protection is suitably encrypted and inaccessible  (note: there is a 10 second window at device lock before the ephemeral key [cryptographic key that is generated  for each new session] is discarded).   Class B: When the device is locked and the file is closed, data afforded ‘Class B’ data protection is suitably  encrypted and inaccessible.   Class C: When the device is turned off, or powered on and a user has not yet authenticated to the device, data  afforded ‘Class C’ data protection is encrypted and inaccessible.   Class D: Data encrypted on the device is afforded ‘Class D’ data protection. However, the nature of the encryption  and key handling means that the data is considered accessible.  ASD recommends that all sensitive or classified data handled by devices uses Class A data protection. In general, basic  iOS functionality that would be used by organisations, such as email, attachment viewing and file storage all use Class A  data protection by default.  Emails that are stored on devices are afforded Class A data protection, except in the case where an email is  downloading or being received while the device is in a locked state. In this situation, the email and any attachments are  afforded Class B data protection, which means the data is encrypted with an ephemeral key that is not generated from  user credentials. Once the device is unlocked, and a suitable user credential-derived key is generated, the email and any  attachments are then re-encrypted to Class A data protection standard.  Supervised devices  ASD guidance advises that devices handling sensitive or classified data (OFFICIAL: Sensitive and above) be supervised,  including for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). Supervision is managed through Apple Business Manager and further  configured via an MDM, as outlined later in this guide. Supervision of devices handling sensitive or classified data is  necessary to ensure that the correct policies and configurations are applied throughout the lifecycle of the devices.  Organisations will need to register with Apple to create Business Manager Accounts and Apple IDs. For high-risk  implementations of devices, and cases where registering with Apple is neither desirable nor technically feasible, advice  may be sought from ASD on potential alternatives.  The need for supervision of BYOD is a serious consideration for individuals wishing to work using their own devices, as it  effectively hands control of devices over to an organisation. Therefore, a detailed discussion about the need for BYOD  should be held between the user and authorising officer, with appropriate policy developed to support this  requirement.  https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201222 https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1902/en_US/apple-platform-security-guide.pdf  5  Advice to authorising officers  The ACSC has developed the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  to help organisations and their  authorising officers mitigate caused by various cyber threats. The most effective of these mitigation strategies are  known as the Essential Eight. While the strategies were developed for Microsoft Windows workstations and servers,  much of this is applicable to modern smartphones.  iOS 14 and the Essential Eight  Application control   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, iOS 14 implements application control that is enforced via  cryptographic signatures. iOS platform application control provides sufficient granularity to allow an administrator  to approve specific versions of applications.  Patch applications   Patches for applications are made available to devices as soon as they are released. When configured in  accordance with ASD guidance, system administrators are able to remotely apply patches to organisation-owned  and supervised devices.  Configure Microsoft Office macros settings   The iOS platform does not support high-risk features such as Microsoft Office macros.   However, new versions of Microsoft Office for iOS may introduce macro functionality and will not be separated  from bundled security enhancement patches. Authorising officers will need to be aware that further configuration  and reassessment of their exposure to this risk may be required in the future.  User application hardening   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, at risk applications such as web browsers are secured by not  supporting Java and by using content blocker solutions.  Restrict administration privileges   The iOS platform restricts administrator permissions by default for both the user and applications.  Patch operating systems   iOS platform operating system patches are made available directly to devices as soon as they are released. When  configured in accordance with ASD guidance, system administrators are able to remotely apply patches to  organisation-owned and supervised devices.  Multi-factor authentication   When configured in accordance with ASD guidance, devices and user identities are authenticated through  multiple authentication factors.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  6  Daily backups   The iOS platform supports remote backups of some content to solutions approved by organisations. Further  decisions can be made beyond ASD guidance to further improve the maturity level of daily backup solutions.  7  iOS 14 platform feature summary and risk  considerations  Supervised Mode (Applicability: Organisation-owned device)  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Without this mode, devices may not always comply with an organisation’s controls and misplaced devices cannot be  secured remotely.  All organisation-owned devices are required to be supervised. Supervision of devices enables an organisation to enforce  broader device policy, monitor the status of devices, manage Activation Lock and enable Lost Mode. Devices that  handle sensitive or classified data, or interact with an organisation’s systems, are required to use Supervised Mode via  Apple Business Manager and an MDM.  The use of Supervised Mode prevents users from being able to sync or backup device contents to home computers and  ensures that users cannot easily sidestep restrictions without erasing all data from devices. Additionally, iOS forensic  recovery utilities will not be able to recover data from devices without the use of a jailbreak.  Supervised Mode increases the difficulty of a number of attacks that rely upon the USB host-pairing protocol.  Supervised Mode also allows an MDM to manage Activation Lock.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Organisation-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM.  Supervised Mode (Applicability: Bring Your Own Device)  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Without this mode, devices may not always comply with an organisation’s controls and misplaced devices cannot be  secured remotely. Organisations will also have a reduced ability to enforce security, audit and monitoring of non- supervised BYOD.  An organisation’s BYOD deployment model will impact upon the residual risk of the deployment. As such, organisations  should decide whether BYODs are to be supervised. Supervision of devices enables an organisation to enforce broader  device policy, monitor the status of devices, manage Activation Lock and enable Lost Mode. BYODs that handle  sensitive or classified data, or interact with the organisation’s systems, should use Supervised Mode via Apple Business  Manager and an MDM.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Privately-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM.  8  Device passcode  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  ASD provides guidance on creating strong passwords/passphrases. Should this not be followed, the encryption strength  afforded to data at rest will be significantly diminished where devices are lost or stolen.  A sufficiently long and complex device passphrase ensures that devices are appropriately protected while locked, by  ensuring that passcodes are both difficult to guess and that enough entropy is generated by the user credentials to  derive adequate ephemeral keys.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Single-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  Biometric device unlock  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not allowed  Risks  When supported by a sufficiently strong device passcode, there is no difference in risk between using TouchID and  FaceID. Deployments of iOS devices using biometrics should consider the practicality and privacy of users, and tailor  advice surrounding these features to best suit the deployment scenario. Authorising officers should seek ASD guidance  to assess these considerations where a tangible practical demand for biometrics is identified.  The biometric mechanisms of the iOS platform have not undergone an ACE, and the security claims of the feature are  difficult to assess. The use of TouchID and FaceID to protect sensitive or classified data may be considered for OFFICIAL:  Sensitive deployments, however, must not be used when the device handles PROTECTED data.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Authentication hardening’ section in the ISM.  Non-native applications  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Applications that do not handle sensitive or classified data appropriately, or afford a suitable level of encryption, are at  risk of disclosing or mishandling of sensitive or classified data.  Non-native applications are applications that are purchased for use on the iOS platform, or developed internally by an  organisation for specific use on the iOS platform. Such non-native applications are sourced from the App Store (either  the public App Store or Custom Apps), or from an internal organisational source that uses Apple Developer Enterprise  Program.  9  Organisations considering the deployment of non-native applications should carefully review the data at rest and data  in transit mechanisms offered by the developer to ensure that appropriate encryption mechanisms are implemented.  Data at rest solutions must make use of ‘Class A’ data protection for PROTECTED deployments.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Mobile Device Management  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Required  Risks  Without an MDM solution, devices may not always comply with an organisation’s controls and misplaced devices  cannot be secured remotely.  The iOS platform allows organisations to automatically manage device enrolment through the Apple Business Manager  platform. MDM solutions allow for configuration management, deeper inspection and auditing of devices, as well as  device content such as applications and documents. In certain limited circumstances, it may also be appropriate to use  Apple Configurator as an alternative to, or in conjunction with, a dedicated MDM solution. Using an MDM solution  allows an organisation to vet and deploy applications without user action or by using iTunes.  Through MDM solutions, notifications can be muted for managed applications and only allowed to be active under  given circumstances (e.g. only allow notifications when an application is active). It is recommended that notifications  only appear for managed applications when devices are unlocked. This recommendation is applied at the OFFICIAL:  Sensitive and PROTECTED levels. It is recommended that managed applications be configured through a MDM solution  to not be removable, to avoid users inadvertently uninstalling allowed applications.  Organisations implementing MDM solutions are encouraged to select products evaluated against the MDM Agent  module of NIAP’s MDFPP.  Organisations operating in higher risk situations are encouraged to engage with ASD when developing and  implementing MDM solutions.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Mobile Device Management’ topic in the ISM.  Bring Your Own Device  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  BYODs have a higher risk of inadvertently introducing malware into an organisation’s networks, and are at higher risk of  infection with malicious applications or software before they are configured for handling sensitive or classified data.  Therefore, organisations should understand the risks around allowing privately-owned devices onto their networks, and  ensure they follow ASD guidance.  As long as a device is enrolled in an MDM and is appropriately configured, devices handling OFFICIAL: Sensitive data  can be BYOD.  https://www.niap-ccevs.org/profile/Info.cfm?PPID=441&id=441  10  Additional information can be found under the ‘Privately-owned mobile devices’ topic in the ISM and in the ACSC’s Risk  Management of Enterprise Mobility Including Bring Your Own Device  publication.  Managed Open-In  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Devices not correctly configured for Managed Open-In, risk allowing un-assessed applications from being loaded onto  devices. These applications may not meet data at rest and data in transit requirements for handling sensitive or  classified data.  Managed Open-In is built into the iOS platform and configured by MDM solutions. Managed Open-In allows  organisations to decide which applications or accounts configured on devices can access sensitive or classified data.  Even if devices are configured in a ‘work only’ mode with no personal enablement, Managed Open-In can be used to  ensure PROTECTED data is only held in, and moved between, applications that have appropriate data at rest and data  in transit protections implemented.  In-app accounts will need to be managed properly as users can manually switch from an enterprise account to a  personal account of a managed Open-In application.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application control’ and ‘Hardening application configurations’ topics in  the ISM.  Virtual Private Network  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Required Required  Risks  Not using a VPN risks exposing data (and metadata) in transit to increased visibility by any entities on the networks the  data traverses. This may increase an organisation’s attack surface, as alternatives may require servers to be directly  connected to the internet.  All data communicated by devices handling sensitive or classified data must be through a VPN. Typically BYOD and  Corporately Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE) configurations will use a ‘per-app’ VPN, but some deployments will  have a risk profile where they are required to use a whole device ‘always on’ VPN configuration. The built-in IPsec IKEv2  VPN client can be configured via profile for either type. This can be changed dynamically to suit the deployment  requirements.  ‘Per-account’ VPN allows managed accounts to be channelled through a specific VPN tunnel. This allows multiple email  accounts to be pushed by MDM through separate VPN tunnels, yet still be inside the Managed Open-In boundary. For  example, Microsoft Exchange has two emails accounts (one for OFFICIAL and another for PROTECTED) each one  connected through a separate VPN tunnel on the same device.  ‘Per-app, per protocol’ VPN allows exceptions from either per-app VPN or always on VPN, through MDM policy. The  primary use-case is for Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) / Unified communications (UC) applications that use User  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/remote-working-and-secure-mobility/secure-mobility/risk-management-enterprise-mobility-including-bring-your-own-device  11  Datagram Protocol (UDP), but could apply to downloading public data such as mapping data outside of a VPN tunnel.  Misconfigurations of the per-app, per protocol VPN can potentially introduce a security vulnerability into deployments.  Addition information can be found under the ‘Connecting mobile devices to the internet’ topic in the ISM.  Backups  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Without regular backups, sensitive or classified data may be irrecoverable should only a local copy of the data exist and  become inaccessible. However, with unapproved backup solutions, sensitive or classified data may be extracted and  then stored on, or transit over, systems that are not suitable for the sensitivity or classification of the data.  The configuration of devices is set by an MDM solution, and is restored whenever a device is enrolled. Whether  backups are necessary depends on the nature of applications in use on devices. For example, email or chat applications  are almost always synchronised with backend server storage, and thus do not require a backup from devices.  If data of organisational value is being created on devices, careful application selection or development can negate the  need for organisational data to require backup explicitly from devices, because it is synchronised to servers implicitly  (such as using a Content Management System that has a client with a File Sharing Extension). Note that in BYOD or  COPE configurations, backup of personal content is generally desirable for users but covered by consumer solutions  such as iCloud backup. Managed applications and accounts containing sensitive or classified data can be excluded from  the backups of personal content using appropriate configuration from a MDM solution.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Data backup and restoration’ section in the ISM.  Email applications  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Devices may over-classify all emails if they aren’t able to be marked individually by the originator, as they may be set to  the maximum sensitivity or classification by default. Alternatively, devices may under-classify all emails if there is no  protective marking set by email clients or servers.  If an email client does not support the application of protective markings to emails, organisations should consider  configuring email servers to allow for manual protective marking of emails by users. In some cases, installing a managed  keyboard, to simplify marking of emails, will be more convenient for users than manually typing out protective  markings.  The native email client on iOS is approved for PROTECTED data when configured in accordance with ASD guidance. See  the iOS Encryption section for more details.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Email usage’ section in the ISM.  12  Microsoft Office for iOS  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  iOS devices do not currently run Microsoft Office macros and therefore many of the risks associated with handling  Office documents are not relevant at this time. As this is a feature of a third-party vendor, continual monitoring of this  risk will need to be undertaken.  Organisations looking to implement Microsoft Office for iOS should refer to the ‘Application hardening’ section in the  ISM.  iOS Calendar  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not Recommended  Risks  Should there be sensitive or classified data in iOS Calendar data and metadata, these will not be stored with sufficient  protection for sensitive or classified data.  iOS Calendar allows synchronising calendar entries across accounts and devices. The iOS Calendar interacts with other  applications to detect dates and times and suggest entries to be submitted to the calendar.  When using the iOS Calendar, attachments are afforded Class A data protection, but calendar data and metadata (such  as the title of an event and any notes or details) are afforded only Class C protection. Therefore, authorising officers  should make an informed risk decision about the use of the iOS Calendar for OFFICIAL: Sensitive data, and should not  include PROTECTED data in any iOS Calendar event other than within calendar attachments.  iOS Contacts  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  iOS Contacts does not store details with sufficient protection for sensitive or classified data.  iOS Contacts implements specific controls set by a MDM solution for the flow of contact information between managed  and unmanaged spaces. For example, whether a managed contact can be used to display a person’s name at the lock  screen, instead of their phone number for an incoming call.  iOS Contacts data is stored on the device in a Class C container and, if names and phone numbers are considered  PROTECTED data by an organisation, consideration should be given to using a dedicated application to manage such  contacts.  13  iOS Camera  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  Photos and videos taken with iOS Camera are stored locally and may be transferred automatically to locations that do  not have sufficient protection for sensitive or classified data.  In BYOD and COPE devices, or deployments where photographs may be considered PROTECTED data, consider using a  dedicated purpose-built camera app that stores photos in a Class A container.  iOS Camera uses Class C data protection to store photographs, and depending on the configuration set by a MDM  solution, may be allowed to synchronise data to iCloud Photo Stream or to a user’s personal unmanaged device.  iOS Books  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Not recommended  Risks  iOS Books does not store data with sufficient protection for sensitive or classified data.  A MDM solution can push iBook, ePub and PDF documents into iOS Books on devices. Such documents are considered  managed by built-in controls and are not included in backups, nor can they be moved to unmanaged destinations or  synchronised to iCloud. However, any PROTECTED documents must use a dedicated application that uses Class A data  protection.  iOS Books uses Class C data protection, so it is only suitable for OFFICIAL: Sensitive or below documents.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Application hardening’ section in the ISM.  Location services  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Organisation decision Organisation decision  Risks  Through the use of location services, information based on devices’ physical location is obtained and used by Apple and  third-party applications for various location-based services. To determine the location of devices, location services can  use GPS, Bluetooth, crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular tower locations.  Configuration by a MDM solution can control when location services are used (e.g. allow once, allow when active and  always allow) and accuracy (precise or approximate).  Additional information can be found under the ‘Radio Frequency devices’ topic in the ISM.  14  Multi-factor authentication  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Recommended Recommended  Risks  If multi-factor authentication is not implemented for application accounts on devices, compromised login credentials  would allow unauthorised access to devices. Multi-factor authentication, when using biometrics, also provides an  additional layer of security that strongly binds the identity of the user to a device. Note however, the authentication of  the user to a MDM solution only occurs at device enrolment.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Multi-factor authentication’ topic in the ISM.  Domain Name System  OFFICIAL: Sensitive PROTECTED  Recommended Recommended  Risks  The protection of the Domain Name System (DNS) service is critical for the translation of Uniform Resource Locator  (URL) addresses to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Starting from iOS 13, new features around the use of a DNS proxy  to channel all DNS resolution via a secure channel, or using encrypted DNS, were introduced.  Additional information can be found under the ‘Host-based intrusion prevention system’ and ‘Software firewall’ topics  in the ISM.  Additional considerations  iOS 14 introduces a number of new security features to the Apple iOS platform. For example, iOS 14 will attempt to  randomise the MAC address when there is a network probe from a new network. Through MDM configuration, this  feature can be disabled for instances when the iOS platform is connecting to an organisation owned and controlled  network. In addition, as of iOS 14, Siri now processes user requests locally and single sign-on (SSO) extensions, used for  authentication, will support per application VPN connections allowing a list of associated and excluded domains to  interact with particular per application VPN configurations.  15  Glossary of cyber security terms  Term Meaning  application control An approach in which only an explicitly defined set of approved  applications permitted to execute on systems.

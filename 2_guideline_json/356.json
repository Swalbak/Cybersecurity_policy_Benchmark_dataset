This roadmap follows the reports that ENISA has published throughout 2017 and 2018 on this  subject-matter: Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the  Judiciary (ENISA, 2018), which focused on the aspects of the cooperation across the three  communities; Review of Behavioural Sciences Research in the Field of Cybersecurity (ENISA,  2018a), which focused on human aspects of cybersecurity; Tools and Methodologies to Support  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017), which focused on  technical aspects; and Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal  and Organisational Aspects (ENISA, 2017a), which focused on the legal and organisational  issues of cooperation. All these reports are available on the ENISA website.  When these entities – CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary – cooperate, they face challenges that have  been categorised as being technical, legal, organisational and/or human behaviour as they  associate with organisational culture. Understanding these challenges is essential to tackle  them, further enhance the cooperation and thus better fight against cybercrime. This roadmap  aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE, as well as their interaction with the  judiciary in their fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the aforementioned  cooperation aspects and by identifying current shortcomings and making recommendations to  further enhance cooperation. The geographical coverage of this roadmap is mainly limited to  the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.  The data for this roadmap was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter  experts and an online survey. The data collected has demonstrated that CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary mainly face a range of cooperation challenges. The legal framework is one of the most  frequently mentioned ones that acts as impeding data exchange; discrepancies in technical or  legal knowledge is another one, as it may make communication challenging; the chain of  custody in evidence collection might also be an issue when using methods that might make  evidence likely inadmissible to a criminal trial. Incident notifications and cybercrime reporting  differ from one Member State to another as different legal obligations might have been set by  their national laws.  The core recommendations identified to improve cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their  interaction with the judiciary are as follows.  ENISA:   to promote the use of ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix for avoiding conflicting roles  throughout the cybercrime investigation lifecycle   to provide guidance for building a competency framework for cybersecurity workforce   to promote knowledge of digital forensics rules   to promote interoperability of cooperation tools deployed and conceived considering  future technologies   to assess the suitability of cybersecurity certification for common tools and processes  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  6  Member States:   to define and implement a national framework for cooperation having all the  communities involved   to use the ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix for assigning roles and responsibilities  throughout the cybercrime investigation lifecycle aiming to get all communities involved   to develop national competency framework and education and training policies   to promote joint trainings, common inter-community technical and table-top exercises  carried out by competent people   to take into account interoperability requirements when conceiving tools  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE  Collecting information on current cooperation between CSIRTs and LE communities is a key  step to enhance it. In 2018, the ENISA report on CSIRT and LE cooperation aimed to present  aspects of cooperation between the two communities by adding the important dimension of  their interaction with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges); the purpose of this roadmap is to  allow to better apprehend subtle aspects of the cooperation and challenges lying ahead.  This roadmap analyses the practices used by various countries when cooperating in order to  better manage the cybersecurity incidents, identifies the key hindrances that prevent or limit  effective cooperation, and looks for examples of good practices through which cooperation can  be strengthened and further enhanced.  Importantly, ENISA aims at using this roadmap as guidance to plan its policy support activities  in the forthcoming period of its multiannual work programme planning.  1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE REPORT  In 2018, ENISA published a report addressing aspects of the cooperation between CSIRTs and  LE to fight against cybercrime, along with their interaction with the judiciary. The 2018 ENISA  report on Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  (ENISA, 2018) confirmed that CSIRTs interact much more with LE than with the prosecutors  and that they interact very rarely with the judiciary; cultural limitations set additional hindrances  to this cooperation. There are legal provisions concerning CSIRTs and LE cooperation and their  interaction with the judiciary; it is broadly accepted that the use of common tools to facilitate  cooperation and interaction seems to be one of the key success factors for effectively fighting  cybercrime.  As highlighted in the 7th ENISA/EC3 workshop for national and governmental CSIRTs and their  LE counterparts (ENISA, 2018c), the theme of interaction across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  is extremely important. In the context of the fight against cybercrime, it was also highlighted that  there is a need to leverage on joint trainings to bring these communities closer together in terms  of cooperating.  The ENISA programming document 2019-2021 includes ‘Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building’. Under this objective, ‘Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LE has the goal to build upon the progress  ENISA has made in supporting different operational communities (e.g. CSIRTs, LE, European  [Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre] FI-ISAC) to enhance mutually  satisfactory ways to collaborate and support exchange of good practices among different  stakeholders in operational communities in Europe (ENISA, 2018b, p. 53).  This roadmap follows up on previous ENISA work and it contributes to the implementation of  the ENISA programming document 2019-2021, Output O.4.2.2, in particular to what is planned  for as ‘A roadmap of further activities on CSIRT/LE cooperation along with their interaction with  the judiciary’.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  8  While this roadmap was initially conceived as a document not for publication (to be shared with  selected stakeholders only), because of the more general interest that this document might  have, the decision was taken to publish it.  1.3 ROADMAP OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  1.3.1 Roadmap objectives  The main objectives of this roadmap are as follows:   To gather further information and discuss the current cooperation across CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary as far as it concerns their fight against cybercrime.   To provide information on the technical, legal, organisational and cultural aspects of  their cooperation and interaction.   To formulate and propose recommendations to further enhance the cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  1.3.2 Roadmap scope  The roadmap focuses on aspects of cooperation between CSIRTs (national/governmental  CSIRTs) and LE, and their interaction with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  The geographical coverage is limited to the EU (European Union, 2019) and EFTA (EFTA,  n.d.) (1) countries. (See also (ENISA, 2015a)). This does not mean however that all these  countries are covered in the roadmap and that no reference to other countries outside the EU  and EFTA is made. Comparison between the EU and EFTA, or between the EU and the United  States, or the EU and Asia (e.g. ASEAN), also fall outside the scope of this report.  This roadmap does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary to fight against cybercrime (which includes crimes where a  computer is an object and crimes where a computer is a tool of crime) in all sectors (from  finance to energy, from transport to health).  The fight against terrorism, cyberwarfare, cyber espionage by nation states, as well as the  enforcement of rights in civil and administrative courts, are outside the scope of this roadmap,  although some of the considerations developed might be extended to such areas.  This roadmap does not aim to present an exhaustive set of instances of cooperation across  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, rather it seeks to facilitate the drawing of meaningful conclusions  and recommendations for further enhancing their cooperation and interaction.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience are mainly CSIRTs (mainly national and governmental CSIRTs  but not limited to them), LE, prosecutors, and judges as well as individuals and organisations  with an interest in NIS.  For the purposes of this roadmap, the definition of each community is listed below:   Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency  response team (CERT) is ‘an organisation that studies computer and network security  to provide incident response services to victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning  vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other information to help improve computer  (1) In this report ‘n.d.’ stands for ‘no date’ and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the  cited source.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  9  and network security’. At present, ‘both terms (CERT and CSIRT) are used in a  synonymous manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term’ (ENISA, 2015a, p. 7)  (ENISA, 2015, p. 12) (ENISA, 2016a, p. 10). Governmental CSIRTs (Council, 2016a)  are teams whose constituency are the public administration networks (ENISA, 2017);   Law enforcement (LE), law-enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police  agencies police and police agencies are terms used in this report, and are  synonymous, and used to refer to police and police agencies, also used as  synonymous. LE is ‘any public authority competent for the prevention, investigation,  detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,  including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security’  (Official Journal of the European Union, 2016);   Judiciary refers both to prosecutors and judges (a similar approach taken in (Council  of the European Union, 2017). Prosecutor refers to ‘a legal official who accuses  someone of committing a crime, especially in a [criminal] law court’ (Cambridge  Dictionary, n.d.). Judge refers to a person who is in charge of a court of law and who  makes final decisions.  Additionally, policy and lawmakers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as  the recommendations of this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for enhancing  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs and their interaction with the judiciary.  http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12711-2017-INIT/en/pdf  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  10  2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 INFORMATION COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS USED  The methodology chosen for creating this roadmap is largely inspired by the methodology used  in previous ENISA reports (ENISA, 2017), (ENISA, 2017a), (ENISA, 2018). This approach  represents a tested practice that is suitable for the purpose of data collection and analysis for  policy support in cybersecurity. Data for this roadmap was collected through desk research,  interviews with subject-matter experts and via an online survey. A qualitative methodological  approach has mainly been used due to the rather new field addressed; however, some  quantitative data were also collected: an online survey was carried out to validate and  complement the findings from the desk research and the interviews.  2.1.1  Desk research  Initial desk research was carried out based on publicly available information sources, including  ENISA publications. The findings from this desk research were particularly useful for the  scoping of the report and for drafting the questionnaire to support the interviews.  Supplementary desk research was conducted to address certain specific topics that the project  team deemed appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected  via the interviews.  2.1.2 Interviews and written replies to the questionnaire  A total of 31 subject-matter experts from 22 Member States replied to the questionnaire either  via structured interviews or with written replies. Of the respondents, 12 were experts from the  CSIRT community (mainly but not exclusively from national/governmental CSIRTs), 18 from the  LE community (mainly national police but also one from a local police force), and one from the  judiciary community.  Figure 1: Overview of communities of respondents to the interview  CSIRT 41%  LE 56%  Judiciary 3%  CSIRT LE Judiciary  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  11  A questionnaire (see Annex C – Questionnaire to support the subject-matter expert interviews)  was prepared to support the interviews. Most questions were open. For all questions, including  yes/no questions, interviewees could add comments and additional information.  The interviews included some questions common to CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, followed by  a specific set of questions for each community.  The interviews were carried out from June to mid-July 2019. They were conducted either face  to face or via phone and they lasted around 1 hour each. Interviewees received the questions in  advance and in most cases they had the opportunity to review the notes taken by the  interviewers (ENISA project team) with their replies and validate them.  Two out of 31 respondents opted to submit written replies only. Some interviewees completed  also the online survey.  The questionnaire developed to collect data for this 2019 roadmap that addresses the issue of  cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary and aims to collect more in-depth information  on technical, legal, organisational and cultural aspects of their cooperation.  The interview questions started with a set of common questions for all participants to answer,  followed by three sets of specific questions for CSIRTs, LE or judiciary to answer respectively.  2.1.3 Online survey  An online survey was carried out to collect additional data to validate and further substantiate  some findings. It was comprised of 25 questions (see Annex D – Questions in the online  survey), most of them with closed answers and some with the possibility to add additional  comments and provide more details related to the answers.  The survey was developed using EUSurvey (2), a survey tool which is ‘supported by the  European Commission’s ISA programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for  European public administrations’.  The invitation to complete the survey was disseminated via:   a closed ENISA mailing list of European national and governmental CSIRTs;   a Europol mailing list of the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF (3)), which is  ‘composed of the heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU  Member States and Europol. (Council of the European Union, 2017b, p. 13).  The survey was launched in June 2019 and was open for around 2 weeks. The data collected  via the online survey was used to validate the data collected through the desk research and the  interviews and used to produce some statistical graphs.  A total of 33 replies (4) were received. Of these (5), 24 were from EU Member States and EFTA  countries (EFTA, n.d.) and one from a non-EU/non-EFTA country. It must be noted that the  reply from non-EU/non-EFTA country was somewhat in line with the other replies received and  has been used to formulate general considerations; however, the graphs in this roadmap were  (2) https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/welcome  (3) In execution of the JHA Council conclusions of 27-28 November 2008 and of the 26 April 2010, Europol, together with  the European Commission and the EU Member States, have set up the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF)  composed of the Heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU Member States and Europol. The  EUCTF is an interagency group formed to allow the Heads of Cybercrime Units, Europol, the European Commission and  Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the  EU and beyond.  (4) ENISA is not privy of the exact number of recipients of the Europol list. The ENISA mailing list is approximately 63.

In total, 11 respondents out of 33 in the EU and EFTA, were from the CSIRT community, 21  from the LE community and one belonged to both of these communities; no replies were  received from the judiciary. An overview of the composition of the EU and EFTA respondents,  based on the community they belong to, is presented hereinafter in Figure 2.  Figure 2: Overview of communities of respondents to the online survey  2.2 DATA USED TO DEVELOP THE RECOMMENDATIONS  The recommendations in this report (see Chapter 5) have been developed based on research  findings of this report.  2.3 SELECTION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE STAKEHOLDERS  The project team discussed and agreed on criteria to use to ensure contribution of a wide range  of stakeholders. The following criteria (which were not prioritised but considered as equal) were  used for the selections of interviewees:   CSIRTs/LE/judiciary community   geographical location   size of country (population)   level of maturity in CSIRT-LE cooperation   level of CSIRT maturity (6)   size of the CSIRT   relevant jurisdiction  (6) On CSIRT maturity, see (ENISA, n.d.a).

ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.).  Four of them contributed to this roadmap by supporting the data collection and the drafting  while two were reviewers. The two CEI experts contributing as reviewers reviewed this  roadmap in several rounds including the first draft in May 2019, an intermediate draft in June  2019, the semi-final and the final draft in July 2019.  All six experts contributed ad personam.  These experts contributed inter alia with their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime, including  but not limited to CSIRT and law cooperation, operational cooperation, information sharing to  handle incidents and to fight against cybercrime.  (7) The ENISA CEI list comprises of experts in various NIS subject-matters that have been selected according to a  procedure in line with the ENISA financial regulation; these experts are called upon by ENISA from time to time to  support the Agency in carrying out its operational duties.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  14  3. CSIRTS, LE AND THE JUDICIARY:  STATE OF PLAY  This chapter presents the state of play for the cooperation across the three communities. This  chapter also discusses cases that lack cooperation; examples for cybercrime cases that  cooperation is required are also presented.  3.1 LACK OF COOPERATION  The extent to which cooperation and information sharing among the three communities is taking  place varies considerably across Member States due to various reasons. As seen in Figure 3,  in some countries, cooperation is universally accepted as a necessary measure, required by  law, implemented in guidelines and internal policies and supported by implementation of  technical, organisational and procedural measures; while in others, the cooperation is limited to  providing information (in the form of evidence or witness testimony) when requested by the LE  or the judiciary. Figure 4 depicts that all three communities agree that cooperation across  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary should be mainly regulated by national legislation.  Figure 3: Replies to question 22 of the online survey conducted for this roadmap  6%  19%  19%  13%  28%  41%  3%  3%  No formal rules in place  Internal policies  Legal framework  Replies  Q22.

By working closely together the  communities may achieve increased effectivity of mitigation of cybersecurity incidents as well  as of cybercrime investigations, better quality of electronic evidence, greater availability of  expertise and specialised technical tools, improved availability of information about relevant  vulnerabilities and threats, increased effectivity of response to the large-scale attacks on  national infrastructure, and ultimately therefore, greater security in society.  Following chapters of this roadmap examine the possible reasons for the lack of cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary is highlighted and present the tools and mechanisms  through which this cooperation can be promoted at EU and national level.  Not all cyber incidents are cybercrimes (so LE do not need to be informed) and not all  cybercrimes are considered cyber incidents (so CSIRTs do not need to be informed). This  means that LE and CSIRTs do not always have the same interest in incidents or investigations,  which also affects the way they further handle each case. Since cybercrime crosses borders,  cooperation among countries is often crucial in the fight against it. In this regard, at least three  difficulties are identified:  1. Political difficulties. Some Member States are reluctant to cooperate because they  prefer to achieve the investigative results on their own. Sometimes this is linked to a  political vision that considers collaboration across operational communities as erosion  of sovereign state powers as cybersecurity has entered the diplomatic realm  (European Commission, 2018a). In particular, it seems that diplomacy encounters  difficulties to promote EU values, interests and principles in the cyber domain.  Moreover, there are some issues in supporting aimed at strengthening capacities of  partner countries and organisations in the field of cybercrime (EU Council, 2016),  (Moret E., Pawlak P., 2017). .  2. Legal difficulties. At European level, there are different regulations related to the  cybercrime depending on the state. This makes the interaction for CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary more difficult.  3%  3%  13%  28%  34%  53%  75%  Common soft-law  Other  No need for an additional legal instrument  Internal rules of each organization  EU legislation  MoU/Agreements  National legislation  Replies  22A.

Difficulties related to different mindset approaches. CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  have different approaches or mindsets, which also derives from the different  educational and scientific backgrounds. In particular, CSIRTs have a ‘technical  mentality’ while the judiciary has a ‘legal mentality’. The LE have partly a ‘legal  mentality’ and partly a ‘technical mentality’ that is entrenched in how society operates  in the area of crime. The different mentalities make communication among these three  entities not always easy. This can also lead to limitations of cooperation or at least a  slowdown in cooperation.  Despite these three obstacles, there are some improvements in cooperation among CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary at the European Union level. This derives from a set of factors. For  instance, European Union acts aimed at encouraging cooperation; big complex transnational  cases (see Petya (EC3, 2017), NotPetya (Europol, 2019), WannaCry (ENISA, 2017b), etc.)  have changed the perception of the need for cooperation; and training and education needs in  the area of cooperation have also been highlighted through reports (ENISA, 2017a); (ENISA,  2018).  National legal framework and CSIRT type are some of the major differentiators when it comes  to frequency and level of cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary. National and  governmental CSIRTs are usually more involved in this type of cooperation, especially those  that are functioning under a National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) type organisation.  Obviously, operating under the same governmental umbrella, or even working at the same  facilities, enables organisations to better know each other and to benefit from a higher mutual  trust both organisationally and personally. Another important aspect of this setup is that it poses  less legal challenges for cooperation and information sharing (e.g. CSIRT is not considered an  external organisation). Background check of the CSIRT staff is just one example of things that  increase the level of trust from the LE perspective.  Interviews show a strong trend regarding cooperation obstacles, the majority of those being  attributed to procedural difficulties and legal issues. Cultural and organisational difficulties, may  be seen as a major issue; however, interviewees have identified those cooperation challenges  as less aggravating. (See Figures 5, 6).

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  17  Figure 6: Replies to question 2 of the online survey  3.2 EXAMPLES OF CYBERCRIME CASES WHERE COOPERATION IS  REQUIRED  When cooperating in a cybercrime investigation case, each entity shares its expertise to move  the case forward. LE conducts the investigation following the instructions of the  magistrate/prosecutor who determines the strategic options. The magistrate usually decides  whether to use coercion or not (seize, searches, interception) while LE conduct investigations  on field. Coercion-based acts as well as open sources investigation provide a lot of data that  need to be analysed and processed. In this phase, CSIRT expertise might be needed, having  required internal skills and tools.  Some big complex transnational cases are presented below:   Altran was one of the most important European IT consulting companies. At the beginning  of 2019, it was struck by a ransomware attack a few weeks before markets financial  publication. Stocks took a hit and a few month later, Altran was bought out by Capgemini  (Capgemini, 2019). Cooperation between CSIRT and LE took place immediately: Altran  was in contact with several critical infrastructures. As such, national CSIRT was first  responder on site. They collected evidence and then provided it to LE for investigation.   Sytech leak (Abrams, 2019): on 18 July, 0v1ru$, a so far-unknown hacking group,  published allegedly leaked Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) data. Screenshots  published on twitter showed interface of internal network as well as a massive  (7 Terabytes or 7 000 gigabytes) amount of leaked data. Most of these data were  concerning FSB Unit 71330 spying and surveillance projects. Among them, a Tor de-  anonymisation project which had been previously suspected by researchers. Data were  then passed to Digital Revolution group who put it at journalists’ disposal.   NotPetya attack (Andy Greenberg, 2018): this attack was conducted through the Ukraine  main tax-paying application which infected entire parts of the country’s economy as well  as other big foreign companies (A.P. Moller-Maersk, Saint-Gobain S.A., Merck KGaA).  3%  3%  3%  6%  13%  16%  16%  16%  No answer provided  Technical  Organizational  Culture change  Skillset discrepancies  Other  Procedural  Legal  Replies  Q2.

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  18  Looking more of a wiper than a ransomware, because lacking decrypting capabilities,  NotPetya was an attack, seemingly, against a country. Because of the very complex  technical architecture used by attacker and extensive planning they seem to have  conducted, investigations showed to be very heavy and technical. CSIRT provided its  technical expertise.   Botnet takedown (usually requires a close and efficient cooperation and coordination  among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary from different countries. The Avalanche botnet  dismantling (Eurojust, 2016) was a 4 years operation which implied a strong CSIRT-LE  cooperation. German BKA, criminal police, and BSI, national CSIRT, worked together for  4 years to takedown the infrastructure.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  19  4. COOPERATION ASPECTS  4.1 ORGANISATIONAL ASPECTS  4.1.1 Organisational structure  4.1.1.1 Segregation of duties per community  Each community has its own discreet set of responsibilities, duties, expertise, powers and  technical and procedural tools. Sometimes, however, duties and responsibilities overlap, and  this might lead to undesirable interference to each other’s activities. Therefore, it is important for  the communities to understand each other’s duties.  For this purpose, the segregation of duties matrix (SoD) developed in the 2018 ENISA report on  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE: interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2018) could be  used in order to highlight conflicting or overlapping duties performed by one community or  more. Not only does this matrix identify the key responsibilities for each community but it also  links them with the skills required to fulfil these duties by presenting appropriate training topics  that should be provided (8).  When using the SoD matrix, it is necessary to identify the key roles of individual communities.  CSIRTs are responsible to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of systems within  their constituency. LE aims to trace offenders and gather evidence that describes the course of  the offence and show offenders’ guilt. On the basis of the results of the work of the law  enforcement authorities, the judiciary assesses the factual and legal conclusions resulting from  the evidence obtained and decides on guilt and punishment.  The CSIRTs’ role is to prevent incidents from happening by implementing appropriate security  measures or suggesting such measures to their constituency. And in the event of an incident,  their aim is to detect and analyse the incident and apply appropriate measures, remedy the  damage and subsequently secure the exploited vulnerabilities, or other existing threats. As first  responders, however, they could be also responsible for advising their constituency to report  the incident to LE (or in some cases they might have themselves a duty to report), expected to  share the information with other sectors or targeted industries, and required to provide  necessary assistance to other communities and collect evidence.  LE is dedicated to investigate cybercrimes and investigate possible culprits. They have legal  power to mandate entities to cooperate in the investigation and disclose information or to  contribute to the investigation in different ways: seizes, searches, and interceptions. LE  responsibility is to collect evidence in a lawful way, even if it may challenge remediation or  business continuity. Of course, they seek to avoid further consequences to the victims, but  sometimes, evidence collection can postpone remediation or return to normal.  The roles of the judicial authorities vary, as public prosecutors or investigative  judges/magistrates usually direct the course of an investigation, to authorise some investigative  actions, to analyse and interpret collected evidence and provide legal assistance to the LE. The  court judges have the authority to authorise some investigative measures, to admit and assess  the evidence provided by LE and prosecutors, and ultimately decide who the victim is, who the  (8) ENISA does not keep track of whether and, if so, who adopted and implemented the SoD matrix in practice, so it is not  known what its use looks like in practice and for what purposes and to what extent it is actually used.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  20  offender is, what the crime was and how the offender should be punished. In addition, the  judicial authorities should act in such a way as to ensure that fundamental rights are respected  during the investigations as well as during the trial. Examples of fundamental rights are the  Right to a fair trial and Right to an effective remedy (Council of Europe, 1950), Article 6 and  Article 13 and (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012) Article 47, Right to  respect for private and family life ( (Council of Europe, 1950), Article 8 and (European Union,  2012) Article 7), Right to no punishment without law ( (Council of Europe, 1950) Article 7 and  (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012) Article 49), Prohibition of  discrimination ( (Council of Europe, 1950) Article 14 and (EU Parliament, EU Charter of  Fundamental Rights, 2012) Article 21).  The role, the powers and responsibilities however vary greatly in individual states. There are  significant differences also at European level. More in-depth information on the role of all of the  communities can be found in 2018 ENISA report Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE:  interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2018).  4.1.1.2 Indicative example of Segregation of duties matrix  Figure 7 depicts a very indicative example of a SoD matrix. It is not based on a specific legal  system. Depending on the country and its legal system this duty matrix might be different and  show different segregation of duties.  As seen in the matrix, the activities of crime have been categorised based on the timeline of a  crime; in particular, we have activities prior to an incident/crime, during the incident/crime and  post incident/crime activities.  The following SoD matrix presents, with all its limitations due to abstraction and generalisation,  how individual duties and responsibilities may be assigned among the three communities. As  seen in Table 1 there might be overlapping duties performed by more than one communities.  Once there is lack of coordination, this can lead to interference with each other’s activities,  which can have a negative impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of their work. It is  therefore appropriate in these cases that the relevant communities agree on rules for the  segregation of duties in order to prevent these negative effects.

This flowchart is a continuation of last year’s information flowchart  focusing on the investigation phase of a cybercrime (ENISA, 2018, p. 40). This graphical  representation, with all the limitations due to abstraction and generalisation, presents actions  taken during the investigation phase; although criminal investigation seems to be under LE  duties, it is worthwhile to mention that CSIRTs’ technical expertise and judicial authorities’  viewpoint are needed in order the investigation to be completed.  Figure 7: Graphical representation of the flow of information across CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary: Analysis of the investigation phase  4.1.1.4 Complementarity of duties  Each community’s duty is part of a process which lead to identifying cybercrime perpetrator(s)  and building a safer internet. CSIRTs focus on remediation and business continuity while LE  objective is to identify the perpetrator and then the judiciary will guarantee the legal prosecution  so the culprit can be charged and brought before the competent court. Figure 8 depicts the  roles and duties of each community are illustrated in the graph below.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  23  Figure 8: Roles and duties per community  Even though each community has different goals, means, powers and duties, their  responsibilities are complementary. The key goal of the CSIRTs is to ensure availability,  integrity and confidentiality of networks and systems within their constituency; however, when  the security is threatened by external attackers, they would need law enforcement to identify the  attacker and prevent him from further attacks. On the other hand, to successfully identify and  prosecute the attacker, law enforcement might need information, data, expertise or equipment  that in some cases might be available exclusively to the CSIRTs. Finally, in order for the  judiciary to be able to convict and punish the attacker, they need actionable electronic evidence  so as to understand how the attacker operates and what the electronic evidence suggests.  Therefore, the activities of each individual community must be coordinated. In some cases,  there are internal security policies of each organisation, or common policy for both communities  that govern the information sharing between certain CSIRTs and LE. Such internal security  policies can improve cooperation between CSIRTs and LE by allowing the CSIRTs to acquire a  greater knowledge of e-evidence collection requirements and develop compliant operational  practices.  4.1.1.5 Discrepancies in finalities: investigation vs remediation  Evidence collection   Investigation: needs for evidence collection  Evidence must be collected in a lawful manner. If a specific law, applying to all  involved communities, outlines detailed standards to handle an investigation, it must  be applied and interpreted within the scope and in the meaning of other legal  instruments, national and possibly international, that are aimed at protecting  fundamental rights (9).  Forensic evidence collection must guarantee evidence data have not been altered or  tampered with. To do so, investigators must for instance use write blockers (10).  Should a member of LE staff not do this, the lawyer of the defendant could argue that  there had been evidence alteration by the police.  Each step of evidence collection is bordered, whether in a technical manner, by  imposing use of vetted tools, or controlled by a magistrate. In case of interception,  some specific operations can only be carried out by using tools vetted by a dedicated  commission.  (9) For more on differences between common and civil law systems please see subchapter 4.4.1.4. below.  (10) A writing blocker is a system aimed at avoiding any alteration of the target device during copy. It is mandatory to  guarantee proof relevance in trial.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  24   Remediation: may destroy evidence  Depending on the IT infrastructure affected as well as the processes and procedures  used for backup and logging, remediation without proper evidence preservation could  actually destroy evidence and may complicate investigations further.  For instance, re-imaging of an infected workstation can delete information about a  malware family. This can be prevented by firstly collecting volatile data (live data,  before shutting down the machine: network connections, running apps/processes,  paging file, memory dump, etc.) and then taking a full disk image. In virtualised  environments, such activities can be done by simply taking a virtual machine snapshot  before the re-image.  The functioning of CSIRTs is not as strictly regulated as in the case of LE, and  therefore they are more flexible to choose appropriate measures to deal with an  incident. However, if CSIRT members are not familiar with the law enforcement  processes, the handling of the electronic evidence and the legal requirements for  evidence admissibility, their activities may render the digital evidence inadmissible and  therefore useless for criminal prosecution.  Based on the online survey results (see Figure 9), the most critical phase where cooperation is  of great importance is the evidence collection phase. During this phase, LE may request CSIRT  experts for support in order to lead complex technical activities; LE may have limited internal  resources for the technical analysis.  Figure 9: Replies to question Q6 of the online survey  Timing:  Timing of operations constitutes one of several discrepancies in the CSIRT/LE way of  intervention. An investigation often needs LE to access private data. As such, access to this  data is authorised mainly under a magistrate’s control and strictly ruled by law. This guarantees  civil liberties but the several layers of controls may introduce a lot of uncompressible delay.  Data access is usually managed by several tracking procedures which eventually generate red  tape. As an example, setup of an interception can take more than 1 week. Transnational  cooperation, especially outside the EU, is subject to an even more demanding set of  requirements and formalities.  3%  9%  19%  28%  41%  Detection and analysis  Post-incident activity  Preparation  Containment, eradication and recovery  Evidence collection  Replies  Q6. In which stage of the incident response life cycle, the  contribution of the CSIRT/LE/Judiciary would be helpful:  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  25  CSIRTs have as a main task to respond to and mitigate cyber incidents. When the cyber  incident has a cybercrime component the remediation part might interfere with the LE  investigation if proper cooperation and a remediation procedure has not been set in place. For  example host disinfection or reimage might erase the necessary evidence/traces for  investigations.  Because of the strict requirements that apply, LE timing is usually longer than that of CSIRTs.  While CSIRTs have to provide fast, sometimes immediate, response to incident, LE’s  investigations take longer to pursue. If first LE responders’ actions are quick to preserve  evidence, further investigation timeframes require time due to legal constraints. Investigations  imply evidence search and collection, warrants and request issues, analysis of new evidence  and so on. To be efficient, evidence analysis (malware samples, logs files, compromised hard  drive or memory dump) must be thorough and extensive. Evidence and IOCs extracted will then  trigger new research such as server seize, interception of IP, identification of an email or an ISP  account (Facebook account, Google account, etc.). Each of these steps may have to be vetted  by a magistrate which extends investigation duration. Furthermore, when European or  international cooperation is implied, MLATs (international warrants) use can take several  months to occur.  Another key factor that can delay the investigation is the innovative nature of cybercrime. It  comes with challenging legal questions that the current legal framework has not been  conceived for. For example, how to seize a bitcoin wallet outside the investigating police force’s  country? Cybercrime investigations trigger legal questioning which often fuel law modification.  No matter how long it takes, each legal question must be carefully discussed among all actors  (LE, magistrate, even Europol and Eurojust) and can postpone even more next investigation  steps.  During the remediation phase, there is limited time frame for action as systems need to be  recovered as soon as possible. Sometimes proper evidence collection or preservation would  increase significantly the remediation time which might have a negative impact from a business  perspective. That is why there are situations when the victim needs to decide on the priorities:  remediation vs investigation. CSIRTs need to be prepared to offer this consultancy to the  victims.  Taxonomy:  The vast majority of the CSIRTs use at least one taxonomy and that is because they usually  publish periodic reports on incidents handled and also because they process and share data  automatically. ENISA promoted the use of taxonomies in the CSIRT community as part of the  best practices sharing. (ENISA, 2016)  LE use taxonomies too but more often refer to legal definitions of crimes foreseen in the  criminal law framework, namely in the articles of the criminal code. In the criminal code each  crime/infringement is described in general terms. The main difference is those descriptions are  results-based: intrusion in a system is the act of unlawfully accessing someone else’s system.  Objectives are different: cybersecurity taxonomy defines how things have been done to be able  to identify vulnerabilities, correct them and reach a more secure situation after the incident than  before. The criminal law aims at having perpetrators punished and stopping the commission of  crimes. But the same issue can happen the next day from another perpetrator. Since the  criminal law is the base ground for any investigation work, LE often refer to legal definitions of  crimes. It is changing slowly because of the needed interactions with cybersecurity ecosystem  and, for investigations purposes, to be technically more efficient.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  26  There is however clear motivation to share a common language among the communities since  their cooperation is necessary. There are some common taxonomies available that can be used  to achieve mutual understanding. The common taxonomy developed by ENISA and Europol  lists and categorises most common cybersecurity incidents and links these incidents to relevant  offenses defined in the Directive on attacks against information systems (EU Council, 2013)  and CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001). Some countries also decided to  further develop their taxonomies – some included links to national criminal codes, definition of  incidents from CSIRTs’ perspective, or suggestions on how to proceed with incident mitigation,  report identified offences or collect evidence. In some cases, a glossary of terms, which defines  the meaning of certain terms used by individual communities, may also be appropriate in order  to further enhance mutual cooperation and understanding. Such a glossary could be especially  useful for the judiciary, since judges and public prosecutors have legal education and very  technical language may represent a challenge for them. An example of such a glossary that  also facilitates cross-border cooperation, as it contains definitions in the national language and  in English, can be the Cyber Security Glossary developed by the authorities of the Czech  Republic (Gov CERT CZ, 2015).  Figure 10 highlights that 45 % of LE respondents stated that they do not use any taxonomy or  glossary that would support mutual understanding of the communities.  Figure 10: Replies to question Q7 of the online survey  The judiciary tasks are based on the criminal law using in particular the criminal code that  applies to each national legal system; this is used as a basis to qualify the criminal  offences. However, adopting a common language is necessary in order to improve the  cooperation with the CSIRT and LE communities as there is lack of common  understanding. The judiciary usually have a legal background and might face challenges  with technical language and technical problems.  Currently, in criminal trials, the Court may ask for CSIRTs’ technical expertise in order to  explain technical concepts, such as IP addresses. This is because the judiciary are not  always familiar with technical terminology.

CSIRT LE Both CSIRT - LE  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  27  to receive more and more technical training that would help when dealing with cybercrime  cases.  The judiciary evaluate cybercrime through the criminal law (mainly but necessarily limited  to the criminal code) that determines which crimes and offences are punishable. As a form  of taxonomy, it is more results-oriented without focusing on how a crime has been  committed. As such, this would probably be very different from a standard taxonomy; as  long as systems have been hacked, details such as vulnerability exploitation, scam or  human errors could only be examined as aggravating factors when assessing the sentence  imposed. What the judiciary need to know is that the perpetrator is responsible for  infringing the system.  Based on the online survey results, what is of high importance is the CSIRT-LE taxonomy  to be based both on LE constraints and CSIRT environment (See Figure 11).  Figure 11: Replies to question Q3 of the online survey  4.1.2 Governance framework and compliance  4.1.2.1 Management practices  Management practices usually refer to the approaches that are followed by managers aiming to  make their organisation more efficient. Differences are highlighted in the management practices  used by each community and are presented below.   CSIRT approach: CSIRTs are usually small organisations with simple hierarchy (flat  organisations) and this is a key factor in the fast decision-making process. Another aspect  is that CSIRTs tend to have more operationally involved managers (or at least informal  leaders) to be able to make quick decisions for initiating the CSIRT’s key activity, i.e. the  22%  38%  31%  13%  22%  47%  19%  16%  44%  28%  22%  9%  High importance Medium importance Low importance No answer provided  R e p  lie s  Q3. Do you think that CSIRT-LE taxonomy should be based on:  LE constraints CSIRT environment A mix of the two  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  28  incident response. Some CSIRT may organise a form of polyvalence where a person can  be assigned to different tasks each week.   LE approach: At operational level, LE use a hierarchical organisational structure based on  ranks to ensure information flow and decision-making at the desired level. One of the key  challenges in cybercrime relates to the method applied in either LE or CSIRTs, with  CSIRTs generally taking a more technical approach on incident analysis.  Information flow and reporting seem to be a cultural matter as LE usually have a fairly  strong set of processes for information flowing. It allows decision-makers, operational or  even politicians, to be provided with the most possibly relevant information. This type of  organisation proves to be very efficient in cases of emergency or a crisis. Staff of any  hierarchical level know their roles of intervention and any legal requirement about  information sharing between LE and their counterparts. Thus, in the EU cooperation field,  this pyramidal organisation with Europol acting as coordinator has proved to be very  efficient.   Judiciary approach: The judicial authority is a functional authority for LE and an  adjudicator in terms of applying the law. Compared to the LE, the judiciary usually have the  powers to take measures against a criminal action and control investigative acts.  In most constitutional systems, the judiciary are independent from other authorities in a  Member State. However, the level of their independence varies from country to country, as  well as the scope of each authority and its organisational structure. It is generally accepted  that the judicial authorities have a hierarchical organisational structure and in some  countries dedicated units are dealing with certain types of crime. This hierarchical structure  is met in both the courts and the prosecutor’s offices. From the perspective of cybercrime  investigation, it is crucial to determine to what extent the judicial authorities are specialised  in a type of crime. In some countries, there are specialised units in courts or prosecutors’  offices dedicated to cybercrime that have staff with technical expertise. However, in other  countries, this is not possible because of the organisational structure of courts and  prosecutor’s offices and relevant legislation; it is then up to the individual judges and  prosecutors to decide whether or not to specialise and voluntarily educate themselves.  Another important aspect is that the judiciary has institutional authority over the law  enforcement. As a rule, the course of the investigation is supervised by a prosecutor or an  investigative judge whose authorisation or cooperation is often required to carry out certain  procedural measures. The evidence and information collected during the investigation must  have the quality of admissible evidence and be onwards provided to the judge in a  comprehensible way, for the latter one to decide on its relevance and assess the weight of  evidence.  4.1.2.2 Internal security policies permitting and supporting information sharing with  CSIRT/LE counterpart  Each CSIRT/LE is capable of sharing information when working with its own community but  both communities might face have difficulties in sharing with each other due to legal and  operational restrictions. Usually LE have more restrictions on exchanging information with  CSIRTs given the confidential nature of the investigations and for that reason, in certain cases  we observe a one-way data flow: from CSIRTs to LE. This also depends a lot on the CSIRT  national mandate and setup.  Another problem is the remediation-investigation dichotomy which impedes information sharing.  LE have a specific proven legal framework to share intelligence with LE in other Member  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  29  States. Sharing with another community outside the LE field poses two challenges, one  operational and one legal.  On the operational side, sharing investigation information can impede or even jeopardise the  identification of perpetrators. Also, LE tend to avoid disclosing information by fear of  compromising several months or years of work. An LE agency could share an IOC of an IP  address of a C² server. However, intelligence sharing may generate a takedown by a CSIRT  partner, while LE intended to seize or intercept the C² server. From a legal standpoint, the  prosecutor decides whether to communicate, or not, any case-related information. Therefore,  before sharing data, LE need to explain the necessity and seek prosecutor’s permission first.  4.1.2.3 Practices and procedures: sharing the same organisational procedures  Sharing common organisational procedures may still be a challenge as each community has  been established to meet its specific mission’s objectives while respecting a set of different  rules.  4.1.2.4 Degree of procedures’ formalisation  CSIRTs, being relatively new organisations, have yet to crystallise their working methods in a  way that aligns with the scientific and forensics method applied in LE which is over a century  and a half old. While LE’s work is considerably formalised due to legal requirements, forensic  cybercrime investigation procedures have overall not reached the same level of detail within the  CSIRT community. Remediation takes place within the (usually) controlled environment of a  constituency’s system. CSIRT have developed a fairly good grip on it and can take stances on  almost all aspects of this environment. On the contrary, not all steps of a specific LE  investigation process can be anticipated, as the process has to address the human factors that  are related to each victim and each perpetrator and may significantly affect the handling of a  cybercrime case. The most challenging part would be to analyse the victim’s device, detect and  collect the IOCs.  4.1.2.5 Incident report protocol  CSIRT may face challenges when reporting incidents to preserve partners’ trust. CSIRT usually  do not have a formalised process to report incidents to LE but have very good and documented  ways for incident reports collection.  LE are notified through victims’ complaints instead of incident reports. The key challenge for the  investigation is unknown incidents. Even if no complaint is lodged, once an incident is detected,  an investigation could be initiated; in some MS jurisdictions, LE may be required ex officio to  launch the procedure, regardless of the victim’s interest in pursuing an investigation that may  go on for years. This can be a challenge for LE units being overwhelmed by cases of  compromised IP addresses.  4.1.2.6 How to improve the performance of national CSIRTs in terms of procedural  compliance  Effective supervision of the national CSIRTs’ constituency should also include a check on the  training of their staff regarding the collection of e-evidence to be used in a criminal trial.  When using procedural tools for evidence collection purposes, CSIRTs have to comply with the  requirements mandated by LE. In order for the evidence obtained to be admissible in court, the  procedural rules defined in the code of criminal procedure must be followed. However, CSIRT  staff usually do not have a legal or in-house expertise or experience with criminal investigations,  so compliance management issues are challenging for them.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  30  For this reason, it is advisable, on the one hand, to provide CSIRTs with relevant information on  how to proceed in accordance with the law and, on the other hand, for CSIRTs to be supervised  when they are performing the requested activities.  The transmission of information can take various forms; in some countries, CSIRTs and LE  carry out joint workshops, conferences or other regular meetings where information and  experience are being shared. A very effective tool is the implementation of joint exercises,  where law enforcement authorities verify their ability to cooperate effectively with CSIRTs, and  CSIRTs in turn verify their ability to comply with requests received from LE.  For the purposes of supporting CSIRT operations, in some countries, LE liaison officers are  appointed to work closely with CSIRTs as consultants, to provide advice on how to act in  accordance with the law and how to cooperate effectively with law enforcement authorities. This  mechanism can also work vice versa; a CSIRT representative may also play the role of a liaison  officer and get involved in activities of law enforcement authorities and provide them with  information on how to work effectively with CISRTs.  4.1.2.7 How to ensure compliance with judiciary procedures – a concern for CSIRTs  The identification of the author of an information security incident is necessary when  investigating it as a crime. The author can be convicted in a criminal trial only if his sentence is  based on valid evidence. For this reason, it is very important to collect evidence that meets the  requirements for being admissible in criminal proceedings.  As explained in section 4.1.1.5, some of the actions taken by CSIRTs when dealing with an  incident may render the digital evidence inadmissible. Such evidence cannot be used in court  and it is therefore worthless for criminal proceedings. Hence, CSIRT team members should be  familiar with the procedures of preserving and securing admissible evidence for criminal  proceedings and be encouraged to implement such procedures in practice.  In order to avoid to destroy evidence and potentially interact or even compromise further LE  investigation, CSIRT should aim to align their incident response and especially remediation  procedures with LE and judiciary procedures and requirements.  Moreover, there is a certain complementarity between CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  responsibilities and attributions, but the success of a cybercrime investigation might depend on  how well their procedures and processes are adapted to each other and integrated to form a  national/European framework.  One possible solution is for the CSIRTs to have accredited experts that could handle and  examine evidence and even testify in court. However, this depends on the national legislation.  Furthermore, it would be necessary for CSIRTs to receive specific legal training in the field of  evidence collection, best practices, and criminal trials. An optimal measure would be to  implement evidence collection standards along with LE and the judiciary to preserve the  integrity of further investigations.  4.1.2.8 Does compliance with judiciary procedures need to be audited?  Depending on the legal framework, procedures may be questioned during a trial to guarantee  the admissibility of evidence.  To be admissible in court, each piece of evidence must meet several admissibility  requirements. These requirement vary depending on the national legal framework. For  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  31  instance, honeypots (11) that are deployed to better identify attackers’ techniques used in  cybercrime cases create challenges in terms of evidence admissibility. In some Member States,  the use of a honeypot is considered incitement, rendering thus the evidence collected  inadmissible in court. In other Member States, where the legal framework has different  principles, this method is considered admissible.  If CSIRTs are asked to testify in court, their evidence collection methodology is likely to be  questioned by the judges, the prosecution and/or the defence attorneys.  An evaluation and feedback exchange should follow between the judiciary and CSIRT  constituency; in every cybercrime cooperation case, the judiciary should provide feedback on  evidence provided by CSIRTs and may issue recommendations for further improvement.  In addition, a typical audit conducted by the judiciary should also examine the written CSIRT  standard operational procedures to assess whether adequate measures are applied for  evidence collection.  4.1.3 Training needs  4.1.3.1 Policy initiatives to promote cooperation across the three communities  Since the adoption of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013 (EU Commission, 2013), the  European Commission has made great efforts to ensure the online protection of European  citizens, companies and institutions. The EU has supported cooperation as part of the EU  Cybersecurity Strategy. Currently, the Commission has added cybersecurity to its core policy  priorities. ENISA has a fundamental role in developing policy initiatives to promote cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE, and the judiciary. The cooperation across the three communities could also  be enhanced by providing training.  4.1.3.2 How to overcome the skills gap across CSIRTs, LE and judiciary  Each stakeholder, i.e. CSIRT, LE and the judiciary, has a very specific skillset. A skills gap  presents obstacles to cooperation as there is no common understanding and also creates  difficulties in perceiving all necessary information. To overcome this challenge, the gap could be  addressed through joint training. In particular:   CSIRTs can provide technical training. CSIRTs have developed technical skills and  can deliver to the other communities investigation-oriented technical training, e.g. on  network investigations, and advanced systems.   LE can provide legal and investigation training. Usually, this is a field in which CSIRT  staff, lacking a legal background, have more limited knowledge. International LE  cooperation is a distinct field, based on specific international legal instruments and  requires operational experience in order to be mastered. LE usually provide to the  judiciary, training on the cyber investigation field more than technical training. The key  is not to explain how to analyse, for example, a log file, but to provide magistrates with  an understanding of cyber-attack mechanics, cybercriminals’ modus operandi and  legal implications of any coercive action taken. These training sessions should provide  magistrates with technical knowledge and give them strategic investigation directions.   Judiciary can provide both CSIRT and LE with legal training. In particular, they should  focus on the exclusionary rules of evidence. Representatives of the judiciary can  provide the other two communities with detailed information on the legal rules  (11) A honeypot is a system left opened on the internet with vulnerabilities known by its owner, with the intention of  attracting hackers and thus collecting information.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  32  applicable to criminal proceedings, the handling of electronic evidence, the evaluation  and admissibility of evidence, and the procedures for reporting a crime. Similarly, they  can provide information guidelines derived from practice and case law on how  electronic evidence should be handled properly or how it should be presented and  evaluated in court. On the other hand, judges and public prosecutors, via technical  training, might increase their technical knowledge needed to understand some of the  specificities of cybercrime such as the nature and weight of certain types of electronic  evidence.  These cross-training efforts between CSIRTs and LE are very good opportunities for sharing  and building a common cultural ground.  TF-CSIRT and FIRST material are a good starting point for LE to understand the CSIRT’s  world. ENISA has also published material (ENISA, 2019) covering a broad set of technical  topics, including a recent course on Digital Forensics (ENISA, 2019a).  Other training initiatives in this field originate for instance from joint initiatives of the European  Union and the Council of Europe (see e.g. GLACY (12) and GLACY+ projects (13)) and from  UNODC (see e.g. University Module Series on Cybercrime (UNODC, n.d.) in which there are  modules specifically focused on cooperation.  4.1.3.3 Prototype organisational behaviour  Organisational behaviour aims at answering several questions impeding cooperation. The  following questions and possible answers provide some guidance for improving cooperation.   How to avoid duplicated efforts?  (a) Communicate once the incident handling has initiated  (b) Send observers on site  (c) It is necessary to trust others.   To achieve this, however, it is necessary for CSIRTs to acquire more legal knowledge about  e-evidence:  (a) Use segregation of duties matrix  (b) Come up with policies or rules on when and how to cooperate  (c) Conduct training   How to handle incidents in order to prevent evidence loss or alteration?  (a) Design and implement a common standard for data collection  (b) Implement taxonomies  (c) Define best practices for most common types of incidents  (d) Develop practical guides  (e) Receive joint training  (f) Provide legal training   How to efficiently share intelligence?  (a) By using MISP  (b) By using common taxonomy  (c) By having English language skills allowing CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary to  communicate easily  (d) By holding regular meetings and building trust  (12) https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacy  (13) https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacyplus  https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacy https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacyplus  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  33   How to efficiently mutually provide expertise and tools:  (a) Through joint training  (b) By maintaining some basic communication tools  4.1.3.4 Case study – Czech Republic  The Czech Republic’s strong focus on cybersecurity led to the adoption of the Cyber Security  Act (Czech Republic, 2014) and showed that one of the fundamental challenges for successful  protection and defence of national cyberspace is the ability of the competent public and private  institutions to cooperate against the rise of cybersecurity incidents. An appropriate way to  strengthen this cooperation is to implement joint exercises to verify and develop the technical,  legal and organisational capabilities of competent institutions and personnel. Cyber exercises  seem to be a great opportunity to get technically skilled professionals, government  representatives and other stakeholders to interact, confront each other and exchange their  different perspectives on and approaches to problem solving.  Exercises conducted in the Czech Republic are organised by the National Cyber and  Information Security Authority (NCISA), a central body of state administration for cybersecurity,  operating government CERT. Its constituency includes systems of critical information  infrastructure, important information systems and operators of essential services. Exercises  organised by NCISA are of two types – technical, primarily focused on testing the technical  readiness of security engineers, CSIRT members and other ICT experts of relevant institutions;  and non-technical, table-top exercises that focus on organisational readiness and cooperation  capability.  The Cyber Czech technical exercise has been developed and implemented every year since  2015 in cooperation with Masaryk University, using the infrastructure of the cyber range KYPO  (KYPO by CSIRT MU, n.d.) developed by Masaryk University as a part of their security  research. The exercise is based on the Red team–Blue team principle, with the red team  consisting of cybersecurity experts from governmental CERT, Masaryk University and other  partner institutions. During the exercise the red team launches cyber-attacks on infrastructures  managed by the Blue team, and the Blue team’s task is to protect their critical systems from  these attacks.  However, this technical exercise also includes an organisational and legal component as it also  simulates the role of the police, the DPA, regular internet users and journalists. Besides  defending their network, and communicating with regular users and media, Blue team members  must also be able for instance to detect whether an offence has been committed, know how to  identify it and report it to the police, and how to respond to requests for operational information  or evidence. In some runs of this exercise actual investigators from the National Centre for  Combatting Organized Crime, responsible for investigating serious cybercrimes, are also  involved.  While technical exercises are designed for practicing primarily technical skills and capabilities,  NCISA also organises discussion-based, table-top exercises that are used for testing  procedures, crisis management processes, institutional arrangements and agreements. A  specific exercise of this type was also organised with a focus on cooperation between CSIRTs  and the LE; in particular the focus of this exercise was to investigate the processes related to  the investigation of the incident and the initiation of criminal proceedings, coordination,  cooperation and information sharing between communities (LE, CSIRTs, other security entities  and victims) and cross-border cooperation capabilities. As part of this exercise, participants are  provided with the scenario and are required to decide, in their capacity, what actions to take in  order to mitigate and investigate the incident. The team of organisers then moderates possible  discussions, mediates the transfer of information and informs team members about new  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  34  developments in scenarios and assigned tasks. The aim then is for both communities to  understand how the incident is approached from a different perspective, to recognise the  implications of the security team’s incident handling activities in the context of criminal  proceedings, to identify white spots in cooperation and coordination during incident  management, investigation, and beyond.  Both types of exercises proved to be a suitable tool for enhancing the understanding of the  mutual roles of individual communities in managing cybersecurity incidents, for sharing  experience with incident management and cybercrime investigations and for identifying and  setting up appropriate procedures and tools for mutual cooperation and coordination.  4.2 TECHNICAL ASPECTS  4.2.1 Use of (common) tools to facilitate cooperation and interaction  One of the key recommendations of the 2018 ENISA report was the use of common tools in  order to facilitate cooperation and interaction across the three communities. Based on the data  collected through the interviews the most common used tool remains email but there is a recent  tendency to adopt Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)14 protocol for encryption of the communication  and MISP for threat intelligence sharing.  While CSIRTs have started to offer technical support to LE for adopting MISP, some MSs are  already using or building national tools for instant messaging communication and information  sharing. In the last case, LE are usually included by default while CSIRTs may also be invited  depending on their role in the national setup (usually national and/or governmental CSIRTs).   Common IT network  Analysis of the data collected through the interviews conducted showed that  segregated networks were another obstacle to cooperation. This creates day-to-day  difficulties that hinder LE and CSIRT staff cooperation and delay any exchange due to  the laborious procedures. When possible, sharing a common IT infrastructure is a first  and mandatory step to enhance the cooperation.   MISP  Malware information sharing platform (MISP) (15) is an application designed by  Luxembourg CSIRT (Computer Incident Response Centre Luxembourg – CIRCL). It  was designed to store and exchange information on indicators of compromise. Being  an open-source software tool and heavily supported both by CIRCL and the  community, it has been considered to be a standard tool in the cybersecurity field.  MISP is an efficient way to store data and unique for its sharing factions.  MISP is widely used around the world, with 6 000 instances being already deployed  (MISP Project, n.d.).  MISP facilitates cooperation between CSIRT and LE. For instance, it is used by  Luxembourg to share IOCs (indicators of compromise) between Luxembourg CSIRT,  and other partner agencies, especially LE.   Instant messaging  Instant messaging tool is essential as it facilitates immediate communication. It  provides quick and direct message exchange which is very crucial during the  cybercrime investigation phase.  (14)  https://www.openpgp.org/  (15) https://www.circl.lu/services/misp-malware-information-sharing-platform/  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  35   Encryption  PGP is the most commonly used method for encryption of communication across the  communities; it is an open source solution internationally recognised as a secure  protocol. PGP has already been adopted by most of the CSIRT teams in Europe,  including national and governmental ones. Moreover, some of the CSIRTs have  started to use it in their communication with LE counterparts.   File sharing system  File sharing is another essential tool to be included in the CSIRT-LE cooperation  toolset. Part of the technical cooperation is also the regular file exchange. To do this,  setting up a secure and user-friendly environment is fundamental in order to:  - facilitate cooperation;  - avoid shadow IT, where personnel relies on inappropriate ways to perform the  required tasks (clouds, third-party holstering application/infrastructure, etc.).   Coordination platform  In case of major cyber crisis, CSIRTs and LE should strongly cooperate. This can  easily be achieved only if some tools for supporting their technical cooperation have  already been set up.  4.2.2 Tools and their key functionalities  Each community uses tools for their day-to-day activities. By using the same toolset, CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary could further enhance their cooperation. Such tools are needed for:  information sharing, evidence collection, coordination and secure communications.   Information sharing  The use of information-sharing tools is dependent on the organisation’s culture: while  CSIRT are familiar with these tools, LE seem usually to rely on the most commonly  used (i.e. email, file sharing, Europol mailing system SIENA (16)). Information-sharing  tools usually include:  ― A database system for storing information;  ― One or several taxonomies;  ― A sharing system, either centralised or peer-to-peer.  More advanced tools can provide other functionalities, such as:  ― Data visualisation (charts, graphs);  ― Data quality assessment;  ― Data management system (based on categories of data or other criteria).   Evidence collection  The tools used by CSIRTs and LE for evidence collection vary. While LE tend to use  commercial tools (e.g. EnCase (17), FTK (18), etc.) and specific hardware (e.g. write  blockers used to avoid any writing on a drive while copying it to avoid tampering),  CSIRTs are more familiarised with open source and free available tools (DD (19),  Clonezilla (20), DumpIT (21), etc.). Moreover, LE are more focused on legally sound  data collection while CSIRTs look for technical accuracy.

GPG is widely used for encryption and it is supported by several mail  service providers. Military affiliated agencies may use other encryption algorithms.  Instant messaging applications like Mattermost (Mattermost, n.d.) allow encryption too.  But what is of great importance is for each organisation to select and use tools fitting  into its ecosystem and its partnerships.  4.2.3 How the investigations are carried out – forensic methods?  Based on the replies received from the interviews and the online survey results, cybercrime  investigations are carried out by using the following forensic methods:   Computer forensics:  The main purpose of an evidence collection tool is to allow the user to extract  information from a system without modifying it. To do this, the main device to use is a  write blocker (22). LE operate easy-to-use forensic tools such as EnCase (23) or  X-Ways (24).  These tools allow staff with basic forensics knowledge to efficiently conduct  investigations. Another advantage is that these tools are usually very efficient to  handle and display a lot of items simultaneously. This feature is necessary when going  through several hundred thousands of files.   Network forensics:  Network forensics are executed to find traces of suspicious activity or previously  flagged items (IOCs). A tool that is widely used for this purpose is Wireshark (25); it  allows its users to search through all protocols for pieces of data.  Interception/sniffing in pcap can generate huge volumes of data that can be analysed  with Moloch (26).  Netflow data is smaller in size (and can be sampled); DNS logs are text and  manageable in size; Netflow and DNS logs are most often not analysed within Moloch  but separately (nfdump, ELK, manually).  (22) This tool is placed between the analysing computer and the target device. Write blocker blocks all write commands,  making sure the target is not altered.  (23) https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic  (24) https://www.x-ways.net  (25) https://www.wireshark.org  (26) https://molo.ch  https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic https://www.x-ways.net/ https://www.wireshark.org/ https://molo.ch/  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  37   Mobile devices forensics:  Mobile devices forensics refer to the tools and technologies of digital forensics utilised  for the recovery of evidence from a mobile device; multiple methods have been  developed to address evidence collection from a variety of mobile devices. For  instance, Jtag (27) mobile forensics rely on jtag connection analysis for artefacts  recovery; while ‘Chip off’ (28) is a technique that implies chip removal and analysis of  chip data.   Memory forensics:  Live memory acquisition can be a challenge from an organisational perspective. What  is needed is qualified personnel, having the appropriate skills and the right tools for  acquisition. However, it is hard to collect evidence when a network or a hard drive are  encrypted; memory becomes one of the last place where evidence can be found.  The main tool for memory forensics is Volatility (29). It loads numerous plugins for  finding malware and has become a standard. It is an open source tool that requires  training to use it.   Live forensics:  Sometimes the data acquisition must be done while the device is powered on. A  common use case is with VPS providers that are running multiple VMs or containers  on the same physical server; in this case, the data collection needs to be done without  powering down the physical server. Acquisition of containers (Docker (30)) is just an  indicative example.  4.2.4 Future technology and cybercrime attribution (Carrier Grade NAT  (CGN), AI, IoT)  Although future technologies seem to create challenges for the investigation teams, they could  also provide cooperation opportunities. Figure 12 shows how the respondents to the online  survey replied to the question on likely future trends in the area of tools for cybercrime.

Although IoT devices also contain some private data,  such as connection data, sometimes those have to be analysed for investigation purposes.  They usually use specific technologies, both software and hardware. An example of  investigation is the Mirai case (Krebs, 2019). A Mirai botnet used CCTV devices to launch  DDoS against DNS service. Analysis of CCTV allowed the perpetrator to be identified.  4.2.4.2 Artificial intelligence  AI could be used by a cybercriminal for vulnerability scanning. IPs are scanned for any  fingerprint they may provide. AI could deduce from appropriate datasets information not only for  an attack vector, but also for the kind of internal vulnerabilities that could potentially be  exploited for moving laterally in the system. AI tools could also enable an attacker to optimise  botnet resources, for example to have DDoS attacks switching between machines, making  detection and mitigation more difficult. Botnets are currently layered through to avoid detection.  One usual setup is to have one layer of a peer-to-peer network of zombie-machines and above  that several layers that transmit instructions and channel stolen information to the attackers’ last  node.  Nevertheless, AI technologies could be utilised to counter cybercrime attacks as well. For  instance, improve botnet management by using AI tools to detect patterns and anticipate  attacks based on identified vulnerabilities.  4.2.4.3 Publicly available mass market encryption  Latest developments, projects and initiatives from the open source community, researchers, but  also from big technology companies are pushing for the availability of strong encryption  products for end users, including end-to-end encryption.  Mylar project is one example of a practical system that can compute on encrypted data (Popa  R.A., 2016). This system might be used by LE to query encrypted databases or capture traffic  for specific words or strings and results without decrypting the content.  4.2.4.4 Carrier Grid NAT  On the internet, every connected device needs an IP address. However, the number of IP  addresses (Internet Protocol Version 4) is limited and insufficient to meet the exploding demand  for new addresses for connected devices including connected objects and smart phones. A new  version of IP address (IPv6) which provides an unlimited number of IP addresses is available  but the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires internet access providers and internet content  providers (websites, social media, webmail services, etc.) to update software and hardware.  As a supposed-to-be temporary solution to address the problem of shortage of IP addresses,  internet access providers adopted CGN (31) technologies which allow sharing of IPv4 addresses  with multiple internet users (several thousands). CGN technologies are used by internet service  providers to share one single IP address among multiple subscribers at the same time.  This has an impact on criminal investigations as an IP address is often the only information that  can link a crime to an individual. It might mean that individuals cannot be distinguished by their  IP addresses anymore, which may lead to innocent individuals being wrongly investigated by  law enforcement because they share their IP address with several thousand others – potentially  including criminals.  (31) https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for- end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  39  As said, this was supposed to be a temporary solution until the transition to IPv6 was  completed. For some operators however it has become a substitute for the IPv6 transition.  Despite IPv6 being available for more than 5 years the internet access industry increasingly  uses CGN technologies (90 % for mobile internet and up to 38 % for fixed line internet access  providers while 12 % were expected to deploy it in the coming months) instead of adopting the  new standard (Europol, 2017).  4.2.5 Technical knowledge used by the judiciary  The judiciary need to broadly understand technical information behind investigation techniques.  What is of great importance is to precisely understand what is at stake, such as private  information and liberties infringements.  For example, if LE want to execute a sinkhole (32) of a malware, the judiciary will need to  understand how this will be done and what kind of data should be collected. Depending on  national laws, executing a sinkhole of a malware, may or may not be authorised, mostly for  privacy and data protection reasons.  4.3 HUMAN ASPECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE  4.3.1 Mind-set differences  One of the differences of individual communities that may prevent or restrict cooperation and  information sharing are differences in personalities or social roles. This situation may result in  one community not understanding the constraints that apply to the other, or its role and  mandate. Some indicative examples are presented below:  There is no common understanding of what data types can be used as evidence. For CSIRTs,  any data or information related to the source of a security incident can be evidence. The way  that attribution of cybercrime is being done may result in making evidence inadmissible in a  trial. Sometimes CSIRTs seem not to understand that the requirements of the quality of  evidence in the concept of criminal law are significantly high; evidence must be obtained  according to the applicable law and handled in a specific way.  There is limited common understanding of the objectives related to the fight against cybercrime;  CSIRTs aim to achieve the fastest possible mitigation of incidents and ensure the  confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) triad of systems of their constituency. But reckless  pursuit of these goals can lead, for example, to destruction of valuable evidence or even  expose the monitoring activities to the attacker.  Hence, mind-set differences could hinder the cooperation at the stage of evidence collection, in  case the competent CSIRT community is not appropriately prepared to address relevant  scenarios as well as when there is difficulty in determining what data may constitute evidence  or not. Understanding what can be used as solid, admissible evidence in a court of law is a  challenge for CSIRTs. This requires time as CSIRTs would need to receive training on what  kind of elements they should look for when collecting evidence. Indeed LE and CSIRTs usually  operate under different time-frames. LE officers are emergency specialists who work in legal-  based timeframes, such as for example temporary detention, which are generally too short for  exhaustive analysis. On the contrary, CSIRTs often deal with espionage cases and are trained  to lead a thorough and exhaustive analysis.  (32) Operation consisting of buying a domain name used by a malware to transmit stolen data. The interest for LE is to  identify victims.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  40  Ultimately, these communities bear a different perspective. LE operate under an offence- based  system. In an optimal scenario of a cybercrime case, the case is closed, with the perpetrators  identified and brought to justice. CSIRTs are accustomed to handling intelligence, collecting,  storing and then analysing the relevant data. Legal constraints may arise when processing  personal data and this could impact the progress of the investigation. Lastly, the judiciary has  mainly a legal perspective and often lacks a technical background or knowledge. The objective  of the judiciary is to determine whether the suspect is the offender and proceed to the  conviction in accordance with the law and while respecting the fundamental rights of the  suspect.  4.3.2 Assessing personnel skills and qualities  Assessing personnel skills and qualities for each community will be a necessary step to  enhance their cooperation. Each community has its own professional context, motivations and  constraints.  Figure 13: Replies to question 18 of the online survey  Differences between the communities are observed in multiple levels. More particularly,  provided the nature of the respective community, work expectations vary, with LE prioritising  achieving higher ranking and being recognised as experts who have more time to practice.  While CSIRTs identify as their work expectations the improvement of skills or the development  of multiple skills. Secondly, relating to the upkeep of their skills and their training necessities,  some LE noted that there are few in-house training possibilities available and an inadequate  budget for that purpose. In contrast, some CSIRTs indicated that there are many internal  resources and usually adequate budget for that purpose. Both communities agreed that training  courses must be carried out by truly competent people. Referring to personal KPIs, LE  identified as such the number of cases handled and the reaction time. The number of cases  handled is also a personal KPI for CSIRTs, in addition to their skillset. Finally, when examining  the impact on cooperation, the communities determined that the difficulties are due to the  technical level discrepancies and the CSRITs’ lack of legal knowledge.  4.3.3 Competency-based framework  Some countries have concluded that a systematic approach is needed to effectively build a  human workforce basis capable of addressing cybersecurity challenges. This is the reason why  some countries are developing competency frameworks that specify what type of employees  are needed in the cybersecurity field, what qualifications these employees should have, what  training programmes, exercises and materials to acquire such qualifications are available and  how to cover any identified gaps.  16%  34%  50%  Skillset management  Work’s expectation  Working culture and behaviour  Replies  Q18. What are the main differences between LE and CSIRT staff?  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  41  An example of such a framework is the US NICE framework (National Institute of Standards  and Technology, 2017) (33), which includes a taxonomy of qualifications. For each qualification,  is then identified what kinds of competences, skills and knowledge are required.  Such a framework can be used in several ways. On this basis, scales for assessing the  competencies of applicants for individual positions in cybersecurity could be defined. This  framework could also be used to analyse the current state of the labour market, assessing what  qualifications are missing from cybersecurity professionals. Another use could be to present the  availability of courses, training programmes and other education and training opportunities that  could help applicants to be better qualified.  Outcomes of such analyses then could be used to develop policies, initiatives and regulation  focused on promoting cybersecurity education and building a cyber-workforce.  4.4 LEGAL AND POLICY ASPECTS  4.4.1 Legal framework in EU  The legal framework establishes and shapes the process of cooperation between CSIRTs and  LE as well as their interaction with the judiciary in the context of fighting against cybercrime.  Information on the legal and policy framework can also be found in the 2017 and 2018 ENISA  reports on CSIRTs and LE cooperation (ENISA, 2017a), (ENISA, 2018).  The legal framework in this area is presented at three levels: international level, EU level,  national level.  4.4.1.1 International level  The first and the most relevant international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence is the  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime ( (Council of Europe, 2001) (34)). This convention  is also called the ‘Budapest Convention’. On the one hand, this aims at providing guidelines for  any country for the development of a comprehensive national legislation against cybercrime. On  the other hand, this convention is a framework for international cooperation between the  signatory states. The Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems  (Council of Europe, 2003) complements the Budapest Convention. The Cybercrime Convention  Committee (T-CY) is also preparing a draft version of the 2nd Additional Protocol (Council of  Europe, 2019) to the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001) to submit to the  Committee of Ministers in the light of its adoption. This draft and an Explanatory Report is  expected to be finalised by December 2019 (35). The 2nd Additional Protocol is ‘designed to  provide solutions for a more efficient criminal justice response to cybercrime and other crime  involving electronic evidence in accordance with data protection and other safeguards’ (Council  of Europe, 2019, p. 4).  (33) https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework  (34) https://www.coe.int/fr/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185  (35) The 2nd Additional Protocol is prepared taking into account among others: Article 46.1.c Budapest Convention on  Cybercrime; the decision adopted by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) at its 17th Plenary (June 2017);  Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 2077 (2015) on ‘Increasing cooperation against cyberterrorism and other large- scale attacks on the Internet’ and the response of the Committee of Ministers of 27 April 2016; the Programme and Budget  of the Council of Europe for 2016/2017 as adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 24/25 November 2015 referring to  follow up to be given to the work of the TCY on access to evidence in the cloud; agreement in principle by the TCY at its  16th Plenary (November 2016) on the need for an additional Protocol, and drawing from the Final Report and  Recommendations of the T-CY Cloud Evidence Group and, in particular section 4.5 with possible elements of a Protocol.  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework https://www.coe.int/fr/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  42  4.4.1.2  EU level  The European Union can legislate through several types of legal acts. The acts that the  European Union can issue are the following:  (a) Regulations. A regulation is a binding legislative act which must be applied in its  entirety throughout the EU, without exception.  (b) Directives. A directive is a legislative act that establishes a common goal that must be  achieved by all EU countries. However, it is the prerogative of each Member State to  define its own laws aimed at achieving these objectives.  (c) Decisions. A decision is a directly applicable legal instrument which is binding upon  those individuals to which it is addressed (the individual can be e.g. an EU country or  an individual company).  (d) Recommendations. A ‘recommendation’ allows the EU institutions to publish their  views and suggest guidelines without, however, imposing any legal obligation on those  to whom it is addressed. Clearly, a recommendation is not binding.  (e) Opinions. An ‘opinion’ is a legal instrument that allows EU institutions to make a non-  binding statement.  4.4.1.3 National level  This level concerns the rules issued by various Member States. The international and European  legal frameworks are a reference point for national legal frameworks. Nevertheless, it is  sometimes possible to find different legal frameworks in various Member States. This diversity  has consequences for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the  judiciary.  4.4.1.4 Differences in legal systems and evidence admissibility  In a criminal trial, it is important that e-evidence is integral and qualitatively reliable. To achieve  this result, data integrity must be ensured in all the life stages of e-evidence management,  namely: identification, collection, acquisition and preservation. In particular, as stated by  Mitrakas and Zaich ‘The chain of custody through appropriate policy frameworks can be used in  order to assess the quality of the collected data. Chain of custody investigations may also help  in establishing the hierarchical structure that prevailed at the time that the acts under  investigations were committed’ (Mitrakas, 2009, p. 164 and 173). Depending on the Member  State, the verification of the chain of custody can have different legal consequences. In some  Member States, this verification is relevant only for the purposes of evaluation of evidence. In  other Member States for the admissibility of evidence. The grounds of inadmissibility of  evidence are defined by the national laws of each Member State. Each piece of evidence has to  be legally obtained, according to the competent jurisdiction.  The national judicial systems are characterised by differences that could also have an impact  on the cooperation and interaction across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary. The judicial systems  could be categorised into: common law systems and civil law systems.  (a) The judicial systems of common law are also called adversarial systems (or adversary  systems). In such a system, a criminal trial is conceived as a conflict or dispute, where  each of the parties supports a contrary position. The oral evidence is of fundamental  importance; such evidence is acquired by means of the so-called cross-examination.  The judicial precedent is very important in a common law system. This means that a  decision of a court can be used as a source for future decisions, also known as  precedents; precedents are authoritative and binding and must be followed. This is the  principle of stare decisis (‘let the decision stand’).  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  43  (b) The civil law systems are non-adversarial systems. The judge sometimes has a more  active role in the collection of evidence and can also interview the witnesses by  himself. The principle of stare decisis does not apply to this case.  From a juridical point of view, the ‘nature’ of e-evidence may create issues regarding its  admissibility in a criminal trial. For this reason, in some Member States there are specific  requirements regarding the collection of e-evidence in order to be admissible in courts. In  addition, related research and evaluation carried out by the Council of the European Union on  the prevention and combating of cybercrime has concluded ‘that in most Member States,  procedural laws are technology-neutral, which means that general rules and principles on  gathering of evidence are applied and that procedural systems do not contain any formal rules  on admissibility and assessment of e-evidence’ (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 11) .  More information about the topic of e-evidence in court can be found also in the 2018 ENISA  report on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA, 2018).  4.4.1.5 Discrepancies  Although meaningful progress has been made at European level to strengthen the cooperation  and interaction across CSIRT, LE and the judiciary, discrepancies which may partly hinder this  progress, still remain.  It is important to point out that there are significant differences in purpose of responding to  information security incidents between CSIRTs and LE investigators. A CSIRT aims to mitigate  an incident, which may also be a crime, as soon as possible and restrict the negative impact it  may have. When performing such tasks, a CSIRT is often not adequately concerned about  preserving the evidence that could be used to identify the author of the incident. On the  contrary, an LE investigator aims to identify the author of this incident, which is determined to  be a crime, for the purpose of prosecuting the criminal offences. For this reason, it is very  important for LE investigators that CSIRTs do not to delete evidence, but preserve it  properly (36).  In addition to that, fundamental differences in each entity’s posture and structure, both within  and between them, may further impede cooperation and interaction among CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary. For example, as some interviews have shown, the hierarchical structure of LE and the  judiciary may cause delay in cooperation, especially with the CSIRTs of other Member States.  Moreover, disconnection may also result from the different mind-sets these entities have.  At national as well as at European level, there are a plurality of non-legislative acts  (memoranda, public–public and public–private agreements, and industry standards) concerning  CSIRT, LE and the judiciary. Such acts have often contributed to the improvement of  cooperation and interaction between CSIRT, LE and the judiciary. However, the multiplicity and  diversity of content of the various acts causes discrepancies between situations that are similar  but regulated by different acts.  Regarding ‘judicial confidentiality’, Member States’ legislation often differs. Consequently, the  types and categories of information that can be shared can vary from one Member State to  another.  4.4.1.6 Jurisdiction issues  • EU law defining only framework  Since cybercrimes do not stop at the borders of Member States and may concern  various Member States, what is often observed is authorities of several Member  (36) For more on this please see subchapter 4.3.1. on Mind-set differences.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  44  States investigating the same crime. This fact may create conflicts of exercise of  jurisdiction. At European level, Council framework decision 2009/948/JHA (EU  Council, 2009) (37) establishes the rules for prevention and settlement of conflicts of  exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings.  Moreover, ‘Electronic evidence has become relevant in a large majority of criminal  investigations and increasingly often, judicial authorities need to make a request in  another jurisdiction in order to obtain necessary evidence from service providers.  Making it easier and quicker to obtain this evidence across borders is therefore of  crucial importance for investigating and prosecuting crime, including terrorism or  cybercrime’ (EU Commission, 2018), II.1, p. 1). At present, this purpose is pursued by  means of: mutual legal assistance (MLAT) instruments; European Investigation Order;  and voluntary cooperation in those cases where it is legally possible.  In view of the particular needs of speed and technicality in the collection of e-evidence,  the European Commission has prepared two proposals with the aim of improving the  investigative cooperation between Member States. These proposals are:   Proposal (38) for a regulation on European production and preservation  orders for e-evidence in criminal matters (EU Commission, 2018); and   Proposal (39) for a directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment  of legal representatives for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal  proceedings (EU Commission, 2018).  These legislative initiatives will address the jurisdictional issues related to cross-border  cooperation/information sharing.  Some important points that still need to be addressed are:  • How quickly data useful for the investigation can be provided;  • Inability to provide certain types of data, in particular data that are  subject to ‘judicial confidentiality’;  • Inability to provide data due to differences in data retention rules;  • Poor quality of data transmitted by CSIRTs to LE;  • Admissibility of digital evidence.  4.4.2 Admissibility of digital evidence  4.4.2.1 Categories and classification  This section presents the categorisation and classification of digital evidence:  • Categorisation of digital evidence: data stored on a device can be divided into two  categories, namely volatile data and non-volatile data.  (a) Volatile  Volatile data usually refers to live memory data. When a computer is running, it  loads in live memory all data needed to work. This data types are precious and  sensitive for analysis for two reasons. First, all live data is unencrypted for the  computer to work on it. Encrypted data such as communication application data  is unencrypted in live memory.

If the attacker erased his tracks, useful data  can still remain in live memory.  (b) Non-volatile data  Non-volatile data refers to any data that can be retrieved even after computer  has been cycled on or reset. This data can usually be found either on hard drive  or on USB key, SIM card, chip, or any other type of so-called ‘dead storage’.  These locations are where system stores all data needs to run on next start.  Among non-volatile data, deleted files are also included. When a file is deleted  from a computer, it simply removes its internal reference to it in hard-drive  master file table (MFT). MFT is equivalent to a map or a summary listing of all  available data and their location on the drive. Unless explicitly ordered by user,  data is not actually erased and can be recovered by forensic analysis.   Types of digital evidence (based upon their source) – see also forensic methods.   Outside data: all data not produced within the system.  (a) Internet data  Internet data is the data related to the internet; this data must be stored by  service providers for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or  prosecution of criminal offences (see 4.4.1)  (b) Malware sample  Malware sample includes malicious files usually found on the victim’s system  as long as the attackers have not erased it. This file, namely payload operates  on the system to execute illegitimate instructions, such as data theft, file  encrypting, DDoS triggering. Compared to traditional crimes, it is the ‘weapon’  used to commit it. Investigators look for malware sample in the first place  because it may contain a lot of information on culprit infrastructure and help  them to identify the attacker.   Internal data: data locally produced by the system.  (a) System files and system logs  According to Article 3 No 6 Directive (EU) 2016/680 (EU Council, 2016b) and  Article 4 No 6 Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (EU Council, 2016), ‘Filing system’ is  defined as any structured set of personal data which is accessible according to  specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional  or geographical basis. The logs contain a record of the operating system (OS)  events, being system logs, user logs or application logs. Consequently, logs  can be very useful for investigation purposes because they provide data related  to processes executed on the computer at the time of the attack. In system  logs, tampering, fraudulent operation and any illegitimate action will appear,  unless attackers manage to erase them.  (b) Internal network data  Internal network data such as net flow, DNS data and pcap files are data  transiting into the system. Numerous pieces of evidence can be collected from  these data types as activities run on a computer have been logged, e.g.: when  malware tried to communicate with their servers for stolen data recovery, when  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  46  a hacker pivoted from one machine to another, and any other hacker’s  operation into the system.  Figure 14 presents the various types of digital evidence most commonly used in a court of  law, based upon their source (volatile and non-volatile data). System files and system logs  are the data types most commonly used, as indicated by 50 % of the online survey  respondents.  Figure 14 – Replies to question 11 of the online survey  4.4.2.2 ISO/IEC 27037:2012 – Information technology – Security techniques – Guidelines  for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electro-technical  Commission (IEC) have proposed international standards for evidence gathering. In particular,  a careful chain of custody is strongly recommended.  Although the ISO/IEC recommendations are not legally binding, there are common standards  that should be observed by investigators all around the world in order to allow an effective  circulation of criminal evidence between the countries.  Several ISO/IEC recommendations can have an impact on a criminal trial. Among these ISO  recommendations, ISO/IEC 27037:2012 appears particularly important because it provides  specific rules on digital evidence for the various phases concerning e-evidence, namely  identification, collection, acquisition and preservation.  Such rules are provided for various devices such as:   Digital storage media used in standard computers like hard drives, floppy disks, optical  and magneto optical disks, data devices with similar functions; digital still cameras and  video cameras (including CCTV); electronic devices (PEDs), memory cards; mobile  phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal mobile navigation systems,  standard computer with network connections, networks based on TCP/IP and other  digital protocols, and devices with similar functions as above.  3%  3%  9%  9%  22%  50%  Metadata  Deleted files  No answer provided  Network data (internet)  Other  System files and system logs  * Types of digital evidence based upon their source - volatile and non-volatile.

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  48  Figure 15: Replies to question 25 of the online survey  4.4.2.3 EU cybersecurity certification  One of the tools that could provide security assurance for sharing of information and data  between communities could be cybersecurity certification. For example, tools for secure  exchange of information useful as evidence in criminal proceedings could be certified through  specific certification schemes. Currently, cybersecurity certification is only implemented at  national level and broader EU level involvement is expected following the adoption of the  Regulation (EU) 2019/881 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on  information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (EU Council, 2019). This regulation, besides  other provisions, creates the mandate for an EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework. The  purpose of the EU cybersecurity certification framework under Regulation (EU) 2019/881 is to  establish and maintain the trust and security on cybersecurity products, services and  processes. This could help users and service providers to determine the level of security  assurance of the products they use or provide. EU cybersecurity certification schemes aim to  define specific requirements and criteria for assessing the level of adherence of specific  products against these requirements. Specific products, services and processes will then be  assessed by conformity assessment bodies at national level, an issued certificate will then be  valid throughout the EU.  Such mechanisms could be used also to certify the level of security assurance of products and  processes used to collect and share information and data among the communities; this could  help to build trust and mutual understanding among CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary. Also, quality  and validity of evidence collected and produced by such certified products and services could  be considered high and decrease the likelihood of inadmissible evidence in criminal  proceedings.  Interviews conducted clearly show that only half of the respondents are aware of the existence  of the Cybersecurity Act and its content, as illustrated in Figure 16 below. Those who know  about this legislation and are familiar with the proposed certification mechanism can be divided  into two groups:   Respondents who do not consider EU certification to be relevant to cooperation or  information sharing, or do not expect this legislation to have a positive impact on it.  6%  6%  9%  25%  25%  44%  ISO/IEC 27005:2018  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  ISO 9000:2015  ISO/IEC 27037:2012  No answer provided  Other  Q25.

Two major cyber crises, namely WannaCry and NotPetya, highlighted the great need  for a coordinated response in case of large-scale incidents that are hard to handle at national  level.  Also, in 2017, the Council of the European Union adopted a Framework for joint EU Diplomatic  Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (EU Council, 2018). This framework makes full use of  measures within the EU common foreign and security policy, including restrictive measures.  In 2018, Council Conclusions on EU Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Incidents and Crisis  was aimed at making operational the Blueprint, along with the development of a European  Cybersecurity Crisis Cooperation Framework. This led to the LE Emergency Response Protocol  (LE ERP).  4.4.3.2 LE ERP  The ERP is a protocol to support LE in providing immediate response to major cross-border  cyber-attacks through:  • Rapid assessment;  • Secure and timely sharing of critical information;  • Effective coordination of international aspects of investigations.  3%  6%  10%  12%  33%  36%  In terms of improved hardware  In terms of improved software  No answer provided  Mitigation of risk  Greater assurance of forensics data  Not aware of this framework  Replies  24A.

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  51  ERP is split among several parts:  • Procedures, roles and responsibilities;  • Secure channel of communication;  • Contact points for exchange of critical information;  • Coordination and de-confliction mechanism.  ERP steps unfold as follows:  1. Early detection of incident: OSINT monitoring, Europol operational centre, LE,  CSIRT network, partners (ENISA, UNODC, OSCE), private sector partners, other  (academia, research institutes);  2. Threat assessment: Incident’s relevance is assessed through a matrix taking into  account target’s nature and scope (geographical, number of services affected, type of  victims affected, number of victims affected) and impact (damage potential,  recoverability, reproducibility, tangible losses);  3. Decision: Based on previous assessment, decision to enter protocol and proceed  through ERP steps or revert to normal operation is taken;  4. Establishing coordination centre and activate information-sharing tool;  5. Early warning notification (EWN): Europol produces the EWN and shares that with  stakeholders;  6. Emergency operational action plan (EOAP): Europol and stakeholders coordinate  and produce the EOAP in order to streamline operational actions in response to the  crisis;  7. Investigations and multilayer analysis: Member State and Europol lead  investigation, through OSINT or on site, while exchanging information in real time;  8. Situational assessment: Depending on last situational assessment, decision is made  to repeat previous steps of the protocol OR close protocol;  9. Closure of ERP: Once incident is contained, ERP is closed. Notices are sent to all  stakeholders and debriefing is organised.  4.4.3.3 Impact on CSIRT/LE cooperation  ERP is a LE coordination mechanism aimed at preserving evidence and taking advantage of LE  reaction capacities and manpower.  CSIRT play an important role into ERP as stakeholders and primary information source.  First, National CSIRTs are usually in charge of crisis management. At step 2 (threat  assessment), they state whether or not a crisis is ongoing.  Second, CSIRTs are a privileged source of qualified information. Based on their tools, expertise  and broad ecosystem (system probes, industrial partnerships), they have access to relevant  intelligence that would otherwise not reach LE.  ERP is a LE/judiciary protocol for emergency response that includes CSIRT as a full partner;  this is an example of cooperation among three communities.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  52  5. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1  Conclusions  Using the analysis of the results collected from the desk research, the interviews with subject-  matter experts, and the online survey, the conclusions summarised below were drawn.   Working together (in the same building/office), or at least having liaison officers, is  recognised as being the most efficient way of ensuring very good cooperation and  information sharing between CSIRT and LE. This model is successfully implemented  at least by the Nordic countries.   There is a very low interaction between the judiciary and the CSIRTs.   Cultural differences between CSIRT and LE are seen as the most important obstacle  to cooperation and information sharing.   Recent EU legislation on personal data protection (including GDPR) makes the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE harder as it sets stricter compliance  requirements for the data processors and applies visibility restrictions even to data that  were public in the past (e.g. WHOIS issue).   LE often rely on CSIRTs’ technical support and expertise as well as on sharing data  about incidents.  Multi-stakeholder cooperation and information sharing are the key activities for ensuring  cybersecurity. However, as can be seen from the online survey carried out and the interviews  conducted, in all countries there is space for improvement of this cooperation, depending on the  maturity level of each community and the restrictions that are being set by their national legal  framework. Improvements can be made in organisational, technical, cultural and legal aspects  of this cooperation:   Organisational challenges: There are no formal rules in place for cooperation among  the communities to set the ground for sharing experience, knowledge and getting  acquainted with each other’s practices.   Technical challenges: There is a lack of effective tools for secure sharing of  information and data as well as for evidence collection.   Cultural challenges: There is lack of trust among the communities and this results in  sharing a limited amount of information. Τhe staff of each community are either not  encouraged or conversely required by law or policies to provide assistance or  cooperation to other communities.   Legal challenges: Poor implementation or wrong interpretation of the EU legislation  for the protection of personal data sometimes may lead to lack of information sharing;  liability issues in data breach cases seem to be a challenge for the staff who are acting  as data processors or controllers.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  53  5.1.1 The importance of cooperation  An information security incident can be either a minor security incident or can also be a  cybercrime. If the incident is also a crime, it is necessary to identify the perpetrators. To achieve  this goal, cooperation and interaction among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary are of fundamental  importance; therefore, the cooperation challenges highlighted through the interviews should be  eliminated.  5.1.2 Effectiveness of cooperation  Effective cooperation is based both on the knowledge of the legal framework and on some  factual aspects. In particular:  (a) The legal framework on the subject is articulated. Even if the acts of the European  Union contribute to progressively eliminating the diversities in legislation of the various  Member States, significant differences are still highlighted across them. Interviewees  from the LE community pointed out that in some cases the communities might not  have a thorough knowledge of some key EU legal instruments, such as the European  Investigation Order (EIO) (40) that can play an important role in the investigation of  cybercrime.  (b) CSIRT, LE, and the judiciary have different mind-sets due to their different educational  and scientific backgrounds. This type of difference can set obstacles to the  effectiveness of an investigation as they make communication among these three  communities harder. Moreover, the different objectives set by the CSIRTs, LE, and  judiciary sometimes make CSIRTs ignore the legal requirements for the data validity  that could influence the admissibility of the data collected as evidence in a criminal  trial.  5.1.3 Strengthening of cooperation  Despite the significant advances in the field of cooperation, the analysis of the collected data  shows that it is necessary to further strengthen it. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to  act on a series of factors such as:  (a) To simplify the communication mechanisms between CSIRT, LE, and the judiciary;  (b) To speed up the time needed to obtain authorisation from their hierarchy by LE and  the judiciary;  (c) To deliver technical and legal training dedicated to cooperation and interaction across  CSIRT, LE and the judiciary;  (d) To improve the knowledge of the English language of everyone involved.  5.2  Recommendations  The recommendations presented in this roadmap have been categorised into organisational,  technical, cultural and legal, based on the aforementioned cooperation challenges.  5.2.1 Organisational  It is evident that CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities have complementary roles when fighting  against cybercrime; it is important to have clarity in duties and responsibilities of each actor and  measures in place to ensure coordination in order to avoid duplication of effort and increase the  effectiveness of combatting cybercrime. The segregation of duties matrix (for an example see  section 4.1.1.1.), once customised for each country, could help to give clarity of responsibilities  of each community and identify overlaps that may cause mutual interference in their activities.  (40) http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/Practitioners/operational/EIO/Pages/EIO.aspx  http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/Practitioners/operational/EIO/Pages/EIO.aspx  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  54  Defining an explicit cooperation framework among the various actors would also facilitate  interaction across the three communities. By setting up internal procedures for information  sharing and best practices exchange, LE and CSIRTs can automate the cooperation process  and make it more tangible, embedded into day-to-day activities.  These rules can be implemented in various forms. Depending on each EU MS’s maturity level  on law adoption, such a cooperation framework could be a legal instrument (regulating the  functioning of CSIRTs, handling cybersecurity incidents, investigating cybercrime, etc.), national  policy documents, inter-community memoranda of understanding, or their mutually compatible  internal guidelines.  The interviews also showed that appointing liaison officers in the partner community can  significantly enhance mutual trust and the effectiveness of cooperation. LE liaison officers  involved in CSIRT activities may provide assistance in identifying and qualifying offences,  collecting evidence properly, identifying offenders, or providing assistance to LE. CSIRT liaison  officers involved in LE activities can in turn provide their own expertise and experience with  specific technologies, where appropriate, provide access to information and data available to  CSIRTs or contacts with experts and partners. Beyond liaison officers, staff of each community  could also be assigned in other communities for adequate posting. CSIRT personnel could  spend some time as technical experts in an LE unit while an LE officer could work in crisis  management within a CSIRT community.  Some Member States have put CSIRT and LE to work together in the same building. Building a  common culture and ecosystem has proved efficient for their cooperation. This is a way also to  improve cooperation conditions among the communities, making the information exchange  easier; by doing this, Member States could build a team comprising different actors able to work  together during investigations.  Staff exchange and liaison officers could facilitate the mutual understanding across the  communities and voluntary information sharing on specific topics/cases. These opportunities  will create mixed culture personnel and thus strengthen cooperation.  Based on the data collected for this report, the main recommendations related to the  organisational aspects of the cooperation are:   Member States with the support of ENISA, Europol and possibly Eurojust: To  reach a better understanding and spread across the communities the knowledge of  roles and responsibilities of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary throughout the cybercrime  lifecycle phases, possibly by using ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix;   Member States with the support of ENISA and Europol: To promote staff exchange  between CSIRTs and LE and appoint liaison officers;   ENISA and Europol: To support the Member States to identify key information flow  paths to strengthen the cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  5.2.2 Technical  Using a common taxonomy (section 4.1.1.5.) solves the common problem of different  classification and description of individual types of cybersecurity incidents and their links to  criminal offences. Taxonomies can be extended to community best practices, definitions,  references to relevant legislation, or division of responsibilities in individual cases.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  55  Also using common tools could help the communities’ coordination. For instance, data  collection tools used by CSIRTs often do not store data in a format that can also be used  operatively by law enforcement authorities and judiciary. When the usage of the same tools is  not feasible, at least interoperability of tools could help cooperation and mitigate possible  operational challenges in information exchange. Thus, it is of great importance for CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary to take into account interoperability requirements when conceiving tools, to  make sure that each tool can export data in a standard format that can be functional for all  communities.  Based on the data collected for this report, the main recommendations related to the technical  aspects of the cooperation are:   ENISA, Europol’s EC3, and Member States: To promote the use of common  taxonomy;   ENISA, Europol’s EC3, and Member States: To promote usage of common tools or  at least interoperability of tools deployed and conceived considering future  technologies (41).  5.2.3 Cultural  Setting up regular synchronous and asynchronous meetings as well as physical meetings  allows the communities to share information about the current security situation, risks,  vulnerabilities and experiences. In particular, this helps to raise their awareness of current  threat landscape and foster mutual trust across the communities. This can be achieved:   Through joint exercises (section 4.1.3.), not only are individual skills tested, but also  individual communities are familiarised with practices of their counterparts; shared  exercise could also help the communities to identify inappropriate procedural rules and  build personal ties between the members of each community.   Through workshops (section 4.1.2.6.), individual communities can share experiences  and knowledge. This event type is particularly suitable for exchanging information on  legal rules, appropriate procedural procedures or specific technical procedures in  specific cases.   Best practices exchange (section 4.1.3.3.) creates opportunities for the staff to debate  and share practices on each community’s field of expertise.   Regular joint meetings give the communities the chance to cooperate and this seems  to be a good tool not only for sharing experience, information on threats and  vulnerabilities, trends and other important news, but also for building trust based on  personal connections between members of such communities.   Experience sharing (section 4.1.3.2.) gives the staff the opportunity to identify what  worked well and what can be improved through their professional experience.  Cybersecurity/legal glossaries can also improve mutual understanding by clearly defining terms  that might be understood differently across the three communities. Publishing internal guides  (section 4.1.3.3.) provides the communities with internal-use-only material on how cooperation  is developed at operational level as an everyday duty.  When assessing the qualifications of members of individual communities, the requirement for  their ability to interact with other relevant communities is often not taken into account. Creating  an appropriate qualifications framework that defines the roles of employees within the  communities, the experience and knowledge expected by them, could probably eliminate this  (41) For further detail also refer to section 4.2.4.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  56  deficiency. A competency framework that could provide specific requirements for these roles  could encourage educational institutions to include in their curriculum appropriate courses and  training focused on cooperation, while employers would also take these requirements into  account when selecting employees.  In previous ENISA reports, the importance of joint training for CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary was  highlighted. However, the interviews conducted to prepare this roadmap showed that training  organised is often criticised for its inadequacy, its usefulness and most of the time it is even  considered as a waste of time.  It is therefore necessary to promote high-level training useful for the CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary that could be appealing to them. In order to do this, well-prepared trainers are needed.  They should have appropriate theoretical and practical knowledge, as well as the ability to  communicate their knowledge effectively.  The interviews showed that the communities’ knowledge of digital forensics rules related to the  criminal trial can be further improved. Measures and actions operated by CSIRTs when  handling a security incident could delete evidence or compromise the LE investigation  (section 4.1.2.7). This has a direct impact on the evidence admissibility and the outcome of the  investigation, hence it must not be neglected.  Both joint exercises focused on technical cooperation and table-top exercises focused on  management cooperation could be very effective tools. Through these we can evaluate the  appropriateness of having set internal procedures, the ability of individual communities to  cooperate and also provide practical experience of cooperation, helping thus the communities  to build mutual trust. Creating specific exercises focused on specific aspects of cooperation  between specific communities and entities is effective, however often very costly. Interested  communities could participate in already existing national and international exercises to test  their cooperation in practice.  Interdisciplinary training covering not only the technical aspects but also the legal aspects  should be provided. For example, the lack of knowledge of the relevant legislation and of the  established procedural practices are key challenges that the communities are faced with. In  particular, CSIRTs might lack knowledge of the law governing the practice of obtaining  electronic evidence and procedures applied in criminal proceedings. On the other hand the law  enforcement and the judicial authorities might not have a thorough knowledge of the functioning  of the CSIRTs and the potential in terms of support that might have from CSIRTs in collecting  evidence.  Based on the data collected for this report, the main recommendations related to the cultural  aspects of the cooperation are:   Member States, possibly with the support of ENISA: To analyse composition and  size of available workforce and develop national competency frameworks;   ENISA, possibly with and Europol’s EC3, CEPOL and Eurojust: To help CSIRTs,  LE, and the judiciary to identify joint training possibilities on digital forensics where  technical and legal aspects are both examined; to promote a culture of training, both  for technical and legal matters; to prepare training material on CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary cooperation targeting the three communities;   Member States: To allow and encourage CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary (staff from all  hierarchical levels) to participate in the trainings and exercises.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  57  5.2.4 Legal  To avoid duplication of efforts, undesired interference and to assure an efficient utilisation of the  resources and expertise, Member States should define and implement cooperation frameworks  among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary by taking into account the responsibilities and capabilities  of these communities as well as their complementarity.  Agreements and memoranda of understanding are instruments where the rules of cooperation  and requirements related to evidence handling are defined; these types of cooperation  agreements can help CSIRT, LE and the judiciary representatives work together against  cybercrime and can significantly increase the effectiveness of their cooperation.  When designing and developing tools for communities, specific requirements defined by each  of them are taken into account. Security and privacy standards of the tools utilised may vary  from one community to another; a certification scheme that might provide a certain level of  security assurance for the tools used during the cybercrime investigation would further enhance  the cooperation among the three communities. Additionally, applying security standards on the  identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of e-evidence, may assist the  communities in ensuring the admissibility of e-evidence in a criminal proceeding and hence  promote successful cross-sectoral and international cooperation in the field (section 4.4.2).   ENISA: To identify and disseminate good practices of cooperation frameworks, by  using existing legal instruments and possibly additional memorandum of  understanding and cooperation agreements, among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary at  national and at cross-border level;   Member States: To define and implement cooperation frameworks among CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary;   ENISA: To assess the suitability of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for  cybercrime investigation tools.

They are: Instrument contributing to Stability  and Peace (58) (IcSP) ( (EU Commission, n.d.)), European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI)  (ENI, n.d.), and Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (59) (IPA) ( (EU Commission, n.d.)).  IPA consists of several systems aimed at help countries willing to integrate EU. Among these  tools, cross-border instruments enhance cooperation.  Data protection and data retention  Given the importance of protecting privacy, it is necessary to specifically note the EU legislation  on data protection and data retention.  The right to protection of personal data is a fundamental right. It is aimed at protecting ‘personal  data’, i.e. ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”)’  (Article 4, GDPR). The protection of privacy of electronic communications is specifically  addressed under Directive 2002/58/EC. Within the European legal framework, this fundamental  right is provided by several acts. Among them, the following are particularly significant:  Fundamental  right  Legal act  Respect for private  and family life  Article 7, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012)  Protection of  personal data  Article 8, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012)  Right to the  protection of  personal data  Article 16, (ex-Article 286 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union (TFEU) (European Union, 2012)  The protection of privacy as a fundamental right is also provided under the Council of Europe’s  Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also called  European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (Council of Europe, 1950) and more precisely  by Article 8 ‘Right to respect for private and family life’. It should be noted that further to the EU  Member States’ adherence to the ECHR, the European Union is expected to proceed with the  accession to the ECHR (60) under the relevant legal obligation defined by the Treaty of Lisbon  (Article 6, paragraph 2) (EU Member States, 2007).  The worldwide diffusion of IT and globalisation have caused and continue to cause new  challenges for the protection of personal data. For this reason, three important acts aimed at  strengthening the legal protection of personal data were issued in 2016. These acts are:  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), Directive (EU) 2016/680 (Law  Enforcement Data Protection Directive) and Directive (EU) 2016/681 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the use of passenger name record (PNR)  data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and  serious crime (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016) (61) (PNR  Directive).

Nevertheless, it ‘is not an  absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced  against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality’ (see  recital 4, GDPR). In particular it is necessary to balance the right to the protection of personal  data with requirements concerning prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of  criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.  Instead, data retention is the storage activity of ‘traffic data’ for a given period (which is called  ‘retention time’) for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of  criminal offences. Traffic data ‘means any computer data relating to a communication by means  of a computer system, generated by a computer system that formed a part in the chain of  communication, indicating the communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size,  duration, or type of underlying service’ (see Article 1, letter d) of the Convention on Cybercrime  (Council of Europe, 2001).  Some examples of traffic data are: the user ID(s) allocated; the user ID and telephone number  allocated to any communication entering the public telephone network; the name and address  of the subscriber or registered user to whom an internet protocol (IP) address, user ID or  telephone number was allocated at the time of the communication; the user ID or telephone  number of the intended recipient(s) of an internet telephony call; the name(s) and address(es)  of the subscriber(s) or registered user(s) and user ID of the intended recipient of the  communication; the date and time of the log-in and log-off of the internet access service, based  on a certain time zone, together with the IP address, whether dynamic or static, allocated by the  internet access service provider to a communication, and the user ID of the subscriber or  registered user; the date and time of the log-in and log-off of the internet email service or  internet telephony service, based on a certain time zone; the calling and called telephone  numbers; the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) of the calling party; the international  mobile equipment identity (IMEI) of the calling party; the IMSI of the called party; the IMEI of the  called party; the calling telephone number for dial-up access; the digital subscriber line (DSL) or  other end point of the originator of the communication; data identifying the geographic location  of cells by reference to their location labels (Cell ID) during the period for which  communications data are retained.  Since these data can be very important for investigation purposes, the legislation in many  Member States requires that the traffic data are stored in suitable archives. The problem arises  that the legislation should balance the needs of data protection and the needs of data storage  for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences.  Such a balancing must necessarily comply with the principle of proportionality, but this is not  always easy. This is clearly shown by the fact that the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of  the European Union (EU Court of Justice, 2014) (62), on 8 April 2014, declared invalid Directive  2006/24/EC because of the breach of the principle of proportionality (EU Council, n.d.) . This  was related to the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of  publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks  and amended Directive 2002/58/EC.  At European level, the laws on data retention of the various states are sometimes significantly  different from one another. In particular, the retention times are often different. The diversity of  retention times sometimes appears to investigators as an obstacle to investigative cooperation.  (62) Joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12 Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and Others (Court of Justice of the European  Union, 2014).  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  70  For this reason, European legislation that provides the same retention time in all Member  States could result in improved cooperation.  Consequences of data breaches (European Court of Human Rights)  Data breach is only one of many possible information security incidents. It is a major incident  and could lead to very heavy damage.  According to Article 4.12 of the GDPR, personal data breach ‘means a breach of security  leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or  access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed’.  All personal data breaches are security incidents; however, not all security incidents are  necessarily personal data breaches according to Article 29 Data Protection Working Party,  Guidelines on Personal data breach notification under Regulation 2016/679 (WP, Article 29,  2017).  In the case of a personal data breach, after the controller having become aware of it, two cases  can occur:  (a) The personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons. In this case the controller is not obliged to notify the personal data  breach to the competent supervisory authority (see Article 33.1 GDPR).  (b) The personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons. In this case, the controller must notify the personal data breach to the  competent supervisory authority. Such a notification must be delivered not later than  72 hours after the controller has become aware of it. If it is delivered after 72 hours,  the reasons for the delay must be declared. This notification must include at least the  following four points: a description of the nature of the personal data breach including  where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned  and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;  name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where  more information can be obtained; a description of the likely consequences of the  personal data breach; a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by  the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate,  measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects (see Article 33.3 GDPR).  Moreover, after becoming aware of a personal data breach, the processor shall notify the  controller without undue delay.  In addition to the notification obligations established by the GDPR, depending on the specific  cases, there may also be additional notification obligations provided for by other acts.  By way of example, the following notification obligations are mentioned here:   Article 19.2 Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation), which provides that  ‘Qualified and nonqualified trust service providers shall, without undue delay but in any  event within 24 hours after having become aware of it, notify the supervisory body and,  where applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the competent national body for  information security or the data protection authority, of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal  data maintained therein’.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  71   Articles 14 and 16 NIS Directive, which provide that operators of essential services  and digital service providers notify security incidents to their competent authority.   Data protection and data retention.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  72  C ANNEX: QUESTIONNAIRE  TO SUPPORT THE SUBJECT  MATTER EXPERT  INTERVIEWS  The questions below have been prepared to support the interviews with subject-matter experts  to collect data for the 2019 ENISA roadmap of further activities in the area of CSIRT (computer  security incident response teams) and law enforcement (LE) cooperation. The roadmap will not  necessarily be made public; it is likely to be distributed instead to selected stakeholders.  This roadmap contributes to the implementation of ‘Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and law enforcement’ of the ENISA  Programming Document 2019-2021, in particular to what is foreseen as publication: ‘Roadmap  to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs and law enforcement and their  interaction with the judiciary’.  (Link: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-  document-2019-2021).  ENISA selected some external experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the  ENISA Call for Expression of Interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) to support the data  collection and drafting of this report. In addition to desk research and an online survey  (planned), the data collection is done also via interviews with subject-matter experts.  The expected duration of the interview is 1 hour. Some of the questions below are common to  CSIRTs, LEAs and judiciary (judges and prosecutor), while others are tailored to CSIRTs, LEAs  and judiciary.  For information on how your personal data are processed, see the Privacy Statement below  (after the questions).

The data controller of the processing operation is ENISA Core Operations Department. The  legal basis for the processing operation is:  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  84  Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, on the basis of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013, in particular the provisions establishing the tasks of ENISA. With the view of  contributing to the fulfilment of such tasks and according to the ENISA Programming  Document 2019-2021 as approved by Management Board in Decision No MB/2018/20 [2],  ENISA is preparing a roadmap to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs  and law enforcement along with their interaction with the judiciary (see Output O.4.2.2 –  Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and law  enforcement).  Article 5(1)(d) of Regulation EU 2018/1725, i.e. consent of the data subjects.  The purpose of this processing operation is to collect data via an online survey and some  subject-matter interviews for the drafting of the ENISA roadmap to further enhance the  cooperation between the CSIRTs and law enforcement along with their interaction with the  judiciary.  The data processors of the processing operation will be external experts who will be  contracted by ENISA to support the data collection and drafting of the report. The online  survey will be conducted by using the EU Survey tool [3]. The interviews will be conducted  face to face, over the phone, via skype or with other means to be agreed with the interviewee.  The following personal data are collected for the respondents of the online survey and of  the interviews:  Contact and professional data: name, surname, community they belong to (e.g. CSIRT, LE,  prosecutors, judges, etc.), position, affiliation, country, email address, phone number  (optional).  Replies to survey/interviews: Note that the data produced by the data subjects’ replies to  survey/interviews are not generally considered to be personal data, since they are only of  professional nature. Still, there might be cases where a respondent produces ad hoc personal  data, e.g. by disclosing during the interview data relating to his/her private life or by  expressing his/her specific personal opinion regarding certain professional matters that may  influence the behaviour or status of other individuals. ENISA will make any possible effort to  remove ad hoc personal data from the replies to survey/interviews, as well as from the final  report. In all cases, the replies to survey/interviews will be presented in the roadmap in an  aggregated form.  The recipients of the data will be designated ENISA staff involved in the data collection and  drafting of the report, as well as designated ENISA contractors supporting ENISA with the  data collection and the drafting of the report (data processors). Only when explicit written  consent is provided by the data subject, name, surname, affiliation, country, might be included  in the acknowledgements of the roadmap. The roadmap will not necessarily be made public; it  is likely to be distributed instead to select stakeholders. The data may also be available to EU  bodies charged with compliance monitoring and inspection tasks.  Personal data will be kept up to a maximum period of 1 year after the publication and/or  distribution of the roadmap, (possibly in March 2020). After the end of this period, the contact  and professional data will be manually deleted. However, replies to survey/interviews will be  kept by ENISA beyond this period in an anonymised form (without linking to specific  respondents) for future ENISA projects.  You have the right of access to your personal data and to relevant information concerning  how we use it. You have the right to rectify your personal data. Under certain conditions, you  have the right to ask that we delete your personal data or restrict their use. You have the right  to object to our processing of your personal data, on grounds relating to your particular  situation, at any time. We will consider your request, take a decision and communicate it to  you. If you have any queries concerning the processing of your personal data, you may  address them to the ENISA staff working on this report at CSIRT-  LEcooperation@enisa.europa.eu.

This roadmap follows the reports that ENISA has published throughout 2017 and 2018 on this  subject-matter: Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the  Judiciary (ENISA, 2018), which focused on the aspects of the cooperation across the three  communities; Review of Behavioural Sciences Research in the Field of Cybersecurity (ENISA,  2018a), which focused on human aspects of cybersecurity; Tools and Methodologies to Support  Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement (ENISA, 2017), which focused on  technical aspects; and Improving Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: Legal  and Organisational Aspects (ENISA, 2017a), which focused on the legal and organisational  issues of cooperation. All these reports are available on the ENISA website.  When these entities – CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary – cooperate, they face challenges that have  been categorised as being technical, legal, organisational and/or human behaviour as they  associate with organisational culture. Understanding these challenges is essential to tackle  them, further enhance the cooperation and thus better fight against cybercrime. This roadmap  aims to support the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE, as well as their interaction with the  judiciary in their fight against cybercrime, by providing information on the aforementioned  cooperation aspects and by identifying current shortcomings and making recommendations to  further enhance cooperation. The geographical coverage of this roadmap is mainly limited to  the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.  The data for this roadmap was collected via desk research, interviews with subject-matter  experts and an online survey. The data collected has demonstrated that CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary mainly face a range of cooperation challenges. The legal framework is one of the most  frequently mentioned ones that acts as impeding data exchange; discrepancies in technical or  legal knowledge is another one, as it may make communication challenging; the chain of  custody in evidence collection might also be an issue when using methods that might make  evidence likely inadmissible to a criminal trial. Incident notifications and cybercrime reporting  differ from one Member State to another as different legal obligations might have been set by  their national laws.  The core recommendations identified to improve cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their  interaction with the judiciary are as follows.  ENISA:   to promote the use of ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix for avoiding conflicting roles  throughout the cybercrime investigation lifecycle   to provide guidance for building a competency framework for cybersecurity workforce   to promote knowledge of digital forensics rules   to promote interoperability of cooperation tools deployed and conceived considering  future technologies   to assess the suitability of cybersecurity certification for common tools and processes  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  6  Member States:   to define and implement a national framework for cooperation having all the  communities involved   to use the ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix for assigning roles and responsibilities  throughout the cybercrime investigation lifecycle aiming to get all communities involved   to develop national competency framework and education and training policies   to promote joint trainings, common inter-community technical and table-top exercises  carried out by competent people   to take into account interoperability requirements when conceiving tools  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  7  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE  Collecting information on current cooperation between CSIRTs and LE communities is a key  step to enhance it. In 2018, the ENISA report on CSIRT and LE cooperation aimed to present  aspects of cooperation between the two communities by adding the important dimension of  their interaction with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges); the purpose of this roadmap is to  allow to better apprehend subtle aspects of the cooperation and challenges lying ahead.  This roadmap analyses the practices used by various countries when cooperating in order to  better manage the cybersecurity incidents, identifies the key hindrances that prevent or limit  effective cooperation, and looks for examples of good practices through which cooperation can  be strengthened and further enhanced.  Importantly, ENISA aims at using this roadmap as guidance to plan its policy support activities  in the forthcoming period of its multiannual work programme planning.  1.2 BACKGROUND OF THE REPORT  In 2018, ENISA published a report addressing aspects of the cooperation between CSIRTs and  LE to fight against cybercrime, along with their interaction with the judiciary. The 2018 ENISA  report on Cooperation between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement: interaction with the Judiciary  (ENISA, 2018) confirmed that CSIRTs interact much more with LE than with the prosecutors  and that they interact very rarely with the judiciary; cultural limitations set additional hindrances  to this cooperation. There are legal provisions concerning CSIRTs and LE cooperation and their  interaction with the judiciary; it is broadly accepted that the use of common tools to facilitate  cooperation and interaction seems to be one of the key success factors for effectively fighting  cybercrime.  As highlighted in the 7th ENISA/EC3 workshop for national and governmental CSIRTs and their  LE counterparts (ENISA, 2018c), the theme of interaction across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary  is extremely important. In the context of the fight against cybercrime, it was also highlighted that  there is a need to leverage on joint trainings to bring these communities closer together in terms  of cooperating.  The ENISA programming document 2019-2021 includes ‘Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS  community building’. Under this objective, ‘Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and LE has the goal to build upon the progress  ENISA has made in supporting different operational communities (e.g. CSIRTs, LE, European  [Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and Analysis Centre] FI-ISAC) to enhance mutually  satisfactory ways to collaborate and support exchange of good practices among different  stakeholders in operational communities in Europe (ENISA, 2018b, p. 53).  This roadmap follows up on previous ENISA work and it contributes to the implementation of  the ENISA programming document 2019-2021, Output O.4.2.2, in particular to what is planned  for as ‘A roadmap of further activities on CSIRT/LE cooperation along with their interaction with  the judiciary’.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  8  While this roadmap was initially conceived as a document not for publication (to be shared with  selected stakeholders only), because of the more general interest that this document might  have, the decision was taken to publish it.  1.3 ROADMAP OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  1.3.1 Roadmap objectives  The main objectives of this roadmap are as follows:   To gather further information and discuss the current cooperation across CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary as far as it concerns their fight against cybercrime.   To provide information on the technical, legal, organisational and cultural aspects of  their cooperation and interaction.   To formulate and propose recommendations to further enhance the cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  1.3.2 Roadmap scope  The roadmap focuses on aspects of cooperation between CSIRTs (national/governmental  CSIRTs) and LE, and their interaction with the judiciary (prosecutors and judges).  The geographical coverage is limited to the EU (European Union, 2019) and EFTA (EFTA,  n.d.) (1) countries. (See also (ENISA, 2015a)). This does not mean however that all these  countries are covered in the roadmap and that no reference to other countries outside the EU  and EFTA is made. Comparison between the EU and EFTA, or between the EU and the United  States, or the EU and Asia (e.g. ASEAN), also fall outside the scope of this report.  This roadmap does not target a specific sector; considerations made can apply to cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary to fight against cybercrime (which includes crimes where a  computer is an object and crimes where a computer is a tool of crime) in all sectors (from  finance to energy, from transport to health).  The fight against terrorism, cyberwarfare, cyber espionage by nation states, as well as the  enforcement of rights in civil and administrative courts, are outside the scope of this roadmap,  although some of the considerations developed might be extended to such areas.  This roadmap does not aim to present an exhaustive set of instances of cooperation across  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, rather it seeks to facilitate the drawing of meaningful conclusions  and recommendations for further enhancing their cooperation and interaction.  1.4 TARGET AUDIENCE  The intended target audience are mainly CSIRTs (mainly national and governmental CSIRTs  but not limited to them), LE, prosecutors, and judges as well as individuals and organisations  with an interest in NIS.  For the purposes of this roadmap, the definition of each community is listed below:   Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) or computer emergency  response team (CERT) is ‘an organisation that studies computer and network security  to provide incident response services to victims of attacks, publish alerts concerning  vulnerabilities and threats, and […] offer other information to help improve computer  (1) In this report ‘n.d.’ stands for ‘no date’ and it is used in the references when no date could be found for the  cited source.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  9  and network security’. At present, ‘both terms (CERT and CSIRT) are used in a  synonymous manner, with CSIRT being the more precise term’ (ENISA, 2015a, p. 7)  (ENISA, 2015, p. 12) (ENISA, 2016a, p. 10). Governmental CSIRTs (Council, 2016a)  are teams whose constituency are the public administration networks (ENISA, 2017);   Law enforcement (LE), law-enforcement agencies (LEAs), police and police  agencies police and police agencies are terms used in this report, and are  synonymous, and used to refer to police and police agencies, also used as  synonymous. LE is ‘any public authority competent for the prevention, investigation,  detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties,  including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security’  (Official Journal of the European Union, 2016);   Judiciary refers both to prosecutors and judges (a similar approach taken in (Council  of the European Union, 2017). Prosecutor refers to ‘a legal official who accuses  someone of committing a crime, especially in a [criminal] law court’ (Cambridge  Dictionary, n.d.). Judge refers to a person who is in charge of a court of law and who  makes final decisions.  Additionally, policy and lawmakers may benefit from select aspects of analysis as well as  the recommendations of this report, as they prepare policies and legislation for enhancing  the cooperation between CSIRTs and LEs and their interaction with the judiciary.  http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-12711-2017-INIT/en/pdf  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  10  2. METHODOLOGY  2.1 INFORMATION COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS USED  The methodology chosen for creating this roadmap is largely inspired by the methodology used  in previous ENISA reports (ENISA, 2017), (ENISA, 2017a), (ENISA, 2018). This approach  represents a tested practice that is suitable for the purpose of data collection and analysis for  policy support in cybersecurity. Data for this roadmap was collected through desk research,  interviews with subject-matter experts and via an online survey. A qualitative methodological  approach has mainly been used due to the rather new field addressed; however, some  quantitative data were also collected: an online survey was carried out to validate and  complement the findings from the desk research and the interviews.  2.1.1  Desk research  Initial desk research was carried out based on publicly available information sources, including  ENISA publications. The findings from this desk research were particularly useful for the  scoping of the report and for drafting the questionnaire to support the interviews.  Supplementary desk research was conducted to address certain specific topics that the project  team deemed appropriate to examine in more depth following the analysis of the data collected  via the interviews.  2.1.2 Interviews and written replies to the questionnaire  A total of 31 subject-matter experts from 22 Member States replied to the questionnaire either  via structured interviews or with written replies. Of the respondents, 12 were experts from the  CSIRT community (mainly but not exclusively from national/governmental CSIRTs), 18 from the  LE community (mainly national police but also one from a local police force), and one from the  judiciary community.  Figure 1: Overview of communities of respondents to the interview  CSIRT 41%  LE 56%  Judiciary 3%  CSIRT LE Judiciary  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  11  A questionnaire (see Annex C – Questionnaire to support the subject-matter expert interviews)  was prepared to support the interviews. Most questions were open. For all questions, including  yes/no questions, interviewees could add comments and additional information.  The interviews included some questions common to CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary, followed by  a specific set of questions for each community.  The interviews were carried out from June to mid-July 2019. They were conducted either face  to face or via phone and they lasted around 1 hour each. Interviewees received the questions in  advance and in most cases they had the opportunity to review the notes taken by the  interviewers (ENISA project team) with their replies and validate them.  Two out of 31 respondents opted to submit written replies only. Some interviewees completed  also the online survey.  The questionnaire developed to collect data for this 2019 roadmap that addresses the issue of  cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary and aims to collect more in-depth information  on technical, legal, organisational and cultural aspects of their cooperation.  The interview questions started with a set of common questions for all participants to answer,  followed by three sets of specific questions for CSIRTs, LE or judiciary to answer respectively.  2.1.3 Online survey  An online survey was carried out to collect additional data to validate and further substantiate  some findings. It was comprised of 25 questions (see Annex D – Questions in the online  survey), most of them with closed answers and some with the possibility to add additional  comments and provide more details related to the answers.  The survey was developed using EUSurvey (2), a survey tool which is ‘supported by the  European Commission’s ISA programme, which promotes interoperability solutions for  European public administrations’.  The invitation to complete the survey was disseminated via:   a closed ENISA mailing list of European national and governmental CSIRTs;   a Europol mailing list of the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF (3)), which is  ‘composed of the heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU  Member States and Europol. (Council of the European Union, 2017b, p. 13).  The survey was launched in June 2019 and was open for around 2 weeks. The data collected  via the online survey was used to validate the data collected through the desk research and the  interviews and used to produce some statistical graphs.  A total of 33 replies (4) were received. Of these (5), 24 were from EU Member States and EFTA  countries (EFTA, n.d.) and one from a non-EU/non-EFTA country. It must be noted that the  reply from non-EU/non-EFTA country was somewhat in line with the other replies received and  has been used to formulate general considerations; however, the graphs in this roadmap were  (2) https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/home/welcome  (3) In execution of the JHA Council conclusions of 27-28 November 2008 and of the 26 April 2010, Europol, together with  the European Commission and the EU Member States, have set up the European Union cybercrime task force (EUCTF)  composed of the Heads of the designated national cybercrime units throughout the EU Member States and Europol. The  EUCTF is an interagency group formed to allow the Heads of Cybercrime Units, Europol, the European Commission and  Eurojust to discuss the strategic and operational issues related to cybercrime investigations and prosecutions within the  EU and beyond.

In total, 11 respondents out of 33 in the EU and EFTA, were from the CSIRT community, 21  from the LE community and one belonged to both of these communities; no replies were  received from the judiciary. An overview of the composition of the EU and EFTA respondents,  based on the community they belong to, is presented hereinafter in Figure 2.

ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) (ENISA, n.d.).  Four of them contributed to this roadmap by supporting the data collection and the drafting  while two were reviewers. The two CEI experts contributing as reviewers reviewed this  roadmap in several rounds including the first draft in May 2019, an intermediate draft in June  2019, the semi-final and the final draft in July 2019.  All six experts contributed ad personam.  These experts contributed inter alia with their expertise in NIS aspects of cybercrime, including  but not limited to CSIRT and law cooperation, operational cooperation, information sharing to  handle incidents and to fight against cybercrime.  (7) The ENISA CEI list comprises of experts in various NIS subject-matters that have been selected according to a  procedure in line with the ENISA financial regulation; these experts are called upon by ENISA from time to time to  support the Agency in carrying out its operational duties.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  14  3. CSIRTS, LE AND THE JUDICIARY:  STATE OF PLAY  This chapter presents the state of play for the cooperation across the three communities. This  chapter also discusses cases that lack cooperation; examples for cybercrime cases that  cooperation is required are also presented.  3.1 LACK OF COOPERATION  The extent to which cooperation and information sharing among the three communities is taking  place varies considerably across Member States due to various reasons. As seen in Figure 3,  in some countries, cooperation is universally accepted as a necessary measure, required by  law, implemented in guidelines and internal policies and supported by implementation of  technical, organisational and procedural measures; while in others, the cooperation is limited to  providing information (in the form of evidence or witness testimony) when requested by the LE  or the judiciary. Figure 4 depicts that all three communities agree that cooperation across  CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary should be mainly regulated by national legislation.  Figure 3: Replies to question 22 of the online survey conducted for this roadmap  6%  19%  19%  13%  28%  41%  3%  3%  No formal rules in place  Internal policies  Legal framework  Replies  Q22.

CSIRT LE Both CSIRT-LE  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  15  Figure 4: Replies to question 22A of the online survey conducted for this roadmap  As both desk research and interviews showed, all three communities agree that effective  collaboration and information sharing can streamline their work. By working closely together the  communities may achieve increased effectivity of mitigation of cybersecurity incidents as well  as of cybercrime investigations, better quality of electronic evidence, greater availability of  expertise and specialised technical tools, improved availability of information about relevant  vulnerabilities and threats, increased effectivity of response to the large-scale attacks on  national infrastructure, and ultimately therefore, greater security in society.  Following chapters of this roadmap examine the possible reasons for the lack of cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary is highlighted and present the tools and mechanisms  through which this cooperation can be promoted at EU and national level.  Not all cyber incidents are cybercrimes (so LE do not need to be informed) and not all  cybercrimes are considered cyber incidents (so CSIRTs do not need to be informed). This  means that LE and CSIRTs do not always have the same interest in incidents or investigations,  which also affects the way they further handle each case. Since cybercrime crosses borders,  cooperation among countries is often crucial in the fight against it. In this regard, at least three  difficulties are identified:  1. Political difficulties. Some Member States are reluctant to cooperate because they  prefer to achieve the investigative results on their own. Sometimes this is linked to a  political vision that considers collaboration across operational communities as erosion  of sovereign state powers as cybersecurity has entered the diplomatic realm  (European Commission, 2018a). In particular, it seems that diplomacy encounters  difficulties to promote EU values, interests and principles in the cyber domain.  Moreover, there are some issues in supporting aimed at strengthening capacities of  partner countries and organisations in the field of cybercrime (EU Council, 2016),  (Moret E., Pawlak P., 2017). .  2. Legal difficulties. At European level, there are different regulations related to the  cybercrime depending on the state. This makes the interaction for CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary more difficult.  3%  3%  13%  28%  34%  53%  75%  Common soft-law  Other  No need for an additional legal instrument  Internal rules of each organization  EU legislation  MoU/Agreements  National legislation  Replies  22A. What kind of rules should regulate the cooperation across the  three communities?  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  16  3. Difficulties related to different mindset approaches. CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  have different approaches or mindsets, which also derives from the different  educational and scientific backgrounds. In particular, CSIRTs have a ‘technical  mentality’ while the judiciary has a ‘legal mentality’. The LE have partly a ‘legal  mentality’ and partly a ‘technical mentality’ that is entrenched in how society operates  in the area of crime. The different mentalities make communication among these three  entities not always easy. This can also lead to limitations of cooperation or at least a  slowdown in cooperation.  Despite these three obstacles, there are some improvements in cooperation among CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary at the European Union level. This derives from a set of factors. For  instance, European Union acts aimed at encouraging cooperation; big complex transnational  cases (see Petya (EC3, 2017), NotPetya (Europol, 2019), WannaCry (ENISA, 2017b), etc.)  have changed the perception of the need for cooperation; and training and education needs in  the area of cooperation have also been highlighted through reports (ENISA, 2017a); (ENISA,  2018).  National legal framework and CSIRT type are some of the major differentiators when it comes  to frequency and level of cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary. National and  governmental CSIRTs are usually more involved in this type of cooperation, especially those  that are functioning under a National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) type organisation.  Obviously, operating under the same governmental umbrella, or even working at the same  facilities, enables organisations to better know each other and to benefit from a higher mutual  trust both organisationally and personally. Another important aspect of this setup is that it poses  less legal challenges for cooperation and information sharing (e.g. CSIRT is not considered an  external organisation). Background check of the CSIRT staff is just one example of things that  increase the level of trust from the LE perspective.  Interviews show a strong trend regarding cooperation obstacles, the majority of those being  attributed to procedural difficulties and legal issues. Cultural and organisational difficulties, may  be seen as a major issue; however, interviewees have identified those cooperation challenges  as less aggravating. (See Figures 5, 6).

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  17  Figure 6: Replies to question 2 of the online survey  3.2 EXAMPLES OF CYBERCRIME CASES WHERE COOPERATION IS  REQUIRED  When cooperating in a cybercrime investigation case, each entity shares its expertise to move  the case forward. LE conducts the investigation following the instructions of the  magistrate/prosecutor who determines the strategic options. The magistrate usually decides  whether to use coercion or not (seize, searches, interception) while LE conduct investigations  on field. Coercion-based acts as well as open sources investigation provide a lot of data that  need to be analysed and processed. In this phase, CSIRT expertise might be needed, having  required internal skills and tools.  Some big complex transnational cases are presented below:   Altran was one of the most important European IT consulting companies. At the beginning  of 2019, it was struck by a ransomware attack a few weeks before markets financial  publication. Stocks took a hit and a few month later, Altran was bought out by Capgemini  (Capgemini, 2019). Cooperation between CSIRT and LE took place immediately: Altran  was in contact with several critical infrastructures. As such, national CSIRT was first  responder on site. They collected evidence and then provided it to LE for investigation.   Sytech leak (Abrams, 2019): on 18 July, 0v1ru$, a so far-unknown hacking group,  published allegedly leaked Russian Federal Security Service’s (FSB) data. Screenshots  published on twitter showed interface of internal network as well as a massive  (7 Terabytes or 7 000 gigabytes) amount of leaked data. Most of these data were  concerning FSB Unit 71330 spying and surveillance projects. Among them, a Tor de-  anonymisation project which had been previously suspected by researchers. Data were  then passed to Digital Revolution group who put it at journalists’ disposal.   NotPetya attack (Andy Greenberg, 2018): this attack was conducted through the Ukraine  main tax-paying application which infected entire parts of the country’s economy as well  as other big foreign companies (A.P. Moller-Maersk, Saint-Gobain S.A., Merck KGaA).  3%  3%  3%  6%  13%  16%  16%  16%  No answer provided  Technical  Organizational  Culture change  Skillset discrepancies  Other  Procedural  Legal  Replies  Q2.

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  18  Looking more of a wiper than a ransomware, because lacking decrypting capabilities,  NotPetya was an attack, seemingly, against a country. Because of the very complex  technical architecture used by attacker and extensive planning they seem to have  conducted, investigations showed to be very heavy and technical. CSIRT provided its  technical expertise.   Botnet takedown (usually requires a close and efficient cooperation and coordination  among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary from different countries. The Avalanche botnet  dismantling (Eurojust, 2016) was a 4 years operation which implied a strong CSIRT-LE  cooperation. German BKA, criminal police, and BSI, national CSIRT, worked together for  4 years to takedown the infrastructure.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  19  4. COOPERATION ASPECTS  4.1 ORGANISATIONAL ASPECTS  4.1.1 Organisational structure  4.1.1.1 Segregation of duties per community  Each community has its own discreet set of responsibilities, duties, expertise, powers and  technical and procedural tools. Sometimes, however, duties and responsibilities overlap, and  this might lead to undesirable interference to each other’s activities. Therefore, it is important for  the communities to understand each other’s duties.  For this purpose, the segregation of duties matrix (SoD) developed in the 2018 ENISA report on  Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE: interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2018) could be  used in order to highlight conflicting or overlapping duties performed by one community or  more. Not only does this matrix identify the key responsibilities for each community but it also  links them with the skills required to fulfil these duties by presenting appropriate training topics  that should be provided (8).  When using the SoD matrix, it is necessary to identify the key roles of individual communities.  CSIRTs are responsible to ensure the confidentiality, availability and integrity of systems within  their constituency. LE aims to trace offenders and gather evidence that describes the course of  the offence and show offenders’ guilt. On the basis of the results of the work of the law  enforcement authorities, the judiciary assesses the factual and legal conclusions resulting from  the evidence obtained and decides on guilt and punishment.  The CSIRTs’ role is to prevent incidents from happening by implementing appropriate security  measures or suggesting such measures to their constituency. And in the event of an incident,  their aim is to detect and analyse the incident and apply appropriate measures, remedy the  damage and subsequently secure the exploited vulnerabilities, or other existing threats. As first  responders, however, they could be also responsible for advising their constituency to report  the incident to LE (or in some cases they might have themselves a duty to report), expected to  share the information with other sectors or targeted industries, and required to provide  necessary assistance to other communities and collect evidence.  LE is dedicated to investigate cybercrimes and investigate possible culprits. They have legal  power to mandate entities to cooperate in the investigation and disclose information or to  contribute to the investigation in different ways: seizes, searches, and interceptions. LE  responsibility is to collect evidence in a lawful way, even if it may challenge remediation or  business continuity. Of course, they seek to avoid further consequences to the victims, but  sometimes, evidence collection can postpone remediation or return to normal.  The roles of the judicial authorities vary, as public prosecutors or investigative  judges/magistrates usually direct the course of an investigation, to authorise some investigative  actions, to analyse and interpret collected evidence and provide legal assistance to the LE. The  court judges have the authority to authorise some investigative measures, to admit and assess  the evidence provided by LE and prosecutors, and ultimately decide who the victim is, who the  (8) ENISA does not keep track of whether and, if so, who adopted and implemented the SoD matrix in practice, so it is not  known what its use looks like in practice and for what purposes and to what extent it is actually used.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  20  offender is, what the crime was and how the offender should be punished. In addition, the  judicial authorities should act in such a way as to ensure that fundamental rights are respected  during the investigations as well as during the trial. Examples of fundamental rights are the  Right to a fair trial and Right to an effective remedy (Council of Europe, 1950), Article 6 and  Article 13 and (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012) Article 47, Right to  respect for private and family life ( (Council of Europe, 1950), Article 8 and (European Union,  2012) Article 7), Right to no punishment without law ( (Council of Europe, 1950) Article 7 and  (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012) Article 49), Prohibition of  discrimination ( (Council of Europe, 1950) Article 14 and (EU Parliament, EU Charter of  Fundamental Rights, 2012) Article 21).  The role, the powers and responsibilities however vary greatly in individual states. There are  significant differences also at European level. More in-depth information on the role of all of the  communities can be found in 2018 ENISA report Cooperation between CSIRTs and LE:  interaction with the Judiciary (ENISA, 2018).  4.1.1.2 Indicative example of Segregation of duties matrix  Figure 7 depicts a very indicative example of a SoD matrix. It is not based on a specific legal  system. Depending on the country and its legal system this duty matrix might be different and  show different segregation of duties.  As seen in the matrix, the activities of crime have been categorised based on the timeline of a  crime; in particular, we have activities prior to an incident/crime, during the incident/crime and  post incident/crime activities.  The following SoD matrix presents, with all its limitations due to abstraction and generalisation,  how individual duties and responsibilities may be assigned among the three communities. As  seen in Table 1 there might be overlapping duties performed by more than one communities.  Once there is lack of coordination, this can lead to interference with each other’s activities,  which can have a negative impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of their work. It is  therefore appropriate in these cases that the relevant communities agree on rules for the  segregation of duties in order to prevent these negative effects.

This flowchart is a continuation of last year’s information flowchart  focusing on the investigation phase of a cybercrime (ENISA, 2018, p. 40). This graphical  representation, with all the limitations due to abstraction and generalisation, presents actions  taken during the investigation phase; although criminal investigation seems to be under LE  duties, it is worthwhile to mention that CSIRTs’ technical expertise and judicial authorities’  viewpoint are needed in order the investigation to be completed.  Figure 7: Graphical representation of the flow of information across CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary: Analysis of the investigation phase  4.1.1.4 Complementarity of duties  Each community’s duty is part of a process which lead to identifying cybercrime perpetrator(s)  and building a safer internet. CSIRTs focus on remediation and business continuity while LE  objective is to identify the perpetrator and then the judiciary will guarantee the legal prosecution  so the culprit can be charged and brought before the competent court. Figure 8 depicts the  roles and duties of each community are illustrated in the graph below.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  23  Figure 8: Roles and duties per community  Even though each community has different goals, means, powers and duties, their  responsibilities are complementary. The key goal of the CSIRTs is to ensure availability,  integrity and confidentiality of networks and systems within their constituency; however, when  the security is threatened by external attackers, they would need law enforcement to identify the  attacker and prevent him from further attacks. On the other hand, to successfully identify and  prosecute the attacker, law enforcement might need information, data, expertise or equipment  that in some cases might be available exclusively to the CSIRTs. Finally, in order for the  judiciary to be able to convict and punish the attacker, they need actionable electronic evidence  so as to understand how the attacker operates and what the electronic evidence suggests.  Therefore, the activities of each individual community must be coordinated. In some cases,  there are internal security policies of each organisation, or common policy for both communities  that govern the information sharing between certain CSIRTs and LE. Such internal security  policies can improve cooperation between CSIRTs and LE by allowing the CSIRTs to acquire a  greater knowledge of e-evidence collection requirements and develop compliant operational  practices.  4.1.1.5 Discrepancies in finalities: investigation vs remediation  Evidence collection   Investigation: needs for evidence collection  Evidence must be collected in a lawful manner. If a specific law, applying to all  involved communities, outlines detailed standards to handle an investigation, it must  be applied and interpreted within the scope and in the meaning of other legal  instruments, national and possibly international, that are aimed at protecting  fundamental rights (9).  Forensic evidence collection must guarantee evidence data have not been altered or  tampered with. To do so, investigators must for instance use write blockers (10).  Should a member of LE staff not do this, the lawyer of the defendant could argue that  there had been evidence alteration by the police.  Each step of evidence collection is bordered, whether in a technical manner, by  imposing use of vetted tools, or controlled by a magistrate. In case of interception,  some specific operations can only be carried out by using tools vetted by a dedicated  commission.  (9) For more on differences between common and civil law systems please see subchapter 4.4.1.4. below.  (10) A writing blocker is a system aimed at avoiding any alteration of the target device during copy. It is mandatory to  guarantee proof relevance in trial.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  24   Remediation: may destroy evidence  Depending on the IT infrastructure affected as well as the processes and procedures  used for backup and logging, remediation without proper evidence preservation could  actually destroy evidence and may complicate investigations further.  For instance, re-imaging of an infected workstation can delete information about a  malware family. This can be prevented by firstly collecting volatile data (live data,  before shutting down the machine: network connections, running apps/processes,  paging file, memory dump, etc.) and then taking a full disk image. In virtualised  environments, such activities can be done by simply taking a virtual machine snapshot  before the re-image.  The functioning of CSIRTs is not as strictly regulated as in the case of LE, and  therefore they are more flexible to choose appropriate measures to deal with an  incident. However, if CSIRT members are not familiar with the law enforcement  processes, the handling of the electronic evidence and the legal requirements for  evidence admissibility, their activities may render the digital evidence inadmissible and  therefore useless for criminal prosecution.  Based on the online survey results (see Figure 9), the most critical phase where cooperation is  of great importance is the evidence collection phase. During this phase, LE may request CSIRT  experts for support in order to lead complex technical activities; LE may have limited internal  resources for the technical analysis.  Figure 9: Replies to question Q6 of the online survey  Timing:  Timing of operations constitutes one of several discrepancies in the CSIRT/LE way of  intervention. An investigation often needs LE to access private data. As such, access to this  data is authorised mainly under a magistrate’s control and strictly ruled by law. This guarantees  civil liberties but the several layers of controls may introduce a lot of uncompressible delay.  Data access is usually managed by several tracking procedures which eventually generate red  tape. As an example, setup of an interception can take more than 1 week. Transnational  cooperation, especially outside the EU, is subject to an even more demanding set of  requirements and formalities.  3%  9%  19%  28%  41%  Detection and analysis  Post-incident activity  Preparation  Containment, eradication and recovery  Evidence collection  Replies  Q6. In which stage of the incident response life cycle, the  contribution of the CSIRT/LE/Judiciary would be helpful:  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  25  CSIRTs have as a main task to respond to and mitigate cyber incidents. When the cyber  incident has a cybercrime component the remediation part might interfere with the LE  investigation if proper cooperation and a remediation procedure has not been set in place. For  example host disinfection or reimage might erase the necessary evidence/traces for  investigations.  Because of the strict requirements that apply, LE timing is usually longer than that of CSIRTs.  While CSIRTs have to provide fast, sometimes immediate, response to incident, LE’s  investigations take longer to pursue. If first LE responders’ actions are quick to preserve  evidence, further investigation timeframes require time due to legal constraints. Investigations  imply evidence search and collection, warrants and request issues, analysis of new evidence  and so on. To be efficient, evidence analysis (malware samples, logs files, compromised hard  drive or memory dump) must be thorough and extensive. Evidence and IOCs extracted will then  trigger new research such as server seize, interception of IP, identification of an email or an ISP  account (Facebook account, Google account, etc.). Each of these steps may have to be vetted  by a magistrate which extends investigation duration. Furthermore, when European or  international cooperation is implied, MLATs (international warrants) use can take several  months to occur.  Another key factor that can delay the investigation is the innovative nature of cybercrime. It  comes with challenging legal questions that the current legal framework has not been  conceived for. For example, how to seize a bitcoin wallet outside the investigating police force’s  country? Cybercrime investigations trigger legal questioning which often fuel law modification.  No matter how long it takes, each legal question must be carefully discussed among all actors  (LE, magistrate, even Europol and Eurojust) and can postpone even more next investigation  steps.  During the remediation phase, there is limited time frame for action as systems need to be  recovered as soon as possible. Sometimes proper evidence collection or preservation would  increase significantly the remediation time which might have a negative impact from a business  perspective. That is why there are situations when the victim needs to decide on the priorities:  remediation vs investigation. CSIRTs need to be prepared to offer this consultancy to the  victims.  Taxonomy:  The vast majority of the CSIRTs use at least one taxonomy and that is because they usually  publish periodic reports on incidents handled and also because they process and share data  automatically. ENISA promoted the use of taxonomies in the CSIRT community as part of the  best practices sharing. (ENISA, 2016)  LE use taxonomies too but more often refer to legal definitions of crimes foreseen in the  criminal law framework, namely in the articles of the criminal code. In the criminal code each  crime/infringement is described in general terms. The main difference is those descriptions are  results-based: intrusion in a system is the act of unlawfully accessing someone else’s system.  Objectives are different: cybersecurity taxonomy defines how things have been done to be able  to identify vulnerabilities, correct them and reach a more secure situation after the incident than  before. The criminal law aims at having perpetrators punished and stopping the commission of  crimes. But the same issue can happen the next day from another perpetrator. Since the  criminal law is the base ground for any investigation work, LE often refer to legal definitions of  crimes. It is changing slowly because of the needed interactions with cybersecurity ecosystem  and, for investigations purposes, to be technically more efficient.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  26  There is however clear motivation to share a common language among the communities since  their cooperation is necessary. There are some common taxonomies available that can be used  to achieve mutual understanding. The common taxonomy developed by ENISA and Europol  lists and categorises most common cybersecurity incidents and links these incidents to relevant  offenses defined in the Directive on attacks against information systems (EU Council, 2013)  and CoE Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001). Some countries also decided to  further develop their taxonomies – some included links to national criminal codes, definition of  incidents from CSIRTs’ perspective, or suggestions on how to proceed with incident mitigation,  report identified offences or collect evidence. In some cases, a glossary of terms, which defines  the meaning of certain terms used by individual communities, may also be appropriate in order  to further enhance mutual cooperation and understanding. Such a glossary could be especially  useful for the judiciary, since judges and public prosecutors have legal education and very  technical language may represent a challenge for them. An example of such a glossary that  also facilitates cross-border cooperation, as it contains definitions in the national language and  in English, can be the Cyber Security Glossary developed by the authorities of the Czech  Republic (Gov CERT CZ, 2015).  Figure 10 highlights that 45 % of LE respondents stated that they do not use any taxonomy or  glossary that would support mutual understanding of the communities.  Figure 10: Replies to question Q7 of the online survey  The judiciary tasks are based on the criminal law using in particular the criminal code that  applies to each national legal system; this is used as a basis to qualify the criminal  offences. However, adopting a common language is necessary in order to improve the  cooperation with the CSIRT and LE communities as there is lack of common  understanding. The judiciary usually have a legal background and might face challenges  with technical language and technical problems.  Currently, in criminal trials, the Court may ask for CSIRTs’ technical expertise in order to  explain technical concepts, such as IP addresses. This is because the judiciary are not  always familiar with technical terminology. It would be of great importance for the judiciary  16%  16%  3%  16%  50% 3%  No answer provided  Yes  No  Replies  Q7. Do you use any taxonomy/glossary that would support mutual  understanding of the communities?  CSIRT LE Both CSIRT - LE  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  27  to receive more and more technical training that would help when dealing with cybercrime  cases.  The judiciary evaluate cybercrime through the criminal law (mainly but necessarily limited  to the criminal code) that determines which crimes and offences are punishable. As a form  of taxonomy, it is more results-oriented without focusing on how a crime has been  committed. As such, this would probably be very different from a standard taxonomy; as  long as systems have been hacked, details such as vulnerability exploitation, scam or  human errors could only be examined as aggravating factors when assessing the sentence  imposed. What the judiciary need to know is that the perpetrator is responsible for  infringing the system.  Based on the online survey results, what is of high importance is the CSIRT-LE taxonomy  to be based both on LE constraints and CSIRT environment (See Figure 11).  Figure 11: Replies to question Q3 of the online survey  4.1.2 Governance framework and compliance  4.1.2.1 Management practices  Management practices usually refer to the approaches that are followed by managers aiming to  make their organisation more efficient. Differences are highlighted in the management practices  used by each community and are presented below.   CSIRT approach: CSIRTs are usually small organisations with simple hierarchy (flat  organisations) and this is a key factor in the fast decision-making process. Another aspect  is that CSIRTs tend to have more operationally involved managers (or at least informal  leaders) to be able to make quick decisions for initiating the CSIRT’s key activity, i.e. the  22%  38%  31%  13%  22%  47%  19%  16%  44%  28%  22%  9%  High importance Medium importance Low importance No answer provided  R e p  lie s  Q3. Do you think that CSIRT-LE taxonomy should be based on:  LE constraints CSIRT environment A mix of the two  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  28  incident response. Some CSIRT may organise a form of polyvalence where a person can  be assigned to different tasks each week.   LE approach: At operational level, LE use a hierarchical organisational structure based on  ranks to ensure information flow and decision-making at the desired level. One of the key  challenges in cybercrime relates to the method applied in either LE or CSIRTs, with  CSIRTs generally taking a more technical approach on incident analysis.  Information flow and reporting seem to be a cultural matter as LE usually have a fairly  strong set of processes for information flowing. It allows decision-makers, operational or  even politicians, to be provided with the most possibly relevant information. This type of  organisation proves to be very efficient in cases of emergency or a crisis. Staff of any  hierarchical level know their roles of intervention and any legal requirement about  information sharing between LE and their counterparts. Thus, in the EU cooperation field,  this pyramidal organisation with Europol acting as coordinator has proved to be very  efficient.   Judiciary approach: The judicial authority is a functional authority for LE and an  adjudicator in terms of applying the law. Compared to the LE, the judiciary usually have the  powers to take measures against a criminal action and control investigative acts.  In most constitutional systems, the judiciary are independent from other authorities in a  Member State. However, the level of their independence varies from country to country, as  well as the scope of each authority and its organisational structure. It is generally accepted  that the judicial authorities have a hierarchical organisational structure and in some  countries dedicated units are dealing with certain types of crime. This hierarchical structure  is met in both the courts and the prosecutor’s offices. From the perspective of cybercrime  investigation, it is crucial to determine to what extent the judicial authorities are specialised  in a type of crime. In some countries, there are specialised units in courts or prosecutors’  offices dedicated to cybercrime that have staff with technical expertise. However, in other  countries, this is not possible because of the organisational structure of courts and  prosecutor’s offices and relevant legislation; it is then up to the individual judges and  prosecutors to decide whether or not to specialise and voluntarily educate themselves.  Another important aspect is that the judiciary has institutional authority over the law  enforcement. As a rule, the course of the investigation is supervised by a prosecutor or an  investigative judge whose authorisation or cooperation is often required to carry out certain  procedural measures. The evidence and information collected during the investigation must  have the quality of admissible evidence and be onwards provided to the judge in a  comprehensible way, for the latter one to decide on its relevance and assess the weight of  evidence.  4.1.2.2 Internal security policies permitting and supporting information sharing with  CSIRT/LE counterpart  Each CSIRT/LE is capable of sharing information when working with its own community but  both communities might face have difficulties in sharing with each other due to legal and  operational restrictions. Usually LE have more restrictions on exchanging information with  CSIRTs given the confidential nature of the investigations and for that reason, in certain cases  we observe a one-way data flow: from CSIRTs to LE. This also depends a lot on the CSIRT  national mandate and setup.  Another problem is the remediation-investigation dichotomy which impedes information sharing.  LE have a specific proven legal framework to share intelligence with LE in other Member  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  29  States. Sharing with another community outside the LE field poses two challenges, one  operational and one legal.  On the operational side, sharing investigation information can impede or even jeopardise the  identification of perpetrators. Also, LE tend to avoid disclosing information by fear of  compromising several months or years of work. An LE agency could share an IOC of an IP  address of a C² server. However, intelligence sharing may generate a takedown by a CSIRT  partner, while LE intended to seize or intercept the C² server. From a legal standpoint, the  prosecutor decides whether to communicate, or not, any case-related information. Therefore,  before sharing data, LE need to explain the necessity and seek prosecutor’s permission first.  4.1.2.3 Practices and procedures: sharing the same organisational procedures  Sharing common organisational procedures may still be a challenge as each community has  been established to meet its specific mission’s objectives while respecting a set of different  rules.  4.1.2.4 Degree of procedures’ formalisation  CSIRTs, being relatively new organisations, have yet to crystallise their working methods in a  way that aligns with the scientific and forensics method applied in LE which is over a century  and a half old. While LE’s work is considerably formalised due to legal requirements, forensic  cybercrime investigation procedures have overall not reached the same level of detail within the  CSIRT community. Remediation takes place within the (usually) controlled environment of a  constituency’s system. CSIRT have developed a fairly good grip on it and can take stances on  almost all aspects of this environment. On the contrary, not all steps of a specific LE  investigation process can be anticipated, as the process has to address the human factors that  are related to each victim and each perpetrator and may significantly affect the handling of a  cybercrime case. The most challenging part would be to analyse the victim’s device, detect and  collect the IOCs.  4.1.2.5 Incident report protocol  CSIRT may face challenges when reporting incidents to preserve partners’ trust. CSIRT usually  do not have a formalised process to report incidents to LE but have very good and documented  ways for incident reports collection.  LE are notified through victims’ complaints instead of incident reports. The key challenge for the  investigation is unknown incidents. Even if no complaint is lodged, once an incident is detected,  an investigation could be initiated; in some MS jurisdictions, LE may be required ex officio to  launch the procedure, regardless of the victim’s interest in pursuing an investigation that may  go on for years. This can be a challenge for LE units being overwhelmed by cases of  compromised IP addresses.  4.1.2.6 How to improve the performance of national CSIRTs in terms of procedural  compliance  Effective supervision of the national CSIRTs’ constituency should also include a check on the  training of their staff regarding the collection of e-evidence to be used in a criminal trial.  When using procedural tools for evidence collection purposes, CSIRTs have to comply with the  requirements mandated by LE. In order for the evidence obtained to be admissible in court, the  procedural rules defined in the code of criminal procedure must be followed. However, CSIRT  staff usually do not have a legal or in-house expertise or experience with criminal investigations,  so compliance management issues are challenging for them.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  30  For this reason, it is advisable, on the one hand, to provide CSIRTs with relevant information on  how to proceed in accordance with the law and, on the other hand, for CSIRTs to be supervised  when they are performing the requested activities.  The transmission of information can take various forms; in some countries, CSIRTs and LE  carry out joint workshops, conferences or other regular meetings where information and  experience are being shared. A very effective tool is the implementation of joint exercises,  where law enforcement authorities verify their ability to cooperate effectively with CSIRTs, and  CSIRTs in turn verify their ability to comply with requests received from LE.  For the purposes of supporting CSIRT operations, in some countries, LE liaison officers are  appointed to work closely with CSIRTs as consultants, to provide advice on how to act in  accordance with the law and how to cooperate effectively with law enforcement authorities. This  mechanism can also work vice versa; a CSIRT representative may also play the role of a liaison  officer and get involved in activities of law enforcement authorities and provide them with  information on how to work effectively with CISRTs.  4.1.2.7 How to ensure compliance with judiciary procedures – a concern for CSIRTs  The identification of the author of an information security incident is necessary when  investigating it as a crime. The author can be convicted in a criminal trial only if his sentence is  based on valid evidence. For this reason, it is very important to collect evidence that meets the  requirements for being admissible in criminal proceedings.  As explained in section 4.1.1.5, some of the actions taken by CSIRTs when dealing with an  incident may render the digital evidence inadmissible. Such evidence cannot be used in court  and it is therefore worthless for criminal proceedings. Hence, CSIRT team members should be  familiar with the procedures of preserving and securing admissible evidence for criminal  proceedings and be encouraged to implement such procedures in practice.  In order to avoid to destroy evidence and potentially interact or even compromise further LE  investigation, CSIRT should aim to align their incident response and especially remediation  procedures with LE and judiciary procedures and requirements.  Moreover, there is a certain complementarity between CSIRT, LE and the judiciary  responsibilities and attributions, but the success of a cybercrime investigation might depend on  how well their procedures and processes are adapted to each other and integrated to form a  national/European framework.  One possible solution is for the CSIRTs to have accredited experts that could handle and  examine evidence and even testify in court. However, this depends on the national legislation.  Furthermore, it would be necessary for CSIRTs to receive specific legal training in the field of  evidence collection, best practices, and criminal trials. An optimal measure would be to  implement evidence collection standards along with LE and the judiciary to preserve the  integrity of further investigations.  4.1.2.8 Does compliance with judiciary procedures need to be audited?  Depending on the legal framework, procedures may be questioned during a trial to guarantee  the admissibility of evidence.  To be admissible in court, each piece of evidence must meet several admissibility  requirements. These requirement vary depending on the national legal framework. For  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  31  instance, honeypots (11) that are deployed to better identify attackers’ techniques used in  cybercrime cases create challenges in terms of evidence admissibility. In some Member States,  the use of a honeypot is considered incitement, rendering thus the evidence collected  inadmissible in court. In other Member States, where the legal framework has different  principles, this method is considered admissible.  If CSIRTs are asked to testify in court, their evidence collection methodology is likely to be  questioned by the judges, the prosecution and/or the defence attorneys.  An evaluation and feedback exchange should follow between the judiciary and CSIRT  constituency; in every cybercrime cooperation case, the judiciary should provide feedback on  evidence provided by CSIRTs and may issue recommendations for further improvement.  In addition, a typical audit conducted by the judiciary should also examine the written CSIRT  standard operational procedures to assess whether adequate measures are applied for  evidence collection.  4.1.3 Training needs  4.1.3.1 Policy initiatives to promote cooperation across the three communities  Since the adoption of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013 (EU Commission, 2013), the  European Commission has made great efforts to ensure the online protection of European  citizens, companies and institutions. The EU has supported cooperation as part of the EU  Cybersecurity Strategy. Currently, the Commission has added cybersecurity to its core policy  priorities. ENISA has a fundamental role in developing policy initiatives to promote cooperation  across CSIRTs, LE, and the judiciary. The cooperation across the three communities could also  be enhanced by providing training.  4.1.3.2 How to overcome the skills gap across CSIRTs, LE and judiciary  Each stakeholder, i.e. CSIRT, LE and the judiciary, has a very specific skillset. A skills gap  presents obstacles to cooperation as there is no common understanding and also creates  difficulties in perceiving all necessary information. To overcome this challenge, the gap could be  addressed through joint training. In particular:   CSIRTs can provide technical training. CSIRTs have developed technical skills and  can deliver to the other communities investigation-oriented technical training, e.g. on  network investigations, and advanced systems.   LE can provide legal and investigation training. Usually, this is a field in which CSIRT  staff, lacking a legal background, have more limited knowledge. International LE  cooperation is a distinct field, based on specific international legal instruments and  requires operational experience in order to be mastered. LE usually provide to the  judiciary, training on the cyber investigation field more than technical training. The key  is not to explain how to analyse, for example, a log file, but to provide magistrates with  an understanding of cyber-attack mechanics, cybercriminals’ modus operandi and  legal implications of any coercive action taken. These training sessions should provide  magistrates with technical knowledge and give them strategic investigation directions.   Judiciary can provide both CSIRT and LE with legal training. In particular, they should  focus on the exclusionary rules of evidence. Representatives of the judiciary can  provide the other two communities with detailed information on the legal rules  (11) A honeypot is a system left opened on the internet with vulnerabilities known by its owner, with the intention of  attracting hackers and thus collecting information.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  32  applicable to criminal proceedings, the handling of electronic evidence, the evaluation  and admissibility of evidence, and the procedures for reporting a crime. Similarly, they  can provide information guidelines derived from practice and case law on how  electronic evidence should be handled properly or how it should be presented and  evaluated in court. On the other hand, judges and public prosecutors, via technical  training, might increase their technical knowledge needed to understand some of the  specificities of cybercrime such as the nature and weight of certain types of electronic  evidence.  These cross-training efforts between CSIRTs and LE are very good opportunities for sharing  and building a common cultural ground.  TF-CSIRT and FIRST material are a good starting point for LE to understand the CSIRT’s  world. ENISA has also published material (ENISA, 2019) covering a broad set of technical  topics, including a recent course on Digital Forensics (ENISA, 2019a).  Other training initiatives in this field originate for instance from joint initiatives of the European  Union and the Council of Europe (see e.g. GLACY (12) and GLACY+ projects (13)) and from  UNODC (see e.g. University Module Series on Cybercrime (UNODC, n.d.) in which there are  modules specifically focused on cooperation.  4.1.3.3 Prototype organisational behaviour  Organisational behaviour aims at answering several questions impeding cooperation. The  following questions and possible answers provide some guidance for improving cooperation.   How to avoid duplicated efforts?  (a) Communicate once the incident handling has initiated  (b) Send observers on site  (c) It is necessary to trust others.   To achieve this, however, it is necessary for CSIRTs to acquire more legal knowledge about  e-evidence:  (a) Use segregation of duties matrix  (b) Come up with policies or rules on when and how to cooperate  (c) Conduct training   How to handle incidents in order to prevent evidence loss or alteration?  (a) Design and implement a common standard for data collection  (b) Implement taxonomies  (c) Define best practices for most common types of incidents  (d) Develop practical guides  (e) Receive joint training  (f) Provide legal training   How to efficiently share intelligence?  (a) By using MISP  (b) By using common taxonomy  (c) By having English language skills allowing CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary to  communicate easily  (d) By holding regular meetings and building trust  (12) https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacy  (13) https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacyplus  https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacy https://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/glacyplus  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  33   How to efficiently mutually provide expertise and tools:  (a) Through joint training  (b) By maintaining some basic communication tools  4.1.3.4 Case study – Czech Republic  The Czech Republic’s strong focus on cybersecurity led to the adoption of the Cyber Security  Act (Czech Republic, 2014) and showed that one of the fundamental challenges for successful  protection and defence of national cyberspace is the ability of the competent public and private  institutions to cooperate against the rise of cybersecurity incidents. An appropriate way to  strengthen this cooperation is to implement joint exercises to verify and develop the technical,  legal and organisational capabilities of competent institutions and personnel. Cyber exercises  seem to be a great opportunity to get technically skilled professionals, government  representatives and other stakeholders to interact, confront each other and exchange their  different perspectives on and approaches to problem solving.  Exercises conducted in the Czech Republic are organised by the National Cyber and  Information Security Authority (NCISA), a central body of state administration for cybersecurity,  operating government CERT. Its constituency includes systems of critical information  infrastructure, important information systems and operators of essential services. Exercises  organised by NCISA are of two types – technical, primarily focused on testing the technical  readiness of security engineers, CSIRT members and other ICT experts of relevant institutions;  and non-technical, table-top exercises that focus on organisational readiness and cooperation  capability.  The Cyber Czech technical exercise has been developed and implemented every year since  2015 in cooperation with Masaryk University, using the infrastructure of the cyber range KYPO  (KYPO by CSIRT MU, n.d.) developed by Masaryk University as a part of their security  research. The exercise is based on the Red team–Blue team principle, with the red team  consisting of cybersecurity experts from governmental CERT, Masaryk University and other  partner institutions. During the exercise the red team launches cyber-attacks on infrastructures  managed by the Blue team, and the Blue team’s task is to protect their critical systems from  these attacks.  However, this technical exercise also includes an organisational and legal component as it also  simulates the role of the police, the DPA, regular internet users and journalists. Besides  defending their network, and communicating with regular users and media, Blue team members  must also be able for instance to detect whether an offence has been committed, know how to  identify it and report it to the police, and how to respond to requests for operational information  or evidence. In some runs of this exercise actual investigators from the National Centre for  Combatting Organized Crime, responsible for investigating serious cybercrimes, are also  involved.  While technical exercises are designed for practicing primarily technical skills and capabilities,  NCISA also organises discussion-based, table-top exercises that are used for testing  procedures, crisis management processes, institutional arrangements and agreements. A  specific exercise of this type was also organised with a focus on cooperation between CSIRTs  and the LE; in particular the focus of this exercise was to investigate the processes related to  the investigation of the incident and the initiation of criminal proceedings, coordination,  cooperation and information sharing between communities (LE, CSIRTs, other security entities  and victims) and cross-border cooperation capabilities. As part of this exercise, participants are  provided with the scenario and are required to decide, in their capacity, what actions to take in  order to mitigate and investigate the incident. The team of organisers then moderates possible  discussions, mediates the transfer of information and informs team members about new  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  34  developments in scenarios and assigned tasks. The aim then is for both communities to  understand how the incident is approached from a different perspective, to recognise the  implications of the security team’s incident handling activities in the context of criminal  proceedings, to identify white spots in cooperation and coordination during incident  management, investigation, and beyond.  Both types of exercises proved to be a suitable tool for enhancing the understanding of the  mutual roles of individual communities in managing cybersecurity incidents, for sharing  experience with incident management and cybercrime investigations and for identifying and  setting up appropriate procedures and tools for mutual cooperation and coordination.  4.2 TECHNICAL ASPECTS  4.2.1 Use of (common) tools to facilitate cooperation and interaction  One of the key recommendations of the 2018 ENISA report was the use of common tools in  order to facilitate cooperation and interaction across the three communities. Based on the data  collected through the interviews the most common used tool remains email but there is a recent  tendency to adopt Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)14 protocol for encryption of the communication  and MISP for threat intelligence sharing.  While CSIRTs have started to offer technical support to LE for adopting MISP, some MSs are  already using or building national tools for instant messaging communication and information  sharing. In the last case, LE are usually included by default while CSIRTs may also be invited  depending on their role in the national setup (usually national and/or governmental CSIRTs).   Common IT network  Analysis of the data collected through the interviews conducted showed that  segregated networks were another obstacle to cooperation. This creates day-to-day  difficulties that hinder LE and CSIRT staff cooperation and delay any exchange due to  the laborious procedures. When possible, sharing a common IT infrastructure is a first  and mandatory step to enhance the cooperation.   MISP  Malware information sharing platform (MISP) (15) is an application designed by  Luxembourg CSIRT (Computer Incident Response Centre Luxembourg – CIRCL). It  was designed to store and exchange information on indicators of compromise. Being  an open-source software tool and heavily supported both by CIRCL and the  community, it has been considered to be a standard tool in the cybersecurity field.  MISP is an efficient way to store data and unique for its sharing factions.  MISP is widely used around the world, with 6 000 instances being already deployed  (MISP Project, n.d.).  MISP facilitates cooperation between CSIRT and LE. For instance, it is used by  Luxembourg to share IOCs (indicators of compromise) between Luxembourg CSIRT,  and other partner agencies, especially LE.   Instant messaging  Instant messaging tool is essential as it facilitates immediate communication. It  provides quick and direct message exchange which is very crucial during the  cybercrime investigation phase.  (14)  https://www.openpgp.org/  (15) https://www.circl.lu/services/misp-malware-information-sharing-platform/  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  35   Encryption  PGP is the most commonly used method for encryption of communication across the  communities; it is an open source solution internationally recognised as a secure  protocol. PGP has already been adopted by most of the CSIRT teams in Europe,  including national and governmental ones. Moreover, some of the CSIRTs have  started to use it in their communication with LE counterparts.   File sharing system  File sharing is another essential tool to be included in the CSIRT-LE cooperation  toolset. Part of the technical cooperation is also the regular file exchange. To do this,  setting up a secure and user-friendly environment is fundamental in order to:  - facilitate cooperation;  - avoid shadow IT, where personnel relies on inappropriate ways to perform the  required tasks (clouds, third-party holstering application/infrastructure, etc.).   Coordination platform  In case of major cyber crisis, CSIRTs and LE should strongly cooperate. This can  easily be achieved only if some tools for supporting their technical cooperation have  already been set up.  4.2.2 Tools and their key functionalities  Each community uses tools for their day-to-day activities. By using the same toolset, CSIRTs,  LE and the judiciary could further enhance their cooperation. Such tools are needed for:  information sharing, evidence collection, coordination and secure communications.   Information sharing  The use of information-sharing tools is dependent on the organisation’s culture: while  CSIRT are familiar with these tools, LE seem usually to rely on the most commonly  used (i.e. email, file sharing, Europol mailing system SIENA (16)). Information-sharing  tools usually include:  ― A database system for storing information;  ― One or several taxonomies;  ― A sharing system, either centralised or peer-to-peer.  More advanced tools can provide other functionalities, such as:  ― Data visualisation (charts, graphs);  ― Data quality assessment;  ― Data management system (based on categories of data or other criteria).   Evidence collection  The tools used by CSIRTs and LE for evidence collection vary. While LE tend to use  commercial tools (e.g. EnCase (17), FTK (18), etc.) and specific hardware (e.g. write  blockers used to avoid any writing on a drive while copying it to avoid tampering),  CSIRTs are more familiarised with open source and free available tools (DD (19),  Clonezilla (20), DumpIT (21), etc.). Moreover, LE are more focused on legally sound  data collection while CSIRTs look for technical accuracy.  (16) https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-  exchange-network-application-siena  (17) https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic?cmpid=nav_r  (18) https://accessdata.com/products-services/forensic-toolkit-ftk  (19) https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1320  (20) https://clonezilla.org  (21) https://blog.comae.io/your-favorite-memory-toolkit-is-back-f97072d33d5c  https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange-network-application-siena https://www.europol.europa.eu/activities-services/services-support/information-exchange/secure-information-exchange-network-application-siena https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic?cmpid=nav_r https://accessdata.com/products-services/forensic-toolkit-ftk https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1320 https://clonezilla.org/ https://blog.comae.io/your-favorite-memory-toolkit-is-back-f97072d33d5c  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  36   Coordination  While some of the already existing and used tools (e.g. MISP, email, instant  messaging) can be used for coordination between communities, the need for  automation in terms of quickly marking certain types of resources as being under  investigation has been highlighted (e.g. national CSIRT to be able to quickly  crosscheck if certain IPs or URLs are investigated by LE, and if so, to avoid any  interference with that investigation).   Secure communication  Secure communication is provided through exchange of encrypted emails or  messages. GPG is widely used for encryption and it is supported by several mail  service providers. Military affiliated agencies may use other encryption algorithms.  Instant messaging applications like Mattermost (Mattermost, n.d.) allow encryption too.  But what is of great importance is for each organisation to select and use tools fitting  into its ecosystem and its partnerships.  4.2.3 How the investigations are carried out – forensic methods?  Based on the replies received from the interviews and the online survey results, cybercrime  investigations are carried out by using the following forensic methods:   Computer forensics:  The main purpose of an evidence collection tool is to allow the user to extract  information from a system without modifying it. To do this, the main device to use is a  write blocker (22). LE operate easy-to-use forensic tools such as EnCase (23) or  X-Ways (24).  These tools allow staff with basic forensics knowledge to efficiently conduct  investigations. Another advantage is that these tools are usually very efficient to  handle and display a lot of items simultaneously. This feature is necessary when going  through several hundred thousands of files.   Network forensics:  Network forensics are executed to find traces of suspicious activity or previously  flagged items (IOCs). A tool that is widely used for this purpose is Wireshark (25); it  allows its users to search through all protocols for pieces of data.  Interception/sniffing in pcap can generate huge volumes of data that can be analysed  with Moloch (26).  Netflow data is smaller in size (and can be sampled); DNS logs are text and  manageable in size; Netflow and DNS logs are most often not analysed within Moloch  but separately (nfdump, ELK, manually).  (22) This tool is placed between the analysing computer and the target device. Write blocker blocks all write commands,  making sure the target is not altered.

For  instance, Jtag (27) mobile forensics rely on jtag connection analysis for artefacts  recovery; while ‘Chip off’ (28) is a technique that implies chip removal and analysis of  chip data.   Memory forensics:  Live memory acquisition can be a challenge from an organisational perspective. What  is needed is qualified personnel, having the appropriate skills and the right tools for  acquisition. However, it is hard to collect evidence when a network or a hard drive are  encrypted; memory becomes one of the last place where evidence can be found.  The main tool for memory forensics is Volatility (29). It loads numerous plugins for  finding malware and has become a standard. It is an open source tool that requires  training to use it.   Live forensics:  Sometimes the data acquisition must be done while the device is powered on. A  common use case is with VPS providers that are running multiple VMs or containers  on the same physical server; in this case, the data collection needs to be done without  powering down the physical server. Acquisition of containers (Docker (30)) is just an  indicative example.  4.2.4 Future technology and cybercrime attribution (Carrier Grade NAT  (CGN), AI, IoT)  Although future technologies seem to create challenges for the investigation teams, they could  also provide cooperation opportunities. Figure 12 shows how the respondents to the online  survey replied to the question on likely future trends in the area of tools for cybercrime.

Although IoT devices also contain some private data,  such as connection data, sometimes those have to be analysed for investigation purposes.  They usually use specific technologies, both software and hardware. An example of  investigation is the Mirai case (Krebs, 2019). A Mirai botnet used CCTV devices to launch  DDoS against DNS service. Analysis of CCTV allowed the perpetrator to be identified.  4.2.4.2 Artificial intelligence  AI could be used by a cybercriminal for vulnerability scanning. IPs are scanned for any  fingerprint they may provide. AI could deduce from appropriate datasets information not only for  an attack vector, but also for the kind of internal vulnerabilities that could potentially be  exploited for moving laterally in the system. AI tools could also enable an attacker to optimise  botnet resources, for example to have DDoS attacks switching between machines, making  detection and mitigation more difficult. Botnets are currently layered through to avoid detection.  One usual setup is to have one layer of a peer-to-peer network of zombie-machines and above  that several layers that transmit instructions and channel stolen information to the attackers’ last  node.  Nevertheless, AI technologies could be utilised to counter cybercrime attacks as well. For  instance, improve botnet management by using AI tools to detect patterns and anticipate  attacks based on identified vulnerabilities.  4.2.4.3 Publicly available mass market encryption  Latest developments, projects and initiatives from the open source community, researchers, but  also from big technology companies are pushing for the availability of strong encryption  products for end users, including end-to-end encryption.  Mylar project is one example of a practical system that can compute on encrypted data (Popa  R.A., 2016). This system might be used by LE to query encrypted databases or capture traffic  for specific words or strings and results without decrypting the content.  4.2.4.4 Carrier Grid NAT  On the internet, every connected device needs an IP address. However, the number of IP  addresses (Internet Protocol Version 4) is limited and insufficient to meet the exploding demand  for new addresses for connected devices including connected objects and smart phones. A new  version of IP address (IPv6) which provides an unlimited number of IP addresses is available  but the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires internet access providers and internet content  providers (websites, social media, webmail services, etc.) to update software and hardware.  As a supposed-to-be temporary solution to address the problem of shortage of IP addresses,  internet access providers adopted CGN (31) technologies which allow sharing of IPv4 addresses  with multiple internet users (several thousands). CGN technologies are used by internet service  providers to share one single IP address among multiple subscribers at the same time.  This has an impact on criminal investigations as an IP address is often the only information that  can link a crime to an individual. It might mean that individuals cannot be distinguished by their  IP addresses anymore, which may lead to innocent individuals being wrongly investigated by  law enforcement because they share their IP address with several thousand others – potentially  including criminals.  (31) https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for- end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/are-you-sharing-same-ip-address-criminal-law-enforcement-call-for-end-of-carrier-grade-nat-cgn-to-increase-accountability-online  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  39  As said, this was supposed to be a temporary solution until the transition to IPv6 was  completed. For some operators however it has become a substitute for the IPv6 transition.  Despite IPv6 being available for more than 5 years the internet access industry increasingly  uses CGN technologies (90 % for mobile internet and up to 38 % for fixed line internet access  providers while 12 % were expected to deploy it in the coming months) instead of adopting the  new standard (Europol, 2017).  4.2.5 Technical knowledge used by the judiciary  The judiciary need to broadly understand technical information behind investigation techniques.  What is of great importance is to precisely understand what is at stake, such as private  information and liberties infringements.  For example, if LE want to execute a sinkhole (32) of a malware, the judiciary will need to  understand how this will be done and what kind of data should be collected. Depending on  national laws, executing a sinkhole of a malware, may or may not be authorised, mostly for  privacy and data protection reasons.  4.3 HUMAN ASPECTS ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE  4.3.1 Mind-set differences  One of the differences of individual communities that may prevent or restrict cooperation and  information sharing are differences in personalities or social roles. This situation may result in  one community not understanding the constraints that apply to the other, or its role and  mandate. Some indicative examples are presented below:  There is no common understanding of what data types can be used as evidence. For CSIRTs,  any data or information related to the source of a security incident can be evidence. The way  that attribution of cybercrime is being done may result in making evidence inadmissible in a  trial. Sometimes CSIRTs seem not to understand that the requirements of the quality of  evidence in the concept of criminal law are significantly high; evidence must be obtained  according to the applicable law and handled in a specific way.  There is limited common understanding of the objectives related to the fight against cybercrime;  CSIRTs aim to achieve the fastest possible mitigation of incidents and ensure the  confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA) triad of systems of their constituency. But reckless  pursuit of these goals can lead, for example, to destruction of valuable evidence or even  expose the monitoring activities to the attacker.  Hence, mind-set differences could hinder the cooperation at the stage of evidence collection, in  case the competent CSIRT community is not appropriately prepared to address relevant  scenarios as well as when there is difficulty in determining what data may constitute evidence  or not. Understanding what can be used as solid, admissible evidence in a court of law is a  challenge for CSIRTs. This requires time as CSIRTs would need to receive training on what  kind of elements they should look for when collecting evidence. Indeed LE and CSIRTs usually  operate under different time-frames. LE officers are emergency specialists who work in legal-  based timeframes, such as for example temporary detention, which are generally too short for  exhaustive analysis. On the contrary, CSIRTs often deal with espionage cases and are trained  to lead a thorough and exhaustive analysis.  (32) Operation consisting of buying a domain name used by a malware to transmit stolen data. The interest for LE is to  identify victims.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  40  Ultimately, these communities bear a different perspective. LE operate under an offence- based  system. In an optimal scenario of a cybercrime case, the case is closed, with the perpetrators  identified and brought to justice. CSIRTs are accustomed to handling intelligence, collecting,  storing and then analysing the relevant data. Legal constraints may arise when processing  personal data and this could impact the progress of the investigation. Lastly, the judiciary has  mainly a legal perspective and often lacks a technical background or knowledge. The objective  of the judiciary is to determine whether the suspect is the offender and proceed to the  conviction in accordance with the law and while respecting the fundamental rights of the  suspect.  4.3.2 Assessing personnel skills and qualities  Assessing personnel skills and qualities for each community will be a necessary step to  enhance their cooperation. Each community has its own professional context, motivations and  constraints.  Figure 13: Replies to question 18 of the online survey  Differences between the communities are observed in multiple levels. More particularly,  provided the nature of the respective community, work expectations vary, with LE prioritising  achieving higher ranking and being recognised as experts who have more time to practice.  While CSIRTs identify as their work expectations the improvement of skills or the development  of multiple skills. Secondly, relating to the upkeep of their skills and their training necessities,  some LE noted that there are few in-house training possibilities available and an inadequate  budget for that purpose. In contrast, some CSIRTs indicated that there are many internal  resources and usually adequate budget for that purpose. Both communities agreed that training  courses must be carried out by truly competent people. Referring to personal KPIs, LE  identified as such the number of cases handled and the reaction time. The number of cases  handled is also a personal KPI for CSIRTs, in addition to their skillset. Finally, when examining  the impact on cooperation, the communities determined that the difficulties are due to the  technical level discrepancies and the CSRITs’ lack of legal knowledge.  4.3.3 Competency-based framework  Some countries have concluded that a systematic approach is needed to effectively build a  human workforce basis capable of addressing cybersecurity challenges. This is the reason why  some countries are developing competency frameworks that specify what type of employees  are needed in the cybersecurity field, what qualifications these employees should have, what  training programmes, exercises and materials to acquire such qualifications are available and  how to cover any identified gaps.  16%  34%  50%  Skillset management  Work’s expectation  Working culture and behaviour  Replies  Q18. What are the main differences between LE and CSIRT staff?  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  41  An example of such a framework is the US NICE framework (National Institute of Standards  and Technology, 2017) (33), which includes a taxonomy of qualifications. For each qualification,  is then identified what kinds of competences, skills and knowledge are required.  Such a framework can be used in several ways. On this basis, scales for assessing the  competencies of applicants for individual positions in cybersecurity could be defined. This  framework could also be used to analyse the current state of the labour market, assessing what  qualifications are missing from cybersecurity professionals. Another use could be to present the  availability of courses, training programmes and other education and training opportunities that  could help applicants to be better qualified.  Outcomes of such analyses then could be used to develop policies, initiatives and regulation  focused on promoting cybersecurity education and building a cyber-workforce.  4.4 LEGAL AND POLICY ASPECTS  4.4.1 Legal framework in EU  The legal framework establishes and shapes the process of cooperation between CSIRTs and  LE as well as their interaction with the judiciary in the context of fighting against cybercrime.  Information on the legal and policy framework can also be found in the 2017 and 2018 ENISA  reports on CSIRTs and LE cooperation (ENISA, 2017a), (ENISA, 2018).  The legal framework in this area is presented at three levels: international level, EU level,  national level.  4.4.1.1 International level  The first and the most relevant international treaty on cybercrime and electronic evidence is the  Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime ( (Council of Europe, 2001) (34)). This convention  is also called the ‘Budapest Convention’. On the one hand, this aims at providing guidelines for  any country for the development of a comprehensive national legislation against cybercrime. On  the other hand, this convention is a framework for international cooperation between the  signatory states. The Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime, concerning the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems  (Council of Europe, 2003) complements the Budapest Convention. The Cybercrime Convention  Committee (T-CY) is also preparing a draft version of the 2nd Additional Protocol (Council of  Europe, 2019) to the Convention on Cybercrime (Council of Europe, 2001) to submit to the  Committee of Ministers in the light of its adoption. This draft and an Explanatory Report is  expected to be finalised by December 2019 (35). The 2nd Additional Protocol is ‘designed to  provide solutions for a more efficient criminal justice response to cybercrime and other crime  involving electronic evidence in accordance with data protection and other safeguards’ (Council  of Europe, 2019, p. 4).  (33) https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework  (34) https://www.coe.int/fr/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185  (35) The 2nd Additional Protocol is prepared taking into account among others: Article 46.1.c Budapest Convention on  Cybercrime; the decision adopted by the Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) at its 17th Plenary (June 2017);  Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 2077 (2015) on ‘Increasing cooperation against cyberterrorism and other large- scale attacks on the Internet’ and the response of the Committee of Ministers of 27 April 2016; the Programme and Budget  of the Council of Europe for 2016/2017 as adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 24/25 November 2015 referring to  follow up to be given to the work of the TCY on access to evidence in the cloud; agreement in principle by the TCY at its  16th Plenary (November 2016) on the need for an additional Protocol, and drawing from the Final Report and  Recommendations of the T-CY Cloud Evidence Group and, in particular section 4.5 with possible elements of a Protocol.  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework https://www.coe.int/fr/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  42  4.4.1.2  EU level  The European Union can legislate through several types of legal acts. The acts that the  European Union can issue are the following:  (a) Regulations. A regulation is a binding legislative act which must be applied in its  entirety throughout the EU, without exception.  (b) Directives. A directive is a legislative act that establishes a common goal that must be  achieved by all EU countries. However, it is the prerogative of each Member State to  define its own laws aimed at achieving these objectives.  (c) Decisions. A decision is a directly applicable legal instrument which is binding upon  those individuals to which it is addressed (the individual can be e.g. an EU country or  an individual company).  (d) Recommendations. A ‘recommendation’ allows the EU institutions to publish their  views and suggest guidelines without, however, imposing any legal obligation on those  to whom it is addressed. Clearly, a recommendation is not binding.  (e) Opinions. An ‘opinion’ is a legal instrument that allows EU institutions to make a non-  binding statement.  4.4.1.3 National level  This level concerns the rules issued by various Member States. The international and European  legal frameworks are a reference point for national legal frameworks. Nevertheless, it is  sometimes possible to find different legal frameworks in various Member States. This diversity  has consequences for the cooperation between CSIRTs and LE and their interaction with the  judiciary.  4.4.1.4 Differences in legal systems and evidence admissibility  In a criminal trial, it is important that e-evidence is integral and qualitatively reliable. To achieve  this result, data integrity must be ensured in all the life stages of e-evidence management,  namely: identification, collection, acquisition and preservation. In particular, as stated by  Mitrakas and Zaich ‘The chain of custody through appropriate policy frameworks can be used in  order to assess the quality of the collected data. Chain of custody investigations may also help  in establishing the hierarchical structure that prevailed at the time that the acts under  investigations were committed’ (Mitrakas, 2009, p. 164 and 173). Depending on the Member  State, the verification of the chain of custody can have different legal consequences. In some  Member States, this verification is relevant only for the purposes of evaluation of evidence. In  other Member States for the admissibility of evidence. The grounds of inadmissibility of  evidence are defined by the national laws of each Member State. Each piece of evidence has to  be legally obtained, according to the competent jurisdiction.  The national judicial systems are characterised by differences that could also have an impact  on the cooperation and interaction across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary. The judicial systems  could be categorised into: common law systems and civil law systems.  (a) The judicial systems of common law are also called adversarial systems (or adversary  systems). In such a system, a criminal trial is conceived as a conflict or dispute, where  each of the parties supports a contrary position. The oral evidence is of fundamental  importance; such evidence is acquired by means of the so-called cross-examination.  The judicial precedent is very important in a common law system. This means that a  decision of a court can be used as a source for future decisions, also known as  precedents; precedents are authoritative and binding and must be followed. This is the  principle of stare decisis (‘let the decision stand’).  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  43  (b) The civil law systems are non-adversarial systems. The judge sometimes has a more  active role in the collection of evidence and can also interview the witnesses by  himself. The principle of stare decisis does not apply to this case.  From a juridical point of view, the ‘nature’ of e-evidence may create issues regarding its  admissibility in a criminal trial. For this reason, in some Member States there are specific  requirements regarding the collection of e-evidence in order to be admissible in courts. In  addition, related research and evaluation carried out by the Council of the European Union on  the prevention and combating of cybercrime has concluded ‘that in most Member States,  procedural laws are technology-neutral, which means that general rules and principles on  gathering of evidence are applied and that procedural systems do not contain any formal rules  on admissibility and assessment of e-evidence’ (Council of the European Union, 2017, p. 11) .  More information about the topic of e-evidence in court can be found also in the 2018 ENISA  report on CSIRT and LE cooperation (ENISA, 2018).  4.4.1.5 Discrepancies  Although meaningful progress has been made at European level to strengthen the cooperation  and interaction across CSIRT, LE and the judiciary, discrepancies which may partly hinder this  progress, still remain.  It is important to point out that there are significant differences in purpose of responding to  information security incidents between CSIRTs and LE investigators. A CSIRT aims to mitigate  an incident, which may also be a crime, as soon as possible and restrict the negative impact it  may have. When performing such tasks, a CSIRT is often not adequately concerned about  preserving the evidence that could be used to identify the author of the incident. On the  contrary, an LE investigator aims to identify the author of this incident, which is determined to  be a crime, for the purpose of prosecuting the criminal offences. For this reason, it is very  important for LE investigators that CSIRTs do not to delete evidence, but preserve it  properly (36).  In addition to that, fundamental differences in each entity’s posture and structure, both within  and between them, may further impede cooperation and interaction among CSIRT, LE and the  judiciary. For example, as some interviews have shown, the hierarchical structure of LE and the  judiciary may cause delay in cooperation, especially with the CSIRTs of other Member States.  Moreover, disconnection may also result from the different mind-sets these entities have.  At national as well as at European level, there are a plurality of non-legislative acts  (memoranda, public–public and public–private agreements, and industry standards) concerning  CSIRT, LE and the judiciary. Such acts have often contributed to the improvement of  cooperation and interaction between CSIRT, LE and the judiciary. However, the multiplicity and  diversity of content of the various acts causes discrepancies between situations that are similar  but regulated by different acts.  Regarding ‘judicial confidentiality’, Member States’ legislation often differs. Consequently, the  types and categories of information that can be shared can vary from one Member State to  another.  4.4.1.6 Jurisdiction issues  • EU law defining only framework  Since cybercrimes do not stop at the borders of Member States and may concern  various Member States, what is often observed is authorities of several Member  (36) For more on this please see subchapter 4.3.1. on Mind-set differences.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  44  States investigating the same crime. This fact may create conflicts of exercise of  jurisdiction. At European level, Council framework decision 2009/948/JHA (EU  Council, 2009) (37) establishes the rules for prevention and settlement of conflicts of  exercise of jurisdiction in criminal proceedings.  Moreover, ‘Electronic evidence has become relevant in a large majority of criminal  investigations and increasingly often, judicial authorities need to make a request in  another jurisdiction in order to obtain necessary evidence from service providers.  Making it easier and quicker to obtain this evidence across borders is therefore of  crucial importance for investigating and prosecuting crime, including terrorism or  cybercrime’ (EU Commission, 2018), II.1, p. 1). At present, this purpose is pursued by  means of: mutual legal assistance (MLAT) instruments; European Investigation Order;  and voluntary cooperation in those cases where it is legally possible.  In view of the particular needs of speed and technicality in the collection of e-evidence,  the European Commission has prepared two proposals with the aim of improving the  investigative cooperation between Member States. These proposals are:   Proposal (38) for a regulation on European production and preservation  orders for e-evidence in criminal matters (EU Commission, 2018); and   Proposal (39) for a directive laying down harmonised rules on the appointment  of legal representatives for the purpose of gathering evidence in criminal  proceedings (EU Commission, 2018).  These legislative initiatives will address the jurisdictional issues related to cross-border  cooperation/information sharing.  Some important points that still need to be addressed are:  • How quickly data useful for the investigation can be provided;  • Inability to provide certain types of data, in particular data that are  subject to ‘judicial confidentiality’;  • Inability to provide data due to differences in data retention rules;  • Poor quality of data transmitted by CSIRTs to LE;  • Admissibility of digital evidence.  4.4.2 Admissibility of digital evidence  4.4.2.1 Categories and classification  This section presents the categorisation and classification of digital evidence:  • Categorisation of digital evidence: data stored on a device can be divided into two  categories, namely volatile data and non-volatile data.  (a) Volatile  Volatile data usually refers to live memory data. When a computer is running, it  loads in live memory all data needed to work. This data types are precious and  sensitive for analysis for two reasons. First, all live data is unencrypted for the  computer to work on it. Encrypted data such as communication application data  is unencrypted in live memory.

If the attacker erased his tracks, useful data  can still remain in live memory.  (b) Non-volatile data  Non-volatile data refers to any data that can be retrieved even after computer  has been cycled on or reset. This data can usually be found either on hard drive  or on USB key, SIM card, chip, or any other type of so-called ‘dead storage’.  These locations are where system stores all data needs to run on next start.  Among non-volatile data, deleted files are also included. When a file is deleted  from a computer, it simply removes its internal reference to it in hard-drive  master file table (MFT). MFT is equivalent to a map or a summary listing of all  available data and their location on the drive. Unless explicitly ordered by user,  data is not actually erased and can be recovered by forensic analysis.   Types of digital evidence (based upon their source) – see also forensic methods.   Outside data: all data not produced within the system.  (a) Internet data  Internet data is the data related to the internet; this data must be stored by  service providers for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or  prosecution of criminal offences (see 4.4.1)  (b) Malware sample  Malware sample includes malicious files usually found on the victim’s system  as long as the attackers have not erased it. This file, namely payload operates  on the system to execute illegitimate instructions, such as data theft, file  encrypting, DDoS triggering. Compared to traditional crimes, it is the ‘weapon’  used to commit it. Investigators look for malware sample in the first place  because it may contain a lot of information on culprit infrastructure and help  them to identify the attacker.   Internal data: data locally produced by the system.  (a) System files and system logs  According to Article 3 No 6 Directive (EU) 2016/680 (EU Council, 2016b) and  Article 4 No 6 Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (EU Council, 2016), ‘Filing system’ is  defined as any structured set of personal data which is accessible according to  specific criteria, whether centralised, decentralised or dispersed on a functional  or geographical basis. The logs contain a record of the operating system (OS)  events, being system logs, user logs or application logs. Consequently, logs  can be very useful for investigation purposes because they provide data related  to processes executed on the computer at the time of the attack. In system  logs, tampering, fraudulent operation and any illegitimate action will appear,  unless attackers manage to erase them.  (b) Internal network data  Internal network data such as net flow, DNS data and pcap files are data  transiting into the system. Numerous pieces of evidence can be collected from  these data types as activities run on a computer have been logged, e.g.: when  malware tried to communicate with their servers for stolen data recovery, when  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  46  a hacker pivoted from one machine to another, and any other hacker’s  operation into the system.  Figure 14 presents the various types of digital evidence most commonly used in a court of  law, based upon their source (volatile and non-volatile data). System files and system logs  are the data types most commonly used, as indicated by 50 % of the online survey  respondents.  Figure 14 – Replies to question 11 of the online survey  4.4.2.2 ISO/IEC 27037:2012 – Information technology – Security techniques – Guidelines  for identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electro-technical  Commission (IEC) have proposed international standards for evidence gathering. In particular,  a careful chain of custody is strongly recommended.  Although the ISO/IEC recommendations are not legally binding, there are common standards  that should be observed by investigators all around the world in order to allow an effective  circulation of criminal evidence between the countries.  Several ISO/IEC recommendations can have an impact on a criminal trial. Among these ISO  recommendations, ISO/IEC 27037:2012 appears particularly important because it provides  specific rules on digital evidence for the various phases concerning e-evidence, namely  identification, collection, acquisition and preservation.  Such rules are provided for various devices such as:   Digital storage media used in standard computers like hard drives, floppy disks, optical  and magneto optical disks, data devices with similar functions; digital still cameras and  video cameras (including CCTV); electronic devices (PEDs), memory cards; mobile  phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), personal mobile navigation systems,  standard computer with network connections, networks based on TCP/IP and other  digital protocols, and devices with similar functions as above.  3%  3%  9%  9%  22%  50%  Metadata  Deleted files  No answer provided  Network data (internet)  Other  System files and system logs  * Types of digital evidence based upon their source - volatile and non-volatile.

For example, tools for secure  exchange of information useful as evidence in criminal proceedings could be certified through  specific certification schemes. Currently, cybersecurity certification is only implemented at  national level and broader EU level involvement is expected following the adoption of the  Regulation (EU) 2019/881 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on  information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (EU Council, 2019). This regulation, besides  other provisions, creates the mandate for an EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework. The  purpose of the EU cybersecurity certification framework under Regulation (EU) 2019/881 is to  establish and maintain the trust and security on cybersecurity products, services and  processes. This could help users and service providers to determine the level of security  assurance of the products they use or provide. EU cybersecurity certification schemes aim to  define specific requirements and criteria for assessing the level of adherence of specific  products against these requirements. Specific products, services and processes will then be  assessed by conformity assessment bodies at national level, an issued certificate will then be  valid throughout the EU.  Such mechanisms could be used also to certify the level of security assurance of products and  processes used to collect and share information and data among the communities; this could  help to build trust and mutual understanding among CSIRTs, LEs and the judiciary. Also, quality  and validity of evidence collected and produced by such certified products and services could  be considered high and decrease the likelihood of inadmissible evidence in criminal  proceedings.  Interviews conducted clearly show that only half of the respondents are aware of the existence  of the Cybersecurity Act and its content, as illustrated in Figure 16 below. Those who know  about this legislation and are familiar with the proposed certification mechanism can be divided  into two groups:   Respondents who do not consider EU certification to be relevant to cooperation or  information sharing, or do not expect this legislation to have a positive impact on it.  6%  6%  9%  25%  25%  44%  ISO/IEC 27005:2018  ISO/IEC 27000:2018  ISO 9000:2015  ISO/IEC 27037:2012  No answer provided  Other  Q25.

Two major cyber crises, namely WannaCry and NotPetya, highlighted the great need  for a coordinated response in case of large-scale incidents that are hard to handle at national  level.  Also, in 2017, the Council of the European Union adopted a Framework for joint EU Diplomatic  Response to Malicious Cyber Activities (EU Council, 2018). This framework makes full use of  measures within the EU common foreign and security policy, including restrictive measures.  In 2018, Council Conclusions on EU Coordinated Response to Large-Scale Incidents and Crisis  was aimed at making operational the Blueprint, along with the development of a European  Cybersecurity Crisis Cooperation Framework. This led to the LE Emergency Response Protocol  (LE ERP).  4.4.3.2 LE ERP  The ERP is a protocol to support LE in providing immediate response to major cross-border  cyber-attacks through:  • Rapid assessment;  • Secure and timely sharing of critical information;  • Effective coordination of international aspects of investigations.  3%  6%  10%  12%  33%  36%  In terms of improved hardware  In terms of improved software  No answer provided  Mitigation of risk  Greater assurance of forensics data  Not aware of this framework  Replies  24A. How do you see the emerging EU cybersecurity certification  framework influencing CSIRT/LE tools?  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  51  ERP is split among several parts:  • Procedures, roles and responsibilities;  • Secure channel of communication;  • Contact points for exchange of critical information;  • Coordination and de-confliction mechanism.  ERP steps unfold as follows:  1. Early detection of incident: OSINT monitoring, Europol operational centre, LE,  CSIRT network, partners (ENISA, UNODC, OSCE), private sector partners, other  (academia, research institutes);  2. Threat assessment: Incident’s relevance is assessed through a matrix taking into  account target’s nature and scope (geographical, number of services affected, type of  victims affected, number of victims affected) and impact (damage potential,  recoverability, reproducibility, tangible losses);  3. Decision: Based on previous assessment, decision to enter protocol and proceed  through ERP steps or revert to normal operation is taken;  4. Establishing coordination centre and activate information-sharing tool;  5. Early warning notification (EWN): Europol produces the EWN and shares that with  stakeholders;  6. Emergency operational action plan (EOAP): Europol and stakeholders coordinate  and produce the EOAP in order to streamline operational actions in response to the  crisis;  7. Investigations and multilayer analysis: Member State and Europol lead  investigation, through OSINT or on site, while exchanging information in real time;  8. Situational assessment: Depending on last situational assessment, decision is made  to repeat previous steps of the protocol OR close protocol;  9. Closure of ERP: Once incident is contained, ERP is closed. Notices are sent to all  stakeholders and debriefing is organised.  4.4.3.3 Impact on CSIRT/LE cooperation  ERP is a LE coordination mechanism aimed at preserving evidence and taking advantage of LE  reaction capacities and manpower.  CSIRT play an important role into ERP as stakeholders and primary information source.  First, National CSIRTs are usually in charge of crisis management. At step 2 (threat  assessment), they state whether or not a crisis is ongoing.  Second, CSIRTs are a privileged source of qualified information. Based on their tools, expertise  and broad ecosystem (system probes, industrial partnerships), they have access to relevant  intelligence that would otherwise not reach LE.  ERP is a LE/judiciary protocol for emergency response that includes CSIRT as a full partner;  this is an example of cooperation among three communities.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  52  5. CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1  Conclusions  Using the analysis of the results collected from the desk research, the interviews with subject-  matter experts, and the online survey, the conclusions summarised below were drawn.   Working together (in the same building/office), or at least having liaison officers, is  recognised as being the most efficient way of ensuring very good cooperation and  information sharing between CSIRT and LE. This model is successfully implemented  at least by the Nordic countries.   There is a very low interaction between the judiciary and the CSIRTs.   Cultural differences between CSIRT and LE are seen as the most important obstacle  to cooperation and information sharing.   Recent EU legislation on personal data protection (including GDPR) makes the  cooperation between CSIRTs and LE harder as it sets stricter compliance  requirements for the data processors and applies visibility restrictions even to data that  were public in the past (e.g. WHOIS issue).   LE often rely on CSIRTs’ technical support and expertise as well as on sharing data  about incidents.  Multi-stakeholder cooperation and information sharing are the key activities for ensuring  cybersecurity. However, as can be seen from the online survey carried out and the interviews  conducted, in all countries there is space for improvement of this cooperation, depending on the  maturity level of each community and the restrictions that are being set by their national legal  framework. Improvements can be made in organisational, technical, cultural and legal aspects  of this cooperation:   Organisational challenges: There are no formal rules in place for cooperation among  the communities to set the ground for sharing experience, knowledge and getting  acquainted with each other’s practices.   Technical challenges: There is a lack of effective tools for secure sharing of  information and data as well as for evidence collection.   Cultural challenges: There is lack of trust among the communities and this results in  sharing a limited amount of information. Τhe staff of each community are either not  encouraged or conversely required by law or policies to provide assistance or  cooperation to other communities.   Legal challenges: Poor implementation or wrong interpretation of the EU legislation  for the protection of personal data sometimes may lead to lack of information sharing;  liability issues in data breach cases seem to be a challenge for the staff who are acting  as data processors or controllers.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  53  5.1.1 The importance of cooperation  An information security incident can be either a minor security incident or can also be a  cybercrime. If the incident is also a crime, it is necessary to identify the perpetrators. To achieve  this goal, cooperation and interaction among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary are of fundamental  importance; therefore, the cooperation challenges highlighted through the interviews should be  eliminated.  5.1.2 Effectiveness of cooperation  Effective cooperation is based both on the knowledge of the legal framework and on some  factual aspects. In particular:  (a) The legal framework on the subject is articulated. Even if the acts of the European  Union contribute to progressively eliminating the diversities in legislation of the various  Member States, significant differences are still highlighted across them. Interviewees  from the LE community pointed out that in some cases the communities might not  have a thorough knowledge of some key EU legal instruments, such as the European  Investigation Order (EIO) (40) that can play an important role in the investigation of  cybercrime.  (b) CSIRT, LE, and the judiciary have different mind-sets due to their different educational  and scientific backgrounds. This type of difference can set obstacles to the  effectiveness of an investigation as they make communication among these three  communities harder. Moreover, the different objectives set by the CSIRTs, LE, and  judiciary sometimes make CSIRTs ignore the legal requirements for the data validity  that could influence the admissibility of the data collected as evidence in a criminal  trial.  5.1.3 Strengthening of cooperation  Despite the significant advances in the field of cooperation, the analysis of the collected data  shows that it is necessary to further strengthen it. In order to achieve this goal it is necessary to  act on a series of factors such as:  (a) To simplify the communication mechanisms between CSIRT, LE, and the judiciary;  (b) To speed up the time needed to obtain authorisation from their hierarchy by LE and  the judiciary;  (c) To deliver technical and legal training dedicated to cooperation and interaction across  CSIRT, LE and the judiciary;  (d) To improve the knowledge of the English language of everyone involved.  5.2  Recommendations  The recommendations presented in this roadmap have been categorised into organisational,  technical, cultural and legal, based on the aforementioned cooperation challenges.  5.2.1 Organisational  It is evident that CSIRT, LE and judiciary communities have complementary roles when fighting  against cybercrime; it is important to have clarity in duties and responsibilities of each actor and  measures in place to ensure coordination in order to avoid duplication of effort and increase the  effectiveness of combatting cybercrime. The segregation of duties matrix (for an example see  section 4.1.1.1.), once customised for each country, could help to give clarity of responsibilities  of each community and identify overlaps that may cause mutual interference in their activities.  (40) http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/Practitioners/operational/EIO/Pages/EIO.aspx  http://www.eurojust.europa.eu/Practitioners/operational/EIO/Pages/EIO.aspx  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  54  Defining an explicit cooperation framework among the various actors would also facilitate  interaction across the three communities. By setting up internal procedures for information  sharing and best practices exchange, LE and CSIRTs can automate the cooperation process  and make it more tangible, embedded into day-to-day activities.  These rules can be implemented in various forms. Depending on each EU MS’s maturity level  on law adoption, such a cooperation framework could be a legal instrument (regulating the  functioning of CSIRTs, handling cybersecurity incidents, investigating cybercrime, etc.), national  policy documents, inter-community memoranda of understanding, or their mutually compatible  internal guidelines.  The interviews also showed that appointing liaison officers in the partner community can  significantly enhance mutual trust and the effectiveness of cooperation. LE liaison officers  involved in CSIRT activities may provide assistance in identifying and qualifying offences,  collecting evidence properly, identifying offenders, or providing assistance to LE. CSIRT liaison  officers involved in LE activities can in turn provide their own expertise and experience with  specific technologies, where appropriate, provide access to information and data available to  CSIRTs or contacts with experts and partners. Beyond liaison officers, staff of each community  could also be assigned in other communities for adequate posting. CSIRT personnel could  spend some time as technical experts in an LE unit while an LE officer could work in crisis  management within a CSIRT community.  Some Member States have put CSIRT and LE to work together in the same building. Building a  common culture and ecosystem has proved efficient for their cooperation. This is a way also to  improve cooperation conditions among the communities, making the information exchange  easier; by doing this, Member States could build a team comprising different actors able to work  together during investigations.  Staff exchange and liaison officers could facilitate the mutual understanding across the  communities and voluntary information sharing on specific topics/cases. These opportunities  will create mixed culture personnel and thus strengthen cooperation.  Based on the data collected for this report, the main recommendations related to the  organisational aspects of the cooperation are:   Member States with the support of ENISA, Europol and possibly Eurojust: To  reach a better understanding and spread across the communities the knowledge of  roles and responsibilities of CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary throughout the cybercrime  lifecycle phases, possibly by using ‘Segregation of duties’ matrix;   Member States with the support of ENISA and Europol: To promote staff exchange  between CSIRTs and LE and appoint liaison officers;   ENISA and Europol: To support the Member States to identify key information flow  paths to strengthen the cooperation across CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary.  5.2.2 Technical  Using a common taxonomy (section 4.1.1.5.) solves the common problem of different  classification and description of individual types of cybersecurity incidents and their links to  criminal offences. Taxonomies can be extended to community best practices, definitions,  references to relevant legislation, or division of responsibilities in individual cases.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  55  Also using common tools could help the communities’ coordination. For instance, data  collection tools used by CSIRTs often do not store data in a format that can also be used  operatively by law enforcement authorities and judiciary. When the usage of the same tools is  not feasible, at least interoperability of tools could help cooperation and mitigate possible  operational challenges in information exchange. Thus, it is of great importance for CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary to take into account interoperability requirements when conceiving tools, to  make sure that each tool can export data in a standard format that can be functional for all  communities.  Based on the data collected for this report, the main recommendations related to the technical  aspects of the cooperation are:   ENISA, Europol’s EC3, and Member States: To promote the use of common  taxonomy;   ENISA, Europol’s EC3, and Member States: To promote usage of common tools or  at least interoperability of tools deployed and conceived considering future  technologies (41).  5.2.3 Cultural  Setting up regular synchronous and asynchronous meetings as well as physical meetings  allows the communities to share information about the current security situation, risks,  vulnerabilities and experiences. In particular, this helps to raise their awareness of current  threat landscape and foster mutual trust across the communities. This can be achieved:   Through joint exercises (section 4.1.3.), not only are individual skills tested, but also  individual communities are familiarised with practices of their counterparts; shared  exercise could also help the communities to identify inappropriate procedural rules and  build personal ties between the members of each community.   Through workshops (section 4.1.2.6.), individual communities can share experiences  and knowledge. This event type is particularly suitable for exchanging information on  legal rules, appropriate procedural procedures or specific technical procedures in  specific cases.   Best practices exchange (section 4.1.3.3.) creates opportunities for the staff to debate  and share practices on each community’s field of expertise.   Regular joint meetings give the communities the chance to cooperate and this seems  to be a good tool not only for sharing experience, information on threats and  vulnerabilities, trends and other important news, but also for building trust based on  personal connections between members of such communities.   Experience sharing (section 4.1.3.2.) gives the staff the opportunity to identify what  worked well and what can be improved through their professional experience.  Cybersecurity/legal glossaries can also improve mutual understanding by clearly defining terms  that might be understood differently across the three communities. Publishing internal guides  (section 4.1.3.3.) provides the communities with internal-use-only material on how cooperation  is developed at operational level as an everyday duty.  When assessing the qualifications of members of individual communities, the requirement for  their ability to interact with other relevant communities is often not taken into account. Creating  an appropriate qualifications framework that defines the roles of employees within the  communities, the experience and knowledge expected by them, could probably eliminate this  (41) For further detail also refer to section 4.2.4.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  56  deficiency. A competency framework that could provide specific requirements for these roles  could encourage educational institutions to include in their curriculum appropriate courses and  training focused on cooperation, while employers would also take these requirements into  account when selecting employees.  In previous ENISA reports, the importance of joint training for CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary was  highlighted. However, the interviews conducted to prepare this roadmap showed that training  organised is often criticised for its inadequacy, its usefulness and most of the time it is even  considered as a waste of time.  It is therefore necessary to promote high-level training useful for the CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary that could be appealing to them. In order to do this, well-prepared trainers are needed.  They should have appropriate theoretical and practical knowledge, as well as the ability to  communicate their knowledge effectively.  The interviews showed that the communities’ knowledge of digital forensics rules related to the  criminal trial can be further improved. Measures and actions operated by CSIRTs when  handling a security incident could delete evidence or compromise the LE investigation  (section 4.1.2.7). This has a direct impact on the evidence admissibility and the outcome of the  investigation, hence it must not be neglected.  Both joint exercises focused on technical cooperation and table-top exercises focused on  management cooperation could be very effective tools. Through these we can evaluate the  appropriateness of having set internal procedures, the ability of individual communities to  cooperate and also provide practical experience of cooperation, helping thus the communities  to build mutual trust. Creating specific exercises focused on specific aspects of cooperation  between specific communities and entities is effective, however often very costly. Interested  communities could participate in already existing national and international exercises to test  their cooperation in practice.  Interdisciplinary training covering not only the technical aspects but also the legal aspects  should be provided. For example, the lack of knowledge of the relevant legislation and of the  established procedural practices are key challenges that the communities are faced with. In  particular, CSIRTs might lack knowledge of the law governing the practice of obtaining  electronic evidence and procedures applied in criminal proceedings. On the other hand the law  enforcement and the judicial authorities might not have a thorough knowledge of the functioning  of the CSIRTs and the potential in terms of support that might have from CSIRTs in collecting  evidence.  Based on the data collected for this report, the main recommendations related to the cultural  aspects of the cooperation are:   Member States, possibly with the support of ENISA: To analyse composition and  size of available workforce and develop national competency frameworks;   ENISA, possibly with and Europol’s EC3, CEPOL and Eurojust: To help CSIRTs,  LE, and the judiciary to identify joint training possibilities on digital forensics where  technical and legal aspects are both examined; to promote a culture of training, both  for technical and legal matters; to prepare training material on CSIRTs, LE and the  judiciary cooperation targeting the three communities;   Member States: To allow and encourage CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary (staff from all  hierarchical levels) to participate in the trainings and exercises.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  57  5.2.4 Legal  To avoid duplication of efforts, undesired interference and to assure an efficient utilisation of the  resources and expertise, Member States should define and implement cooperation frameworks  among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary by taking into account the responsibilities and capabilities  of these communities as well as their complementarity.  Agreements and memoranda of understanding are instruments where the rules of cooperation  and requirements related to evidence handling are defined; these types of cooperation  agreements can help CSIRT, LE and the judiciary representatives work together against  cybercrime and can significantly increase the effectiveness of their cooperation.  When designing and developing tools for communities, specific requirements defined by each  of them are taken into account. Security and privacy standards of the tools utilised may vary  from one community to another; a certification scheme that might provide a certain level of  security assurance for the tools used during the cybercrime investigation would further enhance  the cooperation among the three communities. Additionally, applying security standards on the  identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of e-evidence, may assist the  communities in ensuring the admissibility of e-evidence in a criminal proceeding and hence  promote successful cross-sectoral and international cooperation in the field (section 4.4.2).   ENISA: To identify and disseminate good practices of cooperation frameworks, by  using existing legal instruments and possibly additional memorandum of  understanding and cooperation agreements, among CSIRTs, LE and the judiciary at  national and at cross-border level;   Member States: To define and implement cooperation frameworks among CSIRTs, LE  and the judiciary;   ENISA: To assess the suitability of an EU cybersecurity certification scheme for  cybercrime investigation tools.

They are: Instrument contributing to Stability  and Peace (58) (IcSP) ( (EU Commission, n.d.)), European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI)  (ENI, n.d.), and Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (59) (IPA) ( (EU Commission, n.d.)).  IPA consists of several systems aimed at help countries willing to integrate EU. Among these  tools, cross-border instruments enhance cooperation.  Data protection and data retention  Given the importance of protecting privacy, it is necessary to specifically note the EU legislation  on data protection and data retention.  The right to protection of personal data is a fundamental right. It is aimed at protecting ‘personal  data’, i.e. ‘any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”)’  (Article 4, GDPR). The protection of privacy of electronic communications is specifically  addressed under Directive 2002/58/EC. Within the European legal framework, this fundamental  right is provided by several acts. Among them, the following are particularly significant:  Fundamental  right  Legal act  Respect for private  and family life  Article 7, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012)  Protection of  personal data  Article 8, Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union  (EU Parliament, EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, 2012)  Right to the  protection of  personal data  Article 16, (ex-Article 286 TEC) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union (TFEU) (European Union, 2012)  The protection of privacy as a fundamental right is also provided under the Council of Europe’s  Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, also called  European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (Council of Europe, 1950) and more precisely  by Article 8 ‘Right to respect for private and family life’. It should be noted that further to the EU  Member States’ adherence to the ECHR, the European Union is expected to proceed with the  accession to the ECHR (60) under the relevant legal obligation defined by the Treaty of Lisbon  (Article 6, paragraph 2) (EU Member States, 2007).  The worldwide diffusion of IT and globalisation have caused and continue to cause new  challenges for the protection of personal data. For this reason, three important acts aimed at  strengthening the legal protection of personal data were issued in 2016. These acts are:  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), Directive (EU) 2016/680 (Law  Enforcement Data Protection Directive) and Directive (EU) 2016/681 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the use of passenger name record (PNR)  data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and  serious crime (European Parliament and Council of the European Union, 2016) (61) (PNR  Directive).

Nevertheless, it ‘is not an  absolute right; it must be considered in relation to its function in society and be balanced  against other fundamental rights, in accordance with the principle of proportionality’ (see  recital 4, GDPR). In particular it is necessary to balance the right to the protection of personal  data with requirements concerning prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of  criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties.  Instead, data retention is the storage activity of ‘traffic data’ for a given period (which is called  ‘retention time’) for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of  criminal offences. Traffic data ‘means any computer data relating to a communication by means  of a computer system, generated by a computer system that formed a part in the chain of  communication, indicating the communication’s origin, destination, route, time, date, size,  duration, or type of underlying service’ (see Article 1, letter d) of the Convention on Cybercrime  (Council of Europe, 2001).  Some examples of traffic data are: the user ID(s) allocated; the user ID and telephone number  allocated to any communication entering the public telephone network; the name and address  of the subscriber or registered user to whom an internet protocol (IP) address, user ID or  telephone number was allocated at the time of the communication; the user ID or telephone  number of the intended recipient(s) of an internet telephony call; the name(s) and address(es)  of the subscriber(s) or registered user(s) and user ID of the intended recipient of the  communication; the date and time of the log-in and log-off of the internet access service, based  on a certain time zone, together with the IP address, whether dynamic or static, allocated by the  internet access service provider to a communication, and the user ID of the subscriber or  registered user; the date and time of the log-in and log-off of the internet email service or  internet telephony service, based on a certain time zone; the calling and called telephone  numbers; the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) of the calling party; the international  mobile equipment identity (IMEI) of the calling party; the IMSI of the called party; the IMEI of the  called party; the calling telephone number for dial-up access; the digital subscriber line (DSL) or  other end point of the originator of the communication; data identifying the geographic location  of cells by reference to their location labels (Cell ID) during the period for which  communications data are retained.  Since these data can be very important for investigation purposes, the legislation in many  Member States requires that the traffic data are stored in suitable archives. The problem arises  that the legislation should balance the needs of data protection and the needs of data storage  for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences.  Such a balancing must necessarily comply with the principle of proportionality, but this is not  always easy. This is clearly shown by the fact that the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of  the European Union (EU Court of Justice, 2014) (62), on 8 April 2014, declared invalid Directive  2006/24/EC because of the breach of the principle of proportionality (EU Council, n.d.) . This  was related to the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of  publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks  and amended Directive 2002/58/EC.  At European level, the laws on data retention of the various states are sometimes significantly  different from one another. In particular, the retention times are often different. The diversity of  retention times sometimes appears to investigators as an obstacle to investigative cooperation.

ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  70  For this reason, European legislation that provides the same retention time in all Member  States could result in improved cooperation.  Consequences of data breaches (European Court of Human Rights)  Data breach is only one of many possible information security incidents. It is a major incident  and could lead to very heavy damage.  According to Article 4.12 of the GDPR, personal data breach ‘means a breach of security  leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or  access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed’.  All personal data breaches are security incidents; however, not all security incidents are  necessarily personal data breaches according to Article 29 Data Protection Working Party,  Guidelines on Personal data breach notification under Regulation 2016/679 (WP, Article 29,  2017).  In the case of a personal data breach, after the controller having become aware of it, two cases  can occur:  (a) The personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons. In this case the controller is not obliged to notify the personal data  breach to the competent supervisory authority (see Article 33.1 GDPR).  (b) The personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons. In this case, the controller must notify the personal data breach to the  competent supervisory authority. Such a notification must be delivered not later than  72 hours after the controller has become aware of it. If it is delivered after 72 hours,  the reasons for the delay must be declared. This notification must include at least the  following four points: a description of the nature of the personal data breach including  where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned  and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;  name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where  more information can be obtained; a description of the likely consequences of the  personal data breach; a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by  the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate,  measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects (see Article 33.3 GDPR).  Moreover, after becoming aware of a personal data breach, the processor shall notify the  controller without undue delay.  In addition to the notification obligations established by the GDPR, depending on the specific  cases, there may also be additional notification obligations provided for by other acts.  By way of example, the following notification obligations are mentioned here:   Article 19.2 Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation), which provides that  ‘Qualified and nonqualified trust service providers shall, without undue delay but in any  event within 24 hours after having become aware of it, notify the supervisory body and,  where applicable, other relevant bodies, such as the competent national body for  information security or the data protection authority, of any breach of security or loss of  integrity that has a significant impact on the trust service provided or on the personal  data maintained therein’.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  71   Articles 14 and 16 NIS Directive, which provide that operators of essential services  and digital service providers notify security incidents to their competent authority.   Data protection and data retention.  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  72  C ANNEX: QUESTIONNAIRE  TO SUPPORT THE SUBJECT  MATTER EXPERT  INTERVIEWS  The questions below have been prepared to support the interviews with subject-matter experts  to collect data for the 2019 ENISA roadmap of further activities in the area of CSIRT (computer  security incident response teams) and law enforcement (LE) cooperation. The roadmap will not  necessarily be made public; it is likely to be distributed instead to selected stakeholders.  This roadmap contributes to the implementation of ‘Output O.4.2.2 – Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and law enforcement’ of the ENISA  Programming Document 2019-2021, in particular to what is foreseen as publication: ‘Roadmap  to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs and law enforcement and their  interaction with the judiciary’.  (Link: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-programming-  document-2019-2021).  ENISA selected some external experts from the List of NIS Experts compiled following the  ENISA Call for Expression of Interest (CEI) (Ref. ENISA M-CEI-17-T01) to support the data  collection and drafting of this report. In addition to desk research and an online survey  (planned), the data collection is done also via interviews with subject-matter experts.  The expected duration of the interview is 1 hour. Some of the questions below are common to  CSIRTs, LEAs and judiciary (judges and prosecutor), while others are tailored to CSIRTs, LEAs  and judiciary.

The data controller of the processing operation is ENISA Core Operations Department. The  legal basis for the processing operation is:  ROADMAP ON THE COOPERATION BETWEEN CSIRTS AND LE  December 2019  84  Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, on the basis of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013, in particular the provisions establishing the tasks of ENISA. With the view of  contributing to the fulfilment of such tasks and according to the ENISA Programming  Document 2019-2021 as approved by Management Board in Decision No MB/2018/20 [2],  ENISA is preparing a roadmap to further enhance the cooperation between the CSIRTs  and law enforcement along with their interaction with the judiciary (see Output O.4.2.2 –  Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and law  enforcement).  Article 5(1)(d) of Regulation EU 2018/1725, i.e. consent of the data subjects.  The purpose of this processing operation is to collect data via an online survey and some  subject-matter interviews for the drafting of the ENISA roadmap to further enhance the  cooperation between the CSIRTs and law enforcement along with their interaction with the  judiciary.  The data processors of the processing operation will be external experts who will be  contracted by ENISA to support the data collection and drafting of the report. The online  survey will be conducted by using the EU Survey tool [3]. The interviews will be conducted  face to face, over the phone, via skype or with other means to be agreed with the interviewee.  The following personal data are collected for the respondents of the online survey and of  the interviews:  Contact and professional data: name, surname, community they belong to (e.g. CSIRT, LE,  prosecutors, judges, etc.), position, affiliation, country, email address, phone number  (optional).  Replies to survey/interviews: Note that the data produced by the data subjects’ replies to  survey/interviews are not generally considered to be personal data, since they are only of  professional nature. Still, there might be cases where a respondent produces ad hoc personal  data, e.g. by disclosing during the interview data relating to his/her private life or by  expressing his/her specific personal opinion regarding certain professional matters that may  influence the behaviour or status of other individuals. ENISA will make any possible effort to  remove ad hoc personal data from the replies to survey/interviews, as well as from the final  report. In all cases, the replies to survey/interviews will be presented in the roadmap in an  aggregated form.  The recipients of the data will be designated ENISA staff involved in the data collection and  drafting of the report, as well as designated ENISA contractors supporting ENISA with the  data collection and the drafting of the report (data processors). Only when explicit written  consent is provided by the data subject, name, surname, affiliation, country, might be included  in the acknowledgements of the roadmap. The roadmap will not necessarily be made public; it  is likely to be distributed instead to select stakeholders. The data may also be available to EU  bodies charged with compliance monitoring and inspection tasks.  Personal data will be kept up to a maximum period of 1 year after the publication and/or  distribution of the roadmap, (possibly in March 2020). After the end of this period, the contact  and professional data will be manually deleted. However, replies to survey/interviews will be  kept by ENISA beyond this period in an anonymised form (without linking to specific  respondents) for future ENISA projects.  You have the right of access to your personal data and to relevant information concerning  how we use it. You have the right to rectify your personal data. Under certain conditions, you  have the right to ask that we delete your personal data or restrict their use. You have the right  to object to our processing of your personal data, on grounds relating to your particular  situation, at any time. We will consider your request, take a decision and communicate it to  you. If you have any queries concerning the processing of your personal data, you may  address them to the ENISA staff working on this report at CSIRT-  LEcooperation@enisa.europa.eu.

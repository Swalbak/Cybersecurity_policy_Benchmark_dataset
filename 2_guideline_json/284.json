This report follows the  December 2020 publication of Sectoral CSIRT Capabilities - Status and Development in the  Energy and the Air Transport sectors.  Desk research has been conducted, followed by a survey which was answered by 7 PSIRTs  and 22 CSIRTs from 19 EU Member States. The relatively low number of PSIRTs, especially of  those with a scope limited to the energy and healthcare sectors, led us to include more CSIRTs  and more sectors in the study. The findings and recommendations still apply to the energy and  healthcare sectors, but also offer a wider view of the product vulnerability management  landscape.  As a result, 12 key findings were identified, and 9 recommendations have been proposed.  One of the main findings is the lack of visibility of PSIRTs: from an external point of view, it is  not always clear what their activities are and who to contact. Even from an internal point of view,  the PSIRTs are not sufficiently identified in their role. This report offers recommendations in  terms of standardised presentation and increased visibility to improve this issue.  The second main finding is the current difficulties for different stakeholders of the vulnerability  ecosystem (PSIRTs, CSIRTs, national/sectoral CSIRTs, end clients, Operators of Essential  Services (OES)) in communicating and collaborating efficiently with each other in order to  improve product cybersecurity as a whole. The associated recommendations revolve around  technical standards to improve interoperability and automation, and processes to streamline the  exchange of sensitive information, especially with OES which would greatly benefit from early  notification in the case of vulnerability disclosure.  As to the role of ENISA, the respondents to the survey expect the Agency to provide them with  guidelines, general security recommendations and, at a more global level, a high-level  cooperation framework intended to help develop best practices and improve exchanges among  PSIRTs and other incident response (IR) teams within the European Union (EU). NIS 2 should  bring improvements in this area, as some of these expectations have already been outlined in  the NIS 2 proposal, for instance regarding a vulnerability registry for OES and their suppliers,  and regarding the important role of CSIRTs in global coordination.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  3  KEY FINDINGS  The research highlighted the following 12 key findings:  ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  Key Finding #1 Outside their IR Processes, PSIRTs’ activities and their involvement in  product lifecycle is heterogeneous.  Key Finding #2 The adoption of third-party vulnerability management platforms is  uncommon. Those who use one do so because it is easier to manage and  improves visibility.  Key Finding #3 Measuring the efficiency of a PSIRT proves to be challenging, as most  PSIRTs essentially track efficiency with the number of vulnerabilities  reported and mitigated.  Key Finding #4 PSIRT members have both technical skills in product security areas and  soft skills which enable smoother exchanges and cooperation between all  the stakeholders.  COLLABORATION  Key Finding #5 PSIRTs do not have specific procedures to address vulnerabilities affecting  OES and the NIS directive does not seem to have impacted PSIRT  activities much.  Key Finding #6 PSIRTs collaborate one with each other, but their collaboration is hindered  by the lack of formalised communication and information exchange  procedures/standards/framework.  Key Finding #7 Collaboration between PSIRTs and external CSIRTs (sectoral/national) is  underdeveloped because of difficulties in establishing contact and sharing  sensitive information even though CSIRTs are demanding more regular  contact.  Key Finding #8 EU companies that run a PSIRT almost always have a CSIRT, but these  are mostly distinct in terms of budget, team members and scope. The  collaboration between both entities seems to be strong and efficient when  needed.  DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  Key Finding #9 PSIRTs are more common in the industry and digital sectors than in the  healthcare and energy sectors.  Key Finding #10 The presentation of PSIRTs’ service offering and activities is not  standardised. This is a source of difficulty for reporting vulnerabilities as no  standard document references who should be addressed, what evidence  should be provided, or what communication tools should be used.  Key Finding #11 As PSIRTs emerge, their visibility remains low outside their company.  Some of them even lack visibility from internal stakeholders.  Key Finding #12 Most PSIRTs did not ask or look for specific support or guidance from  external stakeholders to design and implement their team although they  agree on the necessity that ENISA/EU develop best practices, standards,  and harmonised certifications.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  4  RECOMMENDATIONS  The research highlighted the following 9 recommendations, along with the targeted population:  ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  Recommendation #1  Security teams |  PSIRT  The adoption of an agile approach by product teams could be an  opportunity for PSIRTs and security teams to tackle security issues,  whether by introducing new tools in the DevOps pipelines or more  globally by providing an internal catalogue of product security related  services.  Recommendation #2  PSIRT  PSIRTs should strive to build a multidisciplinary team composed of  application and software development experts with security training, and  security experts with application and software development training. The  members of a PSIRT should have a good technical understanding of the  security and applicative issues at hand but also good soft skills to  communicate effectively with all stakeholders, whether internally or  externally, and ensure smooth IR processing.  COLLABORATION  Recommendation #3  CSIRT | PSIRT  To facilitate the sharing of disclosed vulnerability information among IR  teams, and considering the ever-increasing volume of vulnerabilities, a  machine-readable standard should be promoted to automate this  process. These exchanges should rely on a secure communication  channel.  Recommendation #4  OES | PSIRT  There needs to be a stronger link between OES and PSIRTs in terms of  information exchange quality, fluidity, and transparency. On the matter  that PSIRTs may not know whether their products are used by OES, it  could be more efficient to build and implement a legal and technical  framework that would allow OES to receive vulnerability information from  vendor PSIRTs, possibly in advance of their official disclosure, to  mitigate their impact.  Recommendation #5  ENISA | PSIRT  To foster links between PSIRTs and develop the overarching  community, regular events dedicated to PSIRTs could be developed  either through a centralised initiative, or at the initiative of a small group  of PSIRTs, at the national or the EU level. Such events could also be  encouraged worldwide to develop a wider community and to account for  increasingly global information security issues.  DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  Recommendation #6  ENISA  PSIRTs, both emerging and well-established, are eager to have more  guidance and support from ENISA. These could come in the form of  guidelines, general security recommendations, and at a more global  level, a high-level cooperation framework intended to help develop best  practices and improve exchanges among PSIRTs and other IR teams  within the Union Members.  Recommendation #7  PSIRT  The use of a presentation standard, like the one defined in RFC 2350,  may help improve the understandability of the offer, the visibility of the  PSIRT team and facilitate the vulnerability reporting process. This  document could be largely based on the template defined in RFC 2350.  Recommendation #8  PSIRT  To facilitate communication and collaboration with external stakeholders,  be they reporters or other IR teams, PSIRTs should be encouraged to  register their team and contact information on a specialised directory.  Recommendation #9  PSIRT  IR teams should strive to improve their external visibility to facilitate and  develop their vulnerability reporting process. This could be achieved  through communication with clients or a stronger involvement in the IR  community (conferences, working groups, etc.).

INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT  The EU Cybersecurity Act states that ENISA shall support Member States in developing  national strategies on the security of network and information systems, and promote the  dissemination of those strategies and note the progress in their implementation across the  Union in order to promote best practices.  As part of its effort to support EU Member States in their IR development, ENISA would like to  further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for the CSIRT capability development  following the update of the state-of-the-art view of the CSIRT landscape and development in  Europe. ENISA would like to conduct a study on Sectoral CSIRT/PSIRT capabilities status and  development within energy and healthcare sectors as specified within the NIS directive.  1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  The project aims at building an overview of current capabilities of CSIRTs and PSIRTs from  both a strategic and operational perspective within the energy and healthcare sectors. This  report should help to identify standard operating models, activities, and tools of IR teams within  both sectors.  This study is based on structured data that was gathered via desktop and field research and  has been consolidated in this report.  An overview of the methodology and an assessment and presentation of the collected data can  be found in Chapter 2.  1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY  This study provides data and an analysis of IR capabilities (IRC) within the energy and  healthcare sectors in Member States. Though the IR ecosystem necessarily goes beyond the  border of the EU, this study focuses on the EU scope for which ENISA has leverage.  This study examines:   Capabilities of PSIRTs and sectoral CSIRTs   Current levels of maturity   IR services   IR processes and procedures   IR tools   Cooperation mechanisms with internal and external stakeholders   NIS impact   Examples and/or lessons learnt  1.4 DEFINITIONS  Key concepts of the research were defined as follows:  CSIRT: A Computer Security Incidence Response Team is an entity which, at its core, responds  to computer security or cybersecurity incidents.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  8  Incident response (IR): The protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an IR process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications, management  oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the damage, eradicate  the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems.  Incident response capabilities (IRC): The processes (e.g. plans, defined roles, training,  communications, management oversight), procedures and tools (log analysis, Intrusion  Detection Systems, Vulnerability scanners, Data Capture & Incident Response Forensics Tools,  Patch management systems, etc.) used to identify, respond to and mitigate the impact of an  attack, and to restore continuity of service.  National/Government (N/g) CSIRTs: Teams that serve a country’s government by helping to  protect its critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident  management with relevant stakeholders at the national level. They also bear responsibility for  cooperation with other countries’ national and governmental teams.  National Sectoral (N/s) CSIRTs: Entities responding to computer security or cybersecurity  incidents affecting a specific sector at national level. N/s CSIRTs are usually established in  NISD sectors such as the healthcare, energy, and transport sector. Unlike N/g CSIRTs which  serve the public sector, N/s CSIRTs provide services to constituents from a single sector in one  country (in the context of this study, the N/s CSIRTs and sectors mentioned are mainly the air  transport and energy sectors).  NIS Directive: The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016. The  NISD provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  NIS Directive sectors: Critical sectors for the EU’s society and economy are heavily dependent on ICT. Member  States have been requested to identify OES for the seven sectors listed in the NIS Directive (NISD sectors). These  seven sectors – and related subsectors – listed in the Directive are:   Energy (electricity, oil, gas)   Transport (air, rail, water, road)   Banking   Financial market infrastructures   Healthcare sector   Drinking water supply and distribution   Digital Infrastructures  Operators of Essential Services (OES): OES are private or public sector entities who play an  important role in providing healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial market  infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and water supply. According to the NIS Directive, Member  States should be responsible for determining which entities meet the criteria of the definition of  OES.  OES CSIRT/IRTs: Entities or teams responding to computer security or cybersecurity incidents  affecting an OES within a sector.  PSIRT: A Product Security Incident Response Team is an entity which, at its core, responds to  cybersecurity vulnerability reports within the products and services provided by an organisation.  PSIRT organisational structure:   Distributed: The Distributed model utilizes a small core PSIRT that works with  representatives from the product teams to address security vulnerabilities in products.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  9   Centralised: The Centralised model has a larger PSIRT staff drawn from multiple  departments that report into one or more senior executives responsible for the  organisation’s product security.   Hybrid: The Hybrid model is a variation that includes characteristics of both the  Distributed and Centralised model.  Sectoral CSIRT of international organisation: Entities or teams within an international  organisation or company responding to computer security or cybersecurity incidents affecting  the organisation and providing services to constituents from a single sector at regional (EU) or  international level.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  10  2. METHODOLOGY AND DATA  COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  Our methodology to identify, collect and analyse data on IR set-up and capabilities with a focus  on PSIRTs within the healthcare and energy sectors is illustrated below. The methodology  consists of five main steps and is presented in this chapter.  Figure 1: Overview of the methodology  2.2 A FIVE-STEP APPROACH  2.2.1 Step 1 – Collect comprehensive data on IR setup  The objective of this task was to collect data on IR setup within the healthcare and energy  sectors with a focus on PSIRTs through desktop research.  This data collection method implied collecting data from third parties, mostly through the  internet. The main sources of information were official statistics, academic research, external  studies, and official documents as well as reports, white papers, legislation, policies, strategies,  initiatives, and other research projects.  This research focussed on the scope of EU Member States and was extended to international  non-European organisations to broaden our understanding of the subject.  Given that data regarding the healthcare and energy sectors was scarce in relation to our focus  on PSIRTs, we extended our scope to include entities outside the healthcare and energy  sectors in order to have sufficient data available for analysis.  The data collected during this phase was structured in a grid following the main Service Areas  details in FIRST’s PSIRT Framework (FIRST, 2020A). The data was then consolidated and  analysed in order to help prepare a questionnaire.  2.2.2 Step 2 – Prepare questionnaire for assessing IR setup  As anticipated, publicly available information on IR setup within sectoral CSIRTs with a focus on  PSIRTs was not detailed enough to provide truly insightful inputs.  This step was thus focussed on the preparation of a questionnaire, the primary goal of which  was to enrich and to validate the accuracy of the data collected during step 1.  Once the survey was defined, two main recipient categories were identified to participate:   22 PSIRTs   39 National or Sectoral CSIRTs  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  11  Further information on the data collected can be found in Appendix A: Presentation of the raw  data.  Together with ENISA, the project team drafted the survey to be sent to both audiences  considering aspects such as collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, participation  in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the impact of the NIS Directive, etc.  The final version of the survey validated by ENISA is available in Appendix B: survey –  questionnaire.  2.2.3 Step 3 – Conducting the survey and complementary interviews  The survey was sent by ENISA to the PSIRTs and CSIRTs that were previously identified. The  survey included a presentation of the study and its context.  Targeted emails were sent to relevant contacts and were followed up on to maximize  participation.  Following the survey, additional interviews took place to complement and further enrich the data  collected from the survey and the desktop research.  An overview of the raw data collected through the survey is detailed in Appendix A:  Presentation of the raw data.  2.2.4 Step 4 – Analysis of the collected data and identification of key  findings  The project team started by producing a draft version of the report using inputs from steps 1 and  3. This report presented the results identified during the analysis of desktop research data and  the answers to the survey and the interviews conducted during step 3.  Once the draft report was formalised, it was presented to ENISA and iteratively refined during  collaborative workshops.  2.2.5 Step 5 – Final report preparation  This final version of the report was then prepared, presented, and validated by ENISA.  2.3 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA & INFORMATION  AVAILABILITY  The identification of reliable and qualitative data was crucial throughout the study. For each  activity conducted during this study, namely the desktop research phase, the survey and the  complementary interviews, an overall assessment of the data and information availability was  conducted, and several assumptions were made.  During the desktop research and survey data collection phases, a large number of PSIRTs both  in the healthcare and energy sectors and outside of these sectors, and both in the Member  States and outside of them were identified so as to provide a wider understanding of the IR  ecosystem.  All national CSIRTs within the Member States were targeted, along with sectoral CSIRTs (both  within and outside the healthcare and energy sectors). Focus was also directed to a few  national sectoral CSIRTs when they could be identified.  Further information is presented in Appendix A: Presentation of the raw data.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  12  2.3.1 Desktop research – Data collection assessment  During the desktop research phase, data was collected mainly based on publicly available  information on CSIRT and PSIRT teams and activity presentation webpages, along with  information from third-party vulnerability management vendors’ presentations and a few other  literature sources.   The data collected during this phase was structured in a grid following the main  Service Areas details in FIRST’s PSIRT Framework (FIRST, 2020A).   The clarity and level of information available for each CSIRT or PSIRT was uneven  from one to another.   As anticipated, information on internal activities, structure, tools, and maturity was not  publicly available.   Information on procedures and processes followed by IR teams was rarely fully  detailed in publicly available documents.  2.3.2 Survey – Data collection assessment  29 respondents answered the survey:   22 CSIRTS/CERTs   7 PSIRTs  2.3.3 Interviews – Data collection assessment  Two additional interviews were conducted with sectoral PSIRTs that operate within or in close  connection with the healthcare and energy sectors. These PSIRTs were selected from among  those that had answered the survey.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  13  3. KEY FINDINGS  3.1 ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  3.1.1 Key finding #1 – PSIRT activities  Outside their IR Processes, PSIRTs’ activities and their involvement in product lifecycle  is heterogeneous.  Aside from their core IR responsibilities, PSIRTs may have other security related activities, such  as participation in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for their company’s products, or  providing security training for developers, for instance.  The survey and the interviews that we conducted highlighted differences in PSIRTs’  involvement in such activities related to company and team organisation, but also to the  mandate given to the PSIRT.  The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) outlines and divides the traditional software  development process into a few main phases.  Our survey included a focus on the PSIRTs’ involvement in the SDLC. In the survey,  participants were asked about their participation in the following phases:   Requirements   Design   Development   Testing   Release  PSIRTs appear to be globally involved in their company product’s SDLC, albeit unevenly.  Setting aside two respondents that declared that they do not take part in the SDLC, participation  in the testing and release phase is frequent, while participation in the earlier requirement,  design and implementation phases is less so.  Figure 2: PSIRT involvement in each phase of software life cycle according to our survey  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  14  The PSIRTs that reported not being involved in the SDLC in the survey gave details regarding  their answers during interviews:   In one case, though the PSIRT is sponsored by a product development team, as their  company products are strongly diversified, it would be impossible for the PSIRT team  members to be sufficiently knowledgeable about all product specifics in order to be  able to participate in the SDLC efficiently. Thus, they rely on security delegates  (Product Security Officers) within each product team.   In the other case, the PSIRT does not directly take part in the SDLC but is part of a  security competence centre that does.  3.1.2 Key finding #2 – Third-party vulnerability management platforms  The adoption of third-party vulnerability management platforms is uncommon. Those  who use one do so because it is easier to manage and improves visibility.  In recent years, a few commercial or non-commercial third-party vulnerability management  platforms have appeared on the market: Hacker One, Bug Crowd, Yes We Hack, BugHeist,  OpenBugBounty, etc.  These platforms generally offer various security related services such as penetration testing,  bug bounties and vulnerability disclosure programmes.  These services can be complementary to traditional PSIRT activities, especially regarding their  penetration testing offerings, but also as specific tools that can outsource part of the  vulnerability reporting process. In this case, vulnerability reports can be created by reporters  directly on these platforms which then relay the information to the PSIRT.  According to our desk research and survey, the adoption of these third-party platforms, at least  regarding their vulnerability disclosure programme services, is uncommon among European  PSIRTs.  Only one respondent to our survey declared using a third-party platform for their vulnerability  disclosure programme. They mention the ease of setup, the fact that there is no need to  administer the service and the external visibility induced by the presence on the platform as  motivation to do so.  During our interviews, when asked why they had not chosen to use a third-party platform,  PSIRTs declared that they were reluctant to have vulnerability information stored on external  platforms and preferred this information to stay within internal systems. Another factor  mentioned was the overall low number of vulnerabilities handled each year, meaning there is  little or no demand for the use of third-party platforms.  However, we note that the development of these platforms is still relatively new. As most  PSIRTs among our survey respondents were found to be 5+ years old, this might be a factor in  the relatively low adoption rate among our panel. This was confirmed during one of our  interviews: the PSIRT in question was created over 10 years ago, and these services were  either not available then or not as popular as they are nowadays.  3.1.3 Key finding #3 – KPIs  Measuring the efficiency of a PSIRT proves to be challenging, as most PSIRTs essentially  track it with the number of vulnerabilities reported and mitigated.  When it comes to measuring the efficiency of a PSIRT, the most common KPI seems to be the  number of vulnerabilities reported or remediated. Although these indicators seem suitable  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  15  considering the main mission of the PSIRT, the PSIRT does not have any influence on them.  Indeed, if no vulnerability is discovered or if a lot of them are reported to the team, in both  cases, we cannot assume that the PSIRT is efficient or not.  Additionally, few KPIs are taking IR time, the time to onboard stakeholders or the diversity of  stakeholders into account.  3.1.4 Key finding #4 – Skills  PSIRT members have both technical skills in product security areas and soft skills that  enable smoother exchanges and cooperation between all the stakeholders.  The scope covered by PSIRTs includes both technical and business aspects.  Figure 3: Specific desired skills in order to fulfil PSIRT functions  All PSIRTs interviewed reckon that good technical knowledge is a requirement, especially in  application security. It enables an accurate evaluation of reported vulnerabilities and a better  understanding of addressed topics. A good understanding of business is also needed as one  responsibility of their mission is to prioritise reported vulnerabilities. This would be especially  true in the context of an exponential surge in the number of reported vulnerabilities.  “PSIRT members require technical skills to judge whether a reported  vulnerability can be real and to judge whether the response of the business  side makes sense”  With the emergence of agility in product teams, some PSIRTs stated that DevOps and  DevSecOps are desired skills to fulfil their functions. It seems to be unrelated to the involvement  of PSIRT teams in the remediation of the incident as this skill is mentioned both by PSIRTs that  are directly involved in such processes and those who are not.  On the other hand, we observe a strong desire for business understanding. Given that PSIRTs  oversee the vulnerability remediation progress, they should be able to understand business  processes and matters in order to be efficient.  They also should be able to exchange with internal and external stakeholders. Beyond product  teams and developers, these stakeholders can be security researchers, legal teams, or  communication teams. In this case, communication skills at technical and business levels are  also necessary to understand and be understood by all these actors.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  16  3.2 COLLABORATION  3.2.1 Key finding #5 – Impact of NIS Directive  PSIRTs do not have specific procedures to address vulnerabilities affecting OES and the  NIS directive does not seem to have affected PSIRT activities much.  The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was adopted by the  European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016 (European  Commission, 2016). This Directive provides legal measures to boost the overall level of  cybersecurity in the EU.  It defines OES as private or public sector entities that play an important role in providing  healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure,  and water supply.  As part of the general IR landscape, PSIRTs may establish contact with OES either because  their parent company itself is an OES, or because the product they sell or the service their  company offers is provided to an OES.  None of the respondents to our survey say they have currently implemented specific procedures  to address vulnerabilities affecting OES, though two say they are still evaluating the impact of  the NIS Directive.  One of our interviewees declared not having specific OES procedures as they handle all  vulnerabilities on a case by case basis and thus did not feel that this would be needed.  Another interviewee raised concern regarding the impact of NIS on their activities. They belong  to an industrial company that makes parts for other vendors and though they do not have direct  OES clients, their products end up being used in other companies’ products and may thus be  used by OES. However, the PSIRT does not know how its products are used. Therefore, the  PSIRT cannot determine whether a vulnerability would affect an OES or not.  3.2.2 Key finding #6 – Collaboration between PSIRTs  PSIRTs collaborate one with each other, but their collaboration is hindered by the lack of  formalised communication and information exchange procedures/standards/framework.  Collaboration amongst IR teams is essential for the IR process efficacy and efficiency. It is also  important for them to communicate to forge a community of experts, thus enabling smooth  information exchange, knowledge-sharing and trust.  Regarding the collaboration between PSIRTs, our survey highlights the overall will from PSIRTs  to collaborate with each other.  Figure 4: Division of answers regarding the collaboration of PSIRTs with other PSIRTs  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  17  To establish contact, PSIRTs rely on existing security communities and sometimes attend  events hosted by organisations such as FIRST, or by coordinating through the CERT  Coordination Center or the Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group, for instance.  However, PSIRTs may find that these events are perhaps not specific enough to their activities,  as one of our interviewees declared.  PSIRTs may also establish informal contacts directly with a few other selected PSIRTs. Once  contact is established, PSIRTs cited sharing information about:   Best practices   Tips and tricks   Tools   Process improvement ideas  It appears that the exchange of information regarding vulnerabilities is a more complex issue.  Indeed, two main matters were brought to our attention.  Firstly, the lack of commonly established standard procedures and protocols to securely  exchange information about vulnerabilities hinders collaboration, especially now that the sheer  volume of vulnerabilities makes manual and traditional sharing almost impossible:  “Some of our clients urged us to make our reports machine readable because  they do not have time to process that much data manually”  Secondly, sharing vulnerability information with competitors may only work if there is a strong  trust relationship that ensures that “sharing vulnerabilities won´t be used against us\", as one  PSIRT declared in our survey. During our interviews, this issue did not seem to be much of an  issue however and the security of both the product and users was put above these concerns.  3.2.3 Key finding #7 – Collaboration between PSIRTs and CSIRTs  Collaboration between PSIRTs and external CSIRTs (sectoral/national) is underdeveloped  because of difficulties in establishing contact and sharing sensitive information even  though CSIRTs are demanding more regular contact.  Similar to the collaboration between PSIRTs, collaboration between PSIRTs and external  CSIRTs is essential for the IR process efficacy and efficiency.  According to our survey, when PSIRTs and CSIRTs collaborate, they mostly exchange hot  topics, recently disclosed vulnerabilities, or the latest development ideas.  However, collaboration does not appear to be a completely widespread practice. Indeed, among  the PSIRTs and CSIRTs that answered our survey:   83% of the PSIRTs declared having contacts with CSIRTs   55% of the CSIRTs declared having contacts with PSIRTs  Figure 5: Division of answers regarding the collaboration between PSIRTs and CSIRTs  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  18  It appears that few CSIRTs, and especially national ones, had the opportunity to collaborate  with a PSIRT on IR. Those who did described their relationship as functional, but with room for  improvement.  This lower figure among CSIRTs may be nuanced by some of the answers that either mention  the complete absence or the relatively low number of PSIRTs in their country.  Similar to the previous Key Finding about the communication among PSIRTs, collaboration  between PSIRTs and CSIRTs is hindered by the lack of commonly established standard  procedures and protocols to securely exchange information. The ever-increasing volume of  information regarding vulnerabilities is becoming impossible to process with traditional manual  processes.  One of the PSIRTs we interviewed voiced their concern that, from their experience, CSIRTs do  not seem to fully consider hardware specifics during IR collaboration. Indeed, if a vulnerability  affecting a product’s hardware components is reported, it may take longer to find a fix and then  deploy it than for purely software related products, considering all the supply chain issues  associated with it (development, certification, production, delivery, physical access for patching,  etc.). This longer remediation period can possibly span multiple months and may require a  considerable effort (physically dispatching engineers to apply a patch, for instance), that may  not yet be quite considered by the traditional CSIRT IR processes.  3.2.4 Key finding #8 – PSIRT/CSIRT complementarity within a company  EU companies that run a PSIRT almost always have a CSIRT, but these are mostly  distinct in terms of budget, team members and scope. The collaboration between both  entities seems to be strong and efficient when needed.  PSIRT and CSIRT are two complementary yet distinct IR teams. They have specific approaches  and expertise, which is why, for the most part, they have different team members, tools, and  different sponsorship.  On the one hand, a CSIRT typically has a mandate for protecting the company’s internal  information system against threats. On the other hand, a PSIRT is typically more focused on the  security of the product developed in the structure. Its objective is to address vulnerabilities  affecting them and to ensure they are remediated in time. Some PSIRTs are directly involved in  the implementation of remediation, but it varies among structures as there is no clear definition  of the scope of PSIRTs’ missions.  The lack of a clear perimeter of the responsibilities has another consequence: it makes it difficult  for external stakeholders to get in contact with the right person. For example, a national CSIRT  reported that it is sometimes unclear if reports should be addressed to the support team, the  product team or the PSIRT.  “It might be confusing for external parties though, if there is no clear  publication of their respective missions”  Although the teams have a different scope, if a company has a PSIRT and a CSIRT, both  entities naturally share their knowledge and exchange information. They exchange reports  mostly about threat intelligence but may sometimes also organise joint conferences.  Regarding operational cooperation on incidents, they have very few occasions to work together  because their areas of expertise are different. A product vulnerability does seldom affect a  company's internal security, and vice-versa. However, when such an incident occurs,  interviewed teams describe their relationship as strong and efficient.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  19  3.3 DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  3.3.1 Key finding #9 – Sectoral distribution  PSIRTs are more common in the industry and digital sectors than in the healthcare and  energy sectors.  The initial focus of our desktop research was put on PSIRTs in the health and energy sectors.  Once it became evident that there was not a sufficiently significant number of PSIRTs in these  sectors, our research scope was broadened to include all sectors.  The lack of PSIRTs in the health and energy sectors could be explained by the fact that IT  companies are more exposed to security vulnerabilities due to the nature of their product, and  are consequently more likely to develop a dedicated structure and solution to handle these  incidents than health and energy ones, which tend to be users of these solutions.  Table 1: PSIRT sector repartition in our desktop research  Source attached to the  European Union  PSIRT sector Source count  YES  Industry 9  Digital 4  Health 1  NO  Digital 37  Industry 7  Health 2  Energy 2  Note that in some cases where the PSIRT’s company was operating in multiple sectors, we  selected the sector that appeared to be the most prevalent.  Most of the PSIRTs we found, especially outside the EU, were attached to a company either in  the digital sector (software vendors in particular) or the industry sector (equipment  manufacturers, for instance). We also identified a few CSIRTs that operate transversally in the  industry, healthcare, or energy sectors.  The relatively limited number of specific healthcare and energy PSIRTs in place can thus  perhaps be nuanced by the existence of PSIRTs in their industrial supplier companies.  3.3.2 Key finding #10 – PSIRT activities presentation  The presentation of PSIRTs’ service offering and activities is not standardised. This is a  source of difficulty for reporting vulnerabilities as no standard document references who  should be addressed, what evidence should be provided, or what communication tools  should be used.  Through the desktop research, we found that PSIRTs’ service offering is mainly presented  through a dedicated page on the website of their company. This presentation most commonly  includes information regarding:  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  20   The PSIRT charter containing a short description of the PSIRT mission, purpose, roles,  responsibilities, and services.   The channels available for the intake of vulnerabilities (a dedicated email address, a  specific web form, a dedicated tool, etc.).   A high-level overview of the vulnerability reporting process.   The type of vulnerability disclosure agreement that is followed.   Some form of hall of fame or acknowledgment for past vulnerability reporters.  We noticed a few of the PSIRTs that were analysed during the desktop research phase seemed  to follow or at least to have based their offer presentation on publicly available and open source  examples.  The presentation and the amount of information available about each PSIRT varies greatly,  however. For instance, we found that information regarding these key topics is rarely available:   General Service Level Agreement information (report acknowledgment delay, for  instance)   The amount of details expected to be included in a vulnerability report (description of  the vulnerability, reproduction steps, proofs, etc.)  If we look at CSIRTs, RFC 2350 (Brownlee & Guttman, 1998) provides guidelines on how to  present the IR activities of a CSIRT, along with a template that can be used for this purpose.  This document is structured in seven parts:   Document information   Contact information   Charter   Policies   Services   Incident reporting forms   Disclaimers  Our desk research did not highlight any PSIRTs that provided such a document.  As the vulnerability reporting process can differ from one PSIRT to another, the lack of a formal  and standardised document that presents the PSIRT’s activity could hinder the efficiency of the  reporting process and the overall visibility of a PSIRT.  3.3.3 Key finding #11 – PSIRT visibility  As PSIRTs emerge, their visibility remains low outside their company. Some of them  even lack visibility from internal stakeholders.  PSIRT are relatively new in the security vista and collaboration between them will be essential  for their development. Then, improving their visibility is necessary to create a relationship  among actors, resulting in a strong community and smoother exchanges.  As PSIRTs are more recent than CSIRTs, they do not have a community as wide as CSIRTs  do. To gain visibility in the IR domain, PSIRT teams often attend events hosted by other  communities, such as CSIRTs. However, such events are considered too big and not specific  enough by the teams we interviewed.  Nonetheless, from an external point of view, it is sometimes unclear whether a company runs a  PSIRT, and how to contact it. If some of them have a dedicated website with clear contact  details, others are never mentioned in a company’s documents. Furthermore, it appears that  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  21  some PSIRTs do not want to contact nor to be contacted by other PSIRTs or CSIRTs under the  belief that they do not need cooperation yet.  This issue of visibility is not just limited to external actors. It also exists within companies. When  there is no clear sponsorship for PSIRTs, other departments are sometimes unaware of the  existence of a PSIRT. Indeed, PSIRTs can report to their company’s Chief Technical Officer  (CTO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Product Security Officer (PSO), CSIRT  Manager or other Business functions depending on the company.  Figure 6: Sponsorship of PSIRTs  In one case, the CISO did not know of the existence of a PSIRT in their company even though it  was created some years ago, thus highlighting a flaw in the communication channel.  This is a real concern because, as one of the respondents notes:  “It is important for all parts of a company to know that a PSIRT exists.”  3.3.4 Key finding #12 – External guidance and support  Most PSIRTs did not ask or look for specific support or guidance from external  stakeholders to design and implement their team although they agree on the necessity  that ENISA/EU develop best practices, standards and harmonised certifications.  PSIRTs are relatively new in the cybersecurity vista. Most of the PSIRTs that responded to our  survey were 5+ years old and reckoned that, at the time they were created, there was no  guidance for this new kind of IR team. As a result, PSIRTs developed heterogeneously and  each company defined their own scope, procedures, and organisation.  As of today, there are few documents describing what is a PSIRT and how to build one. The  most known is the recently published PSIRT Service Framework published by the FIRST  organisation. It was first released as a draft in 2017 and the final version was published in 2020.  Most recent PSIRTs have relied on this framework to build themselves. They also got support  from the existing CSIRT and PSIRTs communities, professional associations, and industry  players.  Though few PSIRTs benefited from guidance, most of them wish for more guidance and a move  toward standardised communication and protocols to enhance information sharing and  exchanges.  Moreover, as some PSIRTs suggested, national entities could support teams to step into  international IR communities to benefit the community experience.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  22  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  PSIRTs and CSIRTs are essential players in the global IR ecosystem. Our recommendations  thus address PSIRT specifics but also wider security community considerations.  4.1 ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  4.1.1 Recommendation #1 – Security and Agility  More and more product teams are shifting to an agile approach for application development,  which reduces the duration of development cycles. They are mostly implementing DevOps,  which brings development and operational teams closer together.  This shift is a concern for security teams whose processes are not yet compatible with this new  organisation at scale. Traditional integration of security in projects does not fit these new  development methods easily, especially in a context of continuous delivery. As a result, security  teams can be quickly overloaded, and the number of vulnerabilities may increase.  Yet, from a security perspective, DevOps, and more specifically the automated pipelines, can  also be an opportunity to perform automatic security assessments. Security tools such as Static  Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) or Secret  Detection can detect most of the common vulnerabilities and flaws in developed applications.  Therefore, the security teams, including PSIRTs, should also be involved in these new  processes to promote the adoption of such security tools and to ensure processes are  controlled. This would reduce the number of reported vulnerabilities by “shifting security left”, i.e.  upstream in the development processes.  A long-term objective would be the integration of an Agile security Target Operating Model  (TOM) at scale, with the development of autonomous product teams fully aware of security  matters.  In the meantime, to improve application security, security teams could provide tools and  consumable services to support product teams and foster application security maturity. These  accelerators could be framed in a dedicated catalogue tailored for product teams and could  relieve overloaded security teams by raising developers’ awareness regarding application  security.  The content of the catalogue itself should mostly depend on the organisation stack and  available skills, but it may contain the following types of accelerators:   Support services, such as detaching a security expert in product teams. Their  objectives would be to raise developers’ awareness about application security and  ensure security issues are properly handled. It could be enriched with security audits,  training sessions, or penetration testing.   A list of security tools (SAST, DAST, Secret manager) which can be integrated in  pipelines, along with guidance and secure configuration templates to avoid security  flaws due to misuse.  To be relevant, the catalogue should take the current maturity level and team’s objectives into  account. It should be built upon an AppSec Maturity Model, for example the Software  Assurance Maturity Model (OWASP, 2009), and adapted to the specificities of each company.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  23  4.1.2 Recommendation #2 – Multidisciplinary team  PSIRTs should strive to build a multidisciplinary team composed of application and software  development experts with security training, and security experts with an application and  software development training.  The members of PSIRTs should have a good technical understanding of the security and  applicative issues at hand but also good soft skills to communicate effectively with all  stakeholders, whether internally or externally, and ensure smooth IR processing.  This would enable teams to be practical about the addressed vulnerabilities and avoid common  misunderstandings by having a broad vision of the issue. For example, due to the limited  computing power of some products, the security teams may not suggest strong encryption as  remediation given that it cannot be implemented.  4.2 COLLABORATION  4.2.1 Recommendation #3 – Standard vulnerability information  exchanges  Collaboration between IR teams is currently hindered by the lack of standardised procedures  and protocols to exchange information securely and automatically about vulnerabilities.  To facilitate the sharing of disclosed vulnerability information, and considering the ever-  increasing volume of vulnerabilities, a machine-readable standard should be promoted to  automate this process.  Some companies are already working on such a standard. It would enable security teams to  automatically filter relevant vulnerabilities that could affect their products or information systems.  Naturally, given the sensitive nature of the information, these exchanges should rely on a  secure communication channel.  Besides, ENISA agrees with the NIS 2 proposal to “establish a vulnerability registry where, OES  and their suppliers […] may, on a voluntary basis, disclose vulnerabilities and provide the  vulnerability information that allows users to take appropriate mitigating measures” (European  Commission, 2020). Although such databases already exist, ENISA recalls that they are hosted  and maintained by entities that are not established in the EU. This registry would be a  centralised source of information and help users to take appropriate mitigating measures.  4.2.2 Recommendation #4 – Communication between PSIRTs and OES  The NIS Directive does not appear to have had an impact on PSIRT activities yet. However,  there needs to be a stronger link between OES and PSIRTs in terms of information exchange  quality, fluidity, and transparency.  On the matter that PSIRTs may not know whether their products are used by OES, it could be  more efficient to build and implement a legal and technical framework that would allow OES to  receive vulnerability information from vendor PSIRTs, possibly in advance of their official  disclosure, so as to mitigate their impact.  For better coordination between actors, especially on vulnerability disclosure, the NIS 2 directive  stipulates that Member States should designate a CSIRT to take the role of a coordinator. When  vulnerabilities affect multiple organisations, it should identify and contact concerned entities  (including PSIRTs), support reporting entities and negotiate disclosure timelines.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  24  Finally, given the prevalence of incidents where entities have fallen victim to cyber-attacks by  exploiting vulnerabilities affecting third party products and services, they should therefore  assess and take into account the overall quality of products and cybersecurity practices of their  suppliers and service providers. A supplementary recommendation would be to check whether  actors in the supply chain have a PSIRT and, in this case, to cooperate with them on a regular  basis.  4.2.3 Recommendation #5 – PSIRT community events  Collaboration and communication among PSIRTs, between PSIRTs and CSIRTs and more  generally in the global IR ecosystem are essential to IR efficacy and efficiency.  To foster links between PSIRTs and develop the overarching community, regular events  dedicated to PSIRTs could be hosted either through a centralised initiative, or at the initiative of  a small group a PSIRTs, at the national or the EU level. These events could even have a  sectorial focus if appropriate.  Such events could also be encouraged worldwide to develop a wider community and to account  for the increasingly global information security issues.  4.3 DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  4.3.1 Recommendation #6 – ENISA guidance  The PSIRT ecosystem is growing in the EU and worldwide. PSIRTs, both emerging and well-  established, are eager to have more guidance and support from ENISA.  These could come in the form of guidelines, general security recommendations, and more  globally a high-level cooperation framework intended to help develop best practices and  improve exchanges among PSIRTs and other IR teams within the EU Member States.  4.3.2 Recommendation #7 – PSIRT presentation standardisation  PSIRTs’ service offering and activities presentation for external stakeholders is not  standardised. This is a source of difficulty when reporting vulnerabilities as no standard  document references who should be addressed, what evidence should be provided, or what  communication tools should be used.  The use of a presentation standard, like the one defined in RFC 2350, may help improve the  understandability of the offer, the visibility of the PSIRT team and facilitate the vulnerability  reporting process. This document could be largely based on the template defined in RFC 2350,  and should be regularly maintained to ensure it is up to date.  4.3.3 Recommendation #8 – PSIRT directory  Team visibility is a prerequisite to receiving vulnerability reports from external stakeholders, but  also an enabler for communication with other teams. To facilitate communication and  collaboration with external stakeholders, be they reporters or other IR teams, PSIRTs should be  encouraged to register their team and contact information on a specialised directory.  4.3.4 Recommendation #9 – Reputation & recognition  Reputation and recognition from both internal and external stakeholders are key success factors  for IR teams.  IR teams should strive to improve their external visibility to facilitate and develop their  vulnerability reporting process. This could be achieved through communication with clients or a  stronger involvement in the IR community.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  25  IR teams’ internal visibility should also be a main objective, as it allows for better cooperation  with internal stakeholders (Product teams, Legal, Communication, Customer Support, etc.) and  ensures a smooth response to vulnerability reports and incidents. One way of achieving better  visibility could be for PSIRTs to develop stronger links with their company’s PSO and CISO,  through sponsorship or day-to-day cooperation.

This report follows the  December 2020 publication of Sectoral CSIRT Capabilities - Status and Development in the  Energy and the Air Transport sectors.  Desk research has been conducted, followed by a survey which was answered by 7 PSIRTs  and 22 CSIRTs from 19 EU Member States. The relatively low number of PSIRTs, especially of  those with a scope limited to the energy and healthcare sectors, led us to include more CSIRTs  and more sectors in the study. The findings and recommendations still apply to the energy and  healthcare sectors, but also offer a wider view of the product vulnerability management  landscape.  As a result, 12 key findings were identified, and 9 recommendations have been proposed.  One of the main findings is the lack of visibility of PSIRTs: from an external point of view, it is  not always clear what their activities are and who to contact. Even from an internal point of view,  the PSIRTs are not sufficiently identified in their role. This report offers recommendations in  terms of standardised presentation and increased visibility to improve this issue.  The second main finding is the current difficulties for different stakeholders of the vulnerability  ecosystem (PSIRTs, CSIRTs, national/sectoral CSIRTs, end clients, Operators of Essential  Services (OES)) in communicating and collaborating efficiently with each other in order to  improve product cybersecurity as a whole. The associated recommendations revolve around  technical standards to improve interoperability and automation, and processes to streamline the  exchange of sensitive information, especially with OES which would greatly benefit from early  notification in the case of vulnerability disclosure.  As to the role of ENISA, the respondents to the survey expect the Agency to provide them with  guidelines, general security recommendations and, at a more global level, a high-level  cooperation framework intended to help develop best practices and improve exchanges among  PSIRTs and other incident response (IR) teams within the European Union (EU). NIS 2 should  bring improvements in this area, as some of these expectations have already been outlined in  the NIS 2 proposal, for instance regarding a vulnerability registry for OES and their suppliers,  and regarding the important role of CSIRTs in global coordination.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  3  KEY FINDINGS  The research highlighted the following 12 key findings:  ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  Key Finding #1 Outside their IR Processes, PSIRTs’ activities and their involvement in  product lifecycle is heterogeneous.  Key Finding #2 The adoption of third-party vulnerability management platforms is  uncommon. Those who use one do so because it is easier to manage and  improves visibility.  Key Finding #3 Measuring the efficiency of a PSIRT proves to be challenging, as most  PSIRTs essentially track efficiency with the number of vulnerabilities  reported and mitigated.  Key Finding #4 PSIRT members have both technical skills in product security areas and  soft skills which enable smoother exchanges and cooperation between all  the stakeholders.  COLLABORATION  Key Finding #5 PSIRTs do not have specific procedures to address vulnerabilities affecting  OES and the NIS directive does not seem to have impacted PSIRT  activities much.  Key Finding #6 PSIRTs collaborate one with each other, but their collaboration is hindered  by the lack of formalised communication and information exchange  procedures/standards/framework.  Key Finding #7 Collaboration between PSIRTs and external CSIRTs (sectoral/national) is  underdeveloped because of difficulties in establishing contact and sharing  sensitive information even though CSIRTs are demanding more regular  contact.  Key Finding #8 EU companies that run a PSIRT almost always have a CSIRT, but these  are mostly distinct in terms of budget, team members and scope. The  collaboration between both entities seems to be strong and efficient when  needed.  DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  Key Finding #9 PSIRTs are more common in the industry and digital sectors than in the  healthcare and energy sectors.  Key Finding #10 The presentation of PSIRTs’ service offering and activities is not  standardised. This is a source of difficulty for reporting vulnerabilities as no  standard document references who should be addressed, what evidence  should be provided, or what communication tools should be used.  Key Finding #11 As PSIRTs emerge, their visibility remains low outside their company.  Some of them even lack visibility from internal stakeholders.  Key Finding #12 Most PSIRTs did not ask or look for specific support or guidance from  external stakeholders to design and implement their team although they  agree on the necessity that ENISA/EU develop best practices, standards,  and harmonised certifications.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  4  RECOMMENDATIONS  The research highlighted the following 9 recommendations, along with the targeted population:  ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  Recommendation #1  Security teams |  PSIRT  The adoption of an agile approach by product teams could be an  opportunity for PSIRTs and security teams to tackle security issues,  whether by introducing new tools in the DevOps pipelines or more  globally by providing an internal catalogue of product security related  services.  Recommendation #2  PSIRT  PSIRTs should strive to build a multidisciplinary team composed of  application and software development experts with security training, and  security experts with application and software development training. The  members of a PSIRT should have a good technical understanding of the  security and applicative issues at hand but also good soft skills to  communicate effectively with all stakeholders, whether internally or  externally, and ensure smooth IR processing.  COLLABORATION  Recommendation #3  CSIRT | PSIRT  To facilitate the sharing of disclosed vulnerability information among IR  teams, and considering the ever-increasing volume of vulnerabilities, a  machine-readable standard should be promoted to automate this  process. These exchanges should rely on a secure communication  channel.  Recommendation #4  OES | PSIRT  There needs to be a stronger link between OES and PSIRTs in terms of  information exchange quality, fluidity, and transparency. On the matter  that PSIRTs may not know whether their products are used by OES, it  could be more efficient to build and implement a legal and technical  framework that would allow OES to receive vulnerability information from  vendor PSIRTs, possibly in advance of their official disclosure, to  mitigate their impact.  Recommendation #5  ENISA | PSIRT  To foster links between PSIRTs and develop the overarching  community, regular events dedicated to PSIRTs could be developed  either through a centralised initiative, or at the initiative of a small group  of PSIRTs, at the national or the EU level. Such events could also be  encouraged worldwide to develop a wider community and to account for  increasingly global information security issues.  DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  Recommendation #6  ENISA  PSIRTs, both emerging and well-established, are eager to have more  guidance and support from ENISA. These could come in the form of  guidelines, general security recommendations, and at a more global  level, a high-level cooperation framework intended to help develop best  practices and improve exchanges among PSIRTs and other IR teams  within the Union Members.  Recommendation #7  PSIRT  The use of a presentation standard, like the one defined in RFC 2350,  may help improve the understandability of the offer, the visibility of the  PSIRT team and facilitate the vulnerability reporting process. This  document could be largely based on the template defined in RFC 2350.  Recommendation #8  PSIRT  To facilitate communication and collaboration with external stakeholders,  be they reporters or other IR teams, PSIRTs should be encouraged to  register their team and contact information on a specialised directory.  Recommendation #9  PSIRT  IR teams should strive to improve their external visibility to facilitate and  develop their vulnerability reporting process. This could be achieved  through communication with clients or a stronger involvement in the IR  community (conferences, working groups, etc.).

INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT  The EU Cybersecurity Act states that ENISA shall support Member States in developing  national strategies on the security of network and information systems, and promote the  dissemination of those strategies and note the progress in their implementation across the  Union in order to promote best practices.  As part of its effort to support EU Member States in their IR development, ENISA would like to  further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for the CSIRT capability development  following the update of the state-of-the-art view of the CSIRT landscape and development in  Europe. ENISA would like to conduct a study on Sectoral CSIRT/PSIRT capabilities status and  development within energy and healthcare sectors as specified within the NIS directive.  1.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY  The project aims at building an overview of current capabilities of CSIRTs and PSIRTs from  both a strategic and operational perspective within the energy and healthcare sectors. This  report should help to identify standard operating models, activities, and tools of IR teams within  both sectors.  This study is based on structured data that was gathered via desktop and field research and  has been consolidated in this report.  An overview of the methodology and an assessment and presentation of the collected data can  be found in Chapter 2.  1.3 SCOPE OF THE STUDY  This study provides data and an analysis of IR capabilities (IRC) within the energy and  healthcare sectors in Member States. Though the IR ecosystem necessarily goes beyond the  border of the EU, this study focuses on the EU scope for which ENISA has leverage.  This study examines:   Capabilities of PSIRTs and sectoral CSIRTs   Current levels of maturity   IR services   IR processes and procedures   IR tools   Cooperation mechanisms with internal and external stakeholders   NIS impact   Examples and/or lessons learnt  1.4 DEFINITIONS  Key concepts of the research were defined as follows:  CSIRT: A Computer Security Incidence Response Team is an entity which, at its core, responds  to computer security or cybersecurity incidents.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  8  Incident response (IR): The protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an IR process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications, management  oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and effectively contain the damage, eradicate  the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems.  Incident response capabilities (IRC): The processes (e.g. plans, defined roles, training,  communications, management oversight), procedures and tools (log analysis, Intrusion  Detection Systems, Vulnerability scanners, Data Capture & Incident Response Forensics Tools,  Patch management systems, etc.) used to identify, respond to and mitigate the impact of an  attack, and to restore continuity of service.  National/Government (N/g) CSIRTs: Teams that serve a country’s government by helping to  protect its critical information infrastructure. N/g CSIRTs play a key role in coordinating incident  management with relevant stakeholders at the national level. They also bear responsibility for  cooperation with other countries’ national and governmental teams.  National Sectoral (N/s) CSIRTs: Entities responding to computer security or cybersecurity  incidents affecting a specific sector at national level. N/s CSIRTs are usually established in  NISD sectors such as the healthcare, energy, and transport sector. Unlike N/g CSIRTs which  serve the public sector, N/s CSIRTs provide services to constituents from a single sector in one  country (in the context of this study, the N/s CSIRTs and sectors mentioned are mainly the air  transport and energy sectors).  NIS Directive: The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was  adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016. The  NISD provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  NIS Directive sectors: Critical sectors for the EU’s society and economy are heavily dependent on ICT. Member  States have been requested to identify OES for the seven sectors listed in the NIS Directive (NISD sectors). These  seven sectors – and related subsectors – listed in the Directive are:   Energy (electricity, oil, gas)   Transport (air, rail, water, road)   Banking   Financial market infrastructures   Healthcare sector   Drinking water supply and distribution   Digital Infrastructures  Operators of Essential Services (OES): OES are private or public sector entities who play an  important role in providing healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial market  infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and water supply. According to the NIS Directive, Member  States should be responsible for determining which entities meet the criteria of the definition of  OES.  OES CSIRT/IRTs: Entities or teams responding to computer security or cybersecurity incidents  affecting an OES within a sector.  PSIRT: A Product Security Incident Response Team is an entity which, at its core, responds to  cybersecurity vulnerability reports within the products and services provided by an organisation.  PSIRT organisational structure:   Distributed: The Distributed model utilizes a small core PSIRT that works with  representatives from the product teams to address security vulnerabilities in products.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  9   Centralised: The Centralised model has a larger PSIRT staff drawn from multiple  departments that report into one or more senior executives responsible for the  organisation’s product security.   Hybrid: The Hybrid model is a variation that includes characteristics of both the  Distributed and Centralised model.  Sectoral CSIRT of international organisation: Entities or teams within an international  organisation or company responding to computer security or cybersecurity incidents affecting  the organisation and providing services to constituents from a single sector at regional (EU) or  international level.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  10  2. METHODOLOGY AND DATA  COLLECTION  2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  Our methodology to identify, collect and analyse data on IR set-up and capabilities with a focus  on PSIRTs within the healthcare and energy sectors is illustrated below. The methodology  consists of five main steps and is presented in this chapter.  Figure 1: Overview of the methodology  2.2 A FIVE-STEP APPROACH  2.2.1 Step 1 – Collect comprehensive data on IR setup  The objective of this task was to collect data on IR setup within the healthcare and energy  sectors with a focus on PSIRTs through desktop research.  This data collection method implied collecting data from third parties, mostly through the  internet. The main sources of information were official statistics, academic research, external  studies, and official documents as well as reports, white papers, legislation, policies, strategies,  initiatives, and other research projects.  This research focussed on the scope of EU Member States and was extended to international  non-European organisations to broaden our understanding of the subject.  Given that data regarding the healthcare and energy sectors was scarce in relation to our focus  on PSIRTs, we extended our scope to include entities outside the healthcare and energy  sectors in order to have sufficient data available for analysis.  The data collected during this phase was structured in a grid following the main Service Areas  details in FIRST’s PSIRT Framework (FIRST, 2020A). The data was then consolidated and  analysed in order to help prepare a questionnaire.  2.2.2 Step 2 – Prepare questionnaire for assessing IR setup  As anticipated, publicly available information on IR setup within sectoral CSIRTs with a focus on  PSIRTs was not detailed enough to provide truly insightful inputs.  This step was thus focussed on the preparation of a questionnaire, the primary goal of which  was to enrich and to validate the accuracy of the data collected during step 1.  Once the survey was defined, two main recipient categories were identified to participate:   22 PSIRTs   39 National or Sectoral CSIRTs  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  11  Further information on the data collected can be found in Appendix A: Presentation of the raw  data.  Together with ENISA, the project team drafted the survey to be sent to both audiences  considering aspects such as collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, participation  in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), the impact of the NIS Directive, etc.  The final version of the survey validated by ENISA is available in Appendix B: survey –  questionnaire.  2.2.3 Step 3 – Conducting the survey and complementary interviews  The survey was sent by ENISA to the PSIRTs and CSIRTs that were previously identified. The  survey included a presentation of the study and its context.  Targeted emails were sent to relevant contacts and were followed up on to maximize  participation.  Following the survey, additional interviews took place to complement and further enrich the data  collected from the survey and the desktop research.  An overview of the raw data collected through the survey is detailed in Appendix A:  Presentation of the raw data.  2.2.4 Step 4 – Analysis of the collected data and identification of key  findings  The project team started by producing a draft version of the report using inputs from steps 1 and  3. This report presented the results identified during the analysis of desktop research data and  the answers to the survey and the interviews conducted during step 3.  Once the draft report was formalised, it was presented to ENISA and iteratively refined during  collaborative workshops.  2.2.5 Step 5 – Final report preparation  This final version of the report was then prepared, presented, and validated by ENISA.  2.3 OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA & INFORMATION  AVAILABILITY  The identification of reliable and qualitative data was crucial throughout the study. For each  activity conducted during this study, namely the desktop research phase, the survey and the  complementary interviews, an overall assessment of the data and information availability was  conducted, and several assumptions were made.  During the desktop research and survey data collection phases, a large number of PSIRTs both  in the healthcare and energy sectors and outside of these sectors, and both in the Member  States and outside of them were identified so as to provide a wider understanding of the IR  ecosystem.  All national CSIRTs within the Member States were targeted, along with sectoral CSIRTs (both  within and outside the healthcare and energy sectors). Focus was also directed to a few  national sectoral CSIRTs when they could be identified.  Further information is presented in Appendix A: Presentation of the raw data.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  12  2.3.1 Desktop research – Data collection assessment  During the desktop research phase, data was collected mainly based on publicly available  information on CSIRT and PSIRT teams and activity presentation webpages, along with  information from third-party vulnerability management vendors’ presentations and a few other  literature sources.   The data collected during this phase was structured in a grid following the main  Service Areas details in FIRST’s PSIRT Framework (FIRST, 2020A).   The clarity and level of information available for each CSIRT or PSIRT was uneven  from one to another.   As anticipated, information on internal activities, structure, tools, and maturity was not  publicly available.   Information on procedures and processes followed by IR teams was rarely fully  detailed in publicly available documents.  2.3.2 Survey – Data collection assessment  29 respondents answered the survey:   22 CSIRTS/CERTs   7 PSIRTs  2.3.3 Interviews – Data collection assessment  Two additional interviews were conducted with sectoral PSIRTs that operate within or in close  connection with the healthcare and energy sectors. These PSIRTs were selected from among  those that had answered the survey.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  13  3. KEY FINDINGS  3.1 ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  3.1.1 Key finding #1 – PSIRT activities  Outside their IR Processes, PSIRTs’ activities and their involvement in product lifecycle  is heterogeneous.  Aside from their core IR responsibilities, PSIRTs may have other security related activities, such  as participation in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for their company’s products, or  providing security training for developers, for instance.  The survey and the interviews that we conducted highlighted differences in PSIRTs’  involvement in such activities related to company and team organisation, but also to the  mandate given to the PSIRT.  The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) outlines and divides the traditional software  development process into a few main phases.  Our survey included a focus on the PSIRTs’ involvement in the SDLC. In the survey,  participants were asked about their participation in the following phases:   Requirements   Design   Development   Testing   Release  PSIRTs appear to be globally involved in their company product’s SDLC, albeit unevenly.  Setting aside two respondents that declared that they do not take part in the SDLC, participation  in the testing and release phase is frequent, while participation in the earlier requirement,  design and implementation phases is less so.  Figure 2: PSIRT involvement in each phase of software life cycle according to our survey  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  14  The PSIRTs that reported not being involved in the SDLC in the survey gave details regarding  their answers during interviews:   In one case, though the PSIRT is sponsored by a product development team, as their  company products are strongly diversified, it would be impossible for the PSIRT team  members to be sufficiently knowledgeable about all product specifics in order to be  able to participate in the SDLC efficiently. Thus, they rely on security delegates  (Product Security Officers) within each product team.   In the other case, the PSIRT does not directly take part in the SDLC but is part of a  security competence centre that does.  3.1.2 Key finding #2 – Third-party vulnerability management platforms  The adoption of third-party vulnerability management platforms is uncommon. Those  who use one do so because it is easier to manage and improves visibility.  In recent years, a few commercial or non-commercial third-party vulnerability management  platforms have appeared on the market: Hacker One, Bug Crowd, Yes We Hack, BugHeist,  OpenBugBounty, etc.  These platforms generally offer various security related services such as penetration testing,  bug bounties and vulnerability disclosure programmes.  These services can be complementary to traditional PSIRT activities, especially regarding their  penetration testing offerings, but also as specific tools that can outsource part of the  vulnerability reporting process. In this case, vulnerability reports can be created by reporters  directly on these platforms which then relay the information to the PSIRT.  According to our desk research and survey, the adoption of these third-party platforms, at least  regarding their vulnerability disclosure programme services, is uncommon among European  PSIRTs.  Only one respondent to our survey declared using a third-party platform for their vulnerability  disclosure programme. They mention the ease of setup, the fact that there is no need to  administer the service and the external visibility induced by the presence on the platform as  motivation to do so.  During our interviews, when asked why they had not chosen to use a third-party platform,  PSIRTs declared that they were reluctant to have vulnerability information stored on external  platforms and preferred this information to stay within internal systems. Another factor  mentioned was the overall low number of vulnerabilities handled each year, meaning there is  little or no demand for the use of third-party platforms.  However, we note that the development of these platforms is still relatively new. As most  PSIRTs among our survey respondents were found to be 5+ years old, this might be a factor in  the relatively low adoption rate among our panel. This was confirmed during one of our  interviews: the PSIRT in question was created over 10 years ago, and these services were  either not available then or not as popular as they are nowadays.  3.1.3 Key finding #3 – KPIs  Measuring the efficiency of a PSIRT proves to be challenging, as most PSIRTs essentially  track it with the number of vulnerabilities reported and mitigated.  When it comes to measuring the efficiency of a PSIRT, the most common KPI seems to be the  number of vulnerabilities reported or remediated. Although these indicators seem suitable  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  15  considering the main mission of the PSIRT, the PSIRT does not have any influence on them.  Indeed, if no vulnerability is discovered or if a lot of them are reported to the team, in both  cases, we cannot assume that the PSIRT is efficient or not.  Additionally, few KPIs are taking IR time, the time to onboard stakeholders or the diversity of  stakeholders into account.  3.1.4 Key finding #4 – Skills  PSIRT members have both technical skills in product security areas and soft skills that  enable smoother exchanges and cooperation between all the stakeholders.  The scope covered by PSIRTs includes both technical and business aspects.  Figure 3: Specific desired skills in order to fulfil PSIRT functions  All PSIRTs interviewed reckon that good technical knowledge is a requirement, especially in  application security. It enables an accurate evaluation of reported vulnerabilities and a better  understanding of addressed topics. A good understanding of business is also needed as one  responsibility of their mission is to prioritise reported vulnerabilities. This would be especially  true in the context of an exponential surge in the number of reported vulnerabilities.  “PSIRT members require technical skills to judge whether a reported  vulnerability can be real and to judge whether the response of the business  side makes sense”  With the emergence of agility in product teams, some PSIRTs stated that DevOps and  DevSecOps are desired skills to fulfil their functions. It seems to be unrelated to the involvement  of PSIRT teams in the remediation of the incident as this skill is mentioned both by PSIRTs that  are directly involved in such processes and those who are not.  On the other hand, we observe a strong desire for business understanding. Given that PSIRTs  oversee the vulnerability remediation progress, they should be able to understand business  processes and matters in order to be efficient.  They also should be able to exchange with internal and external stakeholders. Beyond product  teams and developers, these stakeholders can be security researchers, legal teams, or  communication teams. In this case, communication skills at technical and business levels are  also necessary to understand and be understood by all these actors.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  16  3.2 COLLABORATION  3.2.1 Key finding #5 – Impact of NIS Directive  PSIRTs do not have specific procedures to address vulnerabilities affecting OES and the  NIS directive does not seem to have affected PSIRT activities much.  The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NISD) was adopted by the  European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016 (European  Commission, 2016). This Directive provides legal measures to boost the overall level of  cybersecurity in the EU.  It defines OES as private or public sector entities that play an important role in providing  healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial market infrastructure, digital infrastructure,  and water supply.  As part of the general IR landscape, PSIRTs may establish contact with OES either because  their parent company itself is an OES, or because the product they sell or the service their  company offers is provided to an OES.  None of the respondents to our survey say they have currently implemented specific procedures  to address vulnerabilities affecting OES, though two say they are still evaluating the impact of  the NIS Directive.  One of our interviewees declared not having specific OES procedures as they handle all  vulnerabilities on a case by case basis and thus did not feel that this would be needed.  Another interviewee raised concern regarding the impact of NIS on their activities. They belong  to an industrial company that makes parts for other vendors and though they do not have direct  OES clients, their products end up being used in other companies’ products and may thus be  used by OES. However, the PSIRT does not know how its products are used. Therefore, the  PSIRT cannot determine whether a vulnerability would affect an OES or not.  3.2.2 Key finding #6 – Collaboration between PSIRTs  PSIRTs collaborate one with each other, but their collaboration is hindered by the lack of  formalised communication and information exchange procedures/standards/framework.  Collaboration amongst IR teams is essential for the IR process efficacy and efficiency. It is also  important for them to communicate to forge a community of experts, thus enabling smooth  information exchange, knowledge-sharing and trust.  Regarding the collaboration between PSIRTs, our survey highlights the overall will from PSIRTs  to collaborate with each other.  Figure 4: Division of answers regarding the collaboration of PSIRTs with other PSIRTs  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  17  To establish contact, PSIRTs rely on existing security communities and sometimes attend  events hosted by organisations such as FIRST, or by coordinating through the CERT  Coordination Center or the Industrial Control Systems Joint Working Group, for instance.  However, PSIRTs may find that these events are perhaps not specific enough to their activities,  as one of our interviewees declared.  PSIRTs may also establish informal contacts directly with a few other selected PSIRTs. Once  contact is established, PSIRTs cited sharing information about:   Best practices   Tips and tricks   Tools   Process improvement ideas  It appears that the exchange of information regarding vulnerabilities is a more complex issue.  Indeed, two main matters were brought to our attention.  Firstly, the lack of commonly established standard procedures and protocols to securely  exchange information about vulnerabilities hinders collaboration, especially now that the sheer  volume of vulnerabilities makes manual and traditional sharing almost impossible:  “Some of our clients urged us to make our reports machine readable because  they do not have time to process that much data manually”  Secondly, sharing vulnerability information with competitors may only work if there is a strong  trust relationship that ensures that “sharing vulnerabilities won´t be used against us\", as one  PSIRT declared in our survey. During our interviews, this issue did not seem to be much of an  issue however and the security of both the product and users was put above these concerns.  3.2.3 Key finding #7 – Collaboration between PSIRTs and CSIRTs  Collaboration between PSIRTs and external CSIRTs (sectoral/national) is underdeveloped  because of difficulties in establishing contact and sharing sensitive information even  though CSIRTs are demanding more regular contact.  Similar to the collaboration between PSIRTs, collaboration between PSIRTs and external  CSIRTs is essential for the IR process efficacy and efficiency.  According to our survey, when PSIRTs and CSIRTs collaborate, they mostly exchange hot  topics, recently disclosed vulnerabilities, or the latest development ideas.  However, collaboration does not appear to be a completely widespread practice. Indeed, among  the PSIRTs and CSIRTs that answered our survey:   83% of the PSIRTs declared having contacts with CSIRTs   55% of the CSIRTs declared having contacts with PSIRTs  Figure 5: Division of answers regarding the collaboration between PSIRTs and CSIRTs  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  18  It appears that few CSIRTs, and especially national ones, had the opportunity to collaborate  with a PSIRT on IR. Those who did described their relationship as functional, but with room for  improvement.  This lower figure among CSIRTs may be nuanced by some of the answers that either mention  the complete absence or the relatively low number of PSIRTs in their country.  Similar to the previous Key Finding about the communication among PSIRTs, collaboration  between PSIRTs and CSIRTs is hindered by the lack of commonly established standard  procedures and protocols to securely exchange information. The ever-increasing volume of  information regarding vulnerabilities is becoming impossible to process with traditional manual  processes.  One of the PSIRTs we interviewed voiced their concern that, from their experience, CSIRTs do  not seem to fully consider hardware specifics during IR collaboration. Indeed, if a vulnerability  affecting a product’s hardware components is reported, it may take longer to find a fix and then  deploy it than for purely software related products, considering all the supply chain issues  associated with it (development, certification, production, delivery, physical access for patching,  etc.). This longer remediation period can possibly span multiple months and may require a  considerable effort (physically dispatching engineers to apply a patch, for instance), that may  not yet be quite considered by the traditional CSIRT IR processes.  3.2.4 Key finding #8 – PSIRT/CSIRT complementarity within a company  EU companies that run a PSIRT almost always have a CSIRT, but these are mostly  distinct in terms of budget, team members and scope. The collaboration between both  entities seems to be strong and efficient when needed.  PSIRT and CSIRT are two complementary yet distinct IR teams. They have specific approaches  and expertise, which is why, for the most part, they have different team members, tools, and  different sponsorship.  On the one hand, a CSIRT typically has a mandate for protecting the company’s internal  information system against threats. On the other hand, a PSIRT is typically more focused on the  security of the product developed in the structure. Its objective is to address vulnerabilities  affecting them and to ensure they are remediated in time. Some PSIRTs are directly involved in  the implementation of remediation, but it varies among structures as there is no clear definition  of the scope of PSIRTs’ missions.  The lack of a clear perimeter of the responsibilities has another consequence: it makes it difficult  for external stakeholders to get in contact with the right person. For example, a national CSIRT  reported that it is sometimes unclear if reports should be addressed to the support team, the  product team or the PSIRT.  “It might be confusing for external parties though, if there is no clear  publication of their respective missions”  Although the teams have a different scope, if a company has a PSIRT and a CSIRT, both  entities naturally share their knowledge and exchange information. They exchange reports  mostly about threat intelligence but may sometimes also organise joint conferences.  Regarding operational cooperation on incidents, they have very few occasions to work together  because their areas of expertise are different. A product vulnerability does seldom affect a  company's internal security, and vice-versa. However, when such an incident occurs,  interviewed teams describe their relationship as strong and efficient.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  19  3.3 DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  3.3.1 Key finding #9 – Sectoral distribution  PSIRTs are more common in the industry and digital sectors than in the healthcare and  energy sectors.  The initial focus of our desktop research was put on PSIRTs in the health and energy sectors.  Once it became evident that there was not a sufficiently significant number of PSIRTs in these  sectors, our research scope was broadened to include all sectors.  The lack of PSIRTs in the health and energy sectors could be explained by the fact that IT  companies are more exposed to security vulnerabilities due to the nature of their product, and  are consequently more likely to develop a dedicated structure and solution to handle these  incidents than health and energy ones, which tend to be users of these solutions.  Table 1: PSIRT sector repartition in our desktop research  Source attached to the  European Union  PSIRT sector Source count  YES  Industry 9  Digital 4  Health 1  NO  Digital 37  Industry 7  Health 2  Energy 2  Note that in some cases where the PSIRT’s company was operating in multiple sectors, we  selected the sector that appeared to be the most prevalent.  Most of the PSIRTs we found, especially outside the EU, were attached to a company either in  the digital sector (software vendors in particular) or the industry sector (equipment  manufacturers, for instance). We also identified a few CSIRTs that operate transversally in the  industry, healthcare, or energy sectors.  The relatively limited number of specific healthcare and energy PSIRTs in place can thus  perhaps be nuanced by the existence of PSIRTs in their industrial supplier companies.  3.3.2 Key finding #10 – PSIRT activities presentation  The presentation of PSIRTs’ service offering and activities is not standardised. This is a  source of difficulty for reporting vulnerabilities as no standard document references who  should be addressed, what evidence should be provided, or what communication tools  should be used.  Through the desktop research, we found that PSIRTs’ service offering is mainly presented  through a dedicated page on the website of their company. This presentation most commonly  includes information regarding:  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  20   The PSIRT charter containing a short description of the PSIRT mission, purpose, roles,  responsibilities, and services.   The channels available for the intake of vulnerabilities (a dedicated email address, a  specific web form, a dedicated tool, etc.).   A high-level overview of the vulnerability reporting process.   The type of vulnerability disclosure agreement that is followed.   Some form of hall of fame or acknowledgment for past vulnerability reporters.  We noticed a few of the PSIRTs that were analysed during the desktop research phase seemed  to follow or at least to have based their offer presentation on publicly available and open source  examples.  The presentation and the amount of information available about each PSIRT varies greatly,  however. For instance, we found that information regarding these key topics is rarely available:   General Service Level Agreement information (report acknowledgment delay, for  instance)   The amount of details expected to be included in a vulnerability report (description of  the vulnerability, reproduction steps, proofs, etc.)  If we look at CSIRTs, RFC 2350 (Brownlee & Guttman, 1998) provides guidelines on how to  present the IR activities of a CSIRT, along with a template that can be used for this purpose.  This document is structured in seven parts:   Document information   Contact information   Charter   Policies   Services   Incident reporting forms   Disclaimers  Our desk research did not highlight any PSIRTs that provided such a document.  As the vulnerability reporting process can differ from one PSIRT to another, the lack of a formal  and standardised document that presents the PSIRT’s activity could hinder the efficiency of the  reporting process and the overall visibility of a PSIRT.  3.3.3 Key finding #11 – PSIRT visibility  As PSIRTs emerge, their visibility remains low outside their company. Some of them  even lack visibility from internal stakeholders.  PSIRT are relatively new in the security vista and collaboration between them will be essential  for their development. Then, improving their visibility is necessary to create a relationship  among actors, resulting in a strong community and smoother exchanges.  As PSIRTs are more recent than CSIRTs, they do not have a community as wide as CSIRTs  do. To gain visibility in the IR domain, PSIRT teams often attend events hosted by other  communities, such as CSIRTs. However, such events are considered too big and not specific  enough by the teams we interviewed.  Nonetheless, from an external point of view, it is sometimes unclear whether a company runs a  PSIRT, and how to contact it. If some of them have a dedicated website with clear contact  details, others are never mentioned in a company’s documents. Furthermore, it appears that  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  21  some PSIRTs do not want to contact nor to be contacted by other PSIRTs or CSIRTs under the  belief that they do not need cooperation yet.  This issue of visibility is not just limited to external actors. It also exists within companies. When  there is no clear sponsorship for PSIRTs, other departments are sometimes unaware of the  existence of a PSIRT. Indeed, PSIRTs can report to their company’s Chief Technical Officer  (CTO), Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Product Security Officer (PSO), CSIRT  Manager or other Business functions depending on the company.  Figure 6: Sponsorship of PSIRTs  In one case, the CISO did not know of the existence of a PSIRT in their company even though it  was created some years ago, thus highlighting a flaw in the communication channel.  This is a real concern because, as one of the respondents notes:  “It is important for all parts of a company to know that a PSIRT exists.”  3.3.4 Key finding #12 – External guidance and support  Most PSIRTs did not ask or look for specific support or guidance from external  stakeholders to design and implement their team although they agree on the necessity  that ENISA/EU develop best practices, standards and harmonised certifications.  PSIRTs are relatively new in the cybersecurity vista. Most of the PSIRTs that responded to our  survey were 5+ years old and reckoned that, at the time they were created, there was no  guidance for this new kind of IR team. As a result, PSIRTs developed heterogeneously and  each company defined their own scope, procedures, and organisation.  As of today, there are few documents describing what is a PSIRT and how to build one. The  most known is the recently published PSIRT Service Framework published by the FIRST  organisation. It was first released as a draft in 2017 and the final version was published in 2020.  Most recent PSIRTs have relied on this framework to build themselves. They also got support  from the existing CSIRT and PSIRTs communities, professional associations, and industry  players.  Though few PSIRTs benefited from guidance, most of them wish for more guidance and a move  toward standardised communication and protocols to enhance information sharing and  exchanges.  Moreover, as some PSIRTs suggested, national entities could support teams to step into  international IR communities to benefit the community experience.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  22  4. RECOMMENDATIONS  PSIRTs and CSIRTs are essential players in the global IR ecosystem. Our recommendations  thus address PSIRT specifics but also wider security community considerations.  4.1 ORGANISATION, PROCESSES & TOOLS  4.1.1 Recommendation #1 – Security and Agility  More and more product teams are shifting to an agile approach for application development,  which reduces the duration of development cycles. They are mostly implementing DevOps,  which brings development and operational teams closer together.  This shift is a concern for security teams whose processes are not yet compatible with this new  organisation at scale. Traditional integration of security in projects does not fit these new  development methods easily, especially in a context of continuous delivery. As a result, security  teams can be quickly overloaded, and the number of vulnerabilities may increase.  Yet, from a security perspective, DevOps, and more specifically the automated pipelines, can  also be an opportunity to perform automatic security assessments. Security tools such as Static  Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) or Secret  Detection can detect most of the common vulnerabilities and flaws in developed applications.  Therefore, the security teams, including PSIRTs, should also be involved in these new  processes to promote the adoption of such security tools and to ensure processes are  controlled. This would reduce the number of reported vulnerabilities by “shifting security left”, i.e.  upstream in the development processes.  A long-term objective would be the integration of an Agile security Target Operating Model  (TOM) at scale, with the development of autonomous product teams fully aware of security  matters.  In the meantime, to improve application security, security teams could provide tools and  consumable services to support product teams and foster application security maturity. These  accelerators could be framed in a dedicated catalogue tailored for product teams and could  relieve overloaded security teams by raising developers’ awareness regarding application  security.  The content of the catalogue itself should mostly depend on the organisation stack and  available skills, but it may contain the following types of accelerators:   Support services, such as detaching a security expert in product teams. Their  objectives would be to raise developers’ awareness about application security and  ensure security issues are properly handled. It could be enriched with security audits,  training sessions, or penetration testing.   A list of security tools (SAST, DAST, Secret manager) which can be integrated in  pipelines, along with guidance and secure configuration templates to avoid security  flaws due to misuse.  To be relevant, the catalogue should take the current maturity level and team’s objectives into  account. It should be built upon an AppSec Maturity Model, for example the Software  Assurance Maturity Model (OWASP, 2009), and adapted to the specificities of each company.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  23  4.1.2 Recommendation #2 – Multidisciplinary team  PSIRTs should strive to build a multidisciplinary team composed of application and software  development experts with security training, and security experts with an application and  software development training.  The members of PSIRTs should have a good technical understanding of the security and  applicative issues at hand but also good soft skills to communicate effectively with all  stakeholders, whether internally or externally, and ensure smooth IR processing.  This would enable teams to be practical about the addressed vulnerabilities and avoid common  misunderstandings by having a broad vision of the issue. For example, due to the limited  computing power of some products, the security teams may not suggest strong encryption as  remediation given that it cannot be implemented.  4.2 COLLABORATION  4.2.1 Recommendation #3 – Standard vulnerability information  exchanges  Collaboration between IR teams is currently hindered by the lack of standardised procedures  and protocols to exchange information securely and automatically about vulnerabilities.  To facilitate the sharing of disclosed vulnerability information, and considering the ever-  increasing volume of vulnerabilities, a machine-readable standard should be promoted to  automate this process.  Some companies are already working on such a standard. It would enable security teams to  automatically filter relevant vulnerabilities that could affect their products or information systems.  Naturally, given the sensitive nature of the information, these exchanges should rely on a  secure communication channel.  Besides, ENISA agrees with the NIS 2 proposal to “establish a vulnerability registry where, OES  and their suppliers […] may, on a voluntary basis, disclose vulnerabilities and provide the  vulnerability information that allows users to take appropriate mitigating measures” (European  Commission, 2020). Although such databases already exist, ENISA recalls that they are hosted  and maintained by entities that are not established in the EU. This registry would be a  centralised source of information and help users to take appropriate mitigating measures.  4.2.2 Recommendation #4 – Communication between PSIRTs and OES  The NIS Directive does not appear to have had an impact on PSIRT activities yet. However,  there needs to be a stronger link between OES and PSIRTs in terms of information exchange  quality, fluidity, and transparency.  On the matter that PSIRTs may not know whether their products are used by OES, it could be  more efficient to build and implement a legal and technical framework that would allow OES to  receive vulnerability information from vendor PSIRTs, possibly in advance of their official  disclosure, so as to mitigate their impact.  For better coordination between actors, especially on vulnerability disclosure, the NIS 2 directive  stipulates that Member States should designate a CSIRT to take the role of a coordinator. When  vulnerabilities affect multiple organisations, it should identify and contact concerned entities  (including PSIRTs), support reporting entities and negotiate disclosure timelines.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  24  Finally, given the prevalence of incidents where entities have fallen victim to cyber-attacks by  exploiting vulnerabilities affecting third party products and services, they should therefore  assess and take into account the overall quality of products and cybersecurity practices of their  suppliers and service providers. A supplementary recommendation would be to check whether  actors in the supply chain have a PSIRT and, in this case, to cooperate with them on a regular  basis.  4.2.3 Recommendation #5 – PSIRT community events  Collaboration and communication among PSIRTs, between PSIRTs and CSIRTs and more  generally in the global IR ecosystem are essential to IR efficacy and efficiency.  To foster links between PSIRTs and develop the overarching community, regular events  dedicated to PSIRTs could be hosted either through a centralised initiative, or at the initiative of  a small group a PSIRTs, at the national or the EU level. These events could even have a  sectorial focus if appropriate.  Such events could also be encouraged worldwide to develop a wider community and to account  for the increasingly global information security issues.  4.3 DEVELOPMENT & VISIBILITY  4.3.1 Recommendation #6 – ENISA guidance  The PSIRT ecosystem is growing in the EU and worldwide. PSIRTs, both emerging and well-  established, are eager to have more guidance and support from ENISA.  These could come in the form of guidelines, general security recommendations, and more  globally a high-level cooperation framework intended to help develop best practices and  improve exchanges among PSIRTs and other IR teams within the EU Member States.  4.3.2 Recommendation #7 – PSIRT presentation standardisation  PSIRTs’ service offering and activities presentation for external stakeholders is not  standardised. This is a source of difficulty when reporting vulnerabilities as no standard  document references who should be addressed, what evidence should be provided, or what  communication tools should be used.  The use of a presentation standard, like the one defined in RFC 2350, may help improve the  understandability of the offer, the visibility of the PSIRT team and facilitate the vulnerability  reporting process. This document could be largely based on the template defined in RFC 2350,  and should be regularly maintained to ensure it is up to date.  4.3.3 Recommendation #8 – PSIRT directory  Team visibility is a prerequisite to receiving vulnerability reports from external stakeholders, but  also an enabler for communication with other teams. To facilitate communication and  collaboration with external stakeholders, be they reporters or other IR teams, PSIRTs should be  encouraged to register their team and contact information on a specialised directory.  4.3.4 Recommendation #9 – Reputation & recognition  Reputation and recognition from both internal and external stakeholders are key success factors  for IR teams.  IR teams should strive to improve their external visibility to facilitate and develop their  vulnerability reporting process. This could be achieved through communication with clients or a  stronger involvement in the IR community.  PSIRT EXPERTISE AND CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT  June 2021  25  IR teams’ internal visibility should also be a main objective, as it allows for better cooperation  with internal stakeholders (Product teams, Legal, Communication, Customer Support, etc.) and  ensures a smooth response to vulnerability reports and incidents. One way of achieving better  visibility could be for PSIRTs to develop stronger links with their company’s PSO and CISO,  through sponsorship or day-to-day cooperation.

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the Sectoral CSIRT and PSIRT capabilities status and development within the Energy and Health sectors as specified within the NIS directive. A desk research has been conducted, followed by a survey which was answered by 7 PSIRTs and 22 CSIRTs dispatched in 18 EU Member States. The relatively low number of PSIRTs, especially with a scope limited to the Energy and Health sectors, led us to include more CSIRTs, and more sectors in the study. The findings and recommendations still apply to the Energy and Health sectors, but also offer a wider view of the products vulnerability management landscape. As a result, 12 key findings were identified, and 9 recommendations are proposed."

In addition, it provides conclusions and recommendations on improvements that can be made on current  taxonomies.  The methodology followed to collect and assess the information for this study included a stock taking and desk  research, discussions with CSIRTs during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop, interviews with the CSIRT community, a  qualitative assessment of taxonomies (and other formats and schemes relevant to mention) and a validation call  with CSIRTs on 22 September 2016.  A qualitative assessment was performed on an indicative taxonomy landscape, which illustrates various ways of  comparing and assessing taxonomies to determine, for instance, what fields that could be added or extended in  current taxonomies.  In addition, use cases that would benefit from the use of taxonomies have been identified. These use cases include;  recording events from different sources, automatic deduplication, ability to export in other taxonomies, ability to  aggregate and search events in the data, ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs, feeding threat intelligence,  incident report management. For each use case a requirement was identified that a taxonomy should fulfil. An  indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case is also provided both for threat intelligence and incident  management purposes.  Since a comparison of every single taxonomy is not feasible, a couple of indicative examples of comparing  taxonomies are provided. This includes an indicative comparison of fields of taxonomies similar to or based on the  eCSIRT taxonomy 1to determine which fields are common. In addition, a comparison of the complexity of taxonomies  in terms of malware incidents is provided to illustrate different ways of describing the same context available in the  current taxonomy landscape.  Furthermore, a number of good practices that have been identified by various CSIRTs during this study are described  while taking into account shortcomings of taxonomies as identified by CSIRTs. The most relevant good practices  include (a) that the top level categorisation of a taxonomy should be simple, (b) the categories within a taxonomy  should be mutually exclusive, (c) taxonomies should support performance measurement and (d) that taxonomies  should have an appropriate of level of ease of use. In addition, the report describes which good practices of high and  medium relevance apply to which use cases according to the CSIRTs that have been involved in this study.  Three case studies illustrate the use of taxonomies in CSIRT operational activities while taking into account the use  cases established in this study. These include a case study on using taxonomies for a website for major NIS incidents  occurring across the EU for the public, using taxonomies to minimise the re-categorisation of cyber incidents and  using taxonomies for incident handling metrics.  A number of conclusions were reached as a result of this study that should be taken into account in any future work  to be performed by CSIRTs. The following are the most relevant to mention.   There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies. Clear definitions  reflecting the operational interpretation of the CSIRTs should be considered as a key success factor towards  increasing cooperation between EU Member States. To this end, sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 reflect some of  the discussions held on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies with CSIRTs throughout this study.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/community-projects/existing-taxonomies  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  06  These sections have been added as food for thought and as possible point of departure for future work to  be performed by CSIRTs.   Taxonomies currently lack terms to properly handle the impact of an incident, incidents with no malice  intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation between  intrusion attempts and intrusions.   The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies are based on the complexity,  contextual information, mutual exclusivity or ambiguity, performance measurement, impact, sensitivity,  confidentiality, and purpose of taxonomies.  The following recommendations based on CSIRT input and the good practices are provided:   A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be set up by  ENISA. This would be a great benefit to the CSIRTs community as it would not only allow the selection of  appropriate taxonomies for specific use cases, but it may also provide a general overview of what  taxonomies or variations thereof are used by CSIRTs, which may be particularly useful in keeping statistics.   A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should be agreed upon by CSIRTs at the EU level.  This would provide examples of taxonomies based on the requirements of the CSIRTs network, which can  be either implemented or used to implement a modified version of the taxonomy, saving time and effort  that would be spent into researching taxonomies.   An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the owners of taxonomies as an indicator to revise  taxonomies, if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same type. For example,  in a case involving ransomware, it is relevant that it should be categorised ransomware, but also the type of  ransomware (such as crypto locker, etc.), if the same tag repeatedly used then it might also indicate the  need for a new field.   A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be established at the  EU level by the CSIRTs network. Such a roadmap should at least consider having CSIRTs agree use cases,  definitions and concepts from an operational point of view for each use case; perform quantitative  assessment (in addition to the qualitative assessment in this study) on the taxonomies used, a centralised  repository for taxonomies, and a list of tags/values that can apply across taxonomies.  Finally, this document provides statistical data about taxonomy usage in a real Malware Information Sharing  Platform (MISP) instance maintained by CIRCL. It allows the collection of statistical conclusions such as the relevance  of the terms used by CSIRTs during day-to-day incident handling. While these statistics are composed of data from  only one community, meaning they may not be representative of all CSIRTs, they illustrate the applicability of some  of the conclusions made in this study.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  Purpose  The main objective of this report is to provide relevant good practices in terms of taxonomies for incident detection  and prevention for the CSIRT community. Additionally, it aims to provide conclusions and recommendations based  on the qualitative assessment of taxonomies within the current taxonomy landscape on improvements that can be  made on current taxonomies, such as what fields can be extended or added to existing taxonomies.  Key Concepts and Definitions  It is important to highlight that the following terms have been used in different ways in various studies: ”information  exchange standard”, “ontology”, “taxonomy”, “data type”, “data/field format standard”, “data/Field representation  format”, “classification”, “semantic vocabulary”, “field” and “knowledge map”. In addition, based on feedback  received by various CSIRTs during this study, it seems that there is no clear consensus on the exact interpretation of  each one of these terms in the operational environment. Therefore, although the title and main focus of this report  is on “taxonomies” used in incident detection and prevention, the reader is invited to consider the term “taxonomy”  and other directly and indirectly related terms as something that is to be further discussed and agreed by the CSIRT  community. However, chapter 8.1 does provide the reader with some preliminary insights on the above mentioned  concepts gathered during this study that could serve as a possible basis for further work to be conducted in line with  recommendation 1 “A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be  set up”. It is worth mentioning that the definition of “taxonomy” in previous ENISA studies is as follows:  A taxonomy2 is defined as a classification of terms. Three characteristics define a taxonomy:   a form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship these  things have to each other;   a semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets; and   a knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge domain  covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to navigate.  In addition to this definition, according to some CSIRTs a taxonomy exposes inheritance and differentiation:   Inheritance: Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other;   Differentiation: Characteristics of an object, which allow to differentiate an object from another object.  For example, in case of malware you can have the category “malware” with the related characteristics  “downloaders”, “rootkits”.  In addition, according to some CSIRTs, a taxonomy can be considered to be 2- or 3-dimensional. For example, TLP is  an example of a 2-dimensional taxonomy while the classification of malware is usually 3-dimensional as it tends to  have a “namespace” a “predicate” and a “value” (for example, SANS Malware Classification: malware type= value).  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  08  2. Methodology  This chapter outlines the methodology applied to collect and assess the information for this study, including:   Stocktaking and desk research;   Discussions with CSIRTs during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop;   Interviews with the CSIRT community;   A qualitative assessment of taxonomies;   A validation call with CSIRTs on 22 September 2016.  Stocktaking and desktop research  The objective of the stocktaking and desktop research was to identify the relevant taxonomies and relevant studies  for this study. In addition, the findings of the following ENISA reports were taken into account: “Actionable  information for Security Incident Response”3; “Standards and tools used in exchange & processing of actionable  information”4; “Detect, Share and Protect”5; “Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and  Law Enforcement”6.  Discussions with CSIRTs during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop  The 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop took place on 10 & 11 May 2016 in Riga, Latvia. On 11 May 2016, the study team  organised a half-day workshop to discuss the following topics with the CSIRTs for the benefit of this study:   Current taxonomies used for incident detection and prevention within CSIRTs;   Use cases describing the context in which the taxonomies are used;   Current gaps vs. good practices related to the current taxonomies.  Interviews with the CSIRT community  Interviews were conducted with 15 CSIRTs to gain operational information related to the use of taxonomies. The key  notions that were investigated are the following:   Type of operational activities performed by CSIRTs that could benefit from the use of taxonomies;   For what purposes CSIRTs use taxonomies; which of them are easy to use, what are the associated benefits,  etc;   Good practices as regards taxonomy use, creation, or revision.  Qualitative assessment and comparison of the collected taxonomies  A qualitative assessment was performed to evaluate the type and number of fields/terms, structure of taxonomies  and to initiate the good practice guide on taxonomies used in incident detection and prevention.  A validation call with CSIRTs on 28 September 2016  A call was organised with various CSIRTs to validate the main outcomes of this study including its conclusions and  recommendations.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/actionable-information-for-security  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/detect-share-protect-solutions-for-improving-threat-data-exchange-among-certs  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/actionable-information-for-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/detect-share-protect-solutions-for-improving-threat-data-exchange-among-certs https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  09  3. Qualitative assessment of taxonomies used by CSIRTs  This chapter presents the qualitative assessment of taxonomies (and other relevant formats and schemes)  performed on an indicative taxonomy landscape. It illustrates various ways of comparing and assessing taxonomies  to determine things such as common fields shared by taxonomies and what type of fields/terms that could be added  or extended in current taxonomies.

For each use case a  requirement was identified that a taxonomy should fulfil. This linking takes into account the various attributes of a  taxonomy (such as complexity, size, etc. defined below), and insures that the taxonomies selected can adequately  meet the requirements of the use cases.  3.2.1 Use cases and use case requirements  A use case is a list of actions or event steps, typically defining the interactions between a role and a system, to  achieve a goal. In this case, “the system” would consists of the taxonomy and/or an exchange platform. The “goal”  could for example relate to either incident detection or incident prevention.  In use case UC.TI.101 - Recording events from different sources, the goal is to adequately record events with the  applicable system using a taxonomy, where recording the events is the action.  From the use cases, requirements are created in terms of what a taxonomy should provide to fulfil the task or activity  at hand. This is performed because setting requirements in line with the overall goal of the use cases aids in the  identification of which taxonomy that is the most appropriate. The requirements depend on the nature of the data  in question. The requirements in day-to-day operational activities may differ entirely from those set out in the table  below, they are not meant to represent a concrete example, but merely a suggestion of the type of requirement and  qualities of taxonomies that would be suitable for a given situation. The use cases in the table below are based on  interviews with the CSIRT community and research24 conducted on use cases related to incident detection and  prevention specifically for CSIRTs. The use cases employ the following naming convention:   The prefix UC refers to Use Case;   TI and IM after the prefix refer to Threat Intelligence and Incident Management respectively;   0XX and 1XX after represent whether the use case is based on interviews with the CSIRT community (marked  with a 1), or on research (marked with a 0). XX represents the unique identifier of the use case.  The title of the use cases is also representative of the defined goal of the use case. This is followed by a brief  description of the use cases in terms of CSIRT activity and the corresponding requirement that needs to be fulfilled  by the taxonomy:  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/community-projects/existing-taxonomies  22 https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/malware-101-viruses-32848  23 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/meeting39/20130523-DV1.pdf  24 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=14253  information will be entered into the Incident Tracking System (ITS) when  a case is created  Hungarian Taxonomy21 Taxonomy describing who reported an incident.

More terms and complexity. To adequately account  for the varying terminology that different sources of  information may present, a more advanced taxonomy  in terms of semantic vocabulary and number of terms  may be preferable .  UC.TI.002 Automatic  deduplication  Whenever new event, vulnerability, or threat  information is received by the system after a  sharing process by another CSIRT, the system  should be able to recognize whether the  received information has already been ingested  or not.  Maximise mutual exclusivity. The deduplication  process (either by general or specific automatic  “server-side” deduplication of even information) may  be affected by the number of terms and the mutual  exclusivity of them. If there are many terms in a  taxonomy, but they are not overly mutually exclusive,  then an identical incident may be recorded under a  different category, causing a duplicate to remain. This  of course depends on the duplication process itself as  well.  UC.TI.003 Ability to export  in other taxonomies  A CSIRT team member should be able to require  event, vulnerability, or threat information to be  exported in structured and open formats  provided by the platform (e.g. OpenIoC, STIX or  TAXII, and CVE or CVRF, if these specifications  are supported).  High complexity, high number of terms, but simple  top level categories preferable. Exporting in other  taxonomies is affected by the complexity and number  of terms that are being exported from and exported  to. Exporting in a more complex taxonomy requires  more effort than exporting in a simple taxonomy, but  causes less loss of information and context overall.  UC.TI.104 Ability to  aggregate and search  events in the data  A CSIRT team member should be able to  aggregate events using appropriate terms to  classify the event elements, and should also be  able to search those events effectively.  Multiple levels of categories with simple top-level  categories. For aggregation and search of events in  data. It should be simpler to use a taxonomy with  multiple levels of categorisation, as it would speed up  the aggregation and searching of the event.  Furthermore, top-level categories should be simpler  and not numerous, to facilitate the aggregation and  searching process.  UC.TI.105 Ability to  exchange data with other  CSIRTs  A CSIRT team member should, when required, be  able to effectively exchange information with  another CSIRT conveying information accurately  and with no loss of information. Potentially being  able to map taxonomies to enable the  information transfer.  High number of terms and high complexity. It would  be preferable to maximize the information exchange;  as such using a complex taxonomy with larger amount  of terms allows more specific and contextual  information to be exchanged.  3.2.1.2 Linking use cases and use case requirement for incident management  ID AND TITLE DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT  UC.IM.006 Feeding threat  intelligence  A CSIRT team member (i.e. CSIRT incident  handler) indicates an incident as solved or is in  the ongoing process of being solved. The system  should extract information from the incident,  structure that information in a threat format  supported by the system (e.g. STIX) and feed the  threat intelligence platform.  High number of terms and high complexity. To  ensure that the full incident information is available  upon requirement, a maximum amount of  information should be provided. As such using a  taxonomy with high complexity and number of terms  may be appropriate.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  12  ID AND TITLE DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT  UC.IM.007 Incident report  management  A CSIRT team member (i.e. CSIRT incident  handler) should be able to access automatically  generated incident reports and define new  reports (to enable automatic generation) by  specifying properties, such as, but not limited to,  scope, type of incident, priority, time (daily,  weekly, etc.); and visualization (graphs, trends,  or maps).  Low number of terms and low complexity. The target  audience of the report dictates the requirement of  the taxonomy. If the report is to management or none  technical personnel, then the taxonomy should reflect  that by using simple and general terms, whereas if it  is a technical report, the complexity of the taxonomy  should reflect that.  Table 1 - Table of use case as defined by previous research and input from the CSIRT community.  3.2.2 Indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case  To facilitate the linking of the taxonomies to the appropriate use case, the taxonomies are chosen from a reduced  taxonomy pool in the table below. The criteria for the reduced pool is to maximise the variation in taxonomy type  and format. The relevant taxonomies are listed and then categorised as either technical or general. In the table  below, “technical” in the second column refers to whether the taxonomy utilises technical terms that may not be  understood by all audiences. While terms such as “virus” or “worm” are generally understood, some others such as  “XSS” or “CRFS” may not be. As some taxonomies contain both general and technical terms, if a taxonomy contains  many technical terms it will be categorised as technical. The “size of the semantic vocabulary”, in the third column,  is defined in relation to the overall size using eCSIRT.net MkII as a baseline due to its popularity in the CSIRT  community. “Overall complexity” is defined based on the “technical or general” and the number of terms of the  taxonomy.

The table below takes the use cases previously defined in this section and takes into account the taxonomy attributes  defined in the previous table. For each use case and goal, an appropriate taxonomy is selected.  3.2.2.1 Indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case for Threat Intelligence  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  UC.TI.101  Recording  events from  different  sources  Veris Veris provides a comprehensive list of both technical and non-technical terms that are general  enough to record a number of events. This enables effective recording from different sources.  FIRST CSIRT Case  Classification  FIRST CSIRT Case Classification Also is technical enough to gain an understanding of the  transpired event, but it is not restrictive enough to cause loss of meaning. This allows the  recording of events from different sources on a higher level effectively.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  13  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  ENISA Taxonomy The ENISA taxonomy provides a wide range of different incident types. As such, it would be  well suited to handle an incident from various sources. Aspects covered by the taxonomy  include, but are not limited to eavesdropping, interception, hijacking, nefarious activity or  abuse, etc. This allows the handling of event information regardless of whether it originated  from a honeypot, sinkhole, etc.  UC.TI.002  Automatic  deduplication  CERT.pt CERT.pt is low in complexity and general in its terms. This does however mean that each  concept represented in the terms is often mutually exclusive. As this taxonomy has two levels  of categorisation, it further enables mutual exclusivity, which helps in the deduplication  process by avoiding scenarios where the same incident is present more than once due to a  different categorisation.  CCN-STIC 817 CCN-STIC 817 uses a comprehensive list of incident types. The taxonomy also covers a  relatively wide aspect including more technical terms and general terms (“XSS” versus “Human  Error”).  UC.TI.003  Ability to export  in other  taxonomies  Veris Veris contains a large number of terms that can be used to maximise the information  transferred with minimal loss of context. Exporting into other taxonomies is more effective  when a larger set of terms, as it avoids miss-categorisation.  UC.TI.104  Ability to  aggregate and  search events in  the data  CCN-STIC 817 Due to CCN-STIC 817 having multiple levels of categorisation, the aggregation and search can  be performed on the different levels. The top-level categories provided by this taxonomy also  allow to search by action or target, making it particularly useful in searching of event  information. For example, making a search on the result of an incident to map what incidents  have similar outcomes and consequences.  CIRCL CIRCL provides a small number of general terms, as such it makes the process of aggregating  and searching data simpler.  eCSIRT.net MkII eCSIRT.net MkII has multiple levels of categorisation, allowing for effective aggregation and  searching of terms. I.e. events can be aggregated and search using the top-level categorisation,  and the next level down of categorisation can be used to refine the aggregation and search.  UC.TI.105  Ability to  exchange data  with other  CSIRTs  eCSIRT.net MkII Depending on the main type of information exchanged, the eCSIRT.net MkII taxonomy  provides a general semantic vocabulary that could facilitate the sharing of threat information  between CSIRTs.  Veris Veris is the taxonomy used to collect the data volunteered by various CSIRTs for the yearly  Verizon reports. As such, it is tried and tested to work with exchanging data effectively with  other CSIRTs. It contains a great number of technical terms, effectively providing a  comprehensive picture of an incident.  3.2.2.2 Indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case for Incident Management  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  UC.IM.006 Feeding threat  intelligence  Veris  Veris provides an extensive vocabulary, which provides a very comprehensive list of  terms.  UC.IM.007 Incident report  management  eCSIRT.net MkII  This taxonomy provides simple and comprehensible terms that can be used effectively  for a non-technical environment. Additionally, it provides a multi-level categorisation,  where it is possible to abstract to the top-level should the bottom level be too  technical. It allows for use in a more technical environment, as the bottom level  categorisation contains more detail than the top level.  For example, if there was a phishing incident that is registered by a CSIRT, it could be  described “Abusive Content -> SPAM”, “Fraud -> Phishing”.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  14  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  CCN-STIC 817  CCN-STIC 817 provides a comprehensive map of terms and a simple top-level category  that can be used to provide different levels of technicality when reporting requires it.  Table 3 - Table linking the taxonomies to specific use cases based on established requirements and metrics  Example comparison of related taxonomies to evaluate common terms  This section provides two examples of comparing related taxonomies:   Comparison of fields of taxonomies similar to or based on the eCSIRT taxonomy to determine which fields  are common;   Comparision of complexity of taxonomies in terms of malware incidents to illustrate different ways of  describing the same context available in the current taxonomy landscape.  Note that comparing every single taxonomy is not feasible as some taxonomies are too different to make comparison  possible (for instance, comparing TLP to Veris). In this respect, an example of a comparison between different  versions of the eCSIRT.net taxonomy is also provided.  3.3.1 Example of comparison of fields of taxonomies similar to or based on the eCSIRT taxonomy  Common fields shared among taxonomies can be determined by comparing fields of popular taxonomies. This  comparison can also illustrate any new fields that can be added to existing taxonomies, as well as extending current  fields according to the needs of the CSIRT community in order to enhance taxonomies.  The following four taxonomies are similar in the sense that they are either used by eCSIRT or part of it as the basis  for the taxonomy:  CERT.PT CERT.BE CESNET CERT ECSIRT.NET MKII  Malware Spam Spam Spam  Botnet Drone Abusive Content Bounce Harassment  Ransomware Malware Virus Child/Sexual/Violence/…  Malware Configuration Scan Malware Virus  C&C  System/Account  Compromised  Trojan Trojan  DDoS (D)DoS Malware Spyware  Scanner Phishing Probe Dialler  Exploit Vulnerability Report Crack Rootkit  Brute-force Other Botnet Scanning  IDS alert  Dos Sniffing  Defacement  Copyright Social Engineering  Compromised  Scam  Exploiting of known  Vulnerabilities  Backdoor  Phishing Login attempts  Drop zone  Pharming New attack signature  Phishing  Other  Privileged Account  Compromise  SPAM  Unknown  Unprivileged Account  Compromise  Vulnerability  Application Compromise  Service  Bot  Other  DoS  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  15  DDoS  Sabotage  It is worth noting that a term from the bottom level category of one taxonomy may be a top category in another  taxonomy. This is the case for “Abusive Content” in CERT.be, which is present as a top-level category in the  eCSIRT.net.  The Venn diagram below displays the terms present in all of the above taxonomies.  Illustrating the fields shared  amongst these taxonomies, each of the ovals contain the terms of the taxonomy, each intersection in the ovals  illustrates that a term, an equivalent term, or similar term are present in multiple taxonomies (such as the term  “Spam” being contained in all the taxonomies below). Where the wording of the term is different, but the context is  similar or the same in different taxonomies, they are grouped in squares.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  16  Figure 1 - Venn diagram comparing the terms of the eCSIRT.net MkII, CERT.pt, CERT.be, and CESNET Cert  taxonomies. Similar concepts with different wording are grouped in squares.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  17  Based on the Venn diagram above the following observations are made:   The most common fields (present in all four taxonomies) shared by the taxonomies are “DDoS”, “Spam”,  “Phishing”, “Malware”, terms for vulnerabilities, “Scan”, and “Other”;   Some of the terms are worded differently or describe different aspects (such as action, process, or entity).  For example, “Scan”, “Scanner”, and “Scanning” represent a similar concept but are worded differently and  do not refer to the concept in the same manner;   CERT.pt is the only taxonomy to mention “Ransomware”, which has been a rapidly growing threat25. As the  likelihood of ransomware is increasing, and the high impact it causes it could be considered as a term to add.  3.3.2 Example of comparing complexity of taxonomies in terms of malware  While many taxonomies describe malware, the level of detail of malware varies among them. To have a clear view  of the difference in the level of detail, the table represents the fields of the taxonomies (for the Veris taxonomy,  only the appropriate category is displayed due to its relatively high number of terms). This comparison allows  conclusions to be drawn, as all of these taxonomies cover the concept of malware somehow, the way in which they  are represented differ. The compared taxonomies are CIRCLE, CERT.pt, SANS, and Veris:  CIRCL CERT.PT26 SANS VERIS  Spam  Malicious  Code  Malware  Malware  Categories  Virus  ACTION  MALWARE  VARIETY  Adware  System  Compromise  Botnet Drone Worm Backdoor  Scan Ransomware Trojan Brute Force  Denial of  service  Malware  Configuration  Ransomware  Capture App  Data  Copyright  Issues  C&C Rootkit  Capture  Stored Data  Phishing Availability DDoS Downloader  Client-Side  Attack  Malware  Information  Gathering  Scanner Adware Click Fraud  XSS  Intrusion  Attempts  Exploit Spyware C2  Vulnerability Brute-force  Obfuscation  categorisation  No-obfuscation Destroy Data  Fastflux IDS Alert Encryption  Disable  Controls  SQL  Injection  Intrusion  Defacement Oligomorphism DoS  Information  Leak  Compromised Metamorphism Downloader  Scam Backdoor Stealth  Exploit  Vulnerability  Information  Content  Security  Dropzone Armouring Export Data  Fraud Phishing Tunnelling  Packet  Sniffer  Abusive  Content  SPAM Retro  Password  Dumper  25 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/report-organizations-must-respond-increasing-threat-ransomware  26 http://www.cncs.gov.pt/cert-pt-2/documents-2/index.html  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/report-organizations-must-respond-increasing-threat-ransomware http://www.cncs.gov.pt/cert-pt-2/documents-2/index.html  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  18  CIRCL CERT.PT26 SANS VERIS  Vulnerable  Vulnerability  Service  Payload  Categorisation  No Payload Ram Scraper  Other Other  Non- Destructive  Payload  Ransomware  Droppers Rootkit  Memory  Categorisation  Resident  Scan  Network  Temporary  Resident  Spam  Swapping  Mode  Spyware /  Keylogger  Non-Resident SQL Injection  Swapping  Mode  Adminware  User Process Worm  Kernel process Unknown  Table 4 - Comparison of possible ways to represent malware with a taxonomy.  From the example above, a number of observations that can be made regarding the difference between taxonomy  fields, especially those concerning the same or a similar concept. The following observations include:  •CIRCL has the most general semantic vocabulary. Malware incidents or events involving malware that  lead to an incident are categorised as malware. This has some benefits in situations where the use of high  level terms is appropriate (reporting, for example).  CIRCL  •Provides the most comprehensive information regarding malware, not only categorising into malware  types (e.g. worm), as well as obfuscation techniques, payload, and memory categorisation in the  taxonomy. In other words, the SANS malware categorisation taxonomy not only classifies malware, but  also its evasion and operation mechanics. In terms of use cases, SANS is technically orientated, meaning it  is well suited for technical reports or personnel, but less well suited for general use.  •It is possible SANS can give more insight into new detailed trends of attack methodologies, which might  not be clear from the other taxonomies. This is because SANS describes the malware itself, whereas Veris  describes the action of the malware.  SANS  • Veris has the most comprehensive list of terms (of the compared taxonomies). There is a distinction  between malware and hacking, but also with each respective distinction being split into variety and  vector. This taxonomy classifies the malware according to what the malware is or does, but also includes  terms to classify propagation (I.e. the threat vector, not shown in the table).  Veris  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  19  3.3.2.1 Contextual differences between similar terms  There is a distinction in the context of the terms in the above example. While semantically the terms “Malware”,  “Malicious Code”, “Malware Category”, and “Malware Variety” are similar, their respective sub-categories can be  divided into two distinct concepts for this specific example:   The action that caused the incident or event - such as “Destroy data” or “SQL Injection”;   The element that made the action that cause the incident or event - “Virus” or “Worm”.  It is also important to consider that in both SANS and Veris the field named “Worm” exists, although the terms are  identical, they are contextually different. This is because SANS describes the malware itself, whereas Veris describes  the action of the malware. While both aspects are important to know, this may also lead to misunderstandings or  different understandings of terms.  3.3.3 Example of a comparison between different versions of the eCSIRT.net taxonomy  This section compares the eCSIRT.net dating from 2003 with the eCSIRT.net MkII27. The following tables illustrate  the additions of the eCSIRT taxonomy upon upgrading it. It contains the incident classes present (the top-level  category), and the incident types from the 2003 version and the incident example from the 2013 version. The  following are incident classes and their sub- categories, which have not had their terms updated or changed:  New terms or modifications are additionally highlighted in bold.  INCIDENT CLASS INCIDENT TYPE (2003) INCIDENT EXAMPLE (2013)  Intrusions  Privileged Account Compromise Privileged Account Compromise  Unprivileged Account  Compromise  Unprivileged Account  Compromise  Application Compromise Application Compromise  Bot  Availability  DoS DoS  DDoS DDoS  Sabotage Sabotage  Outage (no malice)  Fraud  Unauthorized use of resources Unauthorized use of resources  Copyright Copyright  Masquerade  27 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/meeting39/20130523-DV1.pdf  Abusive Content  Spam  Harassment  Child/sexual/ violence/…  Malicious Code  Virus  Worm  Trojan  Spyware  Information  Gathering  Scanning  Sniffing  Social  engineering  Intrusion Attempts  Exploitation of  known  vulnerabilities  Login attempts  New signature  Information  Security  Unauthorised  access to  information  Unauthorised  modification of  information  https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/meeting39/20130523-DV1.pdf  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  20  INCIDENT CLASS INCIDENT TYPE (2003) INCIDENT EXAMPLE (2013)  Phishing  Vulnerable  Open for abuse  Other  All incidents which don’t fit in one of the  given categories should be put into this  class  Test  Meant for testing  Table 5 - Comparison of modified categories eCSIRT.net and eCSIRT.net Mk II with additions in bold.  The following observations were made from the above comparison:   This is good example of a taxonomy which explicitly separates the concepts between an intrusion attempt  and a successful one, which can provide useful information in incident analysis;   Terms have been added to account for new threats (i.e. such as “Phishing”);   A category has been added to also keep track of vulnerabilities, this is useful as it is a concept CSIRTs often  need to contend with;   The “Other” category allows the categorisation of any incident or event that was not accounted for. The  major advantage of this category is that if there is an influx of incidents of a similar (new) nature, it can be  used as a point of consideration to revise the taxonomy and account for it. It is also often used for things  that are not incidents or events, such as conference requests, job requests, press, etc.;   The addition of the term of “Outage (no malice)”, allows the taxonomy to cover a broader scope of incidents;   The addition of the term “Bot” is also relevant as it has become a greater and more frequent threat. It may  also be worth considering other more modern terms for all taxonomies to be up to date with the most  current threat landscape.

Good practices for taxonomies used for incident detection and  prevention  This chapter describes a number of good practices identified by various CSIRTs during this study. A good practice can  be described as a practice that has been proven to work well and which produces good results, and therefore can  be recommended as a model. In addition, it is a successful experience, which has been tested, validated and  repeated and deserves to be shared with the CSIRT community to consider it for adoption. Each good practice has  been defined while taking into account shortcomings of taxonomies as identified by CSIRTs. This chapter is organised  as depicted below.   Chapter “4.1 Overview of good practices” provides a high-level overview of the identified good practices  grouped by relevance;   Chapters 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 provide details of the good practices with high relevance, medium relevance and  possible relevance respectively. For each good practice details are provided on what problem or gap has  been taken into consideration, a summary of the good practice, how the good practice addressed the issue  at hand and a practice example;  Chapter “0  4.1 Overview of  good practices  4.2 Details of  most relevant  good practices  4.3 Details of good  practices with  medium relevance  4.4 Details of good  practices with  possible relevance  4.5 Linking the good  practices to the  use cases  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  22   Linking the good practices to the use cases” described which good practice is considered to support which  use case as identified in chapter “3.2  Linking taxonomies to use cases based on defined requirements and metrics”.  Overview of good practices  The good practices have been grouped by relevance to this guide based on the qualitative assessment. However,  actual relevance depends on the reader and his/her context. Good practices established by the interviewed CSIRT  experts that focus on the taxonomies themselves (and less on the CSIRT operational activity practices) are also  assigned a higher priority. This chapter is organised as depicted below.  4.1.1 Overview of the most relevant good practices  The following table contains a quick overview of the good practices identified as “highly relevant” to the CSIRT  community. Note that each good practice is described in more detail in chapter “04.2 Details of most relevant good  practices”.  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING  GP1: The top-level  categorisation of a  taxonomy should  be simple  With simple top-level categorisation we take into account the complexity of the taxonomy. As simple  top level also implies more than one level of categorisation. With a multi-level categorisation system,  the preferred level of complexity can easily be selected. If a non-technical report is required, a higher  and more general categorisation level can be used. If a technical report is required, then using the  bottom level category enables that. In addition, having a low number of top-level categories can  reduce the mutual exclusivity of the categories. Furthermore, a taxonomy with at least 2-3 levels of  categorisation provides the most versatility and scalability, as it gives the choice of adding a branch to  a tree, or adding a leaf to the branch.  GP2: The categories  within a taxonomy  should be mutually  exclusive  This good practice is related to an issue brought forth by a few CSIRTs. The multiple categorisation or  re-categorisation of an incident during the incident lifetime. While sometimes this may be  unavoidable, as laid out in the use case B of a spear phishing campaign, the first time categorisation  of an incident should not cause any doubt. The re-categorisation may influence reporting, as it may  be unclear whether to only take the final category in the report or take account of the previous  categories. (E.g. reporting could include statistics such as “X cases of type A have eventually resulted  in Y cases of type B after final categorisation).  If the taxonomy terms are defined too loosely and if they do not have enough constraints, the same  incident could potentially be categorised differently by two different analysts. It would also make the  machine reading harder due to the added ambiguity.  GP3: Taxonomies  should support  performance  measurement  There are many benefits to allowing a taxonomy to support the measurement of performance in  terms of time taken to solve an incident (both in terms of complexity and person hours to solve it). In  many cases it is for example relevant to know how quick an incident was closed. Some reports need  to include the time needed to close the incident. This good practice was mentioned by several CSIRTs.  A taxonomy with such a feature would allow management to make operational decisions, such as  resource allocation for a type of incident whose estimate complexity and solving time is known. It is  also useful for keeping statistics.  GP4: Taxonomies  should have an  Ease of use needs to be clearly defined and depends on the operational requirement of the CSIRT,  and the use case for which the taxonomy is required. Although ease of use can be interpreted in  4.1.1 Overview of the most relevant good practices  4.1.2 Overview of the medium relevance good practices  4.1.3 Overview of other good practices with possible relevance  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  23  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING  appropriate level of  ease of use  many different ways by different entities, the following attributes may provide relevant and general  aspects of ease of use:   Completeness of the taxonomy;   Complexity of the taxonomy;   Simple first level of categorisation (for example, when triage happens at the emergency desk  in a hospital, the initial intake should be simple, swift and self-explanatory);   If the taxonomy is to be used to report to decision makers, the terms have to be understood  by the decision makers.  These aspects are very important in the day-to-day usage of the taxonomy independently of the use  cases.  Table 6 – Identified good practices with a high relevance to the CSIRT community.  4.1.2 Overview of the medium relevance good practices  The following table contains a quick overview of the good practices identified by the project team as “fairly relevant”  to the CSIRT community. Note that each good practice is described in more detail in chapter “0  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  24  Details of good practices of medium relevance”.  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING  GP5: A taxonomy should  support the tagging of the  event(s) leading to the  incident or tagging of  additional incident  information that is relevant  While this is not achieved using the taxonomy directly, it is an important aspect that helps  provide actionable information that can be applied in various circumstances, such as impact  area, sensitivity, and many more. With this, a CSIRT can add any tag that may be relevant to  their day-to-day operations.  GP6: Taxonomies should be  understood by external  non-CSIRT entities to  effectively share  information  It is crucial that professionals beyond the CSIRT community can at least understand the basics  of the taxonomies, for high-level taxonomies, but not necessarily all taxonomies this includes  professionals such as politicians, lawyers, law enforcement, etc. There may be low-level IoC,  TTPs, etc. taxonomies that are relevant to more technical audiences.  GP7: Taxonomies should be  created or updated using  existing taxonomies or  standards  Since the use of a taxonomy is not limited to sharing incident information or reporting, it may  very well be valid to create a taxonomy based purely on the necessities of an organisation.  However, if an organisation or CSIRT is mandated to use a certain style of taxonomies, then  this good practice does not apply.  GP8: A taxonomy should be  able to differentiate  between a confirmed, not  yet confirmed and  unconfirmed event  The essence of this good practice is that CSIRTs should be able to differentiate between what  is a real event (incoming notification/report) and what is not. The \"what is not\" can mean  different things, either it is not complete, it is a false assumption or it is incorrect. Sometimes  it is not clear from the beginning whether an event is an incident or not.  GP9: A taxonomy should be  able to support reporting  vulnerabilities  While dealing with incidents, CSIRTs also receive vulnerability information. It may be useful to  have a taxonomy that deals with these vulnerabilities, and additionally the taxonomy used  for incident detection and response should be able to mark it as a vulnerability (this can be a  misconfiguration or an exploitable vulnerability).  Table 7 - Identified good practices with a medium relevance to the CSIRT community.  4.1.3 Overview of other good practices with possible relevance  The following table contains an overview other good practices with “possible relevance” to the CSIRT community.  Note that each good practice is described in more detail in chapter “4.4 Details of other good practices with possible  relevance”.  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING TO DETERMINE RELEVANCE  GP10: An implemented  taxonomy should allow an  incident to be traced back  to the source28  May not be applicable to all CSIRTs because it is likely that the information received by CSIRTs  does not specify or are most likely incidents.  GP11: Taxonomies should  be both human readable  and machine readable  May not be applicable to all CSIRTs because most CSIRTs already use combined human and  machine-readable processes as part of their operational activities.  28 Source can be both the attribution to the threat “actor” or the “attack vector” (I.e. the vulnerability, way of entry)  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  25  Table 8 - Identified good practices with a low relevance to the CSIRT community.  Details of most relevant good practices  This chapter describes the most relevant good practices in detail.  Figure 2 - Overview of most relevant good practice.  4.2.1 Good practice 1: The top-level categorisation of a taxonomy should be simple  4.2.1.1 Problem or gap  Too many top-level categories could increase the complexity of the taxonomy. While a complex taxonomy could be  useful for certain use cases (such as feeding threat intelligence, exchanging information between CSIRTs, etc.), the  more complex it becomes. Too much complexity can result in the taxonomy becoming too cumbersome for day-to- day usage.  4.2.1.2 Summary  The top-level categorisation of a taxonomy should not exceed 6-7 categories. The categories should not be flat.  4.2.1.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Having only a limited amount of top-level categorisations allows the simplification of the categorisation process,  especially by humans, but also by machines. It also allows for selective filtering for sharing, feeding, reporting, etc.  When the taxonomy is required to provide reporting at a less technical level, where an abstraction to the top-level  categorisation is appropriate, a lower number of more general terms could increase the understanding and clarity  for the target audience. If terms that are more technical are required or more complexity is desirable, then additional  categories can be considered within a select top-level category, providing both an overview of the categorisation  and the complexity necessary.  Additionally, if there are multiple levels of categorisation present, the recipients of the report should be able to see  what they consider serious. Since what audience A considers serious is not necessarily the same as for audience B,  picking the appropriate depth of categorisation per top-level categorisation allows the customisation of relevant  data (relevant to the target audience).  This good practice facilitates the reporting of information to decision makers and the categorisation process. In  addition, it allows for clearer mutual –exclusivity. It also enables the control of complexity more effectively. Finally,  multiple levels of categorisations allow different levels of detail and technicality to be represented with the same  taxonomy.  4.2.1.4 Practical example  TOP LEVEL CATEGORY BOTTOM LEVEL CATEGORY  Malware  Virus  Worm  Trojan  Table 9 - A simplified example of using multiple levels of categorisation  GP1 - Simple top  level categorisation  GP2 - The categories  within a taxonomy  should be mutually  exclusive  GP3 - Taxonomies  should support  performance  measurement  GP4 - Taxonomies  should have an  appropriate level of  ease of use  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  26  A taxonomy used by an incident handler can also be used to make a non-technical report for management by  abstracting to the top-level category. As such, instead of specifying which type of malware caused the incident,  it would be sufficient to just use the category of “Malware”, instead of specifying a bottom level category.  4.2.2 Good practice 2: The categories within a taxonomy should be mutually exclusive  4.2.2.1 Problem or gap  When processing an incident or the event(s) leading up to the incident, it is possible that an incident may be re- categorised or in multiple categories throughout the incident lifecycle. This may or may not be a desired outcome.  4.2.2.2 Summary  Depending on needs and requirements, the terms within a taxonomy should be as mutually exclusive as possible. In  a taxonomy with multiple levels of categories, the bottom level categorisation should be mutually exclusive. Re- categorisation of incidents can influence reporting. A choice needs to be made if only the latest categorisation should  apply. Reporting could also include statistics such as: “X incidents of categorisation A have eventually resulted in Y  incidents of categorisation B” to keep track of categorisation trends.  4.2.2.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  If mutually exclusive categories exist, this makes the first categorisation of an incident easier, allowing for the  incident to be machine readable, and reduces ambiguity in the terms.  Multiple attribution enables an incident to be categorised multiple times in different categories, which in some  incidents (such as a spear phishing attack/campaign) may provide more information about the incident.  Achieving mutual exclusivity can be achieved by having clear, self-explanatory, and precisely defined terms within  the taxonomy. If a taxonomy has several levels of categorisations (i.e. broad top-level categories branching down  into more specific categories).  4.2.2.4 Practical examples  A CSIRT receives a set of IOCs listing C2 servers for “malware\", as such the initial categorisation in “Malware” is  obvious. No further information is available at this time and the Indicator of Compromise (IOCs) are placed into  the IDS rules.  When hits have been found in the logs the incident is first marked as malware. Then further investigation is  done into the clients, and it is discovered that the malware is “ransomware”. The incident is enriched with this  info, the sub-category (or tag). This is shared with the community. Enriching the IOCs with this set of information  and sharing it improves the quality of the IOCs.  Further investigation is done to check how the ransomware was delivered. It is detected that a previous incident  that was marked as “Spam” contains details on how the ransomware was delivered and has information on the  message content. The initial incident marked as “Spam” is now set to “Malware / Spam”, the malware incident  can be updated with a tag “delivered via e-mail” and “Office document”.  The result of the client investigation also allows to extend the incident with the ransomware family.  4.2.3 Good practice 3: Taxonomies should support performance measurement  4.2.3.1 Problem or gap  Depending on the size of the CSIRT operational team, it may not be feasible to adequately allocate all required  resources to the needs of the incident, as such the prioritisation process needs to take into account the time taken  for each type of incident to facilitate planning.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  27  4.2.3.2 Summary  Introducing metrics that assess aspects such as time required to analyse the events leading to the incident, to solve  an incident, the effectiveness of solving an incident can provide key information about the incident detection and  prevention process. Though the taxonomy itself does not necessarily affect this, it supports the process.  4.2.3.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  With metric information, each type of incident can be assessed in terms of the time it takes to solve the incident,  the effectiveness of the process used to solve it, as well as the effectiveness of employees in solving incidents. Having  a measurement of how many person hours each incident would require, allows for the proper and effective  allocation of resources to it, meaning that more critical incidents can be addressed more adequately.  For performance, the following measurements should be considered:   It should support the measuring of the criticality of a resources - both in terms of complexity and importance  (e.g. a simple SCADA web interface may not be complex, but can be very critical). This would assist in the  triage of the incidents;   It should measure the impact of the incident. As such, it would facilitate the prioritisation of the incident;   It should allow each incident to be measured in terms of the time needed to resolve it and with additional  measurements taken in the incident resolution process;   It should also support in measuring the efficiency of the personnel working on incidents;   It should measure how quickly the incident was closed.  The taxonomy should provide means or additional fields or terms that can be used for performance measurement.  This can either in the form of tags that keep track of the status of an incident, with the time between opening and  solving the incident recorded. Additionally, a taxonomy could also have a field to account for opening and closing  time of an event or incident. With this information the above measurements could be extracted.  4.2.3.4 Practical example  CSIRTs receive a lot of phishing notices, dealing with these reports is a standard procedure. The amount of time  spent on dealing with a standard phishing mail is standard. However, if one of the phishing mails contains a link  to the public government website then it requires more (human) effort and time because:   It is part of the immediate constituency of a government or CSIRTs;   It is sensitive, in the sense of potentially affecting the image or reputation of the affected entity;   It has the impact that the information provided to and received from the public via the website might  be intercepted or altered.  Having a tag “Government” allows to measure how much time was spent on \"gov\"-incidents. If the phishing link  is placed in “Government” then this will again lead to another incident and an investigation on how the website  was exploited.  4.2.4 Good practice 4: Taxonomies should have an appropriate of level of ease of use  4.2.4.1 Problem or gap  If the taxonomy is too complex or has too many terms it becomes impractical and cumbersome to use in day-to-day  activities, such as effectively exchanging data with other CSIRTs or feeding threat intelligence. If a taxonomy is too  simple, then it may not be able to adequately explain the incident or the context of the incident.  4.2.4.2 Summary  While the definition of ease of use depends very much on who and for what purpose the taxonomy was implemented  for, there are a few basic elements that are generally applicable:  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  28   Completeness of the taxonomy – for a taxonomy to be implemented, used correctly and for day-to-day usage,  the taxonomy should contain all the terms in the semantic vocabulary based on operational requirements. To  assure completeness, the best course of action is to learn from national and international standards, or to  consult other national CSIRTs on their approach. Cooperation enabled through CSIRT networks will also help  assure the completeness of the taxonomy. Additionally, the experience gained from implementing and using the  taxonomy on a day-to-day basis, will further uncover and requirements.   Ease of first categorisation (triage) - Mutual exclusivity may not be the top priority of all taxonomies or even  feasible in some cases (i.e. during the course of an incident life cycle, the incident changing categories due to  further investigation).  Regarding the use case \"Recording events from different sources”, it should be taken into account that some  events might include information that in fact contain two incidents. For instance, someone complains that a  website resource is being abused and forwards the logs, however, when the log is looked into the handler also  notices other unwanted behaviour, such as , the system being used as a command and control server , which  leads to the event being split into two different incidents.   Complexity of the taxonomy – while the complexity depends very much on the nature of the operational activity  (be it for reporting information or exchanging indicator of compromise information). In terms of complexity, the  taxonomy should have more than one level of categorisation. Having multiple levels of categorisation will allow  for describing an incident in greater detail, as well as to provide a high-level view if needed.   Simple first categorisation – depending on the precision of the terms of the taxonomy, it is possible that by the  end of the incident lifecycle, the same incident has been categorised multiple times or that the categorisation  changed. Nonetheless, the first categorisation using the taxonomy should be straightforward and simple to do.  This can be achieved by either clearly defining each term in the taxonomy and/or using self-explanatory terms  within the taxonomy.   If the taxonomy is to be used to report to decision makers, the terms have to be understood by the decision  makers - this can be achieved by having multiple levels of categorisation and reverting back to the top level, as  well as having either self-explanatory or clearly defined terms.  4.2.4.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  When a taxonomy is implemented, it is often used on a day-to-day basis (for incident detection). For this purpose,  the taxonomy chosen must be easy to use, which would facilitate the first categorisation of an event.  4.2.4.4 Practical example  The first categorisation can define who deals with the follow-up of the incident, and the resources to be  assigned. This initial process should be swift and quick.  When the incident handlers process the queue in the ticketing system, an incident that is categorised as  “Copyright infringement” will get lower priority compared to an incident marked as “System compromised”.  This facilitates the task of distinguishing the categorisation between these two and to prioritise them.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  29  Details of good practices of medium relevance  This chapter describes the good practices of medium relevance in detail.  Figure 3- Overview of good practice of medium relevance.  4.3.1 Good practice 5: A taxonomy should support the tagging of the event(s) leading to the incident or tagging  of additional incident information that is relevant  4.3.1.1 Problem or gap  Incidents do not have the same impact for everyone, it may not be relevant for different parties to worry about the  same event(s) leading to an incident. Furthermore, there is not just one method to add relevant information if there  is no field to represent it, or critical information may not be represented appropriately.  4.3.1.2 Summary  A taxonomy should support a tagging system that can represent a varied amount of information.  4.3.1.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  While tagging may not necessarily be performed by the taxonomy itself, as framework which allows customisable  tags to be added would provide a critical component that would save time and provide actionable information.  The following non-exhaustive list of tags could be considered:   Impact Area - Not every incident has the same impact for every CSIRT, as such having a tag that allows the  specification of the impact area may allow the facilitation of aggregation and searching of events by  relevance to a particular area or sector (see use cases). Impact area can include, but is not limited to,  industrial sectors, governmental sectors, public sectors, etc.   Constituency or victim type - In some specific cases, such as reporting to politicians. This often entails  answering statistical questions such as \"how many DDoS attacks were observed\" or \"how many of these  attacks involved the government as a victim\". This can also be solved by allowing an incident handling team  to set tags for “victim type” or “constituency”. It is important to note that victim type can include everything  that is in the incident database, such as “all victims with the e-mail address @belgium.be”, “gov”, “sme”,  “critical infrastructure”.   Law Enforcement applicability (if relevant) - Law enforcement sometimes ask that the reporting includes  the marking if an event or incident has led to a criminal act (sometimes also differentiating between a severe  or light act). There is an ongoing debate to know what the full definition of cybercrime, therefore a use for  such a tag should be foreseeable.  GP5 - A taxonomy should  support the tagging of the  event(s) leading to the  incident or tagging of  additional incident  information that is relevant  GP6 - The taxonomy should  be understood by decision  makers and enable other  CSIRTs to effectively share  information  GP7 - Creating or updating  the taxonomy using  standards or existing  taxonomies  GP8 - A taxonomy should  be able to differentiate  between a confirmed, not  yet confirmed and  unconfirmed event  GP9 - A taxonomy should  be able to handle incidents  from vulnerabilities  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  30   Sensitivity - Due to the sensitive nature of some of the incidents, the event(s) leading up to the incident, the  source or target of the incident that occur, a tag that accounts for the sensitivity of the incident could be  included too. Alternatively, the taxonomy could be extended to include sensitive or another taxonomy (such  as the Traffic Light Protocol) could be used. The TLP tags are as follows29:  o “TLP: RED” - Information exclusively and directly given to (a group of) individual recipients. Sharing  outside is not legitimate;  o “TLP: AMBER” - Information exclusively given to an organisation; sharing limited within the  organisation to be effectively acted upon;  o “TLP: GREEN” - Information given to a community or a group of organisations at large. This  information cannot be publicly released;  o “TLP: WHITE” - Information can be shared publicly in accordance with the law.   Classification - Depending on the content of the incident information or with whom this information is  shared, it may be appropriate to use a tag to represent the classification of the incident information. For  example:  For governmental or nation incidents.  With the NIS directive encouraging the sharing of information within the EU, a taxonomy such as EUCI 30 (EU  classified information marking) may be applicable as use for tagging using the following:   “TRÈS SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET”;   “SECRET UE/EU SECRET”;   “CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL”;   “RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED”.  It is also possible to use a central management tag list as a starting basis.  Tagging may not be an effective solution for every problem. However, it does provide a convenient way to add  critical and actionable information to the data or to account for any future types of incidents that could arise with  relative minimal effort.  It is also important to consider that if all this information were to be implemented in the taxonomy itself and not  around the taxonomy, then there would be a large number of sub-branches making it cumbersome or even  unusable. Not every CSIRT will use all the branches either, some may only require “Malware” -> “Ransomware”.  4.3.1.4 Practical example  If we consider ransomware, it makes sense to categorise it as “Malware” and then as “Ransomware”. However,  it would also make sense to know the version of the ransomware (e.g. crytpolocker version X). The following  information would be relevant and provide actionable information if existing as tags for the example:   The delivery method, e.g. via an embedded Office document;   Whether or not a decryption method is publically available;   Where the incident took place, e.g. in a public administration;   The impact of the loss of all the data.  29 https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/  30 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/classified-information/  https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/ http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/classified-information/  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  31  4.3.2 Good practice 6: Taxonomies should be understood by external non-CSIRT entities to effectively share  information  4.3.2.1 Problem or gap  When reporting to decision-makers, these decision-makers will make a judgement based on their understanding of  the information given to them. Therefore, to ensure that the information given to them is understood as intended,  the terminology must be carefully selected or clearly defined. Therefore when reporting to the government or media  (who may intend to share acquired information with the public), need to fully understand the information they will  base a decision on or share to the public.  4.3.2.2 Summary  A taxonomy should allow decisions to be based on the information and wording provided.  4.3.2.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  A taxonomy should reflect that by having a simple and limited top-level categorisation (GP1) of clearly understood  and defined terms. The level of simplicity should be defined based on operational needs or intended target audience.  4.3.2.4 Practical examples  Reporting towards politicians, law enforcement, lawyers, judges, etc. I.e. entities that may be required to make  decisions based on incident information received.  4.3.3 Good practice 7: A taxonomy should be created or updated using standards or existing taxonomies  4.3.3.1 Problem or gap  Taxonomies are usually created to serve a specific organisational purpose. If the taxonomies cannot easily be  mapped, this complicates the exchange of incident information with other CSIRTs..  4.3.3.2 Summary  Taxonomies should be designed, implemented, or revised using established standards or taxonomies in use by other  CSIRTs.  The following are standards, which provide relevant information for creating, implementing, and exchanging  information using taxonomies:   RFC 2350 31- Best Current Practice; Expectations for Computer Security Incident Response;   RFC 2828 32- Internet Security Glossary;   RFC 507033 - The Incident Object Description Exchange Format;   NIST SP 800-61 revision 234 - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide;   NIST SP 800-15035 - Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing.  Many CSIRTs already use taxonomies to handle incidents or report on them, having already conducted research into  taxonomies themselves, or learned from using the taxonomy what worked and what did not work. Therefore, it is  advisable to contact the respective national CSIRT before creating a completely new and untested taxonomy. .  31 RFC 2350 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  32 RFC 2828 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2828  33 RFC 5070 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070  34 NIST SP 800-61 r2 - http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf  35 NIST SP 800-150 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_second_draft.pdf  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2828 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070 http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_second_draft.pdf  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  32  4.3.3.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Contacting other CSIRTs to gain more information can save a lot of effort and resources in terms of taxonomy  creation and implementation, as well as usage.  4.3.3.4 Practical examples  Many CSIRTs will exchange threat information via MISP. Information that is stored in MISP often is already  categorized by other participants. By using a taxonomy that also is supported in the tagging of information in  MISP taxonomies, then the category information put there by others remains in the events when synchronizing  them to local instances.  4.3.4 Good practice 8: A taxonomy should be able to differentiate between a confirmed, not yet confirmed and  unconfirmed event  4.3.4.1 Problem or gap  Taxonomies do not all account for contextual difference with regards to intrusions vs. misuse, or a false positive for  a vulnerability. For instance, if an account is compromised on a website, it is not necessarily the website that has  suffered an intrusion, it could be merely the credentials of a user being misused. This distinction can provide key  information in an investigation.  4.3.4.2 Summary  A taxonomy should have the necessary fields to be able to distinguish between whether an incident occurred (e.g.  an intrusion or vulnerability), or an unconfirmed event (e.g. the misuse of the credentials of a user, but not an actual  breach).  As such, the following status terms could be applied:   “Confirmed”;   “No yet confirmed”;   “Unconfirmed”;   “Pending”.  In addition, the taxonomy should be accompanied with a document that clearly defines, in terms of organisational  requirement, for the CSIRT each of the above statuses. This may enable external parties to gain understanding into  the statuses.  4.3.4.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  For this, a field can be added upon the taxonomy to distinguish such detail in relevant cases. This helps in the  investigation and proper categorisation of an incident.  4.3.4.4 Practical examples  The following example provides a high level illustration of the life cycle of an event:  1. A report arrives from a governmental institute that one of the other governmental institutes that  provides them data (via a web interface) has become unavailable. The incident status is “Pending\".  2. Initial investigation shows that the whole network is indeed unreachable.  3. Incident responders try to contact the other .gov network but their SIP telephone infrastructure is not  reachable Initial categorisation can be a DDoS attack. The incident status is “Not yet confirmed\".  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  33  4. When contacting the NOC of the ISP that provides access to both organisations it turns out there has  been a human error causing a routing problem. The incident is an “Unconfirmed event\".  4.3.5 Good practice 9: A taxonomy should be able to support reporting vulnerabilities  4.3.5.1 Problem or gap  Not every incident that is reported stems from a security incident. CSIRTs also receive vulnerability information. A  taxonomy should be able to handle this information (if applicable). Note that a vulnerability can be a  misconfiguration or something exploitable.  4.3.5.2 Summary  A taxonomy should be able to handle incidents and vulnerabilities if applicable.  4.3.5.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  If the taxonomy can handle the sharing and reporting of vulnerability data, then those issues can be resolved more  effectively if the proper authorities are alerted. This can be achieved by adding the required categories to deal with  vulnerabilities, as well as any other incident type to the taxonomy.  4.3.5.4 Practical examples  A DNS server open to a DNS amplification attack needs to be reported just as any other incident would be.  Details of other good practices with possible relevance  This chapter describes the good practices with possible relevance in detail.  4.4.1 Good practice 10: An implemented taxonomy should allow an incident to be traced back to the source  4.4.1.1 Problem or gap  Current taxonomies do not always allow the tracing of incidents back to the source.  4.4.1.2 Summary  The implemented taxonomy should provide sufficient information based on the threat event and the threat actor  that allows the tracing back of the events to the source (can be the source of entry (vulnerability, attack vector) or  the source the attribution. However, when sharing sources and possibly doing attribution, different privacy related  considerations are involved. For instance, to the press it is not appropriate to disclose the exact nature of the  victim(s), while it might be indispensable when dealing with another CSIRT .  4.4.1.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Implementing additional controls around the taxonomy allows the assurance of having the full picture of any given  event. This can be achieved by adding some additional metadata or terminology to track the source of the incident.  4.4.1.4 Practical example  A report of a security incident obtained via a public feed is handled with a different priority than a report  received from a local IDS that’s been setup with your own provided set of rules.  GP10: An implemented  taxonomy should allow  an incident to be traced  back to the source  GP11: Taxonomies  should be both human  readable and machine  readable  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  34  Good practice 11: A taxonomy should be able to differentiate between an attempt and a successful incident  4.4.1.5 Problem or gap  Depending on the criteria of what constitutes an incident, when automatically aggregating incidents, there is not  always a clear way do differentiate between what is an attempt and successful incident. If there is no indicator to  differentiate both cases, the attempts could lead to a false positive. Therefore, it would not be useful as actionable  information.  4.4.1.6 Summary  A taxonomy should be able to differentiate between attempts and successful incidents, and differentiate between  malware and legitimate software wherever possible. Adding an additional field to track whether it was a successful  incident, an attempt, or a false positive.  4.4.1.7 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  It provides a more comprehensive picture of the incidents. Additionally, it would facilitate the searching of incidents  if required by adding an additional search option.  4.4.1.8 Practical example  Sites that run WordPress often see scans for wp-login. The web request for wp-login is something was handled  by automated scanning and is nothing more than just a login attempt. A successful request for the /admin/  pages after the login, however, means a successful incident.  4.4.2 Good practice 11: Taxonomies should be both human-readable and machine readable  4.4.2.1 Problem or gap  When automatically processing incident information, it is important that the incident handlers understand the  information that is being processed.  4.4.2.2 Summary  This can be achieved by clearly defining the terminology of the categories.  4.4.2.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Clear definitions allow the incident to become machine-readable in addition to facilitating a first categorisation of  an incident. This can be achieved with clear definitions for each term within the taxonomy. This can be achieved by  keeping additional documentation with each of the terms defined.  4.4.2.4 Practical example  Examples of this are the JSON files that are included in the MISP taxonomy list. The  https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/enisa/machinetag.json  https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/enisa/machinetag.json  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  35  Linking the good practices to the use cases  This section summarises which good practices of high and medium relevance (as defined in chapters 4.2 and 4.3)  apply to which use cases (as defined in chapter “3.2  Linking taxonomies to use cases based on defined requirements and metrics”) according to the CSIRTs that have  been involved in this study.  4.5.1 UC.TI.101 - Recording events from different sources  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.101 –  Recording events from different sources”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  For this use case, having multiple levels of categorisation is also beneficial, as it allows adjusting  the level of complexity.  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity Mutual exclusivity enables a more effective recording of events. As each distinct source may  require specific terminology or present a different context.  GP3 - Performance  measurements  As this is concerned with different sources, this practice would allow the analysis of each source  and determine statistics such as time taken per source or person hours required to process an  incident per source.  GP4 - Ease of use The level of use required depends on the types of source from which events are recorded.  GP5 - Tagging With the use of tagging, the source can be used as a tag.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  If the source of the event is, for example, a website with authentication, then knowing how the  event occurred is important. Furthermore, knowing the initial results of the event may also  provide crucial information.  GP9 - Vulnerability  incidents  As the incidents stem from different sources, it is highly likely that there will be a vulnerability  among the source. As such, the taxonomy needs to be able to handle such information.  4.5.2 UC.TI.002 - Automatic deduplication  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.002 -  Automatic deduplication”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the corresponding  use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If the categories are not shared and mutually exclusive, this makes removing duplicates easier. If  there are two identical incidents, which are effectively identical but categorized differently, then  a duplicate could remain.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  36  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP4 - Ease of use The level of detail affects the effectiveness of deduplication. In this case, a lower level of detail  and complexity should be implemented. Since more terms may cause identical incidents to be  categorised differently, and therefor duplicate.  4.5.3 UC.TI.003 - Ability to export in other taxonomies  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.003 -  Ability to export in other taxonomies”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If there is mutual exclusion, then there should be clear divide in the concepts represented by the  taxonomy, as such choosing to which category another should be exported/mapped to make it  simpler.  GP4 - Appropriate ease  of use  If a taxonomy has a higher level of completeness is terms of incident types, then exporting into  other taxonomies can be facilitated. This is especially true if the information is exported into a  more general taxonomy, where categories require merging.  4.5.4 UC.TI.104 - Ability to aggregate and search events in the data  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.104 -  Ability to aggregate and search events in the data”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice  supports the corresponding use case. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  Simple top-level categories may simplify the aggregation and search process, as it would allow  for aggregation and search at different levels of categorisation.  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If a taxonomy has a higher level of completeness is terms of incident types, then exporting into  other taxonomies can be facilitated. This is especially true if the information is exported into a  more general taxonomy, where categories require merging.  GP4 - Ease of use If a taxonomy has a higher level of completeness in terms of incident types, then exporting into  other taxonomies can be facilitated. This is especially true if the information is exported into a  more general taxonomy, where categories require merging.  GP5 - Tagging The use of tags would reduce the time it would take to aggregate and to search event data, by  giving more options to aggregate and search for.  GP7 - Using standards  and existing taxonomies  Aggregation of events is facilitated if the terms are already well defined and proven to work if  already implemented elsewhere.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  This helps with both the aggregation and searching of events, as it allows another option to be  used as a filter.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  37  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  GP9 - Vulnerability  Incidents  For aggregation purposes, being able to differentiate an incident stemming from a vulnerability  from other sources may provide valuable information.  GP11 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between  an attempt and a  successful incident  This would simplify the aggregation and searching of events, i.e. provide additional information  that can be used to refine the search or aggregation category  4.5.5 UC.TI.105 - Ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.105 -  Ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If there are distinct fields, then the data can be shared effectively at greater ease.  GP4 - Ease of use This practice depends on the ease of use of the taxonomy used to exchange within the CSIRT  network. If all the CSIRT members use the same taxonomy, then the ease of use needs to be  adequate to provide a maximum amount of information.  GP6 - Understanding of  decision makers  Information can also be exchanged between LEAs and politicians, i.e. law enforcement and  policy makers. Therefore, it is important that the information is shared in such a manner that  leaves no doubt about the meaning of it.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  The exchanged information should contain information regarding whether the event was  confirmed, not yet confirmed and unconfirmed.  GP9 - Vulnerability  Incidents  To share the maximum amount of relevant information, the type of the information should be  included.  GP 12 - Definition and  the broadness of a  concept within the  taxonomy should be  precise and self- explanatory  Helps automated sharing of data with other CSIRTs.  4.5.6 UC.IM.006 - Feeding threat intelligence  The table below lists the good practices of high and medium relevance that support achieving use case “UC.IM.006  - Feeding threat intelligence”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the corresponding  use case.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  38  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  Makes the selection process for which types of global level incidents are shared more effective.  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity This ensures the clear distinction between categories, allowing the network to be fed  automatically more effectively, as there are no ambiguities.  GP3 - Performance  measurements  Complexity is an important factor for incident handling. As such complexity needs to be  measured appropriately to allow the estimation of required resources for day-to-day activity.  GP4 - Appropriate ease  of use  This will affect the level of detail the intelligence that is fed possesses, and whether the system  that is being fed can handle the level of detail and completeness of the terms used.  GP5 - Tagging With a tagging system, the relevant incident or event information can be picked out quicker by  providing a term to group incident, or even a tag “For threat intelligence”  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  Depending on who intends to use the intelligence after it is fed into threat intelligence, it is  important for proper and clear definitions to be in place that are also shared over the threat  intelligence feed if possible.  GP9 - Vulnerability  Incidents  To share the maximum amount of relevant information, the type of the information should be  included.  GP11 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between  an attempt and a  successful incident  This is important information to share for threat intelligence, as it provides key information that  can help determine the severity of an event.  GP 12 - Definition and  the broadness of a  concept within the  taxonomy should be  precise and self- explanatory  Having clearly explain concepts in place allows the sharing to be more effective. I.e. alleviate any  confusion that could arise from terms.  4.5.7 UC.IM.007 - Incident report management  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.IM.007 -  Incident report management”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  Depending on the required complexity, having a simple top level category that can be abstracted  to for reporting in high level, or going to bottom level detail for technical level.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  39  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity When reporting, it is important to have a clear understanding of the concepts presented,  regardless of their complexity. As such being mutually exclusive would enable the target  audience to have a very clear distinction between the terms and associated concepts.  GP4 - Appropriate ease  of use  This again highly depends on the intended target audience. Including required complexity,  completeness, etc. Regardless of ease of use, it is an important practice to consider.  GP6 - Understanding of  decision makers  Clearly defining a taxonomy may be very important depending on the audience of the report. If  the audience is a politician with the power to make decisions that potentially affect others, the  each high level term must be clearly defined.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  Being able to report separately on confirmed, not yet confirmed and unconfirmed event is  important.  GP11 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between  an attempt and a  successful incident  Being able to report separately on attempted and successful incidents is important.

Case studies demonstrating the use of taxonomies  Case studies provide relevant information gathered from the CSIRT community to illustrate each of the cases  specified in this chapter. The objective of these case studies is to illustrate the use of taxonomies in CSIRT operational  activity while taking into account the use cases established in previous chapters.  This chapter contains three case studies. Each case study is introduced in terms of the situation presented and the  involvement of a taxonomy. Further, the case is analysed taking into account CSIRT operational activities and a brief  conclusion illustrates what can be drawn from the case and what the impact is.  The following case studies will be explored in the sections below:  Figure 4 - Overview of the case studies in this chapter.  The figure below is the outline of the case studies, the case studies in this chapter will adhere to this structure:  Figure 5 - Structure of the case studies in this chapter.  Case Study A: Website or page dedicated for major NIS incidents occurring across the EU for the general  public to support the use of taxonomies  5.1.1 Case introduction  Information about NIS (Network and Information Security) incidents is increasingly valuable to the public and  businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses as their livelihood could depend on the integrity and  confidentiality of their information. In some cases, such information is already provided via websites at the national  level, in the language of a specific country and focusing mainly on incidents and occurrences with a national  dimension. Given that businesses increasingly operate cross-border and citizens use online services, information on  incidents should be provided in an aggregated form at EU level.  Case Study A - Website  for major NIS incidents  occurring across the EU  for the general public  Case Study B - Re- categorisation of cyber  incidents  Case Study C - Using  taxonomies for incident  handling metrics  •The case introduction provides the background information regarding the case to set the stage  for the analysis.  Case introduction  •The case analysis assesses the overall case, taking into account the previously established use  cases and taxonomy metrics.  Case analysis  •The case conclusions draws the pertinent information from the introduction and analysis, and  outlines the main relevant outcome or consequence associated with the case.  Case conclusions  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  41  According to recital 40 of the NIS Directive36, the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network is encouraged to maintain a  website or host a dedicated page on an existing website where general information on major NIS incidents occurring  across the Union is put at the disposal of the public, with a specific focus on the interests and needs of businesses.  CSIRTs participating in the CSIRTs Network are encouraged to provide on a voluntary basis the information to be  published in this website. However, such a website is not supposed to include confidential or sensitive information.  5.1.2 Case study  To ensure a sufficient level of incident information contained in a publically accessible location, the taxonomy should  have the right attributes. As such, the following are some of the requirements that may be applicable for such public  information:   Easy to understand - While CSIRTs can contend with complex and technical terms, to ensure public  understanding of each of the terms used, the terms should remain simple and general, or at least clearly  defined somewhere;   Both human and machine-readable - Due to the number of incidents that could potentially be submitted to  this public portal, it may be cumbersome to process them all manually, as such automating the process for  machine use may be beneficial. However, since the target audience is not likely to have the same experience  level as a CSIRT expert, it should to be understood by humans too. If incident information is received from a  member CSIRT or constituency and if they followed the taxonomy properly, the system can feed and  automatically understand the incident information. Effectively easing the integration of incident  information. It is also worth noting that machine readable information may be more technical than strictly  human readable information;   Have more than one detail level - If a member of the public has more knowledge in the area of a specific  incident, it may be useful for that person to be able to get a more detailed explanation of the incident.  For the information to be understood by the public, but also provide more detail should it be required, a taxonomy  in this context should have at least one level of categorisation, but no more than three, where the top layer should  be as simple as possible and the next layers down providing more information about the incident specifics.  For example the table below, the public may want to know that a major incident involved “information  gathering”, but may not be interested or may not have the expertise for concepts such as “sniffing”. In that  case knowing that an incident is of the top level category is important, and the bottom level category provides  additional useful details  TOP LEVEL CATEGORY BOTTOM LEVEL CATEGORY  Information gathering  Scanning  Sniffing  Social engineering  Table 11 - Example of 2 levels of categorisation potentially allowing the defining of detail level.  In addition, top-level complexity should neither be too high, i.e.it should be easy to go through the taxonomy, nor it  should not be too flat with too many categories . Additionally, to be clearly understood by the public, the terms  36 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  42  within a taxonomy should be straightforward and easy to explain, i.e. avoiding the use of acronyms such as the term  “DoS”, instead using the term “Denial of Service”.  When incidents occurs at CSIRT level and incident information is published or shared upwards (see information path  below), the taxonomies implemented in this specific case as defined by the body who shares incident information  should be capable of providing context about the incident information. If all n/g CSIRTs have a clear taxonomy  defined for their respective communities, then the information has a natural path:  Figure 6 - Information path.  Where each arrow would represent the sharing of incident information, either by sharing the information directly  following the format of the sharing medium or mapping to another taxonomy.  For instance, mapping the term “Bot” in eCSIRT.net MkII to “Application compromise” in the ENISA taxonomy,  while these terms may not be entirely similar the original concept is not entirely lost.  5.1.3 Case conclusions  While various CSIRTs may not be using the same taxonomy, the adoption of the NIS Directive and the work to be  performed in the CSIRTs Network could serve as a catalyst to normalise the taxonomies used. For instance, to push  the use of taxonomies with similar terms throughout the CSIRTs community increasing the potential for cooperation  and allowing the process of detecting and preventing incidents to become more effective.  Case Study B: Re-categorisation of cyber incidents  5.2.1 Case introduction  One of the typical operational activities that is part of the responsibility of the CSIRT community is the categorisation  and handling of events or incidents. A taxonomy is a crucial component when it comes to categorisation of incidents,  not only must the incident handler correctly interpret the incident, but the handler must then also correctly interpret  the terminology used by the taxonomy to correctly categories the incident or event. In situations where there is a  high turnover of incident handlers or where very large teams operate, the oversight, differing interpretations by  different people or difference of experience may lead to the re-categorisation of an incident. Furthermore, some  incidents may be part of a bigger picture, requiring the re-categorisation of all involved incidents for correctness.  5.2.2 Case Study  The taxonomy plays a vital role in this situation, the incident handler needs to make a decision for first categorisation  (or triage). The incident will be classified on the complexity of the terms of the taxonomy, their mutual exclusivity,  the experience of the handler, and the nature of the incident or event leading to the incident. More mutual  exclusivity may reduce ambiguities that cause the re-categorisation of incidents. Depending on operational  requirements, it may even be the case that an incident or event has multiple categorisations.  This ambiguity may yield additional consequences. For instance, when reporting the decision must be made whether  or not to use only the latest categorisation of an incident and ignore all the iterations before that. However, even  after the report is published and then a categorisation is prompted, then the report needs to be updated too to  reflect such a change. However, an incident can also be re-categorised to provide more clarity on the nature of the  incident, for instance:  Constituency n/g CSIRT Incident information for public  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  43  If an incident is classified as “Abusive content”, changing the classification to “Spam” may provide more insight  into the event or incident.  Furthermore, an incident may be re-categorised depending on the target audience, as some may be interested in  the source of an event, and some on the impact of the event or incident.  Some of the incidents that cause the most ambiguity are those involving spam, malware distribution, and the ones  related to fraud. In those cases, if the taxonomy does not have a sufficient level of mutual exclusion, the triage itself  becomes more ambiguous.  For example, in the case of a taxonomy containing the following:  INCIDENT CLASS INCIDENT TYPE  Malware Infection  Intrusion Account compromise  Information security Unauthorised access  Table 12 - Example taxonomy where one incident falls into multiple incident types and classes.  If there is a malware that causes a compromised account or yields unauthorised access where data is ex-filtrated,  then the first categorisation could potentially fall into either three categories.  This is an example where the terms contained within the taxonomy are not mutually exclusive enough, causing  difficulty in the triage process where the incident handler must rely on experience to aptly categorise the incident  or vulnerability (depending on the source). Additionally, re-categorisation can be triggered when more information  is available from the incident, not necessarily from internal organisational source, but also when an external source  provides new information about an incident.  According to some CSIRTs it is estimated that approximately 20% of incidents get re-categorised into a different  category at least once during their lifecycle. This number is affected by the turnover of security event analysts  and differences in experience yielding more re-categorisations. Suspicious network traffic incidents have the  highest chance to be re-categorised into a more specific category, e.g. a C&C communication detected being re- categorised into targeted malicious email upon investigation.  The chain of events below show an example of an incident being reclassified:  Figure 7 - Chain of events leading to re-classification.  Suspicious network  traffic is detected  A host based  malware detection  is triggered  There are targeted  email incidents  detected  A C&C flow is  detected  Initial forensics  analysis show  malware on host  Timeline indicate  malicious  attachment infect  host initially  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  44  In the chain of events above the incident could potentially be classified and reclassified multiple times depending on  the taxonomy used. If the taxonomy contains many terms that are mutually exclusive, then the chance of re- categorisation using the previous case is high. The same however is applicable to a taxonomy with fewer terms, but  does not contain mutually exclusive categories.  Another approach that could deal with this instead of re-categorising the incident or event, is with the usage of tags.  This would help in the case where an incident may fit into multiple categories. As such, the use of a primary tag could  be the main category.  Re-categorisation of an event can affect reporting, especially to customers with potential impact on the SLA (Service  Level Agreement). This can also potentially impact the prioritisation of which incidents to treat first. This also has  additional implications when considering the confidence of an organisation, there needs to be a repeatable way to  gain confidence in report information.  5.2.3 Case conclusion  It may be possible to reduce the re-categorisation of events or incidents, but it may not be possible to remove the  re-categorisation entirely due to the chain of events, although the mutual exclusivity of the terms of the taxonomy  aid in the reduction, as triage may be performed before the full discovery of the incident life, then re-categorisation  becomes unavoidable. It may be feasible for an event to be able to have a primary category, and additional meta- categories or -tags to further enrich the information about the event.  Case Study C: Using taxonomy for incident handling metrics  5.3.1 Case introduction  A CSIRT has to generate regular reports to their local lawmakers on their recent CSIRT activities. Some of these  reports are done regularly (monthly or yearly) to provide an update of the operations. Some reports are prepared  by special request from the lawmakers. This is often the result of an issue that was raised at the political level, due  to the potential high impact or sensitivity of an event or incident. These issues are not always related to immediate  threats, but can deal with topics that have been covered by the press and for which a politician received questions  (i.e. parliament or the public).  Similar to the reports for politicians, it is expected that n/g CSIRTs provide a regular overview of the “security state”  in their constituency. These quasi-public reports are provided to the press and to other stakeholders.  5.3.2 Case analysis  Although the two type of reports have a different target audience they have a similar construct. They need to  downsize the approach of CSIRTs to report based on \"technology\" to a report aimed towards impact.  A typical line of questioning asked by politicians are or in regards to statistics, such as:  “How many DDoS attacks were there against our government”?  This might introduce a need in the taxonomy for “confirmed” (as being handled via a report) or “not yet confirmed”,  to have an accurate number of attacks and not divulge speculative data.  These types of questions also immediately make room for a taxonomy that supports identifying the target (or victim).  Identification should not be per-victim, but per sector (government, ISPs, financial, etc.). For such a taxonomy the  focus would not be on the incident itself, but on the affected entities.  A taxonomy for this purpose may contain terms such as “Energy” or “Transport” (if referring to critical  infrastructure operating).  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  45  Sometimes it is request that CSIRTs provide the number of serious incidents (as defined by the CSIRT being asked).  This can be dealt with by the taxonomy with impact.  It is important to note that the concept of severity can differ between different institutions. For an incident to be  considered serious by the government, a real impact might be required, whereas an incident considered serious for  a LEA may require there to be a legal follow-up (whether or not it is a criminal case). This difference can be handled  by using different types of “impact”. Not every CSIRT will have to report this to their local LEA’s but as time moves  it is expected that LEA at least need a basic reporting on what is going on. This does not describe reporting incidents  on a 1-1 basis, it is merely reporting on what has been observed (i.e. the general trends).  There may also be requests on knowing how many sensitive incidents or events were observed. The sensitivity also  highly depends on who the entity in question is, or what the audience of their reports consider sensitive, there may  be different types of sensitivity as well. For example:  The defacement of a system that host governmental website may be considered as high impact but low  sensitivity, whereas, the defacement of a system that handles security clearances may have a relatively low  impact but highly sensitive based on the handled data.  This may also lead to the re-categorisation of the incident or event based on the impact or sensitivity.  The definition of impact may also not be static for all entities. Some may be more interested in defining impact as  how much work is required to fix an incident, whereas others may define impact as how much is at stake. An example  of this would be:  A popular sites containing usernames and passwords is compromised, if this data were to leak, users  compromised with a government login may require more effort to be spent on than regular users. I.e. instead  of sending general information email to explain the data breach, certain user groups may need to be contacted  privately.  A taxonomy in this situation would need to handle such information, either with a specified taxonomy that deals  with impact and sensitivity, with terms like “highly sensitive” or “confidential”, or with categories within the  taxonomy that address those issues (number of terms and number of category levels).  Another aspect to consider is privacy, for some types of incidents at specific sources it may be preferred to provide  less specific and more general information, particularly for governmental agencies. To provide the flexibility for a  taxonomy to be able to handle aspects such as sensitivity, impact, or privacy adequately, allowing multiple levels of  categorisation (number of category levels) would enable that, for example:  Consider a taxonomy with 3 classification levels as defined below, where the type refers to the infrastructure in  question, where the sector refers to the sector of the infrastructure and the provider type.  TYPE SECTOR PROVIDER TYPE  Critical infrastructure  Energy  Nuclear power plant  Coal power plant  Water Reservoir  Table 13 - Example infrastructure taxonomy  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  46  Here the following aspects could be defined in the follow way:  As politicians also often decide on the budget it is important to report all the different operational tasks done by a  CSIRT. This involves listing the time spent on things that do not immediately concern a security incident (according  to CSIRT experts it is almost impossible to avoid receiving “non-incident” queries via the regular incident reporting  communication flow). Typically these questions can be of the following format “I have system X, how do I secure it?”  The taxonomy should support categorising these questions. This could be solved with the use of extra tagging. If  multiple questions are received with a similar tag of type (e.g. home routers, WordPress, etc.) this can provide some  insight on whether it is a real attack or press involvement (i.e. the press reporting on a certain type of incidents to  raise awareness, may also increase the number of reports received for that incident).  If the taxonomy feature terminology that could be used to tracking the current state of an incident, i.e. whether it  is solved or still open, may provide some valuable performance measurement metrics if the time between an open  incident and closed incident is kept track of. It should also be considered that each team may have different  expectation of what constitutes a solved incident.  5.3.3 Case conclusion  There are numerous aspects that should be considered when reporting, for the taxonomy to be suitable, a lot of  different metrics and aspects need to be considered. The following are some of the taxonomy considerations that  could be made: target audience, source of incident, nature of incident; impact, sensitivity, and privacy considerations  •An incident at a coal power plant would likely have a lower impact than an incident at a  nuclear power plant  Impact  •An incident at a coal power plant would likely have a lower sensitivity than an incident at a  nuclear power plant  Sensitivity  •Depending on the required privacy there are different ways to report on the incident source  •If high privacy is required, then the incident location can be categorised as “Critical  infrastructure”  •If less privacy is required, but specific details should not be divulged, then the incident source  can be categorised as “Energy sector” under “Critical infrastructure”  •If privacy is not a consideration, then the category can be “Nuclear power plant”  Privacy  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  47  6. Conclusions  This chapter serves to state relevant conclusions based on the previous chapters and their reasoning. It is noteworthy  to keep in mind that not every CSIRT will perform their respective operational activities in an identical manner as  stated in the previous chapter, as such even the conclusions may not apply to every single CSIRT or constituency.  The following conclusions will be detailed below:  Conclusion 1: There is no consensus on concepts and definitions related to  taxonomies  As mentioned before, there are various terms, which have been used in different ways in various studies. These  include: ”information exchange standard”, “ontology”, “taxonomy”, “data type”, “data/field format standard”,  “data/Field representation format”, “classification”, “semantic vocabulary”, “field” and “knowledge map”. In  addition, it seems that there is no clear consensus on the exact interpretation of each one of these terms in the  operational environment. In addition, the definition of taxonomy can vary of the associated use case.  Conclusion 2: Ease of use of taxonomies should be evaluated depending on the use  case  There are several considerations when evaluating ease of use, most importantly, what is considered easy to use by  one CSIRT, may not apply to other CSIRTs, as such ease of use should be evaluated from one of the following point  of views.  Conclusion 1: There is no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies  Conclusion 2: Ease of use of taxonomies should be evaluated depending on the use case  Conclusion 3: Taxonomies currently lack fields to properly handle the impact of an incident, incidents with no  malice intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation  between intrusion attempts and intrusions  Conclusion 4: For reporting incident or event information, it is more effective to have a taxonomy with multiple  levels of categorisation used by incident handlers instead of having a taxonomy specifically for reporting  Conclusion 5: The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies are related to the  complexity, contextual information, mutual exclusivity or ambiguity, performance measurement, impact,  sensitivity, confidentiality, and purpose of taxonomies  Ease of use by humans  •strategic reports and  advisories  Ease of use by systems  •automation:  detection indicators  and low-level data  Combined  •ease use of  taxonomies by  humans and  machines  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  48  6.2.1 Ease of use by humans (for strategic reports and advisories)  There are a number of CSIRTs that use custom taxonomies. Those CSIRTs that are associated with CSIRT networks  or are part of a constituency are encouraged or obligated to use the same or similar taxonomies. In some countries,  CSIRTs have mandates that oblige them to share specific information with a common agreed taxonomy to effectively  share and report upon information.  An observation made during the course of the interviews with the CSIRTs, was that although there were a number  of differences in some of the taxonomies, there were similarities in the style of taxonomy. It was observed that a  number of CSIRTs use taxonomies based off or modified versions of other taxonomies.  6.2.2 Ease of use by systems (for automation of detection of indicators and low-level data)  A lot of taxonomies are implemented in frameworks to automate various processes, such as the sharing of Indicators  of Compromise, the acquisition of incident events, the aggregation and searching of events, etc. These tools enable  the automatic sharing of incident information effectively as most of these are community driven. Since they can  automate the sharing, it gives more incentive for others to share data and receive shared data on the same  framework, encouraging cooperation. The taxonomies used by these frameworks tend to be more technical and  complex than those intended for manual use, as the automation makes the process of recording or sharing incident  information more effective. Additionally, the use of ticketing systems to keep track of the status of incidents is  frequently used.  6.2.3 Combined use of taxonomies by humans and machines  As of the moment of detection of the first event, to the incident being marked as solved, an incident is often treated  by both humans and machines using a combination of taxonomies and systems to track or handle the incidents to  make the process more effective. Some taxonomies used within the MISP taxonomies are also used outside the  framework itself (e.g. such as eCSIRT or ENISA taxonomy). If a machine has the taxonomy completely and  automatically implemented, it helps to integrate IoCs. If an IoC is received and the implemented taxonomy was  properly followed, then the system can feed and understand automatically, allowing the human counterpart to focus  on the incident resolution based on the fed information.  Conclusion 3: Taxonomies currently lack fields to properly handle the impact of an  incident, incidents with no malice intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether  the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation between intrusion attempts and  intrusions  From the qualitative assessment of taxonomy fields and terms it the following was concluded that:   There are currently no adequate fields to define the impact of an incident or event, “Impact” can refer to  either political impact or technology impact (See “Error! Reference source not found.”);   Many taxonomies address issues regarding malicious activity (such as “Malware” or “Sabotage”), but very  few taxonomies contain fields to deal with accidental or none malicious incidents or events. While this may  not represent actionable information for every CSIRT in the community, it may be considered as such by  others;   The majority of the current taxonomies do not currently explicitly categorise ransomware as its own  category, however due to the rising likelihood and the general high impact it can have, it should perhaps be  considered as a new field;   Current taxonomies generally do not have fields to account for whether or not the incident, event, or  vulnerability is confirmed or not (e.g. “Status” -> “Confirmed”), such information would affect statistics and  reporting and may provide useful actionable information;   The different between an intrusion attempt and an intrusion is not explicitly covered in the majority of the  taxonomies assessed. This is however actionable information that may be important to some CSIRTs or  constituencies.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  49  Conclusion 4: For reporting incident or event information, it is more effective to have  a taxonomy with multiple levels of categorisation used by incident handlers instead  of having a taxonomy specifically for reporting  Taxonomies created are usually (if not always) created by a specific entity or group of entities to fulfil a purpose (i.e.  incident handling, classification of information, etc.). As such to fulfil the requirements and aims of said entity or  entities, the taxonomy ostensibly is adapted to their needs. This may have for consequence that the sharing or  reporting in this taxonomy requires some special consideration (such as converting between taxonomies, which may  yield to some loss of contextual information).  When reporting to decision makers, those decision makers will make a judgement based on their understanding of  the information given to them. To ensure that the information given to them is understood as intended, the  terminology should be carefully selected or clearly defined. Therefore, when reporting to the government or media  (who may intend to share acquired information with the public), need to fully understand the information they will  base a decision on or share to the public.  The audience may also have a major impact on the taxonomy layout and terms. As the reports made usually cater  to specific audiences or the audience expect a specific format and terminology, the taxonomy needs to be adapted  to the envisaged purpose (see case study C). In order to accurately cater to different audiences, there should not be  a taxonomy dedicated to reporting, instead the level of detail can be selected by the use of multiple category levels.  When sharing incident or event information (or reporting that information to other CSIRTs) there are considerations  that need to be accounted for which may provide crucial or actionable information for the entity the data is being  shared with:   Not every incident that is reported stems from a security incident. CSIRTs also receive vulnerability  information, as such taxonomy should be able to handle this information (if applicable). Note that a  vulnerability can be a misconfiguration or something exploitable;   The difference between an intrusion and an intrusion attempt may also provide actionable information;   When automatically processing incident information, it is important that the incident handlers understand  the information that is being process.  One of the major areas of improvements, is that there is currently no existing scheme or recommendations to  increase the commonalities in the terms within the taxonomies of all the CSIRTs. While some CSIRTs or  constituencies may be mandated to record and share incident information within their own national or constituency  network in a certain way, there is a lack common and clear accepted definitions for terms.  Conclusion 5: The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies  are related to the complexity, contextual information, mutual exclusivity or  ambiguity, performance measurement, impact, sensitivity, confidentiality, and  purpose of taxonomies  This section lists the various areas of improvement that may be possible based on interviews with the CSIRT  community, and desk research into the taxonomies and past research. Note that even within these areas of  improvement there are things that cannot effectively be addressed, this is mentioned wherever applicable. The  areas of improvements are the major areas of improvements identified and generalised as to be applicable to a  maximum number of CSIRTs within the CSIRT community.  6.5.1 The complexity of the taxonomy  Too many top-level categories or number of terms could increase the complexity of the taxonomy. While a complex  taxonomy could be useful for certain use cases (such as feeding threat intelligence, exchanging information between  CSIRTs, etc.). I.e. there may be benefits if all CSIRTs made use of CAPEC, as it has around 504 attack patterns and in  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  50  some cases 4 or more levels of categorisation, providing a very high level of available detail. The day-to-day usage  may be too cumbersome however and the number of terms and categories may increase the time it takes to  categorise an incident.  There should be a reasonable middle ground. There may be a difference of expectation between producers and  consumers of taxonomies. More data may be better for the consumers of the taxonomy (i.e. more terms to  categorise an incident or event), but this can put additional strain on the producer of the taxonomy to keep the  taxonomy up to date and ensure it is used appropriately (especially if the producer is the consumer as well). The  overall level of complexity depends on the operational requirements and capabilities of CSIRTs. If a taxonomy is too  simple however, then it may not be able to adequately describe the incident or the context of the incident.  6.5.2 Contextual information of the incident or event  Taxonomies do not account for the “big-picture” perspective. For instance, if a user had their credentials hacked and  account on a website compromised as a direct consequence, it was not the website that was compromised, but the  user.  Depending on the criteria of what constitutes an incident, in some situations such as automatically aggregating  incidents, there may not always be a clear way do differentiate between what is an attempt and successful incident  in every taxonomy. As such, if there is no indicator to differentiate both cases, then the attempts could lead to a  false positive. Therefore, it would not be useful as actionable information.  Different taxonomies may not share the same semantic vocabulary, either using the same term for different  concepts or using different terms for the same concept. For example:  A taxonomy may use the term “Worm” to describe the actual malware, while another taxonomy may refer to  “Worm” to describe the malware action (SANS malware taxonomy compared to Veris respectively). Or a  taxonomy may refer to “All incidents which don't fit in one of the given categories should be put into this  category” while other taxonomies may use the term “Other” instead, while the former provides a clear  instruction, the latter is also self-explanatory.  6.5.3 Re-categorisation of events caused due to lack of mutual exclusivity or ambiguity of terms  When processing an incident or the event(s) leading up to the incident, it is possible that an incident may be re- categorised or in multiple categorisation categories throughout the incident lifecycle. This may or may not be a  desired outcome.  Note that the possibility of re-categorisation based on gaining additional information (from internal or external  sources) is still present as outlined in case study B.  6.5.4 Measurement of taxonomy and process performance  Depending on the size of the CSIRT operational team, it may not be feasible to adequately allocate all required  resources to the needs of the incident. In most cases, taxonomies do not inherently support the measurement of  performances of the solving process for each incident. See case study C.  Being able to measure the performance has several operational benefits:   It may provide crucial information regarding the efficiency to solve an incident for each incident type within  the taxonomy;   It may allow the measurement of the performance of the analyst or handler in charge of the incident by  assessing the time taken for solving the incident;   It may help in the identification of any “bottle necks” in the process that could help smooth the workflow.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  51  6.5.5 Impact, sensitivity and information classification  There are several considerations (see case study C). First, the impact and sensitivity of an incident or an event may  not be the same for all constituencies or governments. Second, if the data relates to information that is or should  be classified, then there needs to be a way of effectively keeping track of that.  6.5.6 The purpose of the taxonomy  One of the main aspects that needs to be very clear to adequately make, modify, or use a taxonomy is the purpose  of the taxonomy. One possible limitation of a taxonomy is about the type of things the terms describe (i.e. whether  they describe an action, the source of the incident, critical infrastructure, etc.).Although it is possible to map an  action to a threat actor (or have both of them categorised in one taxonomy), it may not be viable to include all  domains in a single taxonomy. As such, there is no single taxonomy that can deal with all possible domains currently  in existence. This depends on the domain that is to be represented in the taxonomy. Refer to the qualitative  assessment chapter for more detailed information on some of the possible domains of a taxonomy.  Furthermore, it is also possible that not all existing domains relevant to the CSIRT community may be currently  existing as a taxonomy, there are currently very little examples of taxonomies that address abuse domains.

Recommendations  This chapter contains recommendations that can be used related to taxonomies based on the established good  practices. These recommendations have been detailed while taking into account the gaps and problems related to  taxonomies as discussed with the CSIRTs both during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop, as well as the validation call  with CSIRTs on 28 September 2016. Some of the recommendations were included having in mind the tasks to be  performed by the CSIRTs network as described in the NIS Directive. Each of the following recommendations outlines  an area of improvement, a recommendation on how it could be improved, followed by the advantages of the  recommendation:  Each of these recommendations are detailed in the chapters below.  Recommendation 1: A centralized repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies  along with their versions should be set up by ENISA  Due to the high volume of available taxonomies, the abundance of sources and modified versions of those  taxonomies available, there is no clear indication to suggest if the version found is the latest version (note this does  not always apply, as national CSIRTs often keep an up-to-date version of their taxonomy on their website).  To deal with this problem, it would be convenient to have a centralized repository (such as GitHub37) or website  hosted by a central entity where all taxonomies and their versions are visible. Additionally if this included references  such as RFCs, and national and international standards, it would enable anyone to adequately revise, update, or  create a taxonomy based on a wealth of information. This repository or website should be updated regularly, but  only by one team.  This would be a great benefit to the CSIRTs community as not only would it allow the selection of appropriate  taxonomies for specific use cases, but it may also provide a general overview of what taxonomies or variations  thereof are used by CSIRTs, which may be particularly useful in keeping statistics. This would also allow a way of  measuring the usage of a taxonomy.  37 https://github.com/  Recommendation 1: A centralized repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions  should be set up  Recommendation 2: A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should be agreed on EU level  Recommendation 3: An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used as an indicator to revise taxonomies,  if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same type  Recommendation 4: A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be  established on EU level  https://github.com/  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  53  Recommendation 2: A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should  be agreed upon by CSIRTs at EU level  The high numbers of taxonomies does not provide a clear indication on which taxonomy should be used for what  use case. This increases the effort it takes to conduct research into taxonomies if a CSIRT wishes to change, update,  or implement a taxonomy.  While a common taxonomy may not be viable under the current taxonomy landscape, if there were a set of five  taxonomies for five recurring use cases, it may be a first step towards a common taxonomy or at least towards  increased cooperation and exchange within the CSIRT community. Additionally, if the terms within those taxonomies  are agreed upon by the CSIRTs Network, then it may provide the benefit that the descriptions for the terms may be  incorporated into pre-existing taxonomies. A set of common taxonomies would also ease the automatic and manual  exchange of incident or event information.  This would provide example taxonomies based on the requirements of the CSIRTs network, which can then be either  implemented or be used to implement a modified version of the taxonomy, saving time and effort that would be  spent into researching taxonomies. If all relevant taxonomies were centralised, the statistics gathered could also be  used to find common fields, enabling other CSIRTs that do not have the field implemented to consider implementing  it, further normalising the taxonomy landscape.  There is not always a clear indication as to the purpose of a taxonomy, or an indication of what a taxonomy describes  in terms of the event or incident (i.e. whether it refers to the event, the source of the event, the action that caused  the event, etc.).  Recommendation 3: An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the  owners of taxonomies as an indicator to revise taxonomies, if there is an increase in  that category with incidents or events of the same type  Due to the fluid nature of incidents, with a growing number of different events leading to incidents and incidents  themselves, the taxonomy should be pliant enough to enable future additions to it. While most taxonomies do  already contain an “Other” field, the other field should be considered as an indicator to adding new fields to the  taxonomy should there be a surge of incidents or events that fall into the other category but are of the same or  similar type.  A “tag” field (not the same type of tagging than in MISP), would allow specific information of an event or incident to  be recorded. For example:  In a case involving ransomware, it is relevant that it should be categorised ransomware, but also the type of  ransomware (such as crypto locker, etc.), if the same tag repeatedly used then it might also indicate the need  for a new field.  One important aspect to consider is reporting, as the notification of an increase of a specific incident or event will  only happen if it is reported properly.  Recommendation 4: A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the  CSIRTs community should be established by the CSIRTs network on EU level  A practical roadmap should be established to allow the CSIRTs community in the EU to jointly work together (for  example in the context of the CSIRTs Network and the CEF Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure38) to reach  38 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facilities-cybersecurity-digital-service-infrastructure  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facilities-cybersecurity-digital-service-infrastructure  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  54  consensus on a number of key success factors to increase the cooperation and information exchange between them.  The listing below is an indicative roadmap that could be considered by the CSIRTs community.  1. Agree on use cases that would benefit from taxonomies and exchange standards;  2. Agree on definitions and concepts from an operational point of view for each use case;  3. Perform quantitative assessment on the taxonomies used in each Member State of the EU;  4. Agree on centralised repository in line with Recommendation 1 of this study;  5. Agree on a list of tags/values that can apply across taxonomies;  6. Establish a search engine within the centralised repository to looks for such values across all taxonomies;  7. Agree on a set of common taxonomies per use case to put forward for the CSIRTs community in the EU.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  55  8.  Annex  Preliminary discussion on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies  As mentioned in recommendation 4 of this study, it would be beneficial to have the CSIRTs community build a  common interpretation/understanding of key concepts to be used consistently and establish the relation between  these key concepts. During the course of this study various discussions have been held with a number of CSIRTs.  Although this did not result in conclusive results, the sections below have been added to this study as food for  thought and as possible departing point for future work to be performed by CSIRTs. This section summarises various  definitions found by the project team on the key concepts. In addition, we summarise some considerations to be  made in relation to this study.  8.1.1 Information exchange standard  8.1.1.1 Possible definition  An information exchange standard is a common (non-proprietary) language constraining the information transferred  between activities performed by devices, software, or humans, whose goal is to enable effective encoding and  decoding of information to successfully perform the required tasks39.  8.1.1.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  An information exchange standard avoids misunderstanding and ensure a proper documentation and example. For  example, an Information Exchange Standard could say that the structure of information should respect a specific  taxonomy, all dates should respect a specific data format standard, all chain of character should contains a maximum  of 4000 characters etc.  8.1.2 Ontology  8.1.2.1 Possible definition  In computer science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within  a domain, and the relationships between those concepts40.  8.1.2.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  Ontologies are considered as 3-dimensional although by using a taxonomy in an ontology41. The 3rd dimension is  “relationship between concepts”. In addition, ontology is highlighting the inheritance and differentiation exposed  by a taxonomy.  8.1.3 Data representation  8.1.3.1 Possible definition  By data representation is meant, in general, any convention for the arrangement of things in the physical world in  such a way as to enable information to be encoded and later decoded by suitable automatic systems42.  39 Information Modeling for Interoperable Dimensional Metrology by Y Zhao, T Kramer, Robert Brown, Xun Xu  40 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  41 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/getting-the-right-concept-by-using-the-right-words-ontology-taxonomies-for-critical-infrastructures  42 “Data Representation”, C. M.

In addition, the data  representation will be the way a data will be internally processed and/or stored.  8.1.3.3 Example  The image of a triangle (“data”) can be represented as a matrix of dots or as combination of three vectors. Another  example is the representation of a date, which can be either a list of characters (“January, 1st 2000”) or a simple  integer like 946684800.  Data representation is mainly used for internal (within the system implementing taxonomy) representation and  automatic exchange. For example: As depicted in the figure below, an email server will use a specific common data  representation format to be able to transfer an email to another email server; but the last email server may store  the email using its data representation (external). Any tool, like an anti-spam filter having the same data  representation may read the email and process it (internal). In addition, a user may connect directly to the email  server to see the stored email, it would require the email server to use a data representation format so that it is  showing in a human friendly way.

Data types define particular characteristics of data used in  software programs. A data type can be Integer, Date, Text, etc.  8.1.4.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  The data type helps to identify the content of a data without defining any representation or format. Data type may  be part of a semantic vocabulary.  8.1.4.3 Conclusion  For example, the data type can be “date”, it is possible to give a sense of the data but it does not say if the data was  stored as a text, integer and it does not say if the data will be written like “January, 1st 2000” or “01/01/2000”.  8.1.5 Data format standard  8.1.5.1 Possible definition  A data format standard defines how particular information elements are represented in files or in communications  by describing the syntax of a description language and, the semantics associated with those descriptions43.  8.1.5.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  As data representation format may be included in the semantic vocabulary of taxonomies, its form as a “standard”  can also be used in further steps.  8.1.5.3 Examples  For example, the data format standard ISO8601 states that the representation format of the date “January, 1st 2000”  should be 2000-01-01  8.1.6 Data representation format  8.1.6.1 Possible definition  Data representation format is the format used for data representation. A format is a way of presenting data, such  as centring text or adding dollar signs to represent currency; or the order how to represent a date (DD/MM/YYYY,  YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)44 .  8.1.6.2 Examples  For example, the representation format of a month can be a two-digit integer between 1 and 12. Another  representation format could be a value inside a defined vocabulary (“January”, “February”, etc.)  8.1.6.3 Considerations made in relation to this study   The data format indicates how incoming and outgoing data should look like   It gives rules to validate inputs and outputs  43 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  44 http://mlp12.com/task/114  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information http://mlp12.com/task/114  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  59   The data representation format is particularly useful to allow data exchange and may be included in the  semantic vocabulary   Data representation format is mainly used to present data externally and in most of cases to humans or to  external automatic processing. Refer to “Data representation” example.  8.1.7 Classification  8.1.7.1 Possible definition  Classification is designed to group related things together and to define the relationship these things have to each  other45. In addition, classification is the repartition of events and incidents into classes, not to be confused with the  level of classification of a document.46  8.1.7.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  One can group related items on different levels. It is possible to classify data types (scalar, enumeration, etc.), as  well as data representation formats (long format, short format, etc.) and events to classify taxonomies/ontologies.  This is similar to the concept of “attributes” in MISP, which can be put on each level of data.  The NATO level of classification can be seen as an attribute. It is not a classification by itself even if this attribute can  be used to do a classification (like the colour, size or brand of candies).47  Classification is an action that can be performed a taxonomy at every step and level.  It has been noted that in some cases there is a need for a “default fall-back” as a lot of information is not classified.  Therefore, a lot of actionable information starts with a default classification. This is often a problem when data is  received for example in JSON format from a CSIRT and it is classified a TLP AMBER. However, it is not always clear  whether the JSON file is classified as a whole or just the content.  8.1.7.3 Examples  For example, it is possible to classify candies by colour, size, quantity of sugar, brand, etc. It is also possible to classify  people eating candies by age (adult, children, etc.) or by sex (male, female). Another example of data in light of  different classifications: a breach of data in a hospital. All data related to non-medical information (how the breach  happened, exploited vulnerability, location of the data, type of storage, logs) will be classified as \"information leak\"  by a CSIRT, whereas for the same incident the specific medical data (records, content ...) will be classified differently  by a privacy regulator.  8.1.8 Semantic vocabulary  8.1.8.1 Possible definition  A vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets. The vocabulary must be controlled to ensure that each  entry is unambiguous and to also ensure that alternate or less precise terms are excluded48.  8.1.8.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  As well as classification, semantic vocabulary is part of a taxonomy and therefore has to be used at every further  step.  45 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  46 Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  47 https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies  48 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  60  8.1.8.3 Examples  On example of various semantics can be TLP-RED, TLP:RED, TLPRED, TLP RED.  Another example concerns the description of IP. In some cases you can have ambiguity, in some data types you can  have IP addresses where some are source IP and others are destination IP. However, sometimes one just needs IP  information without caring whether it is source or destination. For example, Net Flow records often mix source and  destination IPs. Therefore, in the context of “semantic vocabulary”, when using an IP source, some will just interpret  it as an IP. Therefore, some data cannot be fully interpreted due to lack of level of detail available.  Clarifications related to the available definitions of key concepts  8.2.1 “Taxonomy” vs “Ontology”  A graphical example of a taxonomy versus an ontology: if a taxonomy can be represented as a tree then the ontology  would be a forest. Another possible example of a taxonomy is phylogenetic tree (animals, mammals, etc.). Yet,  another example in a human family, a taxonomy will define the relation between a child and his parents where an  ontology will also define the marriage relation between a child of a family and another child from a distinct family.  The namespace of TLP could be considered to be a taxonomy. On the other hand, for example TLP:RED is often used  with espionage topic, the relationship thereof is rather an ontology.  8.2.2  “Data representation” vs “data representation format”:  Data representation could be seen as an “internal” concept (storing, internal exchanges, etc.) while data  representation format is more an “external” concept (human presentation, serialisation, etc.). For example, a  computer represent the first of January as 946684800 but format it as “January 1st 2000”.  Another example is an MD5 hash which binary wise is 128 bits of data, which is easy to process by system.  Representation of MD5 is usually hexadecimal which in term is used by humans. This example is relevant when  exchanging malware samples  8.2.3 “Information classification” (NATO49/EU) vs “Classification”  Level of information classification (NATO/EU) is an attribute of a document, this attribute can be used for data  classification but it is not a classification by itself. Initially MISP separated this concepts. NATO in the past considered  “classification” to be something different than “tagging” in MISP. Although on paper this might sound different,  when implementing it seems to be the same.

It allows the collection of statistical conclusions such as the relevance of the terms used by  CSIRTs during day-to-day incident handling.  8.5.1 Context  The following section is statistical information provided by CIRCL regarding a single MISP instance and used by a  single community at CIRCL that is composed of around 600 organisation that have read access to the data and around  40-50 organisations that contribute to the instance (i.e. creating events)  While these statistics are composed of data from only one community, meaning they may not be representative of  all CSIRTs, they illustrate the applicability of some of the conclusions made in this chapter (e.g. “Malware” and  “Phishing” are common terms shared within taxonomies due to the large number malware or phishing events  overall).  8.5.2 Statistics  The following are statistics regarding the taxonomies used for sharing based on a single community at CIRCL:  Figure 8 - Statistics of taxonomies used for sharing of information based on a single community at CIRCL.  0,00%  5,00%  10,00%  15,00%  20,00%  25,00%  30,00%  35,00%  40,00%  45,00%  50,00%  Taxonomies used for sharing based on a single community  at CIRCL  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  63  From the above figure, it is observed that this one community uses parts of five taxonomies to share information.  The following taxonomies and their uses are used:   Using CIRCL and eCSIRT to share incident type and event information;   The traffic light protocol (TLP) for categorising sensitivity;   The admiralty scale for categorising the reliability and credibility of the information;   Malware classification for malware categorisation.  The following are statistics regarding the tags used by the CIRCL taxonomy for sharing based on a single community  at CIRCL (Note, due to the use of other taxonomies, the statistics are on the entire dataset, therefore the tags used  will only account for 16.72% of the whole dataset):  Figure 9- Statistics of the CIRCL taxonomy tags used for sharing of information based on a single community at  CIRCL (accounts for around 16.72% of the entire dataset).  From the above figure it is observed that:   In the CIRCL taxonomy the incidents “Malware” and “Phishing” are the most prevalent, and the “Finance”  topic the most used.   The “osint-feed” tag is highly used.

In addition, it provides conclusions and recommendations on improvements that can be made on current  taxonomies.  The methodology followed to collect and assess the information for this study included a stock taking and desk  research, discussions with CSIRTs during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop, interviews with the CSIRT community, a  qualitative assessment of taxonomies (and other formats and schemes relevant to mention) and a validation call  with CSIRTs on 22 September 2016.  A qualitative assessment was performed on an indicative taxonomy landscape, which illustrates various ways of  comparing and assessing taxonomies to determine, for instance, what fields that could be added or extended in  current taxonomies.  In addition, use cases that would benefit from the use of taxonomies have been identified. These use cases include;  recording events from different sources, automatic deduplication, ability to export in other taxonomies, ability to  aggregate and search events in the data, ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs, feeding threat intelligence,  incident report management. For each use case a requirement was identified that a taxonomy should fulfil. An  indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case is also provided both for threat intelligence and incident  management purposes.  Since a comparison of every single taxonomy is not feasible, a couple of indicative examples of comparing  taxonomies are provided. This includes an indicative comparison of fields of taxonomies similar to or based on the  eCSIRT taxonomy 1to determine which fields are common. In addition, a comparison of the complexity of taxonomies  in terms of malware incidents is provided to illustrate different ways of describing the same context available in the  current taxonomy landscape.  Furthermore, a number of good practices that have been identified by various CSIRTs during this study are described  while taking into account shortcomings of taxonomies as identified by CSIRTs. The most relevant good practices  include (a) that the top level categorisation of a taxonomy should be simple, (b) the categories within a taxonomy  should be mutually exclusive, (c) taxonomies should support performance measurement and (d) that taxonomies  should have an appropriate of level of ease of use. In addition, the report describes which good practices of high and  medium relevance apply to which use cases according to the CSIRTs that have been involved in this study.  Three case studies illustrate the use of taxonomies in CSIRT operational activities while taking into account the use  cases established in this study. These include a case study on using taxonomies for a website for major NIS incidents  occurring across the EU for the public, using taxonomies to minimise the re-categorisation of cyber incidents and  using taxonomies for incident handling metrics.  A number of conclusions were reached as a result of this study that should be taken into account in any future work  to be performed by CSIRTs. The following are the most relevant to mention.   There is currently no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies. Clear definitions  reflecting the operational interpretation of the CSIRTs should be considered as a key success factor towards  increasing cooperation between EU Member States. To this end, sections 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3 reflect some of  the discussions held on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies with CSIRTs throughout this study.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/community-projects/existing-taxonomies  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  06  These sections have been added as food for thought and as possible point of departure for future work to  be performed by CSIRTs.   Taxonomies currently lack terms to properly handle the impact of an incident, incidents with no malice  intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation between  intrusion attempts and intrusions.   The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies are based on the complexity,  contextual information, mutual exclusivity or ambiguity, performance measurement, impact, sensitivity,  confidentiality, and purpose of taxonomies.  The following recommendations based on CSIRT input and the good practices are provided:   A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be set up by  ENISA. This would be a great benefit to the CSIRTs community as it would not only allow the selection of  appropriate taxonomies for specific use cases, but it may also provide a general overview of what  taxonomies or variations thereof are used by CSIRTs, which may be particularly useful in keeping statistics.   A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should be agreed upon by CSIRTs at the EU level.  This would provide examples of taxonomies based on the requirements of the CSIRTs network, which can  be either implemented or used to implement a modified version of the taxonomy, saving time and effort  that would be spent into researching taxonomies.   An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the owners of taxonomies as an indicator to revise  taxonomies, if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same type. For example,  in a case involving ransomware, it is relevant that it should be categorised ransomware, but also the type of  ransomware (such as crypto locker, etc.), if the same tag repeatedly used then it might also indicate the  need for a new field.   A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be established at the  EU level by the CSIRTs network. Such a roadmap should at least consider having CSIRTs agree use cases,  definitions and concepts from an operational point of view for each use case; perform quantitative  assessment (in addition to the qualitative assessment in this study) on the taxonomies used, a centralised  repository for taxonomies, and a list of tags/values that can apply across taxonomies.  Finally, this document provides statistical data about taxonomy usage in a real Malware Information Sharing  Platform (MISP) instance maintained by CIRCL. It allows the collection of statistical conclusions such as the relevance  of the terms used by CSIRTs during day-to-day incident handling. While these statistics are composed of data from  only one community, meaning they may not be representative of all CSIRTs, they illustrate the applicability of some  of the conclusions made in this study.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  07  1. Introduction  Purpose  The main objective of this report is to provide relevant good practices in terms of taxonomies for incident detection  and prevention for the CSIRT community. Additionally, it aims to provide conclusions and recommendations based  on the qualitative assessment of taxonomies within the current taxonomy landscape on improvements that can be  made on current taxonomies, such as what fields can be extended or added to existing taxonomies.  Key Concepts and Definitions  It is important to highlight that the following terms have been used in different ways in various studies: ”information  exchange standard”, “ontology”, “taxonomy”, “data type”, “data/field format standard”, “data/Field representation  format”, “classification”, “semantic vocabulary”, “field” and “knowledge map”. In addition, based on feedback  received by various CSIRTs during this study, it seems that there is no clear consensus on the exact interpretation of  each one of these terms in the operational environment. Therefore, although the title and main focus of this report  is on “taxonomies” used in incident detection and prevention, the reader is invited to consider the term “taxonomy”  and other directly and indirectly related terms as something that is to be further discussed and agreed by the CSIRT  community. However, chapter 8.1 does provide the reader with some preliminary insights on the above mentioned  concepts gathered during this study that could serve as a possible basis for further work to be conducted in line with  recommendation 1 “A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be  set up”. It is worth mentioning that the definition of “taxonomy” in previous ENISA studies is as follows:  A taxonomy2 is defined as a classification of terms. Three characteristics define a taxonomy:   a form of classification scheme to group related things together and to define the relationship these  things have to each other;   a semantic vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets; and   a knowledge map to give users an immediately grasp of the overall structure of the knowledge domain  covered by the taxonomy, which should be comprehensive, predictable and easy to navigate.  In addition to this definition, according to some CSIRTs a taxonomy exposes inheritance and differentiation:   Inheritance: Different kinds of objects often have a certain amount in common with each other;   Differentiation: Characteristics of an object, which allow to differentiate an object from another object.  For example, in case of malware you can have the category “malware” with the related characteristics  “downloaders”, “rootkits”.  In addition, according to some CSIRTs, a taxonomy can be considered to be 2- or 3-dimensional. For example, TLP is  an example of a 2-dimensional taxonomy while the classification of malware is usually 3-dimensional as it tends to  have a “namespace” a “predicate” and a “value” (for example, SANS Malware Classification: malware type= value).  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  08  2. Methodology  This chapter outlines the methodology applied to collect and assess the information for this study, including:   Stocktaking and desk research;   Discussions with CSIRTs during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop;   Interviews with the CSIRT community;   A qualitative assessment of taxonomies;   A validation call with CSIRTs on 22 September 2016.  Stocktaking and desktop research  The objective of the stocktaking and desktop research was to identify the relevant taxonomies and relevant studies  for this study. In addition, the findings of the following ENISA reports were taken into account: “Actionable  information for Security Incident Response”3; “Standards and tools used in exchange & processing of actionable  information”4; “Detect, Share and Protect”5; “Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and  Law Enforcement”6.  Discussions with CSIRTs during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop  The 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop took place on 10 & 11 May 2016 in Riga, Latvia. On 11 May 2016, the study team  organised a half-day workshop to discuss the following topics with the CSIRTs for the benefit of this study:   Current taxonomies used for incident detection and prevention within CSIRTs;   Use cases describing the context in which the taxonomies are used;   Current gaps vs. good practices related to the current taxonomies.  Interviews with the CSIRT community  Interviews were conducted with 15 CSIRTs to gain operational information related to the use of taxonomies. The key  notions that were investigated are the following:   Type of operational activities performed by CSIRTs that could benefit from the use of taxonomies;   For what purposes CSIRTs use taxonomies; which of them are easy to use, what are the associated benefits,  etc;   Good practices as regards taxonomy use, creation, or revision.  Qualitative assessment and comparison of the collected taxonomies  A qualitative assessment was performed to evaluate the type and number of fields/terms, structure of taxonomies  and to initiate the good practice guide on taxonomies used in incident detection and prevention.  A validation call with CSIRTs on 28 September 2016  A call was organised with various CSIRTs to validate the main outcomes of this study including its conclusions and  recommendations.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/actionable-information-for-security  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/detect-share-protect-solutions-for-improving-threat-data-exchange-among-certs  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/actionable-information-for-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/detect-share-protect-solutions-for-improving-threat-data-exchange-among-certs https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  09  3. Qualitative assessment of taxonomies used by CSIRTs  This chapter presents the qualitative assessment of taxonomies (and other relevant formats and schemes)  performed on an indicative taxonomy landscape. It illustrates various ways of comparing and assessing taxonomies  to determine things such as common fields shared by taxonomies and what type of fields/terms that could be added  or extended in current taxonomies.

For each use case a  requirement was identified that a taxonomy should fulfil. This linking takes into account the various attributes of a  taxonomy (such as complexity, size, etc. defined below), and insures that the taxonomies selected can adequately  meet the requirements of the use cases.  3.2.1 Use cases and use case requirements  A use case is a list of actions or event steps, typically defining the interactions between a role and a system, to  achieve a goal. In this case, “the system” would consists of the taxonomy and/or an exchange platform. The “goal”  could for example relate to either incident detection or incident prevention.  In use case UC.TI.101 - Recording events from different sources, the goal is to adequately record events with the  applicable system using a taxonomy, where recording the events is the action.  From the use cases, requirements are created in terms of what a taxonomy should provide to fulfil the task or activity  at hand. This is performed because setting requirements in line with the overall goal of the use cases aids in the  identification of which taxonomy that is the most appropriate. The requirements depend on the nature of the data  in question. The requirements in day-to-day operational activities may differ entirely from those set out in the table  below, they are not meant to represent a concrete example, but merely a suggestion of the type of requirement and  qualities of taxonomies that would be suitable for a given situation. The use cases in the table below are based on  interviews with the CSIRT community and research24 conducted on use cases related to incident detection and  prevention specifically for CSIRTs. The use cases employ the following naming convention:   The prefix UC refers to Use Case;   TI and IM after the prefix refer to Threat Intelligence and Incident Management respectively;   0XX and 1XX after represent whether the use case is based on interviews with the CSIRT community (marked  with a 1), or on research (marked with a 0). XX represents the unique identifier of the use case.  The title of the use cases is also representative of the defined goal of the use case. This is followed by a brief  description of the use cases in terms of CSIRT activity and the corresponding requirement that needs to be fulfilled  by the taxonomy:  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/community-projects/existing-taxonomies  22 https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/incident/malware-101-viruses-32848  23 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/meeting39/20130523-DV1.pdf  24 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=14253  information will be entered into the Incident Tracking System (ITS) when  a case is created  Hungarian Taxonomy21 Taxonomy describing who reported an incident.

More terms and complexity. To adequately account  for the varying terminology that different sources of  information may present, a more advanced taxonomy  in terms of semantic vocabulary and number of terms  may be preferable .  UC.TI.002 Automatic  deduplication  Whenever new event, vulnerability, or threat  information is received by the system after a  sharing process by another CSIRT, the system  should be able to recognize whether the  received information has already been ingested  or not.  Maximise mutual exclusivity. The deduplication  process (either by general or specific automatic  “server-side” deduplication of even information) may  be affected by the number of terms and the mutual  exclusivity of them. If there are many terms in a  taxonomy, but they are not overly mutually exclusive,  then an identical incident may be recorded under a  different category, causing a duplicate to remain. This  of course depends on the duplication process itself as  well.  UC.TI.003 Ability to export  in other taxonomies  A CSIRT team member should be able to require  event, vulnerability, or threat information to be  exported in structured and open formats  provided by the platform (e.g. OpenIoC, STIX or  TAXII, and CVE or CVRF, if these specifications  are supported).  High complexity, high number of terms, but simple  top level categories preferable. Exporting in other  taxonomies is affected by the complexity and number  of terms that are being exported from and exported  to. Exporting in a more complex taxonomy requires  more effort than exporting in a simple taxonomy, but  causes less loss of information and context overall.  UC.TI.104 Ability to  aggregate and search  events in the data  A CSIRT team member should be able to  aggregate events using appropriate terms to  classify the event elements, and should also be  able to search those events effectively.  Multiple levels of categories with simple top-level  categories. For aggregation and search of events in  data. It should be simpler to use a taxonomy with  multiple levels of categorisation, as it would speed up  the aggregation and searching of the event.  Furthermore, top-level categories should be simpler  and not numerous, to facilitate the aggregation and  searching process.  UC.TI.105 Ability to  exchange data with other  CSIRTs  A CSIRT team member should, when required, be  able to effectively exchange information with  another CSIRT conveying information accurately  and with no loss of information. Potentially being  able to map taxonomies to enable the  information transfer.  High number of terms and high complexity. It would  be preferable to maximize the information exchange;  as such using a complex taxonomy with larger amount  of terms allows more specific and contextual  information to be exchanged.  3.2.1.2 Linking use cases and use case requirement for incident management  ID AND TITLE DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT  UC.IM.006 Feeding threat  intelligence  A CSIRT team member (i.e. CSIRT incident  handler) indicates an incident as solved or is in  the ongoing process of being solved. The system  should extract information from the incident,  structure that information in a threat format  supported by the system (e.g. STIX) and feed the  threat intelligence platform.  High number of terms and high complexity. To  ensure that the full incident information is available  upon requirement, a maximum amount of  information should be provided. As such using a  taxonomy with high complexity and number of terms  may be appropriate.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  12  ID AND TITLE DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT  UC.IM.007 Incident report  management  A CSIRT team member (i.e. CSIRT incident  handler) should be able to access automatically  generated incident reports and define new  reports (to enable automatic generation) by  specifying properties, such as, but not limited to,  scope, type of incident, priority, time (daily,  weekly, etc.); and visualization (graphs, trends,  or maps).  Low number of terms and low complexity. The target  audience of the report dictates the requirement of  the taxonomy. If the report is to management or none  technical personnel, then the taxonomy should reflect  that by using simple and general terms, whereas if it  is a technical report, the complexity of the taxonomy  should reflect that.  Table 1 - Table of use case as defined by previous research and input from the CSIRT community.  3.2.2 Indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case  To facilitate the linking of the taxonomies to the appropriate use case, the taxonomies are chosen from a reduced  taxonomy pool in the table below. The criteria for the reduced pool is to maximise the variation in taxonomy type  and format. The relevant taxonomies are listed and then categorised as either technical or general. In the table  below, “technical” in the second column refers to whether the taxonomy utilises technical terms that may not be  understood by all audiences. While terms such as “virus” or “worm” are generally understood, some others such as  “XSS” or “CRFS” may not be. As some taxonomies contain both general and technical terms, if a taxonomy contains  many technical terms it will be categorised as technical. The “size of the semantic vocabulary”, in the third column,  is defined in relation to the overall size using eCSIRT.net MkII as a baseline due to its popularity in the CSIRT  community. “Overall complexity” is defined based on the “technical or general” and the number of terms of the  taxonomy.

The table below takes the use cases previously defined in this section and takes into account the taxonomy attributes  defined in the previous table. For each use case and goal, an appropriate taxonomy is selected.  3.2.2.1 Indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case for Threat Intelligence  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  UC.TI.101  Recording  events from  different  sources  Veris Veris provides a comprehensive list of both technical and non-technical terms that are general  enough to record a number of events. This enables effective recording from different sources.  FIRST CSIRT Case  Classification  FIRST CSIRT Case Classification Also is technical enough to gain an understanding of the  transpired event, but it is not restrictive enough to cause loss of meaning. This allows the  recording of events from different sources on a higher level effectively.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  13  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  ENISA Taxonomy The ENISA taxonomy provides a wide range of different incident types. As such, it would be  well suited to handle an incident from various sources. Aspects covered by the taxonomy  include, but are not limited to eavesdropping, interception, hijacking, nefarious activity or  abuse, etc. This allows the handling of event information regardless of whether it originated  from a honeypot, sinkhole, etc.  UC.TI.002  Automatic  deduplication  CERT.pt CERT.pt is low in complexity and general in its terms. This does however mean that each  concept represented in the terms is often mutually exclusive. As this taxonomy has two levels  of categorisation, it further enables mutual exclusivity, which helps in the deduplication  process by avoiding scenarios where the same incident is present more than once due to a  different categorisation.  CCN-STIC 817 CCN-STIC 817 uses a comprehensive list of incident types. The taxonomy also covers a  relatively wide aspect including more technical terms and general terms (“XSS” versus “Human  Error”).  UC.TI.003  Ability to export  in other  taxonomies  Veris Veris contains a large number of terms that can be used to maximise the information  transferred with minimal loss of context. Exporting into other taxonomies is more effective  when a larger set of terms, as it avoids miss-categorisation.  UC.TI.104  Ability to  aggregate and  search events in  the data  CCN-STIC 817 Due to CCN-STIC 817 having multiple levels of categorisation, the aggregation and search can  be performed on the different levels. The top-level categories provided by this taxonomy also  allow to search by action or target, making it particularly useful in searching of event  information. For example, making a search on the result of an incident to map what incidents  have similar outcomes and consequences.  CIRCL CIRCL provides a small number of general terms, as such it makes the process of aggregating  and searching data simpler.  eCSIRT.net MkII eCSIRT.net MkII has multiple levels of categorisation, allowing for effective aggregation and  searching of terms. I.e. events can be aggregated and search using the top-level categorisation,  and the next level down of categorisation can be used to refine the aggregation and search.  UC.TI.105  Ability to  exchange data  with other  CSIRTs  eCSIRT.net MkII Depending on the main type of information exchanged, the eCSIRT.net MkII taxonomy  provides a general semantic vocabulary that could facilitate the sharing of threat information  between CSIRTs.  Veris Veris is the taxonomy used to collect the data volunteered by various CSIRTs for the yearly  Verizon reports. As such, it is tried and tested to work with exchanging data effectively with  other CSIRTs. It contains a great number of technical terms, effectively providing a  comprehensive picture of an incident.  3.2.2.2 Indicative linking of the right taxonomy for the right use case for Incident Management  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  UC.IM.006 Feeding threat  intelligence  Veris  Veris provides an extensive vocabulary, which provides a very comprehensive list of  terms.  UC.IM.007 Incident report  management  eCSIRT.net MkII  This taxonomy provides simple and comprehensible terms that can be used effectively  for a non-technical environment. Additionally, it provides a multi-level categorisation,  where it is possible to abstract to the top-level should the bottom level be too  technical. It allows for use in a more technical environment, as the bottom level  categorisation contains more detail than the top level.  For example, if there was a phishing incident that is registered by a CSIRT, it could be  described “Abusive Content -> SPAM”, “Fraud -> Phishing”.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  14  USE CASE TAXONOMY REASON  CCN-STIC 817  CCN-STIC 817 provides a comprehensive map of terms and a simple top-level category  that can be used to provide different levels of technicality when reporting requires it.  Table 3 - Table linking the taxonomies to specific use cases based on established requirements and metrics  Example comparison of related taxonomies to evaluate common terms  This section provides two examples of comparing related taxonomies:   Comparison of fields of taxonomies similar to or based on the eCSIRT taxonomy to determine which fields  are common;   Comparision of complexity of taxonomies in terms of malware incidents to illustrate different ways of  describing the same context available in the current taxonomy landscape.  Note that comparing every single taxonomy is not feasible as some taxonomies are too different to make comparison  possible (for instance, comparing TLP to Veris). In this respect, an example of a comparison between different  versions of the eCSIRT.net taxonomy is also provided.  3.3.1 Example of comparison of fields of taxonomies similar to or based on the eCSIRT taxonomy  Common fields shared among taxonomies can be determined by comparing fields of popular taxonomies. This  comparison can also illustrate any new fields that can be added to existing taxonomies, as well as extending current  fields according to the needs of the CSIRT community in order to enhance taxonomies.  The following four taxonomies are similar in the sense that they are either used by eCSIRT or part of it as the basis  for the taxonomy:  CERT.PT CERT.BE CESNET CERT ECSIRT.NET MKII  Malware Spam Spam Spam  Botnet Drone Abusive Content Bounce Harassment  Ransomware Malware Virus Child/Sexual/Violence/…  Malware Configuration Scan Malware Virus  C&C  System/Account  Compromised  Trojan Trojan  DDoS (D)DoS Malware Spyware  Scanner Phishing Probe Dialler  Exploit Vulnerability Report Crack Rootkit  Brute-force Other Botnet Scanning  IDS alert  Dos Sniffing  Defacement  Copyright Social Engineering  Compromised  Scam  Exploiting of known  Vulnerabilities  Backdoor  Phishing Login attempts  Drop zone  Pharming New attack signature  Phishing  Other  Privileged Account  Compromise  SPAM  Unknown  Unprivileged Account  Compromise  Vulnerability  Application Compromise  Service  Bot  Other  DoS  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  15  DDoS  Sabotage  It is worth noting that a term from the bottom level category of one taxonomy may be a top category in another  taxonomy. This is the case for “Abusive Content” in CERT.be, which is present as a top-level category in the  eCSIRT.net.  The Venn diagram below displays the terms present in all of the above taxonomies.  Illustrating the fields shared  amongst these taxonomies, each of the ovals contain the terms of the taxonomy, each intersection in the ovals  illustrates that a term, an equivalent term, or similar term are present in multiple taxonomies (such as the term  “Spam” being contained in all the taxonomies below). Where the wording of the term is different, but the context is  similar or the same in different taxonomies, they are grouped in squares.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  16  Figure 1 - Venn diagram comparing the terms of the eCSIRT.net MkII, CERT.pt, CERT.be, and CESNET Cert  taxonomies. Similar concepts with different wording are grouped in squares.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  17  Based on the Venn diagram above the following observations are made:   The most common fields (present in all four taxonomies) shared by the taxonomies are “DDoS”, “Spam”,  “Phishing”, “Malware”, terms for vulnerabilities, “Scan”, and “Other”;   Some of the terms are worded differently or describe different aspects (such as action, process, or entity).  For example, “Scan”, “Scanner”, and “Scanning” represent a similar concept but are worded differently and  do not refer to the concept in the same manner;   CERT.pt is the only taxonomy to mention “Ransomware”, which has been a rapidly growing threat25. As the  likelihood of ransomware is increasing, and the high impact it causes it could be considered as a term to add.  3.3.2 Example of comparing complexity of taxonomies in terms of malware  While many taxonomies describe malware, the level of detail of malware varies among them. To have a clear view  of the difference in the level of detail, the table represents the fields of the taxonomies (for the Veris taxonomy,  only the appropriate category is displayed due to its relatively high number of terms). This comparison allows  conclusions to be drawn, as all of these taxonomies cover the concept of malware somehow, the way in which they  are represented differ. The compared taxonomies are CIRCLE, CERT.pt, SANS, and Veris:  CIRCL CERT.PT26 SANS VERIS  Spam  Malicious  Code  Malware  Malware  Categories  Virus  ACTION  MALWARE  VARIETY  Adware  System  Compromise  Botnet Drone Worm Backdoor  Scan Ransomware Trojan Brute Force  Denial of  service  Malware  Configuration  Ransomware  Capture App  Data  Copyright  Issues  C&C Rootkit  Capture  Stored Data  Phishing Availability DDoS Downloader  Client-Side  Attack  Malware  Information  Gathering  Scanner Adware Click Fraud  XSS  Intrusion  Attempts  Exploit Spyware C2  Vulnerability Brute-force  Obfuscation  categorisation  No-obfuscation Destroy Data  Fastflux IDS Alert Encryption  Disable  Controls  SQL  Injection  Intrusion  Defacement Oligomorphism DoS  Information  Leak  Compromised Metamorphism Downloader  Scam Backdoor Stealth  Exploit  Vulnerability  Information  Content  Security  Dropzone Armouring Export Data  Fraud Phishing Tunnelling  Packet  Sniffer  Abusive  Content  SPAM Retro  Password  Dumper  25 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/report-organizations-must-respond-increasing-threat-ransomware  26 http://www.cncs.gov.pt/cert-pt-2/documents-2/index.html  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/report-organizations-must-respond-increasing-threat-ransomware http://www.cncs.gov.pt/cert-pt-2/documents-2/index.html  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  18  CIRCL CERT.PT26 SANS VERIS  Vulnerable  Vulnerability  Service  Payload  Categorisation  No Payload Ram Scraper  Other Other  Non- Destructive  Payload  Ransomware  Droppers Rootkit  Memory  Categorisation  Resident  Scan  Network  Temporary  Resident  Spam  Swapping  Mode  Spyware /  Keylogger  Non-Resident SQL Injection  Swapping  Mode  Adminware  User Process Worm  Kernel process Unknown  Table 4 - Comparison of possible ways to represent malware with a taxonomy.  From the example above, a number of observations that can be made regarding the difference between taxonomy  fields, especially those concerning the same or a similar concept. The following observations include:  •CIRCL has the most general semantic vocabulary. Malware incidents or events involving malware that  lead to an incident are categorised as malware. This has some benefits in situations where the use of high  level terms is appropriate (reporting, for example).  CIRCL  •Provides the most comprehensive information regarding malware, not only categorising into malware  types (e.g. worm), as well as obfuscation techniques, payload, and memory categorisation in the  taxonomy. In other words, the SANS malware categorisation taxonomy not only classifies malware, but  also its evasion and operation mechanics. In terms of use cases, SANS is technically orientated, meaning it  is well suited for technical reports or personnel, but less well suited for general use.  •It is possible SANS can give more insight into new detailed trends of attack methodologies, which might  not be clear from the other taxonomies. This is because SANS describes the malware itself, whereas Veris  describes the action of the malware.  SANS  • Veris has the most comprehensive list of terms (of the compared taxonomies). There is a distinction  between malware and hacking, but also with each respective distinction being split into variety and  vector. This taxonomy classifies the malware according to what the malware is or does, but also includes  terms to classify propagation (I.e. the threat vector, not shown in the table).  Veris  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  19  3.3.2.1 Contextual differences between similar terms  There is a distinction in the context of the terms in the above example. While semantically the terms “Malware”,  “Malicious Code”, “Malware Category”, and “Malware Variety” are similar, their respective sub-categories can be  divided into two distinct concepts for this specific example:   The action that caused the incident or event - such as “Destroy data” or “SQL Injection”;   The element that made the action that cause the incident or event - “Virus” or “Worm”.  It is also important to consider that in both SANS and Veris the field named “Worm” exists, although the terms are  identical, they are contextually different. This is because SANS describes the malware itself, whereas Veris describes  the action of the malware. While both aspects are important to know, this may also lead to misunderstandings or  different understandings of terms.  3.3.3 Example of a comparison between different versions of the eCSIRT.net taxonomy  This section compares the eCSIRT.net dating from 2003 with the eCSIRT.net MkII27. The following tables illustrate  the additions of the eCSIRT taxonomy upon upgrading it. It contains the incident classes present (the top-level  category), and the incident types from the 2003 version and the incident example from the 2013 version. The  following are incident classes and their sub- categories, which have not had their terms updated or changed:  New terms or modifications are additionally highlighted in bold.  INCIDENT CLASS INCIDENT TYPE (2003) INCIDENT EXAMPLE (2013)  Intrusions  Privileged Account Compromise Privileged Account Compromise  Unprivileged Account  Compromise  Unprivileged Account  Compromise  Application Compromise Application Compromise  Bot  Availability  DoS DoS  DDoS DDoS  Sabotage Sabotage  Outage (no malice)  Fraud  Unauthorized use of resources Unauthorized use of resources  Copyright Copyright  Masquerade  27 https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/meeting39/20130523-DV1.pdf  Abusive Content  Spam  Harassment  Child/sexual/ violence/…  Malicious Code  Virus  Worm  Trojan  Spyware  Information  Gathering  Scanning  Sniffing  Social  engineering  Intrusion Attempts  Exploitation of  known  vulnerabilities  Login attempts  New signature  Information  Security  Unauthorised  access to  information  Unauthorised  modification of  information  https://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/meeting39/20130523-DV1.pdf  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  20  INCIDENT CLASS INCIDENT TYPE (2003) INCIDENT EXAMPLE (2013)  Phishing  Vulnerable  Open for abuse  Other  All incidents which don’t fit in one of the  given categories should be put into this  class  Test  Meant for testing  Table 5 - Comparison of modified categories eCSIRT.net and eCSIRT.net Mk II with additions in bold.  The following observations were made from the above comparison:   This is good example of a taxonomy which explicitly separates the concepts between an intrusion attempt  and a successful one, which can provide useful information in incident analysis;   Terms have been added to account for new threats (i.e. such as “Phishing”);   A category has been added to also keep track of vulnerabilities, this is useful as it is a concept CSIRTs often  need to contend with;   The “Other” category allows the categorisation of any incident or event that was not accounted for. The  major advantage of this category is that if there is an influx of incidents of a similar (new) nature, it can be  used as a point of consideration to revise the taxonomy and account for it. It is also often used for things  that are not incidents or events, such as conference requests, job requests, press, etc.;   The addition of the term of “Outage (no malice)”, allows the taxonomy to cover a broader scope of incidents;   The addition of the term “Bot” is also relevant as it has become a greater and more frequent threat. It may  also be worth considering other more modern terms for all taxonomies to be up to date with the most  current threat landscape.

Good practices for taxonomies used for incident detection and  prevention  This chapter describes a number of good practices identified by various CSIRTs during this study. A good practice can  be described as a practice that has been proven to work well and which produces good results, and therefore can  be recommended as a model. In addition, it is a successful experience, which has been tested, validated and  repeated and deserves to be shared with the CSIRT community to consider it for adoption. Each good practice has  been defined while taking into account shortcomings of taxonomies as identified by CSIRTs. This chapter is organised  as depicted below.   Chapter “4.1 Overview of good practices” provides a high-level overview of the identified good practices  grouped by relevance;   Chapters 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 provide details of the good practices with high relevance, medium relevance and  possible relevance respectively. For each good practice details are provided on what problem or gap has  been taken into consideration, a summary of the good practice, how the good practice addressed the issue  at hand and a practice example;  Chapter “0  4.1 Overview of  good practices  4.2 Details of  most relevant  good practices  4.3 Details of good  practices with  medium relevance  4.4 Details of good  practices with  possible relevance  4.5 Linking the good  practices to the  use cases  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  22   Linking the good practices to the use cases” described which good practice is considered to support which  use case as identified in chapter “3.2  Linking taxonomies to use cases based on defined requirements and metrics”.  Overview of good practices  The good practices have been grouped by relevance to this guide based on the qualitative assessment. However,  actual relevance depends on the reader and his/her context. Good practices established by the interviewed CSIRT  experts that focus on the taxonomies themselves (and less on the CSIRT operational activity practices) are also  assigned a higher priority. This chapter is organised as depicted below.  4.1.1 Overview of the most relevant good practices  The following table contains a quick overview of the good practices identified as “highly relevant” to the CSIRT  community. Note that each good practice is described in more detail in chapter “04.2 Details of most relevant good  practices”.  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING  GP1: The top-level  categorisation of a  taxonomy should  be simple  With simple top-level categorisation we take into account the complexity of the taxonomy. As simple  top level also implies more than one level of categorisation. With a multi-level categorisation system,  the preferred level of complexity can easily be selected. If a non-technical report is required, a higher  and more general categorisation level can be used. If a technical report is required, then using the  bottom level category enables that. In addition, having a low number of top-level categories can  reduce the mutual exclusivity of the categories. Furthermore, a taxonomy with at least 2-3 levels of  categorisation provides the most versatility and scalability, as it gives the choice of adding a branch to  a tree, or adding a leaf to the branch.  GP2: The categories  within a taxonomy  should be mutually  exclusive  This good practice is related to an issue brought forth by a few CSIRTs. The multiple categorisation or  re-categorisation of an incident during the incident lifetime. While sometimes this may be  unavoidable, as laid out in the use case B of a spear phishing campaign, the first time categorisation  of an incident should not cause any doubt. The re-categorisation may influence reporting, as it may  be unclear whether to only take the final category in the report or take account of the previous  categories. (E.g. reporting could include statistics such as “X cases of type A have eventually resulted  in Y cases of type B after final categorisation).  If the taxonomy terms are defined too loosely and if they do not have enough constraints, the same  incident could potentially be categorised differently by two different analysts. It would also make the  machine reading harder due to the added ambiguity.  GP3: Taxonomies  should support  performance  measurement  There are many benefits to allowing a taxonomy to support the measurement of performance in  terms of time taken to solve an incident (both in terms of complexity and person hours to solve it). In  many cases it is for example relevant to know how quick an incident was closed. Some reports need  to include the time needed to close the incident. This good practice was mentioned by several CSIRTs.  A taxonomy with such a feature would allow management to make operational decisions, such as  resource allocation for a type of incident whose estimate complexity and solving time is known. It is  also useful for keeping statistics.  GP4: Taxonomies  should have an  Ease of use needs to be clearly defined and depends on the operational requirement of the CSIRT,  and the use case for which the taxonomy is required. Although ease of use can be interpreted in  4.1.1 Overview of the most relevant good practices  4.1.2 Overview of the medium relevance good practices  4.1.3 Overview of other good practices with possible relevance  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  23  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING  appropriate level of  ease of use  many different ways by different entities, the following attributes may provide relevant and general  aspects of ease of use:   Completeness of the taxonomy;   Complexity of the taxonomy;   Simple first level of categorisation (for example, when triage happens at the emergency desk  in a hospital, the initial intake should be simple, swift and self-explanatory);   If the taxonomy is to be used to report to decision makers, the terms have to be understood  by the decision makers.  These aspects are very important in the day-to-day usage of the taxonomy independently of the use  cases.  Table 6 – Identified good practices with a high relevance to the CSIRT community.  4.1.2 Overview of the medium relevance good practices  The following table contains a quick overview of the good practices identified by the project team as “fairly relevant”  to the CSIRT community. Note that each good practice is described in more detail in chapter “0  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  24  Details of good practices of medium relevance”.  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING  GP5: A taxonomy should  support the tagging of the  event(s) leading to the  incident or tagging of  additional incident  information that is relevant  While this is not achieved using the taxonomy directly, it is an important aspect that helps  provide actionable information that can be applied in various circumstances, such as impact  area, sensitivity, and many more. With this, a CSIRT can add any tag that may be relevant to  their day-to-day operations.  GP6: Taxonomies should be  understood by external  non-CSIRT entities to  effectively share  information  It is crucial that professionals beyond the CSIRT community can at least understand the basics  of the taxonomies, for high-level taxonomies, but not necessarily all taxonomies this includes  professionals such as politicians, lawyers, law enforcement, etc. There may be low-level IoC,  TTPs, etc. taxonomies that are relevant to more technical audiences.  GP7: Taxonomies should be  created or updated using  existing taxonomies or  standards  Since the use of a taxonomy is not limited to sharing incident information or reporting, it may  very well be valid to create a taxonomy based purely on the necessities of an organisation.  However, if an organisation or CSIRT is mandated to use a certain style of taxonomies, then  this good practice does not apply.  GP8: A taxonomy should be  able to differentiate  between a confirmed, not  yet confirmed and  unconfirmed event  The essence of this good practice is that CSIRTs should be able to differentiate between what  is a real event (incoming notification/report) and what is not. The \"what is not\" can mean  different things, either it is not complete, it is a false assumption or it is incorrect. Sometimes  it is not clear from the beginning whether an event is an incident or not.  GP9: A taxonomy should be  able to support reporting  vulnerabilities  While dealing with incidents, CSIRTs also receive vulnerability information. It may be useful to  have a taxonomy that deals with these vulnerabilities, and additionally the taxonomy used  for incident detection and response should be able to mark it as a vulnerability (this can be a  misconfiguration or an exploitable vulnerability).  Table 7 - Identified good practices with a medium relevance to the CSIRT community.  4.1.3 Overview of other good practices with possible relevance  The following table contains an overview other good practices with “possible relevance” to the CSIRT community.  Note that each good practice is described in more detail in chapter “4.4 Details of other good practices with possible  relevance”.  GOOD PRACTICE REASONING TO DETERMINE RELEVANCE  GP10: An implemented  taxonomy should allow an  incident to be traced back  to the source28  May not be applicable to all CSIRTs because it is likely that the information received by CSIRTs  does not specify or are most likely incidents.  GP11: Taxonomies should  be both human readable  and machine readable  May not be applicable to all CSIRTs because most CSIRTs already use combined human and  machine-readable processes as part of their operational activities.  28 Source can be both the attribution to the threat “actor” or the “attack vector” (I.e. the vulnerability, way of entry)  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  25  Table 8 - Identified good practices with a low relevance to the CSIRT community.  Details of most relevant good practices  This chapter describes the most relevant good practices in detail.  Figure 2 - Overview of most relevant good practice.  4.2.1 Good practice 1: The top-level categorisation of a taxonomy should be simple  4.2.1.1 Problem or gap  Too many top-level categories could increase the complexity of the taxonomy. While a complex taxonomy could be  useful for certain use cases (such as feeding threat intelligence, exchanging information between CSIRTs, etc.), the  more complex it becomes. Too much complexity can result in the taxonomy becoming too cumbersome for day-to- day usage.  4.2.1.2 Summary  The top-level categorisation of a taxonomy should not exceed 6-7 categories. The categories should not be flat.  4.2.1.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Having only a limited amount of top-level categorisations allows the simplification of the categorisation process,  especially by humans, but also by machines. It also allows for selective filtering for sharing, feeding, reporting, etc.  When the taxonomy is required to provide reporting at a less technical level, where an abstraction to the top-level  categorisation is appropriate, a lower number of more general terms could increase the understanding and clarity  for the target audience. If terms that are more technical are required or more complexity is desirable, then additional  categories can be considered within a select top-level category, providing both an overview of the categorisation  and the complexity necessary.  Additionally, if there are multiple levels of categorisation present, the recipients of the report should be able to see  what they consider serious. Since what audience A considers serious is not necessarily the same as for audience B,  picking the appropriate depth of categorisation per top-level categorisation allows the customisation of relevant  data (relevant to the target audience).  This good practice facilitates the reporting of information to decision makers and the categorisation process. In  addition, it allows for clearer mutual –exclusivity. It also enables the control of complexity more effectively. Finally,  multiple levels of categorisations allow different levels of detail and technicality to be represented with the same  taxonomy.  4.2.1.4 Practical example  TOP LEVEL CATEGORY BOTTOM LEVEL CATEGORY  Malware  Virus  Worm  Trojan  Table 9 - A simplified example of using multiple levels of categorisation  GP1 - Simple top  level categorisation  GP2 - The categories  within a taxonomy  should be mutually  exclusive  GP3 - Taxonomies  should support  performance  measurement  GP4 - Taxonomies  should have an  appropriate level of  ease of use  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  26  A taxonomy used by an incident handler can also be used to make a non-technical report for management by  abstracting to the top-level category. As such, instead of specifying which type of malware caused the incident,  it would be sufficient to just use the category of “Malware”, instead of specifying a bottom level category.  4.2.2 Good practice 2: The categories within a taxonomy should be mutually exclusive  4.2.2.1 Problem or gap  When processing an incident or the event(s) leading up to the incident, it is possible that an incident may be re- categorised or in multiple categories throughout the incident lifecycle. This may or may not be a desired outcome.  4.2.2.2 Summary  Depending on needs and requirements, the terms within a taxonomy should be as mutually exclusive as possible. In  a taxonomy with multiple levels of categories, the bottom level categorisation should be mutually exclusive. Re- categorisation of incidents can influence reporting. A choice needs to be made if only the latest categorisation should  apply. Reporting could also include statistics such as: “X incidents of categorisation A have eventually resulted in Y  incidents of categorisation B” to keep track of categorisation trends.  4.2.2.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  If mutually exclusive categories exist, this makes the first categorisation of an incident easier, allowing for the  incident to be machine readable, and reduces ambiguity in the terms.  Multiple attribution enables an incident to be categorised multiple times in different categories, which in some  incidents (such as a spear phishing attack/campaign) may provide more information about the incident.  Achieving mutual exclusivity can be achieved by having clear, self-explanatory, and precisely defined terms within  the taxonomy. If a taxonomy has several levels of categorisations (i.e. broad top-level categories branching down  into more specific categories).  4.2.2.4 Practical examples  A CSIRT receives a set of IOCs listing C2 servers for “malware\", as such the initial categorisation in “Malware” is  obvious. No further information is available at this time and the Indicator of Compromise (IOCs) are placed into  the IDS rules.  When hits have been found in the logs the incident is first marked as malware. Then further investigation is  done into the clients, and it is discovered that the malware is “ransomware”. The incident is enriched with this  info, the sub-category (or tag). This is shared with the community. Enriching the IOCs with this set of information  and sharing it improves the quality of the IOCs.  Further investigation is done to check how the ransomware was delivered. It is detected that a previous incident  that was marked as “Spam” contains details on how the ransomware was delivered and has information on the  message content. The initial incident marked as “Spam” is now set to “Malware / Spam”, the malware incident  can be updated with a tag “delivered via e-mail” and “Office document”.  The result of the client investigation also allows to extend the incident with the ransomware family.  4.2.3 Good practice 3: Taxonomies should support performance measurement  4.2.3.1 Problem or gap  Depending on the size of the CSIRT operational team, it may not be feasible to adequately allocate all required  resources to the needs of the incident, as such the prioritisation process needs to take into account the time taken  for each type of incident to facilitate planning.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  27  4.2.3.2 Summary  Introducing metrics that assess aspects such as time required to analyse the events leading to the incident, to solve  an incident, the effectiveness of solving an incident can provide key information about the incident detection and  prevention process. Though the taxonomy itself does not necessarily affect this, it supports the process.  4.2.3.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  With metric information, each type of incident can be assessed in terms of the time it takes to solve the incident,  the effectiveness of the process used to solve it, as well as the effectiveness of employees in solving incidents. Having  a measurement of how many person hours each incident would require, allows for the proper and effective  allocation of resources to it, meaning that more critical incidents can be addressed more adequately.  For performance, the following measurements should be considered:   It should support the measuring of the criticality of a resources - both in terms of complexity and importance  (e.g. a simple SCADA web interface may not be complex, but can be very critical). This would assist in the  triage of the incidents;   It should measure the impact of the incident. As such, it would facilitate the prioritisation of the incident;   It should allow each incident to be measured in terms of the time needed to resolve it and with additional  measurements taken in the incident resolution process;   It should also support in measuring the efficiency of the personnel working on incidents;   It should measure how quickly the incident was closed.  The taxonomy should provide means or additional fields or terms that can be used for performance measurement.  This can either in the form of tags that keep track of the status of an incident, with the time between opening and  solving the incident recorded. Additionally, a taxonomy could also have a field to account for opening and closing  time of an event or incident. With this information the above measurements could be extracted.  4.2.3.4 Practical example  CSIRTs receive a lot of phishing notices, dealing with these reports is a standard procedure. The amount of time  spent on dealing with a standard phishing mail is standard. However, if one of the phishing mails contains a link  to the public government website then it requires more (human) effort and time because:   It is part of the immediate constituency of a government or CSIRTs;   It is sensitive, in the sense of potentially affecting the image or reputation of the affected entity;   It has the impact that the information provided to and received from the public via the website might  be intercepted or altered.  Having a tag “Government” allows to measure how much time was spent on \"gov\"-incidents. If the phishing link  is placed in “Government” then this will again lead to another incident and an investigation on how the website  was exploited.  4.2.4 Good practice 4: Taxonomies should have an appropriate of level of ease of use  4.2.4.1 Problem or gap  If the taxonomy is too complex or has too many terms it becomes impractical and cumbersome to use in day-to-day  activities, such as effectively exchanging data with other CSIRTs or feeding threat intelligence. If a taxonomy is too  simple, then it may not be able to adequately explain the incident or the context of the incident.  4.2.4.2 Summary  While the definition of ease of use depends very much on who and for what purpose the taxonomy was implemented  for, there are a few basic elements that are generally applicable:  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  28   Completeness of the taxonomy – for a taxonomy to be implemented, used correctly and for day-to-day usage,  the taxonomy should contain all the terms in the semantic vocabulary based on operational requirements. To  assure completeness, the best course of action is to learn from national and international standards, or to  consult other national CSIRTs on their approach. Cooperation enabled through CSIRT networks will also help  assure the completeness of the taxonomy. Additionally, the experience gained from implementing and using the  taxonomy on a day-to-day basis, will further uncover and requirements.   Ease of first categorisation (triage) - Mutual exclusivity may not be the top priority of all taxonomies or even  feasible in some cases (i.e. during the course of an incident life cycle, the incident changing categories due to  further investigation).  Regarding the use case \"Recording events from different sources”, it should be taken into account that some  events might include information that in fact contain two incidents. For instance, someone complains that a  website resource is being abused and forwards the logs, however, when the log is looked into the handler also  notices other unwanted behaviour, such as , the system being used as a command and control server , which  leads to the event being split into two different incidents.   Complexity of the taxonomy – while the complexity depends very much on the nature of the operational activity  (be it for reporting information or exchanging indicator of compromise information). In terms of complexity, the  taxonomy should have more than one level of categorisation. Having multiple levels of categorisation will allow  for describing an incident in greater detail, as well as to provide a high-level view if needed.   Simple first categorisation – depending on the precision of the terms of the taxonomy, it is possible that by the  end of the incident lifecycle, the same incident has been categorised multiple times or that the categorisation  changed. Nonetheless, the first categorisation using the taxonomy should be straightforward and simple to do.  This can be achieved by either clearly defining each term in the taxonomy and/or using self-explanatory terms  within the taxonomy.   If the taxonomy is to be used to report to decision makers, the terms have to be understood by the decision  makers - this can be achieved by having multiple levels of categorisation and reverting back to the top level, as  well as having either self-explanatory or clearly defined terms.  4.2.4.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  When a taxonomy is implemented, it is often used on a day-to-day basis (for incident detection). For this purpose,  the taxonomy chosen must be easy to use, which would facilitate the first categorisation of an event.  4.2.4.4 Practical example  The first categorisation can define who deals with the follow-up of the incident, and the resources to be  assigned. This initial process should be swift and quick.  When the incident handlers process the queue in the ticketing system, an incident that is categorised as  “Copyright infringement” will get lower priority compared to an incident marked as “System compromised”.  This facilitates the task of distinguishing the categorisation between these two and to prioritise them.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  29  Details of good practices of medium relevance  This chapter describes the good practices of medium relevance in detail.  Figure 3- Overview of good practice of medium relevance.  4.3.1 Good practice 5: A taxonomy should support the tagging of the event(s) leading to the incident or tagging  of additional incident information that is relevant  4.3.1.1 Problem or gap  Incidents do not have the same impact for everyone, it may not be relevant for different parties to worry about the  same event(s) leading to an incident. Furthermore, there is not just one method to add relevant information if there  is no field to represent it, or critical information may not be represented appropriately.  4.3.1.2 Summary  A taxonomy should support a tagging system that can represent a varied amount of information.  4.3.1.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  While tagging may not necessarily be performed by the taxonomy itself, as framework which allows customisable  tags to be added would provide a critical component that would save time and provide actionable information.  The following non-exhaustive list of tags could be considered:   Impact Area - Not every incident has the same impact for every CSIRT, as such having a tag that allows the  specification of the impact area may allow the facilitation of aggregation and searching of events by  relevance to a particular area or sector (see use cases). Impact area can include, but is not limited to,  industrial sectors, governmental sectors, public sectors, etc.   Constituency or victim type - In some specific cases, such as reporting to politicians. This often entails  answering statistical questions such as \"how many DDoS attacks were observed\" or \"how many of these  attacks involved the government as a victim\". This can also be solved by allowing an incident handling team  to set tags for “victim type” or “constituency”. It is important to note that victim type can include everything  that is in the incident database, such as “all victims with the e-mail address @belgium.be”, “gov”, “sme”,  “critical infrastructure”.   Law Enforcement applicability (if relevant) - Law enforcement sometimes ask that the reporting includes  the marking if an event or incident has led to a criminal act (sometimes also differentiating between a severe  or light act). There is an ongoing debate to know what the full definition of cybercrime, therefore a use for  such a tag should be foreseeable.  GP5 - A taxonomy should  support the tagging of the  event(s) leading to the  incident or tagging of  additional incident  information that is relevant  GP6 - The taxonomy should  be understood by decision  makers and enable other  CSIRTs to effectively share  information  GP7 - Creating or updating  the taxonomy using  standards or existing  taxonomies  GP8 - A taxonomy should  be able to differentiate  between a confirmed, not  yet confirmed and  unconfirmed event  GP9 - A taxonomy should  be able to handle incidents  from vulnerabilities  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  30   Sensitivity - Due to the sensitive nature of some of the incidents, the event(s) leading up to the incident, the  source or target of the incident that occur, a tag that accounts for the sensitivity of the incident could be  included too. Alternatively, the taxonomy could be extended to include sensitive or another taxonomy (such  as the Traffic Light Protocol) could be used. The TLP tags are as follows29:  o “TLP: RED” - Information exclusively and directly given to (a group of) individual recipients. Sharing  outside is not legitimate;  o “TLP: AMBER” - Information exclusively given to an organisation; sharing limited within the  organisation to be effectively acted upon;  o “TLP: GREEN” - Information given to a community or a group of organisations at large. This  information cannot be publicly released;  o “TLP: WHITE” - Information can be shared publicly in accordance with the law.   Classification - Depending on the content of the incident information or with whom this information is  shared, it may be appropriate to use a tag to represent the classification of the incident information. For  example:  For governmental or nation incidents.  With the NIS directive encouraging the sharing of information within the EU, a taxonomy such as EUCI 30 (EU  classified information marking) may be applicable as use for tagging using the following:   “TRÈS SECRET UE/EU TOP SECRET”;   “SECRET UE/EU SECRET”;   “CONFIDENTIEL UE/EU CONFIDENTIAL”;   “RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED”.  It is also possible to use a central management tag list as a starting basis.  Tagging may not be an effective solution for every problem. However, it does provide a convenient way to add  critical and actionable information to the data or to account for any future types of incidents that could arise with  relative minimal effort.  It is also important to consider that if all this information were to be implemented in the taxonomy itself and not  around the taxonomy, then there would be a large number of sub-branches making it cumbersome or even  unusable. Not every CSIRT will use all the branches either, some may only require “Malware” -> “Ransomware”.  4.3.1.4 Practical example  If we consider ransomware, it makes sense to categorise it as “Malware” and then as “Ransomware”. However,  it would also make sense to know the version of the ransomware (e.g. crytpolocker version X). The following  information would be relevant and provide actionable information if existing as tags for the example:   The delivery method, e.g. via an embedded Office document;   Whether or not a decryption method is publically available;   Where the incident took place, e.g. in a public administration;   The impact of the loss of all the data.  29 https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/  30 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/classified-information/  https://www.circl.lu/pub/traffic-light-protocol/ http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/general-secretariat/corporate-policies/classified-information/  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  31  4.3.2 Good practice 6: Taxonomies should be understood by external non-CSIRT entities to effectively share  information  4.3.2.1 Problem or gap  When reporting to decision-makers, these decision-makers will make a judgement based on their understanding of  the information given to them. Therefore, to ensure that the information given to them is understood as intended,  the terminology must be carefully selected or clearly defined. Therefore when reporting to the government or media  (who may intend to share acquired information with the public), need to fully understand the information they will  base a decision on or share to the public.  4.3.2.2 Summary  A taxonomy should allow decisions to be based on the information and wording provided.  4.3.2.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  A taxonomy should reflect that by having a simple and limited top-level categorisation (GP1) of clearly understood  and defined terms. The level of simplicity should be defined based on operational needs or intended target audience.  4.3.2.4 Practical examples  Reporting towards politicians, law enforcement, lawyers, judges, etc. I.e. entities that may be required to make  decisions based on incident information received.  4.3.3 Good practice 7: A taxonomy should be created or updated using standards or existing taxonomies  4.3.3.1 Problem or gap  Taxonomies are usually created to serve a specific organisational purpose. If the taxonomies cannot easily be  mapped, this complicates the exchange of incident information with other CSIRTs..  4.3.3.2 Summary  Taxonomies should be designed, implemented, or revised using established standards or taxonomies in use by other  CSIRTs.  The following are standards, which provide relevant information for creating, implementing, and exchanging  information using taxonomies:   RFC 2350 31- Best Current Practice; Expectations for Computer Security Incident Response;   RFC 2828 32- Internet Security Glossary;   RFC 507033 - The Incident Object Description Exchange Format;   NIST SP 800-61 revision 234 - Computer Security Incident Handling Guide;   NIST SP 800-15035 - Guide to Cyber Threat Information Sharing.  Many CSIRTs already use taxonomies to handle incidents or report on them, having already conducted research into  taxonomies themselves, or learned from using the taxonomy what worked and what did not work. Therefore, it is  advisable to contact the respective national CSIRT before creating a completely new and untested taxonomy. .  31 RFC 2350 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  32 RFC 2828 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2828  33 RFC 5070 - https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070  34 NIST SP 800-61 r2 - http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf  35 NIST SP 800-150 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_second_draft.pdf  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2828 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5070 http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_second_draft.pdf  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  32  4.3.3.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Contacting other CSIRTs to gain more information can save a lot of effort and resources in terms of taxonomy  creation and implementation, as well as usage.  4.3.3.4 Practical examples  Many CSIRTs will exchange threat information via MISP. Information that is stored in MISP often is already  categorized by other participants. By using a taxonomy that also is supported in the tagging of information in  MISP taxonomies, then the category information put there by others remains in the events when synchronizing  them to local instances.  4.3.4 Good practice 8: A taxonomy should be able to differentiate between a confirmed, not yet confirmed and  unconfirmed event  4.3.4.1 Problem or gap  Taxonomies do not all account for contextual difference with regards to intrusions vs. misuse, or a false positive for  a vulnerability. For instance, if an account is compromised on a website, it is not necessarily the website that has  suffered an intrusion, it could be merely the credentials of a user being misused. This distinction can provide key  information in an investigation.  4.3.4.2 Summary  A taxonomy should have the necessary fields to be able to distinguish between whether an incident occurred (e.g.  an intrusion or vulnerability), or an unconfirmed event (e.g. the misuse of the credentials of a user, but not an actual  breach).  As such, the following status terms could be applied:   “Confirmed”;   “No yet confirmed”;   “Unconfirmed”;   “Pending”.  In addition, the taxonomy should be accompanied with a document that clearly defines, in terms of organisational  requirement, for the CSIRT each of the above statuses. This may enable external parties to gain understanding into  the statuses.  4.3.4.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  For this, a field can be added upon the taxonomy to distinguish such detail in relevant cases. This helps in the  investigation and proper categorisation of an incident.  4.3.4.4 Practical examples  The following example provides a high level illustration of the life cycle of an event:  1. A report arrives from a governmental institute that one of the other governmental institutes that  provides them data (via a web interface) has become unavailable. The incident status is “Pending\".  2. Initial investigation shows that the whole network is indeed unreachable.  3. Incident responders try to contact the other .gov network but their SIP telephone infrastructure is not  reachable Initial categorisation can be a DDoS attack. The incident status is “Not yet confirmed\".  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  33  4. When contacting the NOC of the ISP that provides access to both organisations it turns out there has  been a human error causing a routing problem. The incident is an “Unconfirmed event\".  4.3.5 Good practice 9: A taxonomy should be able to support reporting vulnerabilities  4.3.5.1 Problem or gap  Not every incident that is reported stems from a security incident. CSIRTs also receive vulnerability information. A  taxonomy should be able to handle this information (if applicable). Note that a vulnerability can be a  misconfiguration or something exploitable.  4.3.5.2 Summary  A taxonomy should be able to handle incidents and vulnerabilities if applicable.  4.3.5.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  If the taxonomy can handle the sharing and reporting of vulnerability data, then those issues can be resolved more  effectively if the proper authorities are alerted. This can be achieved by adding the required categories to deal with  vulnerabilities, as well as any other incident type to the taxonomy.  4.3.5.4 Practical examples  A DNS server open to a DNS amplification attack needs to be reported just as any other incident would be.  Details of other good practices with possible relevance  This chapter describes the good practices with possible relevance in detail.  4.4.1 Good practice 10: An implemented taxonomy should allow an incident to be traced back to the source  4.4.1.1 Problem or gap  Current taxonomies do not always allow the tracing of incidents back to the source.  4.4.1.2 Summary  The implemented taxonomy should provide sufficient information based on the threat event and the threat actor  that allows the tracing back of the events to the source (can be the source of entry (vulnerability, attack vector) or  the source the attribution. However, when sharing sources and possibly doing attribution, different privacy related  considerations are involved. For instance, to the press it is not appropriate to disclose the exact nature of the  victim(s), while it might be indispensable when dealing with another CSIRT .  4.4.1.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Implementing additional controls around the taxonomy allows the assurance of having the full picture of any given  event. This can be achieved by adding some additional metadata or terminology to track the source of the incident.  4.4.1.4 Practical example  A report of a security incident obtained via a public feed is handled with a different priority than a report  received from a local IDS that’s been setup with your own provided set of rules.  GP10: An implemented  taxonomy should allow  an incident to be traced  back to the source  GP11: Taxonomies  should be both human  readable and machine  readable  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  34  Good practice 11: A taxonomy should be able to differentiate between an attempt and a successful incident  4.4.1.5 Problem or gap  Depending on the criteria of what constitutes an incident, when automatically aggregating incidents, there is not  always a clear way do differentiate between what is an attempt and successful incident. If there is no indicator to  differentiate both cases, the attempts could lead to a false positive. Therefore, it would not be useful as actionable  information.  4.4.1.6 Summary  A taxonomy should be able to differentiate between attempts and successful incidents, and differentiate between  malware and legitimate software wherever possible. Adding an additional field to track whether it was a successful  incident, an attempt, or a false positive.  4.4.1.7 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  It provides a more comprehensive picture of the incidents. Additionally, it would facilitate the searching of incidents  if required by adding an additional search option.  4.4.1.8 Practical example  Sites that run WordPress often see scans for wp-login. The web request for wp-login is something was handled  by automated scanning and is nothing more than just a login attempt. A successful request for the /admin/  pages after the login, however, means a successful incident.  4.4.2 Good practice 11: Taxonomies should be both human-readable and machine readable  4.4.2.1 Problem or gap  When automatically processing incident information, it is important that the incident handlers understand the  information that is being processed.  4.4.2.2 Summary  This can be achieved by clearly defining the terminology of the categories.  4.4.2.3 How does the good practice address the issue and what are the outcomes?  Clear definitions allow the incident to become machine-readable in addition to facilitating a first categorisation of  an incident. This can be achieved with clear definitions for each term within the taxonomy. This can be achieved by  keeping additional documentation with each of the terms defined.  4.4.2.4 Practical example  Examples of this are the JSON files that are included in the MISP taxonomy list. The  https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/enisa/machinetag.json  https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/enisa/machinetag.json  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  35  Linking the good practices to the use cases  This section summarises which good practices of high and medium relevance (as defined in chapters 4.2 and 4.3)  apply to which use cases (as defined in chapter “3.2  Linking taxonomies to use cases based on defined requirements and metrics”) according to the CSIRTs that have  been involved in this study.  4.5.1 UC.TI.101 - Recording events from different sources  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.101 –  Recording events from different sources”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  For this use case, having multiple levels of categorisation is also beneficial, as it allows adjusting  the level of complexity.  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity Mutual exclusivity enables a more effective recording of events. As each distinct source may  require specific terminology or present a different context.  GP3 - Performance  measurements  As this is concerned with different sources, this practice would allow the analysis of each source  and determine statistics such as time taken per source or person hours required to process an  incident per source.  GP4 - Ease of use The level of use required depends on the types of source from which events are recorded.  GP5 - Tagging With the use of tagging, the source can be used as a tag.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  If the source of the event is, for example, a website with authentication, then knowing how the  event occurred is important. Furthermore, knowing the initial results of the event may also  provide crucial information.  GP9 - Vulnerability  incidents  As the incidents stem from different sources, it is highly likely that there will be a vulnerability  among the source. As such, the taxonomy needs to be able to handle such information.  4.5.2 UC.TI.002 - Automatic deduplication  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.002 -  Automatic deduplication”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the corresponding  use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If the categories are not shared and mutually exclusive, this makes removing duplicates easier. If  there are two identical incidents, which are effectively identical but categorized differently, then  a duplicate could remain.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  36  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP4 - Ease of use The level of detail affects the effectiveness of deduplication. In this case, a lower level of detail  and complexity should be implemented. Since more terms may cause identical incidents to be  categorised differently, and therefor duplicate.  4.5.3 UC.TI.003 - Ability to export in other taxonomies  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.003 -  Ability to export in other taxonomies”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If there is mutual exclusion, then there should be clear divide in the concepts represented by the  taxonomy, as such choosing to which category another should be exported/mapped to make it  simpler.  GP4 - Appropriate ease  of use  If a taxonomy has a higher level of completeness is terms of incident types, then exporting into  other taxonomies can be facilitated. This is especially true if the information is exported into a  more general taxonomy, where categories require merging.  4.5.4 UC.TI.104 - Ability to aggregate and search events in the data  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.104 -  Ability to aggregate and search events in the data”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice  supports the corresponding use case. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  Simple top-level categories may simplify the aggregation and search process, as it would allow  for aggregation and search at different levels of categorisation.  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If a taxonomy has a higher level of completeness is terms of incident types, then exporting into  other taxonomies can be facilitated. This is especially true if the information is exported into a  more general taxonomy, where categories require merging.  GP4 - Ease of use If a taxonomy has a higher level of completeness in terms of incident types, then exporting into  other taxonomies can be facilitated. This is especially true if the information is exported into a  more general taxonomy, where categories require merging.  GP5 - Tagging The use of tags would reduce the time it would take to aggregate and to search event data, by  giving more options to aggregate and search for.  GP7 - Using standards  and existing taxonomies  Aggregation of events is facilitated if the terms are already well defined and proven to work if  already implemented elsewhere.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  This helps with both the aggregation and searching of events, as it allows another option to be  used as a filter.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  37  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  GP9 - Vulnerability  Incidents  For aggregation purposes, being able to differentiate an incident stemming from a vulnerability  from other sources may provide valuable information.  GP11 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between  an attempt and a  successful incident  This would simplify the aggregation and searching of events, i.e. provide additional information  that can be used to refine the search or aggregation category  4.5.5 UC.TI.105 - Ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs  The table below lists which good practices of high and medium relevance support achieving use case “UC.TI.105 -  Ability to exchange data with other CSIRTs”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the  corresponding use case.  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity If there are distinct fields, then the data can be shared effectively at greater ease.  GP4 - Ease of use This practice depends on the ease of use of the taxonomy used to exchange within the CSIRT  network. If all the CSIRT members use the same taxonomy, then the ease of use needs to be  adequate to provide a maximum amount of information.  GP6 - Understanding of  decision makers  Information can also be exchanged between LEAs and politicians, i.e. law enforcement and  policy makers. Therefore, it is important that the information is shared in such a manner that  leaves no doubt about the meaning of it.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  The exchanged information should contain information regarding whether the event was  confirmed, not yet confirmed and unconfirmed.  GP9 - Vulnerability  Incidents  To share the maximum amount of relevant information, the type of the information should be  included.  GP 12 - Definition and  the broadness of a  concept within the  taxonomy should be  precise and self- explanatory  Helps automated sharing of data with other CSIRTs.  4.5.6 UC.IM.006 - Feeding threat intelligence  The table below lists the good practices of high and medium relevance that support achieving use case “UC.IM.006  - Feeding threat intelligence”. The “reasoning” column describes how each good practice supports the corresponding  use case.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  38  APPLICABLE GOOD  PRACTICE  REASONING  GP1 - Simple top level  categorisation  Makes the selection process for which types of global level incidents are shared more effective.  GP2 - Mutual exclusivity This ensures the clear distinction between categories, allowing the network to be fed  automatically more effectively, as there are no ambiguities.  GP3 - Performance  measurements  Complexity is an important factor for incident handling. As such complexity needs to be  measured appropriately to allow the estimation of required resources for day-to-day activity.  GP4 - Appropriate ease  of use  This will affect the level of detail the intelligence that is fed possesses, and whether the system  that is being fed can handle the level of detail and completeness of the terms used.  GP5 - Tagging With a tagging system, the relevant incident or event information can be picked out quicker by  providing a term to group incident, or even a tag “For threat intelligence”  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  Depending on who intends to use the intelligence after it is fed into threat intelligence, it is  important for proper and clear definitions to be in place that are also shared over the threat  intelligence feed if possible.  GP9 - Vulnerability  Incidents  To share the maximum amount of relevant information, the type of the information should be  included.  GP11 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between  an attempt and a  successful incident  This is important information to share for threat intelligence, as it provides key information that  can help determine the severity of an event.  GP 12 - Definition and  the broadness of a  concept within the  taxonomy should be  precise and self- explanatory  Having clearly explain concepts in place allows the sharing to be more effective.

Including required complexity,  completeness, etc. Regardless of ease of use, it is an important practice to consider.  GP6 - Understanding of  decision makers  Clearly defining a taxonomy may be very important depending on the audience of the report. If  the audience is a politician with the power to make decisions that potentially affect others, the  each high level term must be clearly defined.  GP8 - A taxonomy  should be able to  differentiate between a  confirmed, not yet  confirmed and  unconfirmed event  Being able to report separately on confirmed, not yet confirmed and unconfirmed event is  important.

Case studies demonstrating the use of taxonomies  Case studies provide relevant information gathered from the CSIRT community to illustrate each of the cases  specified in this chapter. The objective of these case studies is to illustrate the use of taxonomies in CSIRT operational  activity while taking into account the use cases established in previous chapters.  This chapter contains three case studies. Each case study is introduced in terms of the situation presented and the  involvement of a taxonomy. Further, the case is analysed taking into account CSIRT operational activities and a brief  conclusion illustrates what can be drawn from the case and what the impact is.  The following case studies will be explored in the sections below:  Figure 4 - Overview of the case studies in this chapter.  The figure below is the outline of the case studies, the case studies in this chapter will adhere to this structure:  Figure 5 - Structure of the case studies in this chapter.  Case Study A: Website or page dedicated for major NIS incidents occurring across the EU for the general  public to support the use of taxonomies  5.1.1 Case introduction  Information about NIS (Network and Information Security) incidents is increasingly valuable to the public and  businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses as their livelihood could depend on the integrity and  confidentiality of their information. In some cases, such information is already provided via websites at the national  level, in the language of a specific country and focusing mainly on incidents and occurrences with a national  dimension. Given that businesses increasingly operate cross-border and citizens use online services, information on  incidents should be provided in an aggregated form at EU level.  Case Study A - Website  for major NIS incidents  occurring across the EU  for the general public  Case Study B - Re- categorisation of cyber  incidents  Case Study C - Using  taxonomies for incident  handling metrics  •The case introduction provides the background information regarding the case to set the stage  for the analysis.  Case introduction  •The case analysis assesses the overall case, taking into account the previously established use  cases and taxonomy metrics.  Case analysis  •The case conclusions draws the pertinent information from the introduction and analysis, and  outlines the main relevant outcome or consequence associated with the case.  Case conclusions  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  41  According to recital 40 of the NIS Directive36, the secretariat of the CSIRTs Network is encouraged to maintain a  website or host a dedicated page on an existing website where general information on major NIS incidents occurring  across the Union is put at the disposal of the public, with a specific focus on the interests and needs of businesses.  CSIRTs participating in the CSIRTs Network are encouraged to provide on a voluntary basis the information to be  published in this website. However, such a website is not supposed to include confidential or sensitive information.  5.1.2 Case study  To ensure a sufficient level of incident information contained in a publically accessible location, the taxonomy should  have the right attributes. As such, the following are some of the requirements that may be applicable for such public  information:   Easy to understand - While CSIRTs can contend with complex and technical terms, to ensure public  understanding of each of the terms used, the terms should remain simple and general, or at least clearly  defined somewhere;   Both human and machine-readable - Due to the number of incidents that could potentially be submitted to  this public portal, it may be cumbersome to process them all manually, as such automating the process for  machine use may be beneficial. However, since the target audience is not likely to have the same experience  level as a CSIRT expert, it should to be understood by humans too. If incident information is received from a  member CSIRT or constituency and if they followed the taxonomy properly, the system can feed and  automatically understand the incident information. Effectively easing the integration of incident  information. It is also worth noting that machine readable information may be more technical than strictly  human readable information;   Have more than one detail level - If a member of the public has more knowledge in the area of a specific  incident, it may be useful for that person to be able to get a more detailed explanation of the incident.  For the information to be understood by the public, but also provide more detail should it be required, a taxonomy  in this context should have at least one level of categorisation, but no more than three, where the top layer should  be as simple as possible and the next layers down providing more information about the incident specifics.  For example the table below, the public may want to know that a major incident involved “information  gathering”, but may not be interested or may not have the expertise for concepts such as “sniffing”. In that  case knowing that an incident is of the top level category is important, and the bottom level category provides  additional useful details  TOP LEVEL CATEGORY BOTTOM LEVEL CATEGORY  Information gathering  Scanning  Sniffing  Social engineering  Table 11 - Example of 2 levels of categorisation potentially allowing the defining of detail level.  In addition, top-level complexity should neither be too high, i.e.it should be easy to go through the taxonomy, nor it  should not be too flat with too many categories . Additionally, to be clearly understood by the public, the terms  36 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  42  within a taxonomy should be straightforward and easy to explain, i.e. avoiding the use of acronyms such as the term  “DoS”, instead using the term “Denial of Service”.  When incidents occurs at CSIRT level and incident information is published or shared upwards (see information path  below), the taxonomies implemented in this specific case as defined by the body who shares incident information  should be capable of providing context about the incident information. If all n/g CSIRTs have a clear taxonomy  defined for their respective communities, then the information has a natural path:  Figure 6 - Information path.  Where each arrow would represent the sharing of incident information, either by sharing the information directly  following the format of the sharing medium or mapping to another taxonomy.  For instance, mapping the term “Bot” in eCSIRT.net MkII to “Application compromise” in the ENISA taxonomy,  while these terms may not be entirely similar the original concept is not entirely lost.  5.1.3 Case conclusions  While various CSIRTs may not be using the same taxonomy, the adoption of the NIS Directive and the work to be  performed in the CSIRTs Network could serve as a catalyst to normalise the taxonomies used. For instance, to push  the use of taxonomies with similar terms throughout the CSIRTs community increasing the potential for cooperation  and allowing the process of detecting and preventing incidents to become more effective.  Case Study B: Re-categorisation of cyber incidents  5.2.1 Case introduction  One of the typical operational activities that is part of the responsibility of the CSIRT community is the categorisation  and handling of events or incidents. A taxonomy is a crucial component when it comes to categorisation of incidents,  not only must the incident handler correctly interpret the incident, but the handler must then also correctly interpret  the terminology used by the taxonomy to correctly categories the incident or event. In situations where there is a  high turnover of incident handlers or where very large teams operate, the oversight, differing interpretations by  different people or difference of experience may lead to the re-categorisation of an incident. Furthermore, some  incidents may be part of a bigger picture, requiring the re-categorisation of all involved incidents for correctness.  5.2.2 Case Study  The taxonomy plays a vital role in this situation, the incident handler needs to make a decision for first categorisation  (or triage). The incident will be classified on the complexity of the terms of the taxonomy, their mutual exclusivity,  the experience of the handler, and the nature of the incident or event leading to the incident. More mutual  exclusivity may reduce ambiguities that cause the re-categorisation of incidents. Depending on operational  requirements, it may even be the case that an incident or event has multiple categorisations.  This ambiguity may yield additional consequences. For instance, when reporting the decision must be made whether  or not to use only the latest categorisation of an incident and ignore all the iterations before that. However, even  after the report is published and then a categorisation is prompted, then the report needs to be updated too to  reflect such a change. However, an incident can also be re-categorised to provide more clarity on the nature of the  incident, for instance:  Constituency n/g CSIRT Incident information for public  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  43  If an incident is classified as “Abusive content”, changing the classification to “Spam” may provide more insight  into the event or incident.  Furthermore, an incident may be re-categorised depending on the target audience, as some may be interested in  the source of an event, and some on the impact of the event or incident.  Some of the incidents that cause the most ambiguity are those involving spam, malware distribution, and the ones  related to fraud. In those cases, if the taxonomy does not have a sufficient level of mutual exclusion, the triage itself  becomes more ambiguous.  For example, in the case of a taxonomy containing the following:  INCIDENT CLASS INCIDENT TYPE  Malware Infection  Intrusion Account compromise  Information security Unauthorised access  Table 12 - Example taxonomy where one incident falls into multiple incident types and classes.  If there is a malware that causes a compromised account or yields unauthorised access where data is ex-filtrated,  then the first categorisation could potentially fall into either three categories.  This is an example where the terms contained within the taxonomy are not mutually exclusive enough, causing  difficulty in the triage process where the incident handler must rely on experience to aptly categorise the incident  or vulnerability (depending on the source). Additionally, re-categorisation can be triggered when more information  is available from the incident, not necessarily from internal organisational source, but also when an external source  provides new information about an incident.  According to some CSIRTs it is estimated that approximately 20% of incidents get re-categorised into a different  category at least once during their lifecycle. This number is affected by the turnover of security event analysts  and differences in experience yielding more re-categorisations. Suspicious network traffic incidents have the  highest chance to be re-categorised into a more specific category, e.g. a C&C communication detected being re- categorised into targeted malicious email upon investigation.  The chain of events below show an example of an incident being reclassified:  Figure 7 - Chain of events leading to re-classification.  Suspicious network  traffic is detected  A host based  malware detection  is triggered  There are targeted  email incidents  detected  A C&C flow is  detected  Initial forensics  analysis show  malware on host  Timeline indicate  malicious  attachment infect  host initially  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  44  In the chain of events above the incident could potentially be classified and reclassified multiple times depending on  the taxonomy used. If the taxonomy contains many terms that are mutually exclusive, then the chance of re- categorisation using the previous case is high. The same however is applicable to a taxonomy with fewer terms, but  does not contain mutually exclusive categories.  Another approach that could deal with this instead of re-categorising the incident or event, is with the usage of tags.  This would help in the case where an incident may fit into multiple categories. As such, the use of a primary tag could  be the main category.  Re-categorisation of an event can affect reporting, especially to customers with potential impact on the SLA (Service  Level Agreement). This can also potentially impact the prioritisation of which incidents to treat first. This also has  additional implications when considering the confidence of an organisation, there needs to be a repeatable way to  gain confidence in report information.  5.2.3 Case conclusion  It may be possible to reduce the re-categorisation of events or incidents, but it may not be possible to remove the  re-categorisation entirely due to the chain of events, although the mutual exclusivity of the terms of the taxonomy  aid in the reduction, as triage may be performed before the full discovery of the incident life, then re-categorisation  becomes unavoidable. It may be feasible for an event to be able to have a primary category, and additional meta- categories or -tags to further enrich the information about the event.  Case Study C: Using taxonomy for incident handling metrics  5.3.1 Case introduction  A CSIRT has to generate regular reports to their local lawmakers on their recent CSIRT activities. Some of these  reports are done regularly (monthly or yearly) to provide an update of the operations. Some reports are prepared  by special request from the lawmakers. This is often the result of an issue that was raised at the political level, due  to the potential high impact or sensitivity of an event or incident. These issues are not always related to immediate  threats, but can deal with topics that have been covered by the press and for which a politician received questions  (i.e. parliament or the public).  Similar to the reports for politicians, it is expected that n/g CSIRTs provide a regular overview of the “security state”  in their constituency. These quasi-public reports are provided to the press and to other stakeholders.  5.3.2 Case analysis  Although the two type of reports have a different target audience they have a similar construct. They need to  downsize the approach of CSIRTs to report based on \"technology\" to a report aimed towards impact.  A typical line of questioning asked by politicians are or in regards to statistics, such as:  “How many DDoS attacks were there against our government”?  This might introduce a need in the taxonomy for “confirmed” (as being handled via a report) or “not yet confirmed”,  to have an accurate number of attacks and not divulge speculative data.  These types of questions also immediately make room for a taxonomy that supports identifying the target (or victim).  Identification should not be per-victim, but per sector (government, ISPs, financial, etc.). For such a taxonomy the  focus would not be on the incident itself, but on the affected entities.  A taxonomy for this purpose may contain terms such as “Energy” or “Transport” (if referring to critical  infrastructure operating).  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  45  Sometimes it is request that CSIRTs provide the number of serious incidents (as defined by the CSIRT being asked).  This can be dealt with by the taxonomy with impact.  It is important to note that the concept of severity can differ between different institutions. For an incident to be  considered serious by the government, a real impact might be required, whereas an incident considered serious for  a LEA may require there to be a legal follow-up (whether or not it is a criminal case). This difference can be handled  by using different types of “impact”. Not every CSIRT will have to report this to their local LEA’s but as time moves  it is expected that LEA at least need a basic reporting on what is going on. This does not describe reporting incidents  on a 1-1 basis, it is merely reporting on what has been observed (i.e. the general trends).  There may also be requests on knowing how many sensitive incidents or events were observed. The sensitivity also  highly depends on who the entity in question is, or what the audience of their reports consider sensitive, there may  be different types of sensitivity as well. For example:  The defacement of a system that host governmental website may be considered as high impact but low  sensitivity, whereas, the defacement of a system that handles security clearances may have a relatively low  impact but highly sensitive based on the handled data.  This may also lead to the re-categorisation of the incident or event based on the impact or sensitivity.  The definition of impact may also not be static for all entities. Some may be more interested in defining impact as  how much work is required to fix an incident, whereas others may define impact as how much is at stake. An example  of this would be:  A popular sites containing usernames and passwords is compromised, if this data were to leak, users  compromised with a government login may require more effort to be spent on than regular users. I.e. instead  of sending general information email to explain the data breach, certain user groups may need to be contacted  privately.  A taxonomy in this situation would need to handle such information, either with a specified taxonomy that deals  with impact and sensitivity, with terms like “highly sensitive” or “confidential”, or with categories within the  taxonomy that address those issues (number of terms and number of category levels).  Another aspect to consider is privacy, for some types of incidents at specific sources it may be preferred to provide  less specific and more general information, particularly for governmental agencies. To provide the flexibility for a  taxonomy to be able to handle aspects such as sensitivity, impact, or privacy adequately, allowing multiple levels of  categorisation (number of category levels) would enable that, for example:  Consider a taxonomy with 3 classification levels as defined below, where the type refers to the infrastructure in  question, where the sector refers to the sector of the infrastructure and the provider type.  TYPE SECTOR PROVIDER TYPE  Critical infrastructure  Energy  Nuclear power plant  Coal power plant  Water Reservoir  Table 13 - Example infrastructure taxonomy  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  46  Here the following aspects could be defined in the follow way:  As politicians also often decide on the budget it is important to report all the different operational tasks done by a  CSIRT. This involves listing the time spent on things that do not immediately concern a security incident (according  to CSIRT experts it is almost impossible to avoid receiving “non-incident” queries via the regular incident reporting  communication flow). Typically these questions can be of the following format “I have system X, how do I secure it?”  The taxonomy should support categorising these questions. This could be solved with the use of extra tagging. If  multiple questions are received with a similar tag of type (e.g. home routers, WordPress, etc.) this can provide some  insight on whether it is a real attack or press involvement (i.e. the press reporting on a certain type of incidents to  raise awareness, may also increase the number of reports received for that incident).  If the taxonomy feature terminology that could be used to tracking the current state of an incident, i.e. whether it  is solved or still open, may provide some valuable performance measurement metrics if the time between an open  incident and closed incident is kept track of. It should also be considered that each team may have different  expectation of what constitutes a solved incident.  5.3.3 Case conclusion  There are numerous aspects that should be considered when reporting, for the taxonomy to be suitable, a lot of  different metrics and aspects need to be considered. The following are some of the taxonomy considerations that  could be made: target audience, source of incident, nature of incident; impact, sensitivity, and privacy considerations  •An incident at a coal power plant would likely have a lower impact than an incident at a  nuclear power plant  Impact  •An incident at a coal power plant would likely have a lower sensitivity than an incident at a  nuclear power plant  Sensitivity  •Depending on the required privacy there are different ways to report on the incident source  •If high privacy is required, then the incident location can be categorised as “Critical  infrastructure”  •If less privacy is required, but specific details should not be divulged, then the incident source  can be categorised as “Energy sector” under “Critical infrastructure”  •If privacy is not a consideration, then the category can be “Nuclear power plant”  Privacy  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  47  6. Conclusions  This chapter serves to state relevant conclusions based on the previous chapters and their reasoning. It is noteworthy  to keep in mind that not every CSIRT will perform their respective operational activities in an identical manner as  stated in the previous chapter, as such even the conclusions may not apply to every single CSIRT or constituency.  The following conclusions will be detailed below:  Conclusion 1: There is no consensus on concepts and definitions related to  taxonomies  As mentioned before, there are various terms, which have been used in different ways in various studies. These  include: ”information exchange standard”, “ontology”, “taxonomy”, “data type”, “data/field format standard”,  “data/Field representation format”, “classification”, “semantic vocabulary”, “field” and “knowledge map”. In  addition, it seems that there is no clear consensus on the exact interpretation of each one of these terms in the  operational environment. In addition, the definition of taxonomy can vary of the associated use case.  Conclusion 2: Ease of use of taxonomies should be evaluated depending on the use  case  There are several considerations when evaluating ease of use, most importantly, what is considered easy to use by  one CSIRT, may not apply to other CSIRTs, as such ease of use should be evaluated from one of the following point  of views.  Conclusion 1: There is no consensus on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies  Conclusion 2: Ease of use of taxonomies should be evaluated depending on the use case  Conclusion 3: Taxonomies currently lack fields to properly handle the impact of an incident, incidents with no  malice intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation  between intrusion attempts and intrusions  Conclusion 4: For reporting incident or event information, it is more effective to have a taxonomy with multiple  levels of categorisation used by incident handlers instead of having a taxonomy specifically for reporting  Conclusion 5: The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies are related to the  complexity, contextual information, mutual exclusivity or ambiguity, performance measurement, impact,  sensitivity, confidentiality, and purpose of taxonomies  Ease of use by humans  •strategic reports and  advisories  Ease of use by systems  •automation:  detection indicators  and low-level data  Combined  •ease use of  taxonomies by  humans and  machines  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  48  6.2.1 Ease of use by humans (for strategic reports and advisories)  There are a number of CSIRTs that use custom taxonomies. Those CSIRTs that are associated with CSIRT networks  or are part of a constituency are encouraged or obligated to use the same or similar taxonomies. In some countries,  CSIRTs have mandates that oblige them to share specific information with a common agreed taxonomy to effectively  share and report upon information.  An observation made during the course of the interviews with the CSIRTs, was that although there were a number  of differences in some of the taxonomies, there were similarities in the style of taxonomy. It was observed that a  number of CSIRTs use taxonomies based off or modified versions of other taxonomies.  6.2.2 Ease of use by systems (for automation of detection of indicators and low-level data)  A lot of taxonomies are implemented in frameworks to automate various processes, such as the sharing of Indicators  of Compromise, the acquisition of incident events, the aggregation and searching of events, etc. These tools enable  the automatic sharing of incident information effectively as most of these are community driven. Since they can  automate the sharing, it gives more incentive for others to share data and receive shared data on the same  framework, encouraging cooperation. The taxonomies used by these frameworks tend to be more technical and  complex than those intended for manual use, as the automation makes the process of recording or sharing incident  information more effective. Additionally, the use of ticketing systems to keep track of the status of incidents is  frequently used.  6.2.3 Combined use of taxonomies by humans and machines  As of the moment of detection of the first event, to the incident being marked as solved, an incident is often treated  by both humans and machines using a combination of taxonomies and systems to track or handle the incidents to  make the process more effective. Some taxonomies used within the MISP taxonomies are also used outside the  framework itself (e.g. such as eCSIRT or ENISA taxonomy). If a machine has the taxonomy completely and  automatically implemented, it helps to integrate IoCs. If an IoC is received and the implemented taxonomy was  properly followed, then the system can feed and understand automatically, allowing the human counterpart to focus  on the incident resolution based on the fed information.  Conclusion 3: Taxonomies currently lack fields to properly handle the impact of an  incident, incidents with no malice intended, explicit fields for ransomware, whether  the incident is confirmed, and the differentiation between intrusion attempts and  intrusions  From the qualitative assessment of taxonomy fields and terms it the following was concluded that:   There are currently no adequate fields to define the impact of an incident or event, “Impact” can refer to  either political impact or technology impact (See “Error! Reference source not found.”);   Many taxonomies address issues regarding malicious activity (such as “Malware” or “Sabotage”), but very  few taxonomies contain fields to deal with accidental or none malicious incidents or events. While this may  not represent actionable information for every CSIRT in the community, it may be considered as such by  others;   The majority of the current taxonomies do not currently explicitly categorise ransomware as its own  category, however due to the rising likelihood and the general high impact it can have, it should perhaps be  considered as a new field;   Current taxonomies generally do not have fields to account for whether or not the incident, event, or  vulnerability is confirmed or not (e.g. “Status” -> “Confirmed”), such information would affect statistics and  reporting and may provide useful actionable information;   The different between an intrusion attempt and an intrusion is not explicitly covered in the majority of the  taxonomies assessed. This is however actionable information that may be important to some CSIRTs or  constituencies.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  49  Conclusion 4: For reporting incident or event information, it is more effective to have  a taxonomy with multiple levels of categorisation used by incident handlers instead  of having a taxonomy specifically for reporting  Taxonomies created are usually (if not always) created by a specific entity or group of entities to fulfil a purpose (i.e.  incident handling, classification of information, etc.). As such to fulfil the requirements and aims of said entity or  entities, the taxonomy ostensibly is adapted to their needs. This may have for consequence that the sharing or  reporting in this taxonomy requires some special consideration (such as converting between taxonomies, which may  yield to some loss of contextual information).  When reporting to decision makers, those decision makers will make a judgement based on their understanding of  the information given to them. To ensure that the information given to them is understood as intended, the  terminology should be carefully selected or clearly defined. Therefore, when reporting to the government or media  (who may intend to share acquired information with the public), need to fully understand the information they will  base a decision on or share to the public.  The audience may also have a major impact on the taxonomy layout and terms. As the reports made usually cater  to specific audiences or the audience expect a specific format and terminology, the taxonomy needs to be adapted  to the envisaged purpose (see case study C). In order to accurately cater to different audiences, there should not be  a taxonomy dedicated to reporting, instead the level of detail can be selected by the use of multiple category levels.  When sharing incident or event information (or reporting that information to other CSIRTs) there are considerations  that need to be accounted for which may provide crucial or actionable information for the entity the data is being  shared with:   Not every incident that is reported stems from a security incident. CSIRTs also receive vulnerability  information, as such taxonomy should be able to handle this information (if applicable). Note that a  vulnerability can be a misconfiguration or something exploitable;   The difference between an intrusion and an intrusion attempt may also provide actionable information;   When automatically processing incident information, it is important that the incident handlers understand  the information that is being process.  One of the major areas of improvements, is that there is currently no existing scheme or recommendations to  increase the commonalities in the terms within the taxonomies of all the CSIRTs. While some CSIRTs or  constituencies may be mandated to record and share incident information within their own national or constituency  network in a certain way, there is a lack common and clear accepted definitions for terms.  Conclusion 5: The identified areas for potential improvement of existing taxonomies  are related to the complexity, contextual information, mutual exclusivity or  ambiguity, performance measurement, impact, sensitivity, confidentiality, and  purpose of taxonomies  This section lists the various areas of improvement that may be possible based on interviews with the CSIRT  community, and desk research into the taxonomies and past research. Note that even within these areas of  improvement there are things that cannot effectively be addressed, this is mentioned wherever applicable. The  areas of improvements are the major areas of improvements identified and generalised as to be applicable to a  maximum number of CSIRTs within the CSIRT community.  6.5.1 The complexity of the taxonomy  Too many top-level categories or number of terms could increase the complexity of the taxonomy. While a complex  taxonomy could be useful for certain use cases (such as feeding threat intelligence, exchanging information between  CSIRTs, etc.). I.e. there may be benefits if all CSIRTs made use of CAPEC, as it has around 504 attack patterns and in  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  50  some cases 4 or more levels of categorisation, providing a very high level of available detail. The day-to-day usage  may be too cumbersome however and the number of terms and categories may increase the time it takes to  categorise an incident.  There should be a reasonable middle ground. There may be a difference of expectation between producers and  consumers of taxonomies. More data may be better for the consumers of the taxonomy (i.e. more terms to  categorise an incident or event), but this can put additional strain on the producer of the taxonomy to keep the  taxonomy up to date and ensure it is used appropriately (especially if the producer is the consumer as well). The  overall level of complexity depends on the operational requirements and capabilities of CSIRTs. If a taxonomy is too  simple however, then it may not be able to adequately describe the incident or the context of the incident.  6.5.2 Contextual information of the incident or event  Taxonomies do not account for the “big-picture” perspective. For instance, if a user had their credentials hacked and  account on a website compromised as a direct consequence, it was not the website that was compromised, but the  user.  Depending on the criteria of what constitutes an incident, in some situations such as automatically aggregating  incidents, there may not always be a clear way do differentiate between what is an attempt and successful incident  in every taxonomy. As such, if there is no indicator to differentiate both cases, then the attempts could lead to a  false positive. Therefore, it would not be useful as actionable information.  Different taxonomies may not share the same semantic vocabulary, either using the same term for different  concepts or using different terms for the same concept. For example:  A taxonomy may use the term “Worm” to describe the actual malware, while another taxonomy may refer to  “Worm” to describe the malware action (SANS malware taxonomy compared to Veris respectively). Or a  taxonomy may refer to “All incidents which don't fit in one of the given categories should be put into this  category” while other taxonomies may use the term “Other” instead, while the former provides a clear  instruction, the latter is also self-explanatory.  6.5.3 Re-categorisation of events caused due to lack of mutual exclusivity or ambiguity of terms  When processing an incident or the event(s) leading up to the incident, it is possible that an incident may be re- categorised or in multiple categorisation categories throughout the incident lifecycle. This may or may not be a  desired outcome.  Note that the possibility of re-categorisation based on gaining additional information (from internal or external  sources) is still present as outlined in case study B.  6.5.4 Measurement of taxonomy and process performance  Depending on the size of the CSIRT operational team, it may not be feasible to adequately allocate all required  resources to the needs of the incident. In most cases, taxonomies do not inherently support the measurement of  performances of the solving process for each incident. See case study C.  Being able to measure the performance has several operational benefits:   It may provide crucial information regarding the efficiency to solve an incident for each incident type within  the taxonomy;   It may allow the measurement of the performance of the analyst or handler in charge of the incident by  assessing the time taken for solving the incident;   It may help in the identification of any “bottle necks” in the process that could help smooth the workflow.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  51  6.5.5 Impact, sensitivity and information classification  There are several considerations (see case study C). First, the impact and sensitivity of an incident or an event may  not be the same for all constituencies or governments. Second, if the data relates to information that is or should  be classified, then there needs to be a way of effectively keeping track of that.  6.5.6 The purpose of the taxonomy  One of the main aspects that needs to be very clear to adequately make, modify, or use a taxonomy is the purpose  of the taxonomy. One possible limitation of a taxonomy is about the type of things the terms describe (i.e. whether  they describe an action, the source of the incident, critical infrastructure, etc.).Although it is possible to map an  action to a threat actor (or have both of them categorised in one taxonomy), it may not be viable to include all  domains in a single taxonomy. As such, there is no single taxonomy that can deal with all possible domains currently  in existence. This depends on the domain that is to be represented in the taxonomy. Refer to the qualitative  assessment chapter for more detailed information on some of the possible domains of a taxonomy.  Furthermore, it is also possible that not all existing domains relevant to the CSIRT community may be currently  existing as a taxonomy, there are currently very little examples of taxonomies that address abuse domains.

Recommendations  This chapter contains recommendations that can be used related to taxonomies based on the established good  practices. These recommendations have been detailed while taking into account the gaps and problems related to  taxonomies as discussed with the CSIRTs both during the 11th CSIRT ENISA Workshop, as well as the validation call  with CSIRTs on 28 September 2016. Some of the recommendations were included having in mind the tasks to be  performed by the CSIRTs network as described in the NIS Directive. Each of the following recommendations outlines  an area of improvement, a recommendation on how it could be improved, followed by the advantages of the  recommendation:  Each of these recommendations are detailed in the chapters below.  Recommendation 1: A centralized repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies  along with their versions should be set up by ENISA  Due to the high volume of available taxonomies, the abundance of sources and modified versions of those  taxonomies available, there is no clear indication to suggest if the version found is the latest version (note this does  not always apply, as national CSIRTs often keep an up-to-date version of their taxonomy on their website).  To deal with this problem, it would be convenient to have a centralized repository (such as GitHub37) or website  hosted by a central entity where all taxonomies and their versions are visible. Additionally if this included references  such as RFCs, and national and international standards, it would enable anyone to adequately revise, update, or  create a taxonomy based on a wealth of information. This repository or website should be updated regularly, but  only by one team.  This would be a great benefit to the CSIRTs community as not only would it allow the selection of appropriate  taxonomies for specific use cases, but it may also provide a general overview of what taxonomies or variations  thereof are used by CSIRTs, which may be particularly useful in keeping statistics. This would also allow a way of  measuring the usage of a taxonomy.  37 https://github.com/  Recommendation 1: A centralized repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions  should be set up  Recommendation 2: A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should be agreed on EU level  Recommendation 3: An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used as an indicator to revise taxonomies,  if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same type  Recommendation 4: A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be  established on EU level  https://github.com/  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  53  Recommendation 2: A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should  be agreed upon by CSIRTs at EU level  The high numbers of taxonomies does not provide a clear indication on which taxonomy should be used for what  use case. This increases the effort it takes to conduct research into taxonomies if a CSIRT wishes to change, update,  or implement a taxonomy.  While a common taxonomy may not be viable under the current taxonomy landscape, if there were a set of five  taxonomies for five recurring use cases, it may be a first step towards a common taxonomy or at least towards  increased cooperation and exchange within the CSIRT community. Additionally, if the terms within those taxonomies  are agreed upon by the CSIRTs Network, then it may provide the benefit that the descriptions for the terms may be  incorporated into pre-existing taxonomies. A set of common taxonomies would also ease the automatic and manual  exchange of incident or event information.  This would provide example taxonomies based on the requirements of the CSIRTs network, which can then be either  implemented or be used to implement a modified version of the taxonomy, saving time and effort that would be  spent into researching taxonomies. If all relevant taxonomies were centralised, the statistics gathered could also be  used to find common fields, enabling other CSIRTs that do not have the field implemented to consider implementing  it, further normalising the taxonomy landscape.  There is not always a clear indication as to the purpose of a taxonomy, or an indication of what a taxonomy describes  in terms of the event or incident (i.e. whether it refers to the event, the source of the event, the action that caused  the event, etc.).  Recommendation 3: An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the  owners of taxonomies as an indicator to revise taxonomies, if there is an increase in  that category with incidents or events of the same type  Due to the fluid nature of incidents, with a growing number of different events leading to incidents and incidents  themselves, the taxonomy should be pliant enough to enable future additions to it. While most taxonomies do  already contain an “Other” field, the other field should be considered as an indicator to adding new fields to the  taxonomy should there be a surge of incidents or events that fall into the other category but are of the same or  similar type.  A “tag” field (not the same type of tagging than in MISP), would allow specific information of an event or incident to  be recorded. For example:  In a case involving ransomware, it is relevant that it should be categorised ransomware, but also the type of  ransomware (such as crypto locker, etc.), if the same tag repeatedly used then it might also indicate the need  for a new field.  One important aspect to consider is reporting, as the notification of an increase of a specific incident or event will  only happen if it is reported properly.  Recommendation 4: A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the  CSIRTs community should be established by the CSIRTs network on EU level  A practical roadmap should be established to allow the CSIRTs community in the EU to jointly work together (for  example in the context of the CSIRTs Network and the CEF Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure38) to reach  38 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facilities-cybersecurity-digital-service-infrastructure  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/connecting-europe-facilities-cybersecurity-digital-service-infrastructure  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  54  consensus on a number of key success factors to increase the cooperation and information exchange between them.  The listing below is an indicative roadmap that could be considered by the CSIRTs community.  1. Agree on use cases that would benefit from taxonomies and exchange standards;  2. Agree on definitions and concepts from an operational point of view for each use case;  3. Perform quantitative assessment on the taxonomies used in each Member State of the EU;  4. Agree on centralised repository in line with Recommendation 1 of this study;  5. Agree on a list of tags/values that can apply across taxonomies;  6. Establish a search engine within the centralised repository to looks for such values across all taxonomies;  7. Agree on a set of common taxonomies per use case to put forward for the CSIRTs community in the EU.  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  55  8.  Annex  Preliminary discussion on concepts and definitions related to taxonomies  As mentioned in recommendation 4 of this study, it would be beneficial to have the CSIRTs community build a  common interpretation/understanding of key concepts to be used consistently and establish the relation between  these key concepts. During the course of this study various discussions have been held with a number of CSIRTs.  Although this did not result in conclusive results, the sections below have been added to this study as food for  thought and as possible departing point for future work to be performed by CSIRTs. This section summarises various  definitions found by the project team on the key concepts. In addition, we summarise some considerations to be  made in relation to this study.  8.1.1 Information exchange standard  8.1.1.1 Possible definition  An information exchange standard is a common (non-proprietary) language constraining the information transferred  between activities performed by devices, software, or humans, whose goal is to enable effective encoding and  decoding of information to successfully perform the required tasks39.  8.1.1.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  An information exchange standard avoids misunderstanding and ensure a proper documentation and example. For  example, an Information Exchange Standard could say that the structure of information should respect a specific  taxonomy, all dates should respect a specific data format standard, all chain of character should contains a maximum  of 4000 characters etc.  8.1.2 Ontology  8.1.2.1 Possible definition  In computer science and information science, an ontology formally represents knowledge as a set of concepts within  a domain, and the relationships between those concepts40.  8.1.2.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  Ontologies are considered as 3-dimensional although by using a taxonomy in an ontology41. The 3rd dimension is  “relationship between concepts”. In addition, ontology is highlighting the inheritance and differentiation exposed  by a taxonomy.  8.1.3 Data representation  8.1.3.1 Possible definition  By data representation is meant, in general, any convention for the arrangement of things in the physical world in  such a way as to enable information to be encoded and later decoded by suitable automatic systems42.  39 Information Modeling for Interoperable Dimensional Metrology by Y Zhao, T Kramer, Robert Brown, Xun Xu  40 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  41 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/getting-the-right-concept-by-using-the-right-words-ontology-taxonomies-for-critical-infrastructures  42 “Data Representation”, C. M. Sperberg-McQueen, Black Mesa Technology, David Dubin, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/news-items/getting-the-right-concept-by-using-the-right-words-ontology-taxonomies-for-critical-infrastructures  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  56  8.1.3.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  Data representation has to be strictly defined and respected in order to keep data accurate. In addition, the data  representation will be the way a data will be internally processed and/or stored.  8.1.3.3 Example  The image of a triangle (“data”) can be represented as a matrix of dots or as combination of three vectors. Another  example is the representation of a date, which can be either a list of characters (“January, 1st 2000”) or a simple  integer like 946684800.  Data representation is mainly used for internal (within the system implementing taxonomy) representation and  automatic exchange. For example: As depicted in the figure below, an email server will use a specific common data  representation format to be able to transfer an email to another email server; but the last email server may store  the email using its data representation (external). Any tool, like an anti-spam filter having the same data  representation may read the email and process it (internal). In addition, a user may connect directly to the email  server to see the stored email, it would require the email server to use a data representation format so that it is  showing in a human friendly way.

Data types define particular characteristics of data used in  software programs. A data type can be Integer, Date, Text, etc.  8.1.4.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  The data type helps to identify the content of a data without defining any representation or format. Data type may  be part of a semantic vocabulary.  8.1.4.3 Conclusion  For example, the data type can be “date”, it is possible to give a sense of the data but it does not say if the data was  stored as a text, integer and it does not say if the data will be written like “January, 1st 2000” or “01/01/2000”.  8.1.5 Data format standard  8.1.5.1 Possible definition  A data format standard defines how particular information elements are represented in files or in communications  by describing the syntax of a description language and, the semantics associated with those descriptions43.  8.1.5.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  As data representation format may be included in the semantic vocabulary of taxonomies, its form as a “standard”  can also be used in further steps.  8.1.5.3 Examples  For example, the data format standard ISO8601 states that the representation format of the date “January, 1st 2000”  should be 2000-01-01  8.1.6 Data representation format  8.1.6.1 Possible definition  Data representation format is the format used for data representation. A format is a way of presenting data, such  as centring text or adding dollar signs to represent currency; or the order how to represent a date (DD/MM/YYYY,  YYYY-MM-DD, etc.)44 .  8.1.6.2 Examples  For example, the representation format of a month can be a two-digit integer between 1 and 12. Another  representation format could be a value inside a defined vocabulary (“January”, “February”, etc.)  8.1.6.3 Considerations made in relation to this study   The data format indicates how incoming and outgoing data should look like   It gives rules to validate inputs and outputs  43 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information  44 http://mlp12.com/task/114  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/actionable-information/standards-and-tools-for-exchange-and-processing-of-actionable-information http://mlp12.com/task/114  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  59   The data representation format is particularly useful to allow data exchange and may be included in the  semantic vocabulary   Data representation format is mainly used to present data externally and in most of cases to humans or to  external automatic processing. Refer to “Data representation” example.  8.1.7 Classification  8.1.7.1 Possible definition  Classification is designed to group related things together and to define the relationship these things have to each  other45. In addition, classification is the repartition of events and incidents into classes, not to be confused with the  level of classification of a document.46  8.1.7.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  One can group related items on different levels. It is possible to classify data types (scalar, enumeration, etc.), as  well as data representation formats (long format, short format, etc.) and events to classify taxonomies/ontologies.  This is similar to the concept of “attributes” in MISP, which can be put on each level of data.  The NATO level of classification can be seen as an attribute. It is not a classification by itself even if this attribute can  be used to do a classification (like the colour, size or brand of candies).47  Classification is an action that can be performed a taxonomy at every step and level.  It has been noted that in some cases there is a need for a “default fall-back” as a lot of information is not classified.  Therefore, a lot of actionable information starts with a default classification. This is often a problem when data is  received for example in JSON format from a CSIRT and it is classified a TLP AMBER. However, it is not always clear  whether the JSON file is classified as a whole or just the content.  8.1.7.3 Examples  For example, it is possible to classify candies by colour, size, quantity of sugar, brand, etc. It is also possible to classify  people eating candies by age (adult, children, etc.) or by sex (male, female). Another example of data in light of  different classifications: a breach of data in a hospital. All data related to non-medical information (how the breach  happened, exploited vulnerability, location of the data, type of storage, logs) will be classified as \"information leak\"  by a CSIRT, whereas for the same incident the specific medical data (records, content ...) will be classified differently  by a privacy regulator.  8.1.8 Semantic vocabulary  8.1.8.1 Possible definition  A vocabulary to describe knowledge and information assets. The vocabulary must be controlled to ensure that each  entry is unambiguous and to also ensure that alternate or less precise terms are excluded48.  8.1.8.2 Considerations made in relation to this study  As well as classification, semantic vocabulary is part of a taxonomy and therefore has to be used at every further  step.  45 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  46 Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement  47 https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies  48 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/metrics/ontology/ontology_taxonomies  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  60  8.1.8.3 Examples  On example of various semantics can be TLP-RED, TLP:RED, TLPRED, TLP RED.  Another example concerns the description of IP. In some cases you can have ambiguity, in some data types you can  have IP addresses where some are source IP and others are destination IP. However, sometimes one just needs IP  information without caring whether it is source or destination. For example, Net Flow records often mix source and  destination IPs. Therefore, in the context of “semantic vocabulary”, when using an IP source, some will just interpret  it as an IP. Therefore, some data cannot be fully interpreted due to lack of level of detail available.  Clarifications related to the available definitions of key concepts  8.2.1 “Taxonomy” vs “Ontology”  A graphical example of a taxonomy versus an ontology: if a taxonomy can be represented as a tree then the ontology  would be a forest. Another possible example of a taxonomy is phylogenetic tree (animals, mammals, etc.). Yet,  another example in a human family, a taxonomy will define the relation between a child and his parents where an  ontology will also define the marriage relation between a child of a family and another child from a distinct family.  The namespace of TLP could be considered to be a taxonomy. On the other hand, for example TLP:RED is often used  with espionage topic, the relationship thereof is rather an ontology.  8.2.2  “Data representation” vs “data representation format”:  Data representation could be seen as an “internal” concept (storing, internal exchanges, etc.) while data  representation format is more an “external” concept (human presentation, serialisation, etc.). For example, a  computer represent the first of January as 946684800 but format it as “January 1st 2000”.  Another example is an MD5 hash which binary wise is 128 bits of data, which is easy to process by system.  Representation of MD5 is usually hexadecimal which in term is used by humans. This example is relevant when  exchanging malware samples  8.2.3 “Information classification” (NATO49/EU) vs “Classification”  Level of information classification (NATO/EU) is an attribute of a document, this attribute can be used for data  classification but it is not a classification by itself. Initially MISP separated this concepts. NATO in the past considered  “classification” to be something different than “tagging” in MISP. Although on paper this might sound different,  when implementing it seems to be the same.

It allows the collection of statistical conclusions such as the relevance of the terms used by  CSIRTs during day-to-day incident handling.  8.5.1 Context  The following section is statistical information provided by CIRCL regarding a single MISP instance and used by a  single community at CIRCL that is composed of around 600 organisation that have read access to the data and around  40-50 organisations that contribute to the instance (i.e. creating events)  While these statistics are composed of data from only one community, meaning they may not be representative of  all CSIRTs, they illustrate the applicability of some of the conclusions made in this chapter (e.g. “Malware” and  “Phishing” are common terms shared within taxonomies due to the large number malware or phishing events  overall).  8.5.2 Statistics  The following are statistics regarding the taxonomies used for sharing based on a single community at CIRCL:  Figure 8 - Statistics of taxonomies used for sharing of information based on a single community at CIRCL.  0,00%  5,00%  10,00%  15,00%  20,00%  25,00%  30,00%  35,00%  40,00%  45,00%  50,00%  Taxonomies used for sharing based on a single community  at CIRCL  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  63  From the above figure, it is observed that this one community uses parts of five taxonomies to share information.  The following taxonomies and their uses are used:   Using CIRCL and eCSIRT to share incident type and event information;   The traffic light protocol (TLP) for categorising sensitivity;   The admiralty scale for categorising the reliability and credibility of the information;   Malware classification for malware categorisation.  The following are statistics regarding the tags used by the CIRCL taxonomy for sharing based on a single community  at CIRCL (Note, due to the use of other taxonomies, the statistics are on the entire dataset, therefore the tags used  will only account for 16.72% of the whole dataset):  Figure 9- Statistics of the CIRCL taxonomy tags used for sharing of information based on a single community at  CIRCL (accounts for around 16.72% of the entire dataset).  From the above figure it is observed that:   In the CIRCL taxonomy the incidents “Malware” and “Phishing” are the most prevalent, and the “Finance”  topic the most used.   The “osint-feed” tag is highly used.

From the above figure it is observed that:   TLP accounts for the majority of the dataset, due to the ease of use and applicability to almost every event  or incident;   The “Malware” tag is frequently used;   The “OSINT” or Open-source intelligence is often used, indicating that information was gathered from  publically available sources.  The following are statistics about the top 10 most common artefacts used for sharing:  Figure 15 - Top 10 fields used for sharing of information based on a single community at CIRCL (accounts for  around 93.03% of the entire dataset).  From the above figure it is observed that:   Hashes are very commonly shared   IPs, hostnames, domains, URLs, and links are very commonly shared   Credit card numbers are commonly shared  The following are statistics about attribute types shared in the community:  0,00%  5,00%  10,00%  15,00%  20,00%  25,00%  30,00%  Top 5 tags to share information based on a single community at CIRCL  0,00%  5,00%  10,00%  15,00%  20,00%  25,00%  Top 10 fields to share information based on a single community at CIRCL  A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  December 2016  67  Figure 16 - Attribute types used for sharing of information based on a single community at CIRCL (accounts for  around 100% of the entire dataset).

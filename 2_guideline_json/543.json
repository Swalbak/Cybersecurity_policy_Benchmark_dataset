We were able to see impressive changes in top threats, increased  complexity of attacks, successful internationally coordinated operations of law enforcement and  security vendors, but also successful attacks on vital security functions of the internet.  Many of the changes in the top threats can be attributed to successful law enforcement operations  and mobilisation of the cyber-security community:   The take down of GameOver Zeus botnet has almost immediately stopped infection campaigns  and Command and Control communication with infected machines.   Last year’s arrest of the developers of Blackhole has shown its effect in 2014 when use of the  exploit kit has been massively reduced.   NTP-based reflection within DDoS attacks are declining as a result of a reduction of infected  servers. This in turn was due to awareness raising efforts within the security community.   SQL injection, one of the main tools used to compromise web sites, is on the decline due to a  broader understanding of the issue in the web development community.   Taking off-line Silk Road 2 and another 400 hidden services in the dark net has created a shock in  TOR community, both at the attackers and TOR users ends.  But there is a dark side of the threat landscape of 2014:   SSL and TLS, the core security protocols of the internet have been under massive stress, after a  number of incidents have unveiled significant flaws in their implementation .   2014 can be called the year of data breach. The massive data breaches that have been identified  demonstrate how effectively cyber threat agents abuse security weaknesses of businesses and  governments.   A vulnerability found in the BASH shell may have a long term impact on a large number of  components using older versions, often implemented as embedded software.   Privacy violations, revealed through media reports on surveillance practices have weakened the  trust of users in the internet and e-services in general.   Increased sophistication and advances in targeted campaigns have demonstrated new qualities  of attacks, thus increasing efficiency and evasion through security defences.  In the ETL 2014, details of these developments are consolidated by means of top cyber threats and  emerging threat trends in various technological and application areas. References to over 400 relevant  sources on threats will help decision makers, security experts and interested individuals to navigate  through the threat landscape.  Lessons learned and conclusions may be useful for all stakeholders involved in the reduction of  exposure to cyber threats. Opportunities and issues in the areas of policy/business and technology  have been identified to strengthen collectively coordinated actions towards this goal. In the next year,  ENISA will try to capitalize on these conclusions by bringing together expertise to improve information  collection capabilities and to apply lessons learned to various areas of cyber security.  The figure below summarizes the top 15 assessed current cyber-threats and threat trends for  emerging technology areas. More details on the threats, emerging technology areas, threat agents  and attack methods can be found in this report.

The ETL 2014 is a continuation of the reports produced in 2012 and 2013: it follows similar approaches  for the collection, collation and analysis of publicly available information to produce the cyber-threat  assessment. The report contains a description of the methodology followed, together with some  details on use-cases of cyber-threat intelligence. The main contribution of the ETL 2014 lies in the  identification of top cyber threats within the reporting period. Together with the emerging threat  landscape, it makes up the main contribution towards identification of cyber-threats.  As in previous years, the ETL 2014 is based on publicly available material, the availability of which has  grown substantially in the reporting period. Starting from ca. 150 references in 2012, we identified ca.  250 in 2013. In 2014, we identified over 400 sources containing information on cyber threats, whereas  in all years we assume that our information collection detects ca. 60-70% of available material. This  makes the ETL 2014 a unique comprehensive collection of information regarding cyber-security  threats.  ENISA has performed information collection by means of internet searches, by using the information  provided by the CERT-EU2 and by using the web platform of Welund Horizon Ltd through free access  granted to ENISA in the reporting period.  As is explained later in this report, the ETL 2014 has been expanded to include information on attack  vectors, that is schematic representations on the course of attacks, indicating targeted assets and  exploited weaknesses/vulnerabilities. Another new component in the ETL 2014 is the elaboration of  use-cases of threat intelligence: by showing the various activities of threat analysis, we demonstrate  how the information produced can be used within various phases of security management.  Another novelty of the ETL 2014 process is the involvement of stakeholders in the identification of  issues as well as knowledge transfer and information sharing. In 2014, ENISA has established an ETL  stakeholder group consisting of 13 experts from CERTs, vendors, Member States and users. This group  has provided advice on various issues of threat analysis, including stakeholder requirements and state- of-the art developments in the area of threat intelligence.  Lessons learned and conclusions summarize the highlights of this year’s threat assessment exercise  and provide concluding remarks that are relevant for policy makers, businesses and cyber-security  experts.  Policy Context  The policy context of the ETL 2014 with regard to relevant EU-regulations is identical to that of 2013  ETL. The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU3 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity contributing towards the  achievement of objectives formulated in this strategy, in particular by contributing to the  identification of emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see  2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).  2 http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html, accessed November 2014.  3 http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-  and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  2  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation4 mentions the need to analyse current and emerging risks (and  their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with  statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii),  the new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses to current and  emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  The ENISA Threat Landscape aims to make  a significant contribution to the implementation of the EU  Cyber Security Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and  their evolution.  Target audience  The target audience of the ETL 2014 remains very similar to that of previous versions of this report. It  mainly targets cyber-security specialists and individuals interested in the development of cyber- threats. More precisely, these are cyber-security specialists working at the strategic, tactical and  operational levels of security management. Threat and risk assessments may be the primary concerns  of such individuals. They are busy with assessing the “external environment” and “internal  environments”5 in the framework of threat and risk assessments. In this year’s ETL, we provide a more  extensive view on the use-cases of a threat analysis process (see section 2.2). Besides the high level  discussions provided within this document, security experts will be in a position to identify detailed  issues on the assessed threats by means of numerous references to collected sources. This might make  the ETL a useful tool for long term use as it comprises a sort of contextualized “directory” to cyber- threat sources.  As the ETL contains high level information about cyber threats and emerging technology areas, it is a  good “entry point” to the subject of threat intelligence for non-experts. This target group will be  interested in the descriptions provided and the consolidated presentations of cyber threats and threat  trends. We have experiences, for example, that consolidated material of ETL 2013 has been used  within German schoolbooks.  The ETL 2014 will be of interest for policy makers: current threats and threat trends may be an  important input to policy actions in the area of cyber-security, national cyber-security preparedness  and possible coordination and cooperation initiatives among threat collection organisations and other  competent bodies.  Experience from previous ETL reports shows that media is an important target group of the ETL. The  generic cyber-threat descriptions provided can be easily understood by non-security experts. Such  descriptions help media to understand the dependencies and developments in that area. An area that  enjoys particular media attention, the latest after revelations about state sponsored surveillance  activities and related privacy risks for citizens world-wide.  Last but not least, by providing tactical and strategic guidance, The ETL 2014 could be used to support  executive management decisions and orientation of asset protection policies. This makes the ETL 2014  potentially useful for ISMS activities.  Structure of this document  The structure of the ETL 2014 is as follows:  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  5 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-  process/crm-strategy/scope-framework, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  3  Chapter 2 “Purpose, Scope and Method” provides some information regarding the threat analysis  process as it is being performed within the ETL 2014. Moreover, it refers to the information flow  between threat analysis and relevant stakeholders, while it gives some information on use-cases for  threat intelligence and used definitions.  Chapter 3 “ETL 2014: Current Threat Landscape” is the heart of the ETL 2014 as it contains top 15  cyber-threats assessed in 2014. It provides detailed information on the threat with references to all  relevant resources found, trends assessed and the role of each threat within the kill-chain.  Chapter 4 “Threat Agents” is an overview of threat agents with short profiles and references to  developments that have been observed for every threat agent group in the reporting period.  Chapter 5 “Attack Vectors” contains some new content that has been adopted in this year’s ETL. It  provides information on typical attack scenarios, steps and deployed cyber-threats and is supposed to  complement the presented material by giving some initial information on the “How” of a cyber-attack.  Chapter 6 “The Emerging Threat Landscape” indicates assessed technology areas that will impact the  threat landscapes in the middle-term. Ongoing developments in those areas will influence the ways  attackers will try to achieve their aims, but also the way defences are going to be implemented.  Chapter 7 “Food for thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions” is a summary of interesting issues  encountered within the threat analysis and provides the conclusions of this year’s ETL.  As was the case in ETL 2013, the present document has been developed in a modular way. The  chapters are as independent as possible to each other, thus allowing for an isolation of the addressed  issues so that readers can concentrate on the topic of interest. This approach also allows for  independent updates of the content, when deemed necessary (i.e. in cases of publication of additional  threat assessment summaries within a year).  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  4  ETL 2013: Purpose, Scope and Method  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  5  2 Purpose, Scope and Method  Worldwide, the cyber threat landscape – and threat analysis in general – has been assigned a central  role in practical Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM6). This is the case both in the relevant  vendor market and within end-user organisations. A plethora of related services and good practices  are available that are based on threat intelligence. They consist mainly of collection, aggregation and  correlation of data. It has been recognised that information on cyber-threats should be THE parameter  to actively adapt security protection practices towards a more agile management of security controls.  Following these trends, in this year’s ETL we have optimized threat collection and analysis practices,  whilst at the same time better reflecting on the practical applicability of threat information in  Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and SIEM.  The purpose and positioning of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) has been documented in ENISA’s  2013 deliverable (ETL 20137) and is still valid. Yet, based on advancements observed in the reporting  period, a more detailed view on the purpose and potential use of the delivered information is provided  in this chapter. This is done by paying attention to stakeholder requirements with regard to threat  information/threat intelligence. These requirements have been assessed within the ENISA Threat  Landscape Stakeholder Group (ETL SG), established in 2014 in order to advise ENISA on relevant  matters.  In the rest of this chapter we discuss several important aspects of threat landscape such as:   Quality and content of threat information;   End-user needs with regard to threat information;   Typical practical use case for threat information and,   Content of this year’s ETL and terminology.  2.1 Quality of Content of Threat Information  Numerous organisations create, assess and analyse information regarding cyber threats. Typically,  such information may have varying levels of detail, structure and abstraction level. The differences  are motivated by the purpose of the delivered information and the input data used to create it. In  particular, the following types of threat information can be found:  Strategic (S): this is usually the highest level information about threats. Such information is used within  forecasts of the threat landscape and emerging technological trends in order to prepare organisations  by means of assessments, prospective measures and security investments, as well as adaptation of  existing cyber security strategies. These are typical ISMS activities and stakeholders interested in this  level of information are mostly CISOs and CIOs.  Tactical (T): tactical threat information consists of condensed information describing threats and their  components, such as threat agents, threat trends, emerging trends for various technological areas,  risks to various assets, risk mitigation practices, etc. This information is important for stakeholders  engaged in long-term maintenance of security infrastructures, mostly within security management  activities. Hence, tactical threat information is also relevant to ISMS.  Operational (O): this is the most basic information about existing threats. It covers detailed technical  information about threats, incidents, vulnerabilities, etc., and usually derived from detections at the  6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management, accessed November 2014.  7 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed 30 Sept 2014.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  6  level of technical artefacts. It includes identification of cyber threats (e.g.. MD5 hash or Indicators of  Compromise (IOC) 8 ), its elements (vulnerability abuses, threat agents, attack vectors) and  corresponding countermeasures (technical controls for the elimination/reduction of threat or threat  exposure). This information is crucial for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of infrastructure  on the technical level and comprises the main input to SIEM. This area is strongly supported by many  standards and tools available on the market (both open source like MISP9 or commercial like Threat  Connect®10) which facilitate automatic (at least on some level) gathering and sharing information.  The diagram known as Pyramid of Pain 11  illustrates how to measure the trouble generated to  adversaries by using threat intelligence. Taking this approach as a basis, one can argue that while  operational information is related to the bottom layers of the pyramid, tactical information refers  rather to the top levels. Whereas both tactical and strategic information constitute the transition from  threat intelligence and SIEM to ISMS.  ETL contains mainly strategic and tactical information about cyber threats. Information collection,  aggregation and analysis, however, is often based on all types of information found in the public  domain. Operational information is used mainly as trigger to recognise/understand the whereabouts  of cyber threats which are then consolidated by means of tactical and strategic issues. The main focus  of ETL is on tactical and strategic guidance, this makes it  more relevant to asset protection policies  and practices.  2.2 End-user Needs with regard to Threat Information  It is important to analyse, understand and address end-user needs in the provision of cyber threat  information. Given the novelty of (dynamic) threat analysis processes in SIEM and ISMS, the  identification of possible use-cases that might suit end-user needs is at an early stage.  In the reporting period, ENISA has initiated a dialogue with threat information stakeholders by means  of the ETL SG. Within this group, discussions have taken place in an attempt to understand the needs  end-users have with regard to threat information. Moreover, the act of balancing threat information  provision capabilities and end-user requirements/expectations has also been elaborated.  Being at an initial state of maturity of threat intelligence, matching user expectations/needs and threat  information provision models seems to be a challenge ahead. In this chapter, an initial assessment of  user requirements on threat information is presented. Additional information on how to balance  “supply and demand” in the case of threat information/threat intelligence is currently in preparation.  End-users apply the threat assessment process mainly as a support process to SIEM and ISMS  implemented according to adaptations that meet individual organisational requirements. Usually, the  ISMS includes three components:   Assessment (threats, vulnerabilities, impact, risks);   Planning (security controls and procedures) and   Operation (security controls and security policy enforcement).  In each of these component, and according to the capability level of the organisation, end-users may  have different needs in relation to the threat assessment process. Some of them may only use threat  8 http://www.openioc.org/, accessed December 2014.  9 https://github.com/MISP/MISP, accessed December 2014.  10 http://www.threatconnect.com/, accessed December 2014.  11 http://detect-respond.blogspot.gr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html, accessed November 2014.  http://www.openioc.org/ https://github.com/MISP/MISP http://www.threatconnect.com/ http://detect-respond.blogspot.gr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  7  information in selected phases or even outsource threat intelligence to external organisations. At this  point, cyber threat information provision models come into the scope.  Some users will need only to assess the level of threats to perform risk assessments for developing  better business processes or to provide precise pricing of their products. In this case, it is sufficient for  the threat information to be adopted from external sources. Subsequently this information is put in  scope of the internal assessment exercise.  Similarly, not all phases of the threat assessment process are used within the operational activities of  a SIEM. To operate security controls there is a need for collecting, collating and analysing data about  threats that concern specific assets and threat exposure assumptions. Moreover, for SIEM activities  not only data about the newest threats are needed; historical data are also useful in order to draw  conclusions about the efficiency of implemented security controls and revisions of the security  architecture.  Knowing the current context of received threat information (e.g. strategic, tactical or operational  guidance), users can formulate the overall organisation policies concerning cybersecurity, plan  appropriate security controls and, finally, manage investment decisions. In those three cases the most  important issue for organisations is to possess and understand the context of cyber threat  information. Depending on the origin of threat information and the internal capability level, this might  be a challenge.  The interaction between the threat assessment process and user needs is presented in Figure 1 below:  green areas correspond to the threat assessment process phases, blue areas correspond to described  user needs. S, T and O abbreviations refer to threat information levels (Strategic/Tactical/Operational)  and orange text indicates which stakeholder group is associated with which user need.  Figure 1: Threat assessment process – relation with user needs and ISMS activities  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  8  Given the presented user requirements it becomes clear that ETL is delivering information for:   Management decisions regarding expected evolution of cyber threats and in particular their  relevance to emerging technology areas;   Security policy recommendations, in particular through cyber threats, their potential impact on  assets and the extrapolation of threats to emerging technology areas;   Supporting information for risk assessments to be performed for valuable assets of the  organisation, and   Planning of security controls that will be in the position to reduce vulnerabilities that can be  potentially abused by top cyber threats.  As a collateral product of ETL, but also of cyber threat information from other sources, one should  mention the usefulness of this material in assessing the effectiveness of existing controls by utilising  provided kill-chain12 information. This approach is a typical practical example based on cyber threat  information and is discussed in the forthcoming section (see section 2.3).  2.3 Typical Practical Use Case for Threat Information  In the present section we present a practical example for the use of threat information within the  operational activities of an organisation. This example has been developed after feedback received  from threat information users using threat information within both SIEM and ISMS. It is considered as  a good practice in an agile management of security controls.  It is assumed that threat information consists of:   Threat description including targeted assets;   Threat details providing information on the “whereabouts” of an incident;   Threat agents involved and   Indicative information on attack vector (i.e. based on kill-chain).  Obviously, the more comprehensive the above information is, the more easily it can be integrated into  the SIEM and ISMS activities. Nonetheless, structure and content of cyber threat information has to  correspond to the internal capability and maturity level. In other words, threat information has to be  structured in a way that can be efficiently consumed by internal security management process. This  might be a challenging task to achieve, especially when internal capabilities are relatively low (e.g.  SMEs willing to consume threat intelligence).  Figure 2 presents an indicative workflow of this use case: starting from a selection of the threat agent  group to be addressed in the defence, it continues with the selection of relevant cyber threats and  goes ahead up to the performance of corrective actions of existing protection. In this indicative  workflow the importance of the kill-chain becomes apparent through its role within many steps.  It is worth mentioning that for the implementation of such a workflow some additional information  will be necessary (i.e. asset inventories, vulnerability information, configuration data for existing  security controls, etc.). Such information is one basic tool of ISMS within organisations.  Finally, as it is indicated in Figure 2, cyber threat information may be a useful tool for auditing existing  security controls. This will allow using similar criteria, both for the implementation and efficiency  check of available controls. Hence, this would contribute towards using a common terminology for  12 http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/information-technology/cyber-security/cyber-kill-chain.html,  accessed November 2014.  http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/information-technology/cyber-security/cyber-kill-chain.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  9  implementing and controlling actions that are inherent to ISMS. This is a significant advantage for  organisations, as differences in knowledge level between cyber security and other disciplines is often  seen as a weakening factor for the life-cycle of security controls. For this reason, the use of a common  threat taxonomy and common threat intelligence may be very beneficial.  The use cases around threat assessment/threat intelligence have been investigated in the reporting  period quite thoroughly. In this context, we have made use of an authoritative resource in this area:  “How to Collect, Refine, Utilize and Create Threat Intelligence”, of Gartner Group13. The material  published provides a comprehensive view on collection and analysis of threat information towards  the creation of threat intelligence and comprises a very useful reading for information security  professionals.  Figure 2: Indicative workflow of security management actions based on threat intelligence  2.4 Content of this year’s ETL and Terminology  This version of the ETL covers all elements found in previous versions. In particular it provides:   Information on top threats assessed in the reporting period (2014);   Trends and issues of particular interest related to these threats;   Kill-chain information per threat;   Threat agents;   Emerging threats in important technology areas;  13 http://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2014/05/15/my-threat-intelligence-and-threat-assessment-research-papers-  publish/, accessed October 2014.  http://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2014/05/15/my-threat-intelligence-and-threat-assessment-research-papers-publish/ http://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2014/05/15/my-threat-intelligence-and-threat-assessment-research-papers-publish/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  10  The details about structure and rationale of this information are the same as in last year’s ETL 7 (see  Chapter 2).  Following the developments in the area of cyber threat analysis and cyber threat landscape in general,  this year’s ETL has been expanded with information on attack vectors. This addition contributes  towards a more clear separation between cyber threats and common tactical methods used to deploy  an attack by combining various cyber threats.  The information on attack vectors added to the ETL 2014 is complementary to kill-chains: a kill chain  provides generic guidance about which phases of an attack the threat can be deployed; while an attack  vector provides information about the assets that can be targeted and the type of threat used per  asset. In practice, within an attack vector several threats might be combined. E.g. in a Targeted Attack  the cyber threats phishing, malicious URL and malware are being combined, targeting assets like  human, web-browser, operating system, etc.  Finally, a new element added to this year’s report is the explicit mentioning of authoritative resources.  In each relevant section, a reference has been made to the authoritative sources found for a particular  topic. This should facilitate information finding regarding the details of the particular topic. It should  be noted that the term of authoritative source is used in order to indicate an information source that  provides significant quantity of explanations/information in one topic. Hence, this term is not  indicative for qualitative differences to other sources. Thus, reports that are referenced in the  document but are not enlisted within authoritative resources are by no means of lower quality.  2.5 Used definitions  As in many complex areas, in cyber threat assessment wording matters. In this section we briefly  present the terms used. Both within and outside this report, definitions facilitate the understanding  of used terms; further, and equally importantly, consistent use of terms contributes towards better,  quicker and more efficient knowledge transfer on cyber threats. This may enhance the response  capabilities to cyber threats.  The definitions used are identical to the ones of ETL 2013. In order to visualize the relationships among  all elements of risks, we use a figure taken from ISO 15408:2005 (see Figure 3). This figure has a level  of granularity that is sufficient to illustrate most of the elements of risk mentioned in this section. It  should be noted that “owner” refers to the owner of the asset; moreover, the issue of attack vector is  displayed in this figure.

In more detailed terms, we consider  risk as being composed of the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  12  ETL 2014: Current Threat Landscape  NEW YORK LONDON ISTANBUL NEW DELHI  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  13  3 Top Threats: The Current Threat Landscape  In the Current Threat Landscape 2014, related material published in the period between November  2013 and November 2014 has been compiled, thus covering approximately one year of cyber threat  developments.  The amount of material published in the reporting period has increased significantly, both in terms of  quantity and quality. From the material examined, we note that issued reports and published  information have almost doubled since ETL 201314. This is a strong indication of the important role  assigned to threat information (i.e. threat intelligence) in the cyber-security community. While being  a main component of SIEM, threat information plays and important role in ISMS because it can serve  as an important instrument to implement more agile ISMS processes based on detections and  reported incidents. This is a significant shift in security management, that has been traditionally based  on one-off assessments that had taken into account a time restricted snapshot of the threat  environment; and were often outdated shortly after they have been released.  Advances in the quality of published material has also been assessed. All organisations engaged in  threat analysis have yet developed significant experience in the coverage of all facets of threat analysis  and threat intelligence. This is indicated by the fact that the terminology used has converged, threat  agents come into the focus and details of attack vectors started appearing in the reports. Although  there is space for improvement, information available has reached a high maturity and span of  coverage that was not available in the past couple of years.  As was the case in previous versions of the ETL, the threat prioritisation has been performed mainly  by means of a combination of frequency of appearance/reference and number of incidents (i.e.  efficiency of the threat). In some cases, for example, threats that were decreasing ranked higher than  last year. This means that a higher efficiency of attacks based on this threat has been reported (e.g.  botnets).  Knowing that this approach might not be free from ambiguity, it has nevertheless been selected as it  delivers “good-enough” classification of threat importance and of threat trends. For example, it makes  clear that worms/trojans, together with web-based attacks are detected the most, while detection of  the insider threat is significantly lower. This approach is one among others, e.g. classification according  to encountered incidents, according to breached assets, according to assessed impact etc. Discussions  performed with members of the ENISA Stakeholder Group, led to the conclusion that it might be  worthwhile examining various classification schemes and allowing the users of the threat landscape  to select the one that best suits to their needs. This can be achieved by taking into account  documented impact, relevant sectors, geographical spread, etc. In the presentation of the threats  below, more frequent threats are mentioned first.  Having said that, it is worth mentioning that our aim was to present a priority of threats. However,  users of this material who wish to use it as input to their assessments, will need to consider cyber- threats according to the scope of their assessment. This might require prioritisation according to  relevant assets, vulnerabilities, impact level, etc. In such cases, the presented prioritisation might need  to be changed to fulfil the needs of the scoping exercise.  14 Due to the vast amount of published threat information and the limited resources available, it is very likely  that several publications on the topic of cyber threats escaped our attention. Hence, if readers miss some known  publications to them, these might be items that have not been spotted during information collection. Despite  potentially undetected reports, we believe that the collected material is a sufficient sample to identify threat  dynamics and trends.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  14  The following threat descriptions consist of i) a short text explaining the whereabouts of the threat, ii)  a list of findings, iii) the trend observed in the reporting period, iv) other related threats that are used  in combination with a threat, v) a list of authoritative resources and vi) the position of the threat in  the attack workflow15.  This chapter is concluded by a comparison between the current threat landscapes of the ETL 2013 and  the ETL 2014. This will help readers to easily understand the changes of the current threat landscape  in this time period.  3.1 Malicious Code: Worms/Trojans  In this reporting period, malware (worms/Trojans and Potentially Unwanted Programs – PUPs ) tops  the list of cyber threats, with worms and Trojans being the most common type of newly created  malware16 ,36. It is interesting that in the reporting period, an observed increase of adware was  observed, due to software delivered in form of bundled free software, the so called Potentially  Unwanted Programs (PUPs)17. Besides topping the cyber threats in 2014, there are some additional  interesting developments regarding malware. These developments concern: use of custom encryption  for communication with C&C servers167, file-less malware18,19 , increase of spyware20,21, provision of  multi-platform capabilities22, use of anonymity network TOR23 and obfuscation /evasion techniques24.  These advancements, together with the vast amount of malware variants per day (ca. 350.000),  decreases the efficiency of existing signature based antivirus tools44.  In this reporting period we have concluded that:   Worms are over 19% of malware. Interestingly the Conficker worm – a six year old malware -  is still the most commonly detected malware in domain computers (i.e. business  environments). In PCs it is the number one detection (also referred to as DOWNADUP) 25,36.   Due to its dynamics, complexity, sophistication and stealthiness, over 50% of malware stays  undetected by antivirus products44. This indicated the need for multi-layered security  15 Due to the scope of each cyber threat in ETL 2014, but also due the consolidation that is part of our analysis process, the  kill chains of the threats is of generic nature. In other words, it might not correspond to the phases included in a particular  detail threat assumed within this cyber-threat category. Rather it has been selected as a superset of phases found in all  threats of this kind.  16 http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/malware-still-generated-rate-160000-new-samples-day-q2- 2014/, accessed October 2014.  17 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-turning-the-tables-on-cyber- attacks.pdf, accessed October 2014.  18 https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/poweliks-the-persistent-malware-without-a-file.html, accessed November  2014.  19 http://www.faronics.com/news/blog/reboot-to-restore-new-fileless%E2%80%8B-malware-making-the-rounds-66/,  accessed October 2014.  20 http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FinFisher-Co-machen-harmlose-Katzenvideos-zur-Waffe-fuer-Cyber- Attacken-2293549.html?wt_mc=rss.ho.beitrag.atom, accessed November 2014.  21 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/06/spyware-exports-licence-new-eu-rules-military-applications,  accessed November 2014.  22 http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-security-stories/mask-sophisticated-multi-platform-malware-espionage- operation/, accessed October 2014.  23 http://threatpost.com/shedding-new-light-on-tor-based-malware/104651, accessed October 2014.  24 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-  techniques-seek-human-interaction.html, accessed October 2014.  25 http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/B/72B5DE91-04F4-42F4-A587-  9D08C55E0734/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_16_English.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/malware-still-generated-rate-160000-new-samples-day-q2-2014/ http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/malware-still-generated-rate-160000-new-samples-day-q2-2014/ http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-turning-the-tables-on-cyber-attacks.pdf http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-turning-the-tables-on-cyber-attacks.pdf https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/poweliks-the-persistent-malware-without-a-file.html http://www.faronics.com/news/blog/reboot-to-restore-new-fileless%E2%80%8B-malware-making-the-rounds-66/ http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FinFisher-Co-machen-harmlose-Katzenvideos-zur-Waffe-fuer-Cyber-Attacken-2293549.html?wt_mc=rss.ho.beitrag.atom http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FinFisher-Co-machen-harmlose-Katzenvideos-zur-Waffe-fuer-Cyber-Attacken-2293549.html?wt_mc=rss.ho.beitrag.atom http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/06/spyware-exports-licence-new-eu-rules-military-applications http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-security-stories/mask-sophisticated-multi-platform-malware-espionage-operation/ http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-security-stories/mask-sophisticated-multi-platform-malware-espionage-operation/ http://threatpost.com/shedding-new-light-on-tor-based-malware/104651 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-techniques-seek-human-interaction.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-techniques-seek-human-interaction.html http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/B/72B5DE91-04F4-42F4-A587-9D08C55E0734/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_16_English.pdf http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/B/72B5DE91-04F4-42F4-A587-9D08C55E0734/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_16_English.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  15  solutions that perform malware detection at multiple levels of the infrastructure (i.e. network,  application level, etc.) 26,27,44.   In this reporting period, ca. 30% of malware used custom encryption to hide communication  of stolen data28. It is interesting, that for this purpose SSL is not used due to the overhead  related to certificates28. Besides securing communication, encryption has been also used in  order to store modules of malware as encrypted data blobs that evade forensic functions29.   The increase in numbers of malware variants is a result of the availability of malware toolkits  that can be found in the underground malware market 30 . Such tools offer obfuscation  functions that allow for automated scanning of existing signatures and creation of new ones  to evade antivirus detections103.   Open environments are the “paradise” of malware infections44. Due to access through a  variety of users (obviously maintaining poor end-point security) academic, education and  university environments were responsible for over 40% of malware detections. This  demonstrates the difficulty in imposing security controls in such open environments.   Sophistication of malware has been impressively demonstrated by means of existing banking  Trojans. Such Trojans (e.g. the Italian and Turkish jobs31), have demonstrated a great deal of  criminal energy and knowledge behind the attack: for example, as all sensitive components  have been removed right after the investigation by law enforcement agencies had started40.  Moreover, banking Trojans have been reused/reconfigured in order to steal user  information 32 . Once installed, this malware can be re-configured to attack any kind of  information, further to banking data. The efficiency in infection rates is illustrated by the fact  that one in every 500 PCs is infected with this banking malware33. This corresponds to an  increase by a factor of four within the reporting period and by a factor of 14,5 since mid-  201240.   Malware defence tactics need to be revised. While most of the tactics are mainly defending  from “commodity malware”34 new, more advanced approaches to malware defence need to  be developed. They should not be based solely on detection at the end-points, but rather  involving countermeasures at the level of network architecture. Another interesting measure  for spyware control is its inclusion in the control list on dual use items 35  (together with  surveillance equipment).  26 http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303417104579542140235850578, accessed November 2014.  27 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/antivirus-is-dead-long-live-antivirus/, accessed November 2014.  28 http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-threat-report.aspx, accessed October 2014.  29 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/regin-analysis.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  30 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v19_221284438.en-us.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  31 http://bgr.com/2014/06/25/luuuk-trojan-online-banking-malware/, accessed October 2014.  32 http://www.darkreading.com/operations/identity-and-access-management/new-citadel-attack-targets-password-  managers/d/d-id/1317642, accessed December 2014.  33 http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2370710/ibm-warns-over-proliferating-use-of-banking-trojans-in-enterprise-  attacks), accessed October 2014.  34 http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/grem/malwared-study-network-host-based-defenses-prevent-  malware-accomplishing-go_3428, accessed November 2014.  35 http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1166, accessed November 2014.  http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303417104579542140235850578 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/antivirus-is-dead-long-live-antivirus/ http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-threat-report.aspx http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/regin-analysis.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v19_221284438.en-us.pdf http://bgr.com/2014/06/25/luuuk-trojan-online-banking-malware/ http://www.darkreading.com/operations/identity-and-access-management/new-citadel-attack-targets-password-managers/d/d-id/1317642 http://www.darkreading.com/operations/identity-and-access-management/new-citadel-attack-targets-password-managers/d/d-id/1317642 http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2370710/ibm-warns-over-proliferating-use-of-banking-trojans-in-enterprise-attacks http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2370710/ibm-warns-over-proliferating-use-of-banking-trojans-in-enterprise-attacks http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/grem/malwared-study-network-host-based-defenses-prevent-malware-accomplishing-go_3428 http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/grem/malwared-study-network-host-based-defenses-prevent-malware-accomplishing-go_3428 http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1166  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  16  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Web application/Injection attacks, Exploit Kits, Botnets, Information leakage, Identity  theft, Data breaches, Ransomware/Rogueware/Scareware, Phishing, Cyber espionage.

In 2013, this kind of attack has been referred to as “drive- by-downloads”. As was the case with other threats, in the reporting period a shift has been assessed  regarding this threat. This was due to widening of the scope of redirections (e.g.. disseminated via  phishing messages), deployment of additional techniques in mobile devices/mobile apps and a strong  decline in the use of the exploit kit Blackhole (after the arrest of its developers37). Nonetheless,  available vulnerabilities in web browsers are still most often exploited in order to achieve a redirection  to malicious sites (i.e. malicious URLs). The primary surface for exploitation are vulnerabilities of the  Java programming environment and browser exploits36,38,39.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Web-based attacks are facilitated by the fact that malicious URLs are easy to implement. In  this reporting period some 145 million unique URLs have been recognized as malicious  (responsible for 39% of web attacks). The malicious URL is by far the first malicious object  detected (72,9%)40.   It seems that short-lived domains further facilitate the creation of malicious URLs. According  to reports found41, ca. 0,4% of short life domains are malicious and have a life-cycle of ca 48  hours. These are ca. 2 million URLs every second day that are used for drive-by-  communication, botnets and malware hosting. This reduces the usefulness of blacklists and  increases maintenance effort. Therefore, in addition to blacklists, end-users need also to  introduce intrusion detection combined with end-device security (i.e. Anti-Virus and Web  Antimalware).   Web-based attacks take the first position in the threat landscape in North America and  Europe. In other continents, they are positioned in the lower middle field of top threats,  following malware36. Assuming a higher spread of online services in North America and  36 http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H1_2014.pdf, accessed October 2014.  37 http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070360/12-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested-in-russia-along-with-blackhole-  creator.html, accessed October 2014.  38 http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html, accessed October 2014.  39 http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/web-loving-malware-doubles-in-2013/, accessed October 2014.  40 https://securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_Q2_IT_Threat_evolution_EN.pdf, accessed October 2014.  41 http://www.csoonline.com/article/2599806/data-protection/spotting-web-threats-in-the-confusion-of-short-lived-  hostnames.html, accessed October 2014.  http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H1_2014.pdf http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070360/12-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested-in-russia-along-with-blackhole-creator.html http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070360/12-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested-in-russia-along-with-blackhole-creator.html http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/web-loving-malware-doubles-in-2013/ https://securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_Q2_IT_Threat_evolution_EN.pdf http://www.csoonline.com/article/2599806/data-protection/spotting-web-threats-in-the-confusion-of-short-lived-hostnames.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2599806/data-protection/spotting-web-threats-in-the-confusion-of-short-lived-hostnames.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  17  Europe, it seems that web browsers are the main targets. Country statistics might be seen as  a validation of this assumption: 88% of malicious web resources are located in Europe and  North America36.   Although Java exploits have declined, Java is still by far the most exploited web software by  this threat. Ca. 90 percent of web exploits are Java related. Among the reasons for these rates  is the fact that a large amount of web sites (over 70%) use Java versions that are unsupported  (e.g. Java 6)42.   While malicious URLs is the most widely detected malicious object, they are responsible for  ca. 39% of detected infections. Malware infections scored higher40: several hundreds of  millions of infections took place via viruses/worms/Trojans. This led us to consider web attacks  as the second threat in the row in the ETL 2014.

Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Web based attacks  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 5: Position of Web-based attacks in attack workflow  3.3 Web application attacks / Injection attacks  Web application attacks consist mainly of feeding vulnerable servers and/or mobile apps with  malicious inputs or unexpected sequences of events with the objective to inject malicious code, alter  site content or breach information. In the area of web application attacks, some interesting  developments are worth noticing: firstly, a slight reduction of vulnerable applications has been  identified43. This is due to the fact that application developers have understood issues with SQL  injection and have managed to reduce the attack surface. Moreover, app stores seem to do a good  job in testing apps on malicious activities. Despite more efficient coding practices, in the reporting  period web application vulnerabilities have increased slightly.  Yet, despite proportionally less SQLi incidents, a large amount of web applications are still vulnerable  (over 90%43). Top web application threats are XSS, information leakage, authentication and access  control, insecure object references, SQLi44,45,46. Interestingly, in recent surveys, the majority of CISOs  (51%) are concerned about risks emanating from application vulnerabilities 47 , while they see  application threat exposure increasing.  42 http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html, accessed October 2014.  43 http://www.cenzic.com/downloads/Cenzic_Vulnerability_Report_2014.pdf, accessed October 2014.  44 http://www.nttcomsecurity.com/en/services/managed-security-services/threatintelligence/, accessed October 2014.  45 http://info.whitehatsec.com/rs/whitehatsecurity/images/statsreport2014-20140410.pdf, accessed October 2014.  46 http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed5.pdf, accessed December 2014.  47 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CISO_Survey_2013:_Threats_and_risks, accessed October 2014.  http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html http://www.cenzic.com/downloads/Cenzic_Vulnerability_Report_2014.pdf http://www.nttcomsecurity.com/en/services/managed-security-services/threatintelligence/ http://info.whitehatsec.com/rs/whitehatsecurity/images/statsreport2014-20140410.pdf http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed5.pdf https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CISO_Survey_2013:_Threats_and_risks  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  18  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   A reduction of web application attack surfaces has been identified: Areas where flaws were  understood by developers are: SQLi, Clickjacking and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)48.   Besides injection attacks on web applications, mobile apps are exposed to additional threats.  This is due to an inherent shift of architectural principles from web applications to mobile  applications: this allows an attacker to deploy traditional web application threats in new  unconventional ways49. As a result, reverse engineering or modifications the app’s binary  code 50  are possible. Moreover, in the reporting period an injection method known as  Fragment Injection has been detected51.   Web application attacks are the second threat in the area of cloud computing surfaced by  cloud hosting providers75.   Web application/Injection attacks are expected to develop in the coming years. This is mainly  due to possible attacks to mobile devices, in combination with new web technologies, i.e.  HTML5. Cross Device Scripting (XDS) is such an attack, which is assessed by experts to become  a very serious threat in the future52.   Java is still by far the most exploited web software. Ca. 90 percent of web exploits are Java  related. Among the reasons for these rates is the fact that a large amount of web sites (over  70%) use Java versions that are unsupported (e.g. Java 6)53.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing (flat)  Related threats: Web-based attacks, Data Breaches, Worms/Trojans, Botnets, Exploit Kits.

Activities like this have led to a reduction of PC based botnets. On the other hand,  attackers have changed strategies and moved away from botnet-driven PC infections42. In particular,  they seem to work on building up web server based botnets. The advantage of this approach lies in  the superior performance of web server machines: one web server zombie performs better than  hundreds of PCs and is far easier to administrate73. Other forms of botnets that emerged in the  reporting period include hardware based botnets abusing internet of things devices56. Speculations  about the existence of cloud based botnets do also exist, following a demonstration of feasibility from  the scientific community57.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   All in all, botnet activity has been a very serious cyber-threat: it accounted for 34% of attacks  and has thus ranked at 1st position of attack statistics44. However, due to successful law  enforcement takedowns, the number of botnets has dropped in the reporting period (number  of infected computers went down form ca. 3.5 million to ca. 2.3 million55). However, newer  forms of botnet infections have shown up, which will lead to an increase of infected devices.  As in other areas of malware, infected mobile devices will significantly contribute to the  increase of botnet nodes58.   Botnet takedowns are quite controversial59;60;61. Firstly it is a matter of fact that through  incorporated resilience mechanisms, total takedown of a botnet is not feasible55. While  disruption of a botnet may give hard times to cybercriminals, the fact that the botnet still  exists will give them the opportunity to build it up again, by potentially advancing structure  and functions36. This might be at least a risk equal to the existence of the disrupted botnet, as  experts argue. It has been reported, that during the takedown operation of ZeroAccess botnet  its operators fixed a weakness in the protocol to disrupt the ongoing takedown campaign55.   Other forms of botnets seem to be in place consisting of smaller devices that are networked  such as routers62, sensors and Internet of Things devices63. The creation and operation of such  botnets can be performed by means of an available toolkit that supports a variety of devices64.   Sophistication and stealthiness of botnets improved in this reporting period. The use of short  life domains (ca. 2 million with a life shorter than 48 hours) are being used for various  54 https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/european-cybercrime-center-ec3-first-year-report, accessed October 2014.  55 http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp, accessed October 2014.  56 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28642/cyber-crime/spike-botnet-runs-ddos.html, accessed November 2014.  57 http://www.wired.com/2014/07/how-hackers-hid-a-money-mining-botnet-in-amazons-cloud/, accessed October 2014.  58 http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2322028/24-000-android-devices-are-hit-by-xxxxapk-mobile-botnet,  accessed October 2014.  59 https://www.damballa.com/microsoft-dcu-strike-three-now-what-2/, accessed November 2014.  60 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215443/RSA-2014-Microsoft-and-partners-defend-botnet-disruption,  accessed October 2014.  61 http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-15-14VixieTestimony.pdf, accessed November 2014.  62 http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/04/more-than-300000-wireless-routers-hijacked-by-criminals-in-global-  attack/, accessed October 2014.  63 http://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-threat-landscape-report-2014.html, accessed October 2014.  64 http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-  botnet.html, accessed October 2014.  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/european-cybercrime-center-ec3-first-year-report http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28642/cyber-crime/spike-botnet-runs-ddos.html http://www.wired.com/2014/07/how-hackers-hid-a-money-mining-botnet-in-amazons-cloud/ http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2322028/24-000-android-devices-are-hit-by-xxxxapk-mobile-botnet https://www.damballa.com/microsoft-dcu-strike-three-now-what-2/ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215443/RSA-2014-Microsoft-and-partners-defend-botnet-disruption http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-15-14VixieTestimony.pdf http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/04/more-than-300000-wireless-routers-hijacked-by-criminals-in-global-attack/ http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/04/more-than-300000-wireless-routers-hijacked-by-criminals-in-global-attack/ http://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-threat-landscape-report-2014.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-botnet.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-botnet.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  20  malicious activities, including botnet communication41. Such sources are difficult to detect and  takedown. Moreover, advanced botnet infections techniques aggravate botnet detection65.  Observed current trend for this threat: decreasing (number only; while efficiency has significantly  increased)  Related threats: Web application attacks / Injection attacks, Malicious code, Exploit Kits, Phishing,  Spam, Denial of Service, Ransomware/Rogueware /Scareware.

Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Botnets  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 7: Position of Botnets in attack workflow  3.5 Denial of Service  In this reporting period, DDoS attacks continued to be a strong tool of adversaries. As with other  threats, DDoS has evolved in many ways. Firstly, bandwidth has continued its growing trend: in 2014  (Q1-Q2) the average bandwidth of attacks is ca. 70% higher than in 2013, whereas a peak of ca. 240%  higher has been observed63, 66,67. There are various reasons for this development. Firstly, reflection  attacks have been more efficient in that they take advantage of multiple protocols (NTP, SNMP, DNS),  with SNMP reflection demonstrating a comeback 67 . They bear the advantage that they can be  performed without any involvement of botnets. Secondly, the use of server-based botnets (often  hosted on performant web/cloud based servers) are more difficult to detect can be stealthy until their  activation68. This is a shift away from PC-based botnets that significantly increases performance and  C2 management67. Finally, one should mention the increased complexity of DDoS attacks: by attacking  at the infrastructure and transport layer (i.e. TLS) (layers 3 and 4) and application layer (layer 7), a  change of attack vectors in the course of single attack campaigns make their detection difficult69.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   DDoS attacks are evolving by gaining in sophistication, stealthiness and unpredictability.  Volumetric, asymmetric, computational, and vulnerability-based attacks are now in the  arsenal of threat agents70. Moreover, attack bandwidth continues growing (peak 325 Gbps  this year), while time windows of attacks become smaller (i.e. reduction of their duration).  65 http://www.tomsguide.com/us/java-botnet-mac-linux-pc,news-18260.html, accessed October 2014.  66 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-continued-rise-of-  ddos-attacks.pdf, accessed November 2014.  67 http://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-dos-and-ddos-attack-reports.html, accessed October 2014.  68 http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/ddos-mit-ntp-grosse-attacke-mit-gefaelschten-statusabfragen-a-953079.html,  accessed October 2014.  69 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/analyst-report-idc-analyst-connection-ddos-prevention-time-for-w-  1112, accessed October 2014.  70 https://f5.com/solutions/enterprise/reference-architectures/ddos-protection, accessed October 2014.  http://www.tomsguide.com/us/java-botnet-mac-linux-pc,news-18260.html http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-continued-rise-of-ddos-attacks.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-continued-rise-of-ddos-attacks.pdf http://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-dos-and-ddos-attack-reports.html http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/ddos-mit-ntp-grosse-attacke-mit-gefaelschten-statusabfragen-a-953079.html http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/analyst-report-idc-analyst-connection-ddos-prevention-time-for-w-1112 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/analyst-report-idc-analyst-connection-ddos-prevention-time-for-w-1112 https://f5.com/solutions/enterprise/reference-architectures/ddos-protection  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  21   Most DDoS attacks have been launched in combination with another attack, thus used as  “smokescreening” to distract defenders from the collateral attacks happening in parallel71,72.  In particular, the main objectives of collateral attacks assessed are: Virus and Malware  installation/activation (49%), data theft (25,53%), loss of intellectual property (19,15%) and  financial theft (10,64%)71.   Volumetric attacks will continue to be the main attack type in the future. Efficient reflection  attacks and performant server-based botnets ease the deployment of such attacks69,73. The  trend of SSDP reflection growth should be observed carefully and measures to reduce this  exposure should be implemented74.   The trend of declining application attacks is continued in 2014. Nevertheless, they have picked  up during the 2nd quarter. It is worth mentioning that application layer attacks are a strong  tool as they may create significant impact and such attacks are difficult to detect and defend  against. Along with reconnaissance attacks, brute force attacks and vulnerability scans these  attacks may open new avenues of misuse of web applications through adversaries75.   In the reporting period, DDoS attacks to SSL have been detected. These are difficult to detect  without decrypting and analysing SSL traffic69, 76 . This sort of attack continues to grow.  Although SSL attacks increase computational load77, together with weaknesses regarding SSL78  they provide a considerable attack surface for this technology.   After big increases at the beginning of 2014, NTP reflection attacks are on the decline as a  result of awareness raised within the security community that led to reduction of servers to  be abused (reduction of servers responding to monlist requests)79,80.  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Botnets, Web-based attacks, Data breaches, Malware: Worms/Trojans.

The  impressive drop of spam compared with volumes of 2010-2011 is related to take downs of large spam  bots and successful spam blocking practices25. However, spam is still a serious cyber threat166: ca. 75%  of messages are unwanted. Phishing comprises only ca. 4% of the entire spam volume25. From  available statistics and spam volumes, it is assumed that quite some spam bots might exist in  geographic areas where Window XP is still operated81. Another characteristic of spam are unexpected  waves that come and go. In March 2014, spam numbers have been detected that are the highest of  the last two and a half years81. Just as for phishing, spammers piggyback on international events that  obtain media attention82 in order to lure their victims. Speed of spread is one important element for  spams: spam messages based on breaking news sent immediately after an event, thus making  recipients believe that the message is authentic (admittedly an overlapping method with spear  phishing, see section 3.6). Finally, it is worth mentioning that spam is rather well understood as an e- mail threat. In the reporting period, however, we have seen increased spam disseminated over  channels that are non-typical for this threat, such as Social media spam83, mobile apps, SMS, etc84.  This “mutation” of spam opens new opportunities for attackers to increase the efficiency of their  campaigns and achieve better infection rates.  In this reporting period we assessed that:   Top themes for spam worldwide are: Bank Deposit/Payment Notifications, Online Product  Purchase, Attached Photo, Shipping Notices, Online Dating, Taxes, Facebook, Gift Card or  Voucher, PayPal42.   Although rather stable, image spam is an important tool of adversaries. As being typical for  spam, however, some voluminous image spam activities have been detected in the period  between December 2013 and January 2014. It is argued that images are an interesting content  for spammers, as most spam filters are text based. Thus, spam images might evade spam-  detection capabilities81.   In the reporting period spam has been assessed as a serious mobile threat85 ,86. Through  parallel campaigns started both in social media and mobile applications, spammers try to  81 http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03050USEN#loaded,  accessed October 2014.  82 http://securelist.com/blog/58260/the-world-cup-spammers-set-their-sights-on-goal/, accessed October 2014.  83 http://nexgate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Nexgate-2013-State-of-Social-Media-Spam-Research-Report.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  84 https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/67851/spam-and-phishing-in-the-q3-of-2014/, accessed  December 2014.  85 http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/news/whatsapp-scam/, accessed October 2014.  86 http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/software/3331146/new-whatsapp-charging-hoax-surfaces/, accessed October 2014.  http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03050USEN#loaded http://securelist.com/blog/58260/the-world-cup-spammers-set-their-sights-on-goal/ http://nexgate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Nexgate-2013-State-of-Social-Media-Spam-Research-Report.pdf https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/67851/spam-and-phishing-in-the-q3-of-2014/ http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/news/whatsapp-scam/ http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/software/3331146/new-whatsapp-charging-hoax-surfaces/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  23  create user confidence about the trustworthiness of their messages. Through convolution of  messages through various channels, it may become difficult for users to detect malicious  purpose of messages.   In social media we have seen significant spam increase rates83. It has been assessed that  during first half of 2013 social spam volume has increased by 355% (one every 200 messages),  with Facebook and YouTube leading the list of spam distribution social platforms (one every  100 messages). It is impressive that the number of spam messages increases faster than that  of comments in social media83.   With the proliferation of mobile devices, text messages (SMS) are also misused as a spam  channel. Spam text messages often aim at infecting mobile devices with malware (i.e. via  malicious URLs) or just as a reconnaissance mechanism to identify valid telephone numbers  (eventually connected to IDs in cloud services of providers, such as Apple-Cloud IDs)87.  Observed current trend for this threat: decreasing  Related threats: Web-based attack, Phishing, Malicious code, Exploit Kits, Botnets.

Attackers often combine spoofed e-mails and counterfeited web sites to lure users to malicious sites  with the very objective of infecting end-user devices. The second component of phishing is social  engineering. Both components gain in efficiency from availability of breached data in the underground  market89,92. The ultimate malicious aim is to steal/intercept user names and passwords and financial  credentials 90 . In addition to these advancements, it is remarkable that phishing volumes in the  reporting period have been quite high106 (Q2 2014 has been the second highest number since Q2  2012). The premium target of phishing activities are payment services, financial and retail services and  crypto-currencies. Malicious URLs found in phishing messages demonstrate an increase of distribution  87 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-  underground-market-in-china.pdf, accessed October 2014.  88 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-phishing-technique-outfoxes-site-owners-operation-  huyao/, accessed November 2014.  89 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/epsilon-breach-raises-specter-of-spear-phishing/, accessed October 2014.  90 http://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q2_2014.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-underground-market-in-china.pdf http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-underground-market-in-china.pdf http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-phishing-technique-outfoxes-site-owners-operation-huyao/ http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-phishing-technique-outfoxes-site-owners-operation-huyao/ http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/epsilon-breach-raises-specter-of-spear-phishing/ http://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q2_2014.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  24  of PUPs (adware, spyware) 91 . Targeted phishing campaigns combining personal identifiable  information (PII) is known as spear phishing92.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Some interesting data regarding phishing are: Europe is the region with the lowest infection  rates due to phishing messages. US is the number one country hosting phishing-based Trojans.  Supposedly, this is due to the fact that the biggest part of the .com domain is hosted in the  US90.   The proliferation of new technologies - usually bearing vulnerabilities and weak security  controls - may lead to information theft/leakage. When misused within a spear phishing  message, attacks can become extremely efficient and very difficult to defend93,94. Defending  this threat will be a significant challenge, as it is obvious that when possessing information  from the user’s intimate environment, it will be very easy to fool them. Smart Cities, smart  vehicles will constitute another big potential of phishing abuse95. In the reporting period ENISA  has produced a detailed threat landscape and good practice guide for smart homes409, that  further elaborates on these issues.   In order to understand the importance of phishing as cyber-threat, one needs to have a look  at the rankings of seriousness of cyber-attacks: in some reports, phishing is in the 3rd position  behind web based attacks and DDoS96. This fact demonstrates the importance of this threat  for adversaries.   It is common, that attackers may craft spear phishing messages by collecting publicly available  information on victims. Social networking sites are the main source of information collection.  This usually takes place during initial phases of targeted attacks, i.e. external reconnaissance97.   Social networking is also an important target for phishing. According to phishing statistics,  Social Networking sites are the third target of phishing behind payment and financial  systems98.   Defence of phishing/spear phishing is based mainly on appropriate end-user behaviour and  awareness99. This defence is difficult to achieve, as following phishing trends, enrolment of  end-user and awareness raising might be time-consuming and costly. Some information found  in the reporting period provides a deeper insight into the topic100.

Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Phishing  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 10: Position of Phishing in attack workflow  3.8 Exploit Kits  Exploit kits are a major tool of threat agents. They are automated tools, mainly detecting  vulnerabilities at user end-devices and then downloading and managing malicious content  accordingly101. The area of exploit kits has undergone significant developments in the reporting period,  being thus maybe the best example of threat landscape dynamics. Around the end of reporting period  of ETL 2013, the developer of Blackhole, of one of the prevailing exploit kits was arrested102. Since  then, we have been in the position to observe a realignment of the exploit kit “market”. Within 2014,  Blackhole has almost disappeared from the landscape (currently estimated ca 3% of exploit kit market,  while previously covering ca. 44%103). Cyber-criminals have almost immediately adapted to breaking  news and have changed to other exploit kits104. Though not yet reaching the same level of usage, new  exploit kits have come to fill the void left by Blackhole. In addition, in the reporting period we have  seen cyber-criminals increasing the sophistication of exploit kits. Examples are: checked vulnerabilities  in the victim’s systems that are considerably newer, while it has become possible to infect hosts by  injecting malware directly into existing processes105, instead of downloading the payload by means of  files. It is expected that exploit kit usage will continue to be a main threat leading to infections on the  Web. Despite a contemporary decrease, the potential to see increased usage of exploit kits in the  future is quite big106.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Like almost all cyber threats, exploit kits become more complex/sophisticated. In the  reporting period we have seen exploit kits infecting targets with file-less malware, using  TOR107 communication between installed malware and C&C. Publication of exploit kit source  code allows more malware authors to create more innovative, new attack patterns103.   It has been assessed, that organisations deploying vulnerability management show  significantly lower infection rates from exploit kits than those without. Yet, vulnerability  management based on manual processes (i.e. excel lists) seems to be weaker than more  mature solutions based on formal methods.  101 http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf, accessed October  2014.  102 http://threatpost.com/blackhole-exploit-kit-author-arrested-in-russia/102537, accessed October 2014.  103 http://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-security-threat-report-2014.pdf, accessed October  2014.  104 http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  105 http://www.securityweek.com/malware-injected-directly-processes-angler-exploit-kit-attack, accessed October 2014.  106 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-vulnerabilities-under-attack.pdf,  accessed December 2014.  107 http://www.isssource.com/new-exploit-kit-using-tor/, accessed October 2014.  http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf http://threatpost.com/blackhole-exploit-kit-author-arrested-in-russia/102537 http://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-security-threat-report-2014.pdf http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2013.pdf http://www.securityweek.com/malware-injected-directly-processes-angler-exploit-kit-attack http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-vulnerabilities-under-attack.pdf http://www.isssource.com/new-exploit-kit-using-tor/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  26   The average age of vulnerabilities used within exploit kits has been reduced significantly.  While some years ago the average age of exploit kit vulnerabilities were at about two years,  recent tools contain many actual vulnerabilities of one year average age. This is considered as  another indication of increased sophistication of these malicious tools44. Other indications of  increase sophistication are found in the Angler Exploit Kit that integrates Microsoft Silverlight  vulnerabilities and uses gzip and Pack200, a compression method specially optimized for JAR  archives104. Further indications for the creativeness of adversaries are redirects that have led  Yahoo users to an exploit kit that exploited Java vulnerabilities and had installed malware  including ZeuS, Andromeda and Dorkbot/Ngrbot28. Another innovation are DNS hijacks that  redirected users to exploit kits55.   The new order in the area of exploit kits, especially after the arrest of Blackhole developer, is  reflected in the available exploit kit statistics103, according to which their spread is: Neutrino  24%, Unknown kit 21%, Redkit 19%, SweetOrange 11%, Styx 10%, Glazunov/Sibhost 5%,  Nuclear 4% , Blackhole/Cool 3%, Other 3%, while Angler exploit kit seems to gain  momentum104.   As security researchers argue, the possibility of the source code of Blackhole being published  does exist. It is being argued, that publication of source code helps malicious actors mask their  trails from investigators and detection55. This is due to improvements that may be  implemented in existing malicious code. This was already the case with BlackPOS108.  Observed current trend for this threat: decreasing  Related threats: Web-based attacks, Web application attacks/Code Injection, Malicious code:  Worms/Trojans, Phishing, Ransomware/Rogueware /Scareware.

Data breach data assessed up to the authoring period of this report (Oct-Dec 2014) have  already demonstrated an increase of ca. 25% over the same period in 2013109,110,111. In the reporting  period many kinds of data breaches have surfaced. Most of those have had significant impact, at least  within media and businesses: many have concerned large numbers of consumer information112, others  108 http://www.mcafee.com/sg/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q4-2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  109 http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ITRC-Surveys-Studies/2014databreaches.html, accessed October 2014.  110 http://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/DataBreachReports_2014.pdf, accessed December 2014.  111 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240235603/Films-leaked-online-after-Sony-Pictures-  hack?asrc=EM_EDA_36999404&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=EDA&utm_campaign=20141201_Films%20leaked%20 online%20after%20Sony%20Pictures%20hack_, accessed December 2014.  112 http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/10/02/jp-morgan-says-76-million-households-affected-by-data- breach/, accessed October 2014, (indicative, selected as the latest found in the media).  http://www.mcafee.com/sg/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q4-2013.pdf http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ITRC-Surveys-Studies/2014databreaches.html http://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/DataBreachReports_2014.pdf http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240235603/Films-leaked-online-after-Sony-Pictures-hack?asrc=EM_EDA_36999404&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=EDA&utm_campaign=20141201_Films%20leaked%20online%20after%20Sony%20Pictures%20hack_ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240235603/Films-leaked-online-after-Sony-Pictures-hack?asrc=EM_EDA_36999404&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=EDA&utm_campaign=20141201_Films%20leaked%20online%20after%20Sony%20Pictures%20hack_ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240235603/Films-leaked-online-after-Sony-Pictures-hack?asrc=EM_EDA_36999404&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=EDA&utm_campaign=20141201_Films%20leaked%20online%20after%20Sony%20Pictures%20hack_ http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/10/02/jp-morgan-says-76-million-households-affected-by-data-breach/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/10/02/jp-morgan-says-76-million-households-affected-by-data-breach/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  27  a small numbers of celebrities113. But not only personal data are subject to this threat: valuable  information, mostly with financial impact is considered to be prime target of cyber-criminals, e.g..  Bitcoins114,115. Data breaches are the result of successful cyber-attacks, materialised cyber threats, or  erroneous unintentional user activities, all leading to disclosure of confidential information. Due to  their impact but also long term consequences, data breaches are among the most thoroughly  managed and investigated cyber incidents. This is due to the fact that relevant national and  international regulations force operators of IT systems - especially in the area of Critical Infrastructure  – to report data breaches116,117,118. It is expected that more and more sectors will be obliged to join  data breach reporting schemes in the near future.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   According to extensive data breach reports, the causes of data breaches are: Weak passwords,  Vulnerable networks and application, Malware, Phishing, Incorrect user authentication,  Insider threat, Tampering, Database errors119,120. This motivates the identified need for two  factor authentication121. An observed deviation of data breach statistics/causes can be found  in various reports 122 , 123 , 124 . It should be clear that data breach reports depend on the  context/subject area in scope. Readers would need to understand the particular context and  decide on the level of concern for their organisation.   Breached information is an important tool for adversaries. This information is being utilized in  a variety of cyber-attacks with intentions ranging from fraud to targeted attacks based on  personal information and is available over underground markets125. This leads to a continuous  abuse of this information, long after the occurrence of the breach. Hence, making the  aftermath of a data breach is an important task for evaluating its impact and reduce long term  costs from potential customer regress claims.   Breached data are subject to monetisation through adversaries101. As a consequence, lost or  stolen information will be misused over a longer time frame than the time needed to  process/manage the incident. Additional costs should be calculated for assaults on businesses  as the data is being offered in underground markets17.  113 http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-4chan-shock-naked-picture-4395155, accessed October 2014.  114 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/bitcoin-exchange-mtgox-offline-amid-rumours-of-theft,  accessed October 2014.  115 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-investment-firm-collapses-due-alleged-hacking-management-disappears-1470779,  accessed October 2014.  116 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-  for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport, accessed December 2014.  117 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058, accessed December 2014.  118 http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-  laws.aspx, accessed December 2014.  119 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/, accessed October 2014.  120 http://www.datasurer.com/8-common-reasons-of-data-breach/, accessed November 2014.  121 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476642/data-security/financial-firms-not-offering-two-factor-  authentication.html, accessed November 2014.  122 http://www.privacyrisksadvisors.com/news/beazley-announces-findings-from-analysis-of-1-500-data-breaches/,  accessed October 2014.  123 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014, accessed October 2014.  124 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-  2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2014.  125 http://www.csoonline.com/article/2691735/malware-cybercrime/what-to-do-in-the-aftermath-of-the-jpmorgan-  breach.html, accessed October 2014.  http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-4chan-shock-naked-picture-4395155 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/bitcoin-exchange-mtgox-offline-amid-rumours-of-theft http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-investment-firm-collapses-due-alleged-hacking-management-disappears-1470779 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058 http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/ http://www.datasurer.com/8-common-reasons-of-data-breach/ http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476642/data-security/financial-firms-not-offering-two-factor-authentication.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476642/data-security/financial-firms-not-offering-two-factor-authentication.html http://www.privacyrisksadvisors.com/news/beazley-announces-findings-from-analysis-of-1-500-data-breaches/ http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.csoonline.com/article/2691735/malware-cybercrime/what-to-do-in-the-aftermath-of-the-jpmorgan-breach.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2691735/malware-cybercrime/what-to-do-in-the-aftermath-of-the-jpmorgan-breach.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  28   Still relatively large unspecified/unknown number of data breach incidents are hindering  cybersecurity specialists and law enforcement in understanding the whereabouts of  successful attacks126. It will be necessary that additional data breach reporting schemes will  enter into force127.   The security preparedness of businesses for new technologies are still in early maturity  phases. Existing security mechanisms and processes are struggling to adapt to new  technological developments such as cloud and mobile, especially with regard to data  ownership in off-premises environments. Given the inevitable trend that data breaches will  happen in cloud and mobile, the availability and maturity of multilayered security controls  should be increased128.   A study regarding information loss has indicated that over 50% of data breaches is attributed  to “sloppiness” of end-users with regard to security controls/procedures129.   Recent US data breach statistics show that most breaches have been reported in the area of  medical/healthcare (ca. 42%)130. Businesses score second with 32% of reported incidents. Yet,  data breaches in businesses have the lion’s share as regards the amount of records stolen (ca.  82%). It is interesting to observe the interest of cyber-criminals in medical/health information.  This is a strong indication that this sort of information will be premium target, in particular  with the proliferation of assisted living and e-health systems within smart environments (see  also section 6.6 on internet of things).

In the reporting period, we have  seen device theft or loss to be the 3rd most important reason leading to data breaches131, following  hacking (1st position) and accidental exposure (2nd position). By summarizing all available reports122,123,  processed, one can argue that theft/loss is between second and third cause for data breaches. This  looks reasonable, if one takes into account that one in seven devices gets lost132. Taking into account  advances in hardware tampering techniques133,134, code analysis135 and bypassing security controls, it  is evident that this threat plays an important role for cyber-adversaries, including targeted attacks.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   More than 3 million smart phones were stolen in the US last year alone. Taking into account  that 34% of device owners do not use any security controls to protect information and that  around 50% are using their devices for business purposes136, this is the best demonstration of  the potential efficiency of this threat.   Inevitably, physical damage and theft is highly likely to happen in areas with social, political or  military crises. In the reporting period we have seen few physical damage events with  significant impact in crisis areas137. In such cases, besides availability issues, additional risks  emerge from unencrypted storage devices.   Physical damage may have non-human causes138 such as force majeure, extreme weather and  physical phenomena. The later has been identified a significant cause of outages in the  telecommunications sector124.   Assessments indicate that loss of devices and documents is more often reported than theft.  Interestingly, most assets have been stolen more frequently from corporate environments  than various other locations (homes, cars, transportation, etc.). This might clarify the three  most popular vectors reported for theft, namely: disabling existing protection controls,  bypassing existing protection controls and privilege abuse119. All these vectors are related  mainly to corporate locations.   Statistics on device theft/loss indicate that at the first position are mobile user devices (i.e.  smart phones, tablets), followed by laptops, documents, desktop, flash drive and disk drive119.   Though not led to device theft or loss, one of the most important consequences of access to  physically unprotected assets in the reporting period was the fraud on ATMs139. In those cases,  physical access to the ATM machines are key to manipulation of ATMs in order to initiate  fraudulent activities140.  131 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/data-breaches-put-focus-endpoint-security, accessed October 2014.  132 http://blogs.absolute.com/lojack-for-laptops/2014/07/1-7-experience-device-loss-theft-travelling/, accesses October  2014.  133 http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2344962/nsa-seen-tampering-with-cisco-kit-to-add-surveillance-tools, accessed  October 2014.  134 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hacking-atms-new-wave-malware/, accessed October 2014.  135 http://securityintelligence.com/how-to-hack-a-mobile-app-its-easier-than-you-think/#.VE9qjqNBuLM, accessed October  2014.  136 http://blogs.cisco.com/security/securing-mobile-data-in-the-event-of-device-loss-or-theft/, accessed October 2014.  137 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/russia-ukraine-information-warfare/, accessed October 2014.  138 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehFiErtjW0, accessed October 2014.  139 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/atm-fraud-c-245, accessed October 2014.  140 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/hacking-atms-no-malware-required-a-7460, accessed November 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/data-breaches-put-focus-endpoint-security http://blogs.absolute.com/lojack-for-laptops/2014/07/1-7-experience-device-loss-theft-travelling/ http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2344962/nsa-seen-tampering-with-cisco-kit-to-add-surveillance-tools http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hacking-atms-new-wave-malware/ http://securityintelligence.com/how-to-hack-a-mobile-app-its-easier-than-you-think/#.VE9qjqNBuLM http://blogs.cisco.com/security/securing-mobile-data-in-the-event-of-device-loss-or-theft/ http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/russia-ukraine-information-warfare/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehFiErtjW0 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/atm-fraud-c-245 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/hacking-atms-no-malware-required-a-7460  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  30   Available attacks on mobile phones allow an attacker to exploit data leakage vulnerabilities  when app developers place sensitive information or data in a location on the mobile device50.  An adversary having physical access to the device (through theft or loss) can use existing tools  to perform this attack. Hence, protection of mobile devices against theft or loss should be a  priority for owners.

Reports on the insider threat have been issued, mainly  on the initiative of or commissioned by governmental organisations or organisations enrolled in  national security and military defence141,142,143,144,145. Although these reports mainly focus on malicious  insider user activities, analysis of incidents indicates that a significant amount of insider threats stem  from unintentional user errors/mistakes, unintentional displacement of information and loss/theft124.  Whatever the grounds for insider threat materialisation might be, usually, they lead to significant  impact for the organisation. This explains significant CISO concerns assessed: more than half of  organisations believe that they are vulnerable to this threat142. On the other hand, more than half of  security professionals consider insider threats as being difficult to prevent. Admittedly, the insider  threat is not mainly a technical issue. Together with the high impact of such attacks, it is evident that  this threat is a significant concern, both for technical experts and executives.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   The insider threat is being primarily noticed by means of technical controls (e.g. via analytics  regarding printer logs, intranet logs, unauthorised access attempts, outbound web traffic to  mistrusted sites, etc.). But technology is just one part of the problem. Being a part of the  organisation, measures that go beyond technological solutions need to be sought.  141 http://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-  %20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  142 http://www.vormetric.com/sites/default/files/ap_Vormetric-Insider_Threat_ESG_Research_Brief.pdf, accessed October  2014.  143 http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/Ponemon-RaytheonPrivilegedUserAbuseResearchReport.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  144 http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/RTN-PrivilegedUserAccessPUMA-RiskMitigationIIS2013-238WP.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  145 http://www.lancope.com/files/documents/Industry-Reports/Lancope-Ponemon-Report-Cyber-Security-Incident- Response.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-%20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf http://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-%20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf http://www.vormetric.com/sites/default/files/ap_Vormetric-Insider_Threat_ESG_Research_Brief.pdf http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/Ponemon-RaytheonPrivilegedUserAbuseResearchReport.pdf http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/RTN-PrivilegedUserAccessPUMA-RiskMitigationIIS2013-238WP.pdf http://www.lancope.com/files/documents/Industry-Reports/Lancope-Ponemon-Report-Cyber-Security-Incident-Response.pdf http://www.lancope.com/files/documents/Industry-Reports/Lancope-Ponemon-Report-Cyber-Security-Incident-Response.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  31  Technological solutions need to go hand in hand with HR, awareness and employee guidance  processes145.   Materialised insider threats need particularly high efforts to contain. While average  containment of cyber-attacks is ca. 30 days, insider attacks need on average ca. 60 days146.   Insider attacks are often bypassing existing security controls due to access rights but also due  to available knowledge of the insider regarding existing protection. In addition, they are aware  of weaknesses/vulnerabilities of the organisation that can be misused in order to successfully  place an attack. Often, the best way to recognise an insider adversary is to keep an eye on  people’s behaviour to detect patterns of dissatisfaction145.   A considerable amount of insider incidents in organisations is a result of user error143. Given  the assessed fact that over 50% of data breaches are due to user sloppiness, one can argue  that significant damage is caused due to ignorance. Hence, a better remediation of insider  threat might be achieved by better user training. Over 48% of organisations participating in a  survey on insider threat have not provided any security training to their employees147. Among  the most frequent user errors are misdelivery, that is, sending information (paper or digital)  to wrong recipients119. Misdelivery is followed by publishing error, disposal error,  misconfiguration and malfunction119.   Information types that have been breached by insiders are: intellectual property (63%),  customer data (50%), unknown (24%) and financial records (22%)147. Top 5 activities of insider  misuse assessed are: privilege abuse (88%), non-approved hardware (18%), bribery (16%), e-  mail misuse and data mishandling (11%)119.   A very thorough risk assessment of the insider threat141 has impressively demonstrated that  no operator of critical systems can afford having the required level of protection to properly  mitigate insider threats. This report underlines also the potential for the combination of  insider threat with guidance from external threat agents, an issue that is often  underestimated by organisations. All in all, this report penetrates the issue of insider threat  at a considerable depth.   It seems that there is a gap between perception and reality about insider threat. Analysis of  real incidents shows that insider threats are in second position as cause of all incidents, but  are far less than outsider threats which is at the first position148 (insider threat only 8% of all  incidents).  Observed current trend for this threat: stable/ slight increase  Related threats: Malicious code, Data Breaches, Information leakage, Identity theft, Physical  damage/theft/loss, Phishing, Web-based attacks, Web application attacks / Injection attacks.

Such information is then abused as is, or within other threats and  attacks. Information leakage is different from data breach, in that it mainly concerns exploitation of  technical and organisational weaknesses to obtain information that is then fed to other attacks. Data  breach, on the other hand, is the threat of compromising of confidentiality of massively stored  business information. In the reporting period we have experienced leakage incidents, one of which –  Heartbleed - has been classified by the security community as “one of the most serious to affect the  Internet”149,150. However, some months later, another leakage vulnerability of SSL has been found151.  Concluding one can say that increased complexity of internet architectures (i.e. web and application  services) as well as decentralisation and virtualisation of processing, open doors to information left- overs during processing. This information is targeted by this threat.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Heartbleed was a serious blow to OpenSSL, one of the basic components of secure  communication in the internet. Though good guidance was given to remove the vulnerability,  delays, update errors and even non-corrections of the used SSL version have been observed.  Yet, this incident has demonstrated the complexity in losing trust to a basic security  component: certificates need to be re-issued and dependencies of existing software need to  be analysed and fixed. It is expected that this incident will continue bothering security experts  for some time150. A second leakage incident related to SSL is indicative for the continuous  attempt to challenge the security of trust functions of the internet151.   Among application vulnerabilities (XXS, Information leakage, Session Management, etc.),  none has demonstrated an increase similar to information leakage, which has nearly doubled  in comparison to 2012. It is assumed that this was due to accidental leakage of sensitive  information through data transmission error messages43. Others argue that due to increased  complexity and low level of awareness for a good error handling, information storage and  application architecture issues, information leakage will increase152. In the reporting period,  information leakage weaknesses have been assessed to be within the top three in application  vulnerabilities45.  149 http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet, accessed October 2014.  150 http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03057USEN#loaded,  accessed October 2014.  151 https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2014/10/14/poodle-unleashed-understanding-the-ssl-30-  vulnerability, accessed October 2014.  152 http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1571359#.VFCVzaNBsnO, accessed October 2014.  http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03057USEN#loaded https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2014/10/14/poodle-unleashed-understanding-the-ssl-30-vulnerability https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2014/10/14/poodle-unleashed-understanding-the-ssl-30-vulnerability http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1571359#.VFCVzaNBsnO  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  33   Social media remain a major channel for information leakage that can be used in other (e.g.  targeted) attacks153. Creating awareness with regard to social media/networking applications  can be considered as a “work in progress” area154. Important personal information can be  found in social media such as: copies of driver licenses, ID cards, passports, registration cards,  school ID cards or credit cards155.   Due to the need to transfer information among servers, mobile applications, cloud servers,  etc. it is necessary to introduce/use security controls to avoid data exfiltration for data that  are on the move or reside in end-devices that are not properly managed, at least security wise.  Such controls need to be positioned at all components interacting by means of application  scenarios, both within and outside the organisation156.   A relevant study shows that over 50% of tested applications exhibit weaknesses regarding  information leakage related to application, its implementation, user data, etc. Moreover, over  30% of applications are prone to information leakage due to poor error handling. This fact  opens windows for abuse through information leakage threat152. This indicates an increased  need for secure application development practices.   Among the most common leaks found in applications are: information found in comments  (e.g. filename), cookie retrieval, internal IP addresses and server versions152.

As  such, identity theft is not overlap free with data breach and information leakage threats (see Annex B  in119). This threat is considered individually, because PII is a valuable asset that is often targeted in  cyber space by means of specific tools and attack vectors. As a matter of fact, PII can be part of a data  153http://www.academia.edu/6179116/Social_Information_Leakage_Effects_of_Awareness_and_Peer_Pressure_on_User_  Behavior, accessed October 2014.  154 http://research.itpro.co.uk/content34207, accessed October 2014.  155 http://www.cert.pl/PDF/Report_CP_2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  156 http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/2014-04-11-de_lancaster_executive_report.pdf, accessed  October 2014.  http://www.academia.edu/6179116/Social_Information_Leakage_Effects_of_Awareness_and_Peer_Pressure_on_User_Behavior http://www.academia.edu/6179116/Social_Information_Leakage_Effects_of_Awareness_and_Peer_Pressure_on_User_Behavior http://research.itpro.co.uk/content34207 http://www.cert.pl/PDF/Report_CP_2013.pdf http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/2014-04-11-de_lancaster_executive_report.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  34  breach, just as PII can be subject of information leakage. Relevant sources on this topic 157 ,158 ,159  underline the importance of identity theft and fraud as a consumer issue: following an observed  irregularity in financial transactions, credit card information or other identification information,  consumers consider their identity being compromised and/or used for fraud. Accordingly, they  proceed with notification to corresponding/competent organisations (e.g. Identity Theft Resource  Centre in the US160). To this extent, identity theft/fraud is an important term for consumers who have  experienced a successful attack that has revealed their PII.  In this reporting period we assessed that:   Increasing numbers of identity theft/fraud161 incidents have led to consumer mistrust in using  digital means for performing financial transactions. Over 50% of consumers have expressed  their concerns about reclaiming their identity in case they fall victim of this threat. This is  double the number assessed in 2011157. This concern is justified, as they constantly hear news  and reports about fraud in the areas financial, medical/health, taxation, POS, etc. It is  understandable that the trust to the protection offered by their service providers vanishes157.   Both emerging, yet security immature innovations but also older pieces of technology in the  area of home environments will become targets for identity theft: due to weakly implemented  or operated security controls, a variety of PII will flow through a number of interacting  components. Potential areas of PII to be exposed is entertainment, gaming, medical and  consumer information94.   An increased activity in the area of identity theft has been assessed by national authorities.  Threat agents have deployed more sophisticated methods, such as keyloggers, virtual  kidnapping using ransomware and phishing attacks, to perform identity theft and fraud  targeting small medium enterprises but also larger organisations180.   The role of interoperable identities increases together with the interoperability of applications  in the consumer market162. While delivering advancements in application usability and user  comfort, interoperable identities may introduce significant risks if one of those identities will  be subject to identity theft. Through the interoperability, the adversary may obtain access to  a number of other credentials by breaching only one94.   Businesses need to be prepared to manage customer reports on identity theft and fraud, as  this threat has been assessed to be at the first position of overall customer complains,  (increasing by 14% within 2013-2014158). Especially identity fraud in the area of medical care  is on the rise: in a survey on medical identity fraud, it has been estimated that ca. 2 million US  citizens will spend over $12 billion as consequence of identity fraud159,55.  157 http://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/global-consumers-losing-confidence-in-the-battle-against-  fraud-report, accessed October 2014.  158 http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-  2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  159https://www.privacyrights.org/sites/privacyrights.org/files/ID%20Experts%204th%20Annual%20Patient%20Privacy%20  &%20Data%20Security%20Report%20FINAL.pdf, accessed October 2014.  160 http://www.idtheftcenter.org/, accessed October 2014.  161 http://time.com/2953428/data-breaches-identity-theft/, accessed October 2014.  162 http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_050742.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_050742,  accessed October 2014.  http://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/global-consumers-losing-confidence-in-the-battle-against-fraud-report http://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/global-consumers-losing-confidence-in-the-battle-against-fraud-report http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf https://www.privacyrights.org/sites/privacyrights.org/files/ID%20Experts%204th%20Annual%20Patient%20Privacy%20&%20Data%20Security%20Report%20FINAL.pdf https://www.privacyrights.org/sites/privacyrights.org/files/ID%20Experts%204th%20Annual%20Patient%20Privacy%20&%20Data%20Security%20Report%20FINAL.pdf http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ http://time.com/2953428/data-breaches-identity-theft/ http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_050742.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_050742  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  35   Top types of PII breached between October 2013 and September 2014 are: real names,  government ID numbers and home addresses163.

Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Identity theft/fraud  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 16: Position of Identity Theft/Fraud in attack workflow  3.14 Cyber espionage  This threat has been introduced in the top threats due to the significant amount of incidents attributed  to nation states and corporations (see also section 4.2 on Threat Agents).With this cyber threat we  would like to refer mainly to APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and to Targeted Attacks, knowing that  the later kind of attacks is not only deployed within espionage campaigns164. Moreover, from assessed  material it becomes clear that APT is nothing more than a targeted attack that is being initiated by a  threat agent with very high capabilities and resources. It is also clear, that cyber espionage consists of  a combination of threats mentioned in this chapter. Hence, just as other threats in the present  chapter, the cyber espionage threat is not overlap-free with other threats mentioned. To this extent,  this threat refers rather to certain tools and tactics that match the profile of espionage threat agents:  cyber espionage is rather a tactical approach than technical165. As it is the case with some reports  found, cyber espionage is worth classifying according to campaigns encountered165. Whatever the  classification of this threat might be, it assumes a high level capability and corresponding motivation.  Moreover, this kind of attack and especially the reconnaissance phases may persist over a very long  time period, while attribution is very difficult, especially in case of state sponsored espionage. In the  reporting period we have seen cyber espionage on the rise: reports about incidents state a growth  that is close to 3% compared to last year166.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:  163 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-september-2014, accessed October 2014.  164 Due to the terminology diffusion regarding what is a threat and what is an attack vector, in ETL 2014 we have  introduced an extra chapter on the topic of attack vectors to further analyse this matter (see Chapter 5  “Attack Vectors”).  165 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/resources/threat-intelligence/targeted-attack-trends/rpt-targeted-attack-trends- 2h-2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  166 http://media.kaspersky.com/en/IT_Security_Risks_Survey_2014_Global_report.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-september-2014 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/resources/threat-intelligence/targeted-attack-trends/rpt-targeted-attack-trends-2h-2013.pdf http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/resources/threat-intelligence/targeted-attack-trends/rpt-targeted-attack-trends-2h-2013.pdf http://media.kaspersky.com/en/IT_Security_Risks_Survey_2014_Global_report.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  36   Quite some targeted attack campaigns have demonstrated an increase in focus, sophistication  and persistence55. We have seen attacks more narrowly tailored, addressing a reduced  number of recipients and organisations but increasing significantly in frequency. Spear  phishing and Strategic Web Compromise167 (SWC, aka Watering Hole) are important tools  used for initial phases of the attack (i.e. reconnaissance, weaponisation and delivery). Spyware  Trojans, Bootkits40 and remote access trojans168 (RAT) are often used malware in the phases  exploitation and persistence55,169.   Statistics show important trends observed in the reporting period55: there is an increase of  industry sectors targeted (11%) (i.e. wider campaigns). While the number of recipients  targeted has decreased (62%) (i.e. more targeted campaigns). Average duration of targeted  attacks increased (105%) (i.e. more persistent campaigns); and number of detected campaigns  increased significantly (472%).   The observed cascade of sophistication, complexity and capability levels start with advanced  persistent threat, go over to targeted attacks and end at cyber-criminals. With the  advancement of attacks, technology used today within APT and targeted attacks, will be  adopted over time by cyber-criminals167,169,170.   New attack methods that can be used in targeted and advanced persistent threat attacks  emerge in the area of research171. It can be assumed that advancements in new methods will  arise in the military and national security sectors172.   The volume of attacks by industry sector shows that the most popular targets of targeted  attacks are: governments (80%), computer/IT (4%), followed by Aerospace, Industrial,  Electrical, Telecommunications and Military (3% each)55,169. This fact clearly manifests the  areas of interest and motives behind cyber-espionage, being collection of intelligence  regarding political, strategic, technological and industrial developments.   Primarily within APTs but also targeted attacks, involved adversaries have demonstrated the  ability to evade existing controls, at least automated ones145. It is therefore advisable to  consider strengthening defences at the level of human-based controls, such as trainings  regarding phishing and spam and awareness raising measures in general.

In the reporting period we have seen ransomware  gaining importance as a malicious tool. Though some reduction of this threat has been expected after  law enforcement success of last year (Police Virus173, Zeus-Botnet174), a significant revival of this threat  has been assessed, in particular for mobile devices. Equally significant is the fact that ransom shows  growth potential due to updates performed in corresponding malicious tools, especially regarding  distribution, encryption and used payment methods. It seems that ransomware has gone through  improvements adopted from malware17. Moreover, it seems reasonable to speculate on the potential  entrance of a ransomware development kit in the cyber-crime market 175 ,36. Although ransom  decreased in the reporting period, the inclusion of mobile devices and the new features mentioned  above, create the impression that this threat will be increased in the future.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Advancements in functionality of ransomware have shown up after the announcement of a  Trojan encryption tool for sale in underground market for Android. Right after this  announcement, the first mobile malware embracing this functionality was detected. By the  end of second quarter of 2014, some 47 versions on the Trojan have been detected40. All  ransom attempts have used social engineering techniques to exert pressure on the victims40.   For the communication with the C&C server, one version of the Trojan has used the TOR  network. Although the use of the anonymity network is seen as an advancement, researchers  argue that this increases detectability both of the malware and the underlying botnet176. It  remains to be observed how TOR functionality usage within malware will evolve over the time.   It is interesting to observe how protective functions of mobile devices have been misused to  block phones and require a ransom: by attacking the Apple ID on iOS devices, adversaries  managed to completely block the device and as money to unlock the device177.   Thee ransomware threat can create damage, especially to businesses, while it is highly  profitable for cyber-criminals. As opposed to the past, available anonymous payment schemes  such as MoneyPack and QIWI VISA Wallet, facilitate cash flow to the cyber-criminals.

These  approaches build on the old saying “opportunity makes the thief.” In cyber-crime the situation is not  much different. In the reporting period we have seen cyber threat agents looking for opportunities to  better target their attacks and more easily fool their victims. The examples are self-speaking:  international sport events, specially crafted phishing attacks based on personal profiles/habits,  targeted campaigns to find weak links, etc.  Considering the opportunity factor in cyber-crime might be an important tool for defenders in order  to understand motivation and techniques that are likely to be used. By taking into account the issue  of opportunities in cyber-crime, it can be concluded that:   Cyber-crime opportunities often have location and time relevance: It is typical that, as ordinary  criminals, cyber criminals seek to abuse collective mind-sets that are formed within big  events182,183,184. Moreover, events with international political impact are main triggers for cyber-  crime, especially hacktivism, cyber-fighters and state sponsored espionage185,186,187,188.   Cyber-crime tries to increase opportunity specificity: cyber-crime seeks for specific opportunities  that increase success rates. In the reporting period we have experienced a shift towards more  targeted attacks to sets of opportunities that are concentrated to exploiting specific weaknesses.  Hence, instead of looking for victims in the wild, cyber attackers concentrate their attacks on set  of users, e.g. by abusing breached information189.   Cyber-crime produces opportunities for cyber-crime: The emergence of underground markets for  hacking tools and hacked information (i.e. cyber-crime as a service) shows clearly that cyber-crime  leads to cyber-crime. Cyber-crime underground forums, cyber-crime market places and offerings  are a clear indication hereto190.   Social and technological changes create cyber-crime opportunities: Building the basis of cyber-  crime for years now, social and technical changes are THE opportunity abused, especially in phases  181 http://skywallnet.com/data_server/CA/OMT_PP_CP.pdf, accessed October 2014.  182 http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/anonymous-threatens-cyber-attack-on-fifa-world-cup-sponsors-533657,  accessed October 2014.  183 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sochi-olympics-2014-cyber-threats-mean-there-no-privacy-winter-olympics-  1435387#channel=f32fe627f65f00c&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.co.uk, accessed October 2014.  184 http://www.eweek.com/security/world-cup-spurs-cyber-attacks-digital-protests.html, accessed October 2014.  185 http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/565988/20140911/isis-islamic-state-al-qaeda-caliphate.htm#.VDZLpqP6jZ4, accessed  October 2014.  186 http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/hong-kong-protesters-fight-cyber-attacks/2477307.html, accessed  October 2014.  187 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-  Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmis sion%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223, accessed  October 2014.  188 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18294/security/fireeye-nation-state-driven-cyber-attacks.html, accessed October  2014.  189 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small- businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard %20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_, accessed October 2014.  190 http://securityintelligence.com/underground-cybercrime-exploits-for-sale/#.VDY-ZqP6jZ4, accessed October 2014.  http://skywallnet.com/data_server/CA/OMT_PP_CP.pdf http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/anonymous-threatens-cyber-attack-on-fifa-world-cup-sponsors-533657 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sochi-olympics-2014-cyber-threats-mean-there-no-privacy-winter-olympics-1435387#channel=f32fe627f65f00c&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.co.uk http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sochi-olympics-2014-cyber-threats-mean-there-no-privacy-winter-olympics-1435387#channel=f32fe627f65f00c&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.co.uk http://www.eweek.com/security/world-cup-spurs-cyber-attacks-digital-protests.html http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/565988/20140911/isis-islamic-state-al-qaeda-caliphate.htm#.VDZLpqP6jZ4 http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/hong-kong-protesters-fight-cyber-attacks/2477307.html http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmission%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmission%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmission%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18294/security/fireeye-nation-state-driven-cyber-attacks.html http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small-businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard%20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small-businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard%20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small-businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard%20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_ http://securityintelligence.com/underground-cybercrime-exploits-for-sale/#.VDY-ZqP6jZ4  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  42  of growth, mass deployment/marketing and end of support. Knowing that, introduction of social  and technical changes should be “secure by design”. In the reporting period we have seen some  EU-Member States introducing security in early stages of technology adoption191,192 in order to  effectively reduce the window of this opportunity.  Yet not always feasible and obvious, with some awareness, these opportunities could be recognised  by defenders, thus contributing to situational prevention. In cyber-space this might mean adapting  defences, level of preparedness and expectations.  Looking at ways to better understand the methods used for opportunity emergence and opportunity  exploitation, might lead to a better cyber-defence. It is considered appropriate to more systematically  analyse this field and capitalized on existing experience from the area of criminology193.  4.2 Overview of Threat Agents  In the reporting period, we have seen evidence for the existence of almost all of threat agents  described in previous ETLs 194 . Hence, the same group of threat agents will be maintained, by  introducing a ranking according to attribution statistics found.  Generally speaking, some trends in the way threat agents place their attacks have been identified in  the reporting period: the most active threat agents seem to perform more targeted attacks. Speaking  in terms of opportunities, cyber threat agents are more effective in finding means for identification of  windows of opportunities. This is a new trend: cyber-criminals can better target their attacks and be  more successful in exploitation of vulnerabilities, while using more effectively malicious tools and  attack methods.  One reason assumed for this trend is advancements in capabilities of finding vulnerabilities  (technical/human). Breached/leaked information is considered as main tool to achieve this goal.  Secondly, advancements in attack techniques allow certain types of attacks to “fly under the radar”  by leaving no traces behind195,196. Finally, new attack practices combined with reconnaissance attacks  on web applications (e.g. smokescreening197) increase their efficiency, while reducing detections.  These tactics have led to the changes of threat landscape assessed within the ETL 2014.  191 https://blog.cyberwar.nl/2014/07/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-4/, accessed October 2014.  192 https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/#downloads, accessed October 2014.  193 http://www.cybercrimejournal.com/broadhurstetalijcc2014vol8issue1.pdf, accessed October 2014.  194 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2014.  195 http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601140/hackers-make-driveby-download-attacks-stealthier-with-fileless-  infections.html, accessed October 2014.  196 http://rt.com/news/175912-critroni-ransomware-tor-network/, accessed October 2014.  197 http://www.neustar.biz/resources/whitepapers/ddos-protection/2014-annual-ddos-attacks-and-impact-report.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  https://blog.cyberwar.nl/2014/07/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-4/ https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/#downloads http://www.cybercrimejournal.com/broadhurstetalijcc2014vol8issue1.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601140/hackers-make-driveby-download-attacks-stealthier-with-fileless-infections.html http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601140/hackers-make-driveby-download-attacks-stealthier-with-fileless-infections.html http://rt.com/news/175912-critroni-ransomware-tor-network/ http://www.neustar.biz/resources/whitepapers/ddos-protection/2014-annual-ddos-attacks-and-impact-report.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  43  In this chapter we provide an overview of the threat agents. In 2014, few elaborated descriptions  were found on this topic198,199,200,201,202,203,204. However, no significant changes in the typology of  Threat Agents could be observed. All in all, data collected in 2014 provides some additional  information, yet not much differing from previous reporting periods.  However, it should be mentioned that this observation regards publicly available information. There  are reports that law enforcement agencies work on profiling cyber criminals205. Yet this information  is kept confidential and as such not accessible for this report.  In order to better understand Threat Agents, advancements in attribution are necessary. Attribution  of incidents to various groups is difficult and laborious. In most cases attribution can be performed  with the cooperation of various players triggered through law enforcement. Attribution of incidents  to threat agents is an area that has significant development potential.  Moreover, observation of relevant underground market and its dynamics helps in understanding  important dependencies among various Threat Agents as well as their product and technology level.  It is worth mentioning that in the reporting period significant insights into the relevant market for  cyber-crime tools and stolen data has been found (Authoritative Resource: Report of Rand National  Security Research Division “Markets for Cybercrime Tools and Stolen Data”206).  The above developments aim at the validation of Threat Agent description and provide additional  details regarding motives and capabilities. While the threat agents from ETL 2013 still remain relevant,  the details assessed this year provide the basis for a ranking based on statistical information from  incidents (mainly reported incidents207 and data breaches208). The top five attributions of incidents  refer to the target groups: Cybercriminals, Hacktivists and Cyber Espionage, Insider Threat and Cyber  War. Accordingly, major threat agents identified are as follows (prioritised):  Cybercriminals: This threat agent group is the most widely known as its objective is to obtain profit  from illegal/criminal activities in cyberspace. In the reporting period, most of the observed incidents  have been attributed to this group. The main motivations behind their activities are intelligence and  monetisation. One main characteristic is the availability of large time and money budgets, while being  technically highly skilled and very well equipped. Often they use high-performance computing  resources and might be part of highly organised groups (i.e. organised crime in Far East and Eastern  Europe). Given existing crime opportunities and profitability of cybercrime, it is expected that  organised crime groups will increasingly engage in this field.  198 https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-  _an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf, accessed October  2014.  199 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/how-well-do-you-understand-your-cyber-adversary-part-1/,  accessed October 2014.  200 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/well-understand-cyber-adversary-part-3/, accessed October  2014.  201 http://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijict_spl/ijictv4n3spl_06.pdf, accessed October 2014.  202 http://technical.cloud-journals.com/index.php/IJACSIT/article/download/Tech-136/pdf, accessed October 2014.  203 http://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/infographic-the-many-faces-of-todays-hackers/a/d-  id/1317039?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT, accessed November 2014.  204 http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/9-notorious-hackers-of-2013/d/d-id/1113140,  accessed November 2014.  205 http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/6449644-74/hackers-bukh-criminals#axzz3FjI4gCyZ, accessed October 2014.  206 http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf, accessed October  2014.  207 http://hackmageddon.com/, accessed October 2014.  208 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014, accessed October 2014.  https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/how-well-do-you-understand-your-cyber-adversary-part-1/ http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/well-understand-cyber-adversary-part-3/ http://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijict_spl/ijictv4n3spl_06.pdf http://technical.cloud-journals.com/index.php/IJACSIT/article/download/Tech-136/pdf http://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/infographic-the-many-faces-of-todays-hackers/a/d-id/1317039?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT http://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/infographic-the-many-faces-of-todays-hackers/a/d-id/1317039?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/9-notorious-hackers-of-2013/d/d-id/1113140 http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/6449644-74/hackers-bukh-criminals#axzz3FjI4gCyZ http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf http://hackmageddon.com/ http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  44  Cybercriminals are typically involved in fraud regarding all kinds of sectors engaged in cyber-space: e- finance, e-commerce, e-payment, ransomware, cybercrime-as-a-service209, delivery and development  of malicious tools and infrastructures. Taking into account aspects of the cybercrime market, one can  discriminate among some specialized roles (often building hierarchical structures)193,206. Such roles are  administrators, specialized experts in various areas of cybercrime, intermediaries, brokers and  vendors. In the figure provided in this section, roles at the “productive” end of the cybercrime are  depicted by means of providers/developers/operators.  The cybercriminal market allows its suppliers/customers to obtain the means needed for their hostile  activities, such as knowledge, tools and breached data. By taking as given that this group possesses  significant monetary resources, it should be considered as being in the position to occupy additional  workforce in order to enhance capabilities210. Finally the utilisation of anonymisation, encryption and  virtual currencies, allows cyber criminals to move in a “dark market”, hence impeding detection and  attribution efforts.  Online Social Hackers: given the important role of phishing and stalking in targeting cyber-attacks,  this group is considered as part of criminal activities in cyber space211,212. Therefore this threat agent  group plays a key role when deploying cyber threats. Online social hackers are skilled with social  engineering knowledge, are in the position to analyse and understand behaviour and psychology of  social targets, thus evading privacy of potential victims. Main tools used are analysis of social  engineering information, profiling of user (e.g. by using loggers, social media accounts, breached  data). Even when not using high-tech methodologies and tools, activities of this threat agent group  may cause significant privacy impact especially in areas of identity theft, collection of confidential  personal data, user credentials, cyber bullying, etc. 213 , 214 . The capabilities of this group can be  characterised as low to medium as regards the use of technology. However their social engineering  skills are high. With increasing use of social networking, it is expected that the importance of this  group in cyber-attacks will play a significant role, as phishing is becoming an important tool for placing  cyber-attacks.  Hacktivists: Hacktivists is a threat agent group that has enjoyed great media attention, as they are  politically motivated activists. Their motivation emerges mainly from political ideology, they proclaim  social justice and sincerity and aim at propaganda and influence in political decision making. According  to their motive and ideological direction, they can dynamically form groups/subgroups, usually lacking  a central organisation structure. Typical reasons for their mobilisation are political decisions,  political/social crises and assumed injustice and unfairness towards social groups. Their reactions are  triggered during riots, international sport events and other major events with international attention.  In the reporting period we have seen quite few engagements of this target agent group in  209 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240231663/Service-model-driving-cyber-crime-says-Europol-report,  accessed October 2014.  210 http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-  careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html, accessed October 2014.  211 http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/jpmorgan-cybersecurity-idUSL2N0RY1CC20141003, accessed October  2014.  212 https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/iocta2014_summary_findings_and_recommendations.  pdf, accessed October 2014.  213 http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/social-media/people-hack-social-media-accounts/, accessed October  2014.  214 http://hackerspace.lifehacker.com/social-hacking-for-introverts-1554859929, accessed October 2014.  http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240231663/Service-model-driving-cyber-crime-says-Europol-report http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/jpmorgan-cybersecurity-idUSL2N0RY1CC20141003 https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/iocta2014_summary_findings_and_recommendations.pdf https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/iocta2014_summary_findings_and_recommendations.pdf http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/social-media/people-hack-social-media-accounts/ http://hackerspace.lifehacker.com/social-hacking-for-introverts-1554859929  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  45  corresponding occasions215,216,217,218. The main malicious activities of this group include: DDoS attacks,  leakage, defacement, hacking219.  Due to the dynamics behind this group, it is difficult to give it a sharp profile: in some cases, threat  agents of other groups – e.g. script kiddies - join hacktivists activities in order to co-protest or to serve  other purposes (e.g. express their sympathy, perform knowledge transfer, provide tools, etc.). Due to  these dynamics, alleged hacktivist activities might be a façade used by groups with different  motives220.  Targets are selected in such a way, that media attention to successful cyber-attacks creates high  visibility (e.g. government sites, big companies, media, public and private infrastructure components,  etc.). Typical actions of successful attacks include publishing of breached data and video messages to  maximize public attention. Defence costs against threats of hacktivists are considered as moderate. In  the reporting period it has been reported for first time that security agencies have performed counter- attacks to defend hacktivist activities221.  Nation States: The Snowden revelations in 2013-2014 have shed a new light in hostile activities that  emerge as part of national security and intelligence/counter-intelligence regimes of nation states. The  true dimension behind the potential of this threat agent group is a main ongoing focus of media since  then (here few indicative references due to the large amount222). In the reporting period the state- sponsored espionage threat has created concerns to media223, security experts224,225,226 and industry  alike, while has ranked at third position in attribution of cyber-incidents.  In the meantime, various nation states have developed cyber-intelligence capabilities227. Due to non- transparent policies and regimes, it can be assumed that all countries with such capabilities could  potentially be involved in cyber-attacks, with a significant part being in the area of  intelligence/counter-intelligence. Even within allies, no clear no-spy policies exist 228 . Taking into  account resources and budget availability, hostile cyber-activities of nation states are a severe threat  that can cause high defence costs, while creating severe impact both at governmental and corporate  levels. Main targets of this threat agent group are state secrets, military secrets, data on intelligence,  as well as threatening the availability of critical infrastructures.

As it is the case with espionage in general, nation state  activities aim at the creation of intelligence, strategic, psychological and political advantages229.  Corporations: The growth of activities in corporate espionage follows the trends in state-sponsored  cyber-espionage: it grows by targeting corporate information230,231,232. The aim is to collect business  intelligence, stealing competitive information (e.g. research results, analyses, innovation ideas,  planned procurements etc.), breach intellectual property rights (IPR), or even cause damage/sabotage  to competitors. Being significantly budgeted and having sufficient knowledge, potential attacks from  this threat agent group could cause high costs233. Generally speaking, corporations may be involved in  reconnaissance activities, intrusion and data breach. Being in close cooperation with state, industrial  espionage may use existing state cyber-resources to achieve their objectives 234 . Moreover,  corporations may engage salaried threat agents from other groups to achieve their objectives.  Employees (current, ex, internal and external): motivated by extortion, revenge, sabotage or profit,  this group has a significant role in the materialisation of cyber threats, especially those that lead to  data breaches235. Referred to as Insider Threat, this threat group embraces both own and contracted  employees, i.e. staff, contractors, operational staff, former employees, etc. Threats emanating from  this target group may be both intentional and unintentional (i.e. i.e. lax handling of security  procedures, user error or even malicious intent). ENISA incident reporting, for example, has shown  that in the telecommunication sector Human Error and Third Party Failure are within the top 5 causes  for large outages236. The effort required to protect assets against such threats can be quite high237.  Therefore it is important to identify employee unhappiness, spot knowledge-gaps and get alerted  when attacks abuse publicly unknown vulnerabilities202.  Cyber Fighters: Cyber fighters are groups of nationally motivated citizens who possess significant  striking power. Their attacks are politically motivated and, in a similar manner to hacktivists, are  concentrating mainly to sabotage, by often publishing of breached data and video messages to  maximize public attention. Such groups might have strong feelings when their political, national or  religious values seem to be threatened by another group and are capable of launching cyber-attacks.  To certain extent, such groups may be supporters of totalitarian regimes and, rightly or wrongly, act  on behalf of their supporting parties (i.e. governments) by contributing to national activities in the  cyber-space238,239.  229 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_spying, accessed October 2014.  230 http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/robert-gates-most-countries-conduct-economic-espionage/, accessed October 2014.  231 http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/corporate-espionage-gavin-haynes-284, accessed October 2014.  232 http://www.dw.de/german-businesses-face-rising-threat-of-industrial-espionage/a-17798275, accessed October 2014.  233 http://cybertinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HARKONNEN-OPERATION-CYBER-ESPIONAGE1.pdf, accessed  October 2014.  234 http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/26/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126, accessed  October 2014.  235 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_Verizon-DBIR-2014_en_xg.pdf, accessed October 2014.  236 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-  reports-2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2014.  237 http://www.vormetric.com/resources/Infographics/the-2014-vormetric-insider-threat-report-european-edition,  accessed October 2014.  238 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background, accessed October 2014.  239 http://cybershafarat.com/2014/10/13/post-9-abu-bahgat-hatem-deeb-syrian-electronic-army-leadership/, accessed  October 2014.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_spying http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/robert-gates-most-countries-conduct-economic-espionage/ http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/corporate-espionage-gavin-haynes-284 http://www.dw.de/german-businesses-face-rising-threat-of-industrial-espionage/a-17798275 http://cybertinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HARKONNEN-OPERATION-CYBER-ESPIONAGE1.pdf http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/26/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_Verizon-DBIR-2014_en_xg.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.vormetric.com/resources/Infographics/the-2014-vormetric-insider-threat-report-european-edition http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background http://cybershafarat.com/2014/10/13/post-9-abu-bahgat-hatem-deeb-syrian-electronic-army-leadership/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  47  In the reporting period we have seen more systematic and well organised activities from this threat  agent group240,241,242,243. Activities of this target group from this year are characterized by increased  maturity and sophistication of attack methods used.  Cyber Terrorists: cyber terrorism continued to be controversially discussed in the reporting period244.  In this time, more extensive descriptions of this threat agent group could be found245. Supposedly,  cyber terrorists are targeting large-scale sabotage to harm national security and society, mainly aiming  at critical infrastructure. Characteristic of this threat agent group is the indiscriminate use of violence  in order to influence decisions/actions of states towards their politically or relationally motivated  objectives. As a matter of fact, no publicly known incident has been attributed to this target group in  the reporting period. Nevertheless, national cyber-security strategies rate cyber-terrorism risks quite  high and have developed numerous defences for protection 246 . At the same time it has been  recognised that risks from cyber-crime and not cyber-terrorism is the major threat for western  countries247. In the reporting period we have seen some evidence that terrorists may use technology  as means for improving their communication while avoiding state surveillance. Yet, according to the  definition of this threat agent group this is not a hostile activity. However, such an engagement may  lead to increasing knowledge of related tools that can be then used to launch attacks248,249. In this  reporting period a report was found that gives an interesting overview of potential misuse of the  Internet by terrorists. It provides a detailed list of use-cases, potential actions and tools250.  Script Kiddies: This target group consists of young individuals who might be thrilled about  achievements and skills of tech savvy individuals who assumedly gave a lesson to persons,  organisations or brands considered outrageous. Although they are not be present in incident statistics  in the reporting period, script kiddies are still considered as threat agents. The rationale behind this  is, that due to the ease of obtaining malicious tools, tech savvy teenagers will purchase and use  them251. Consequently, due to potentially low level of knowledge about the use of hacking tools, low  threshold of self-control, overestimation of own skills and the consequences of their activities, script  kiddies may achieve great impact. Although it is not expected that significant incidents will be  attributed to this threat agent group, it is considered within the ETL 2014for the sake of completeness.  As a short reflection to forthcoming developments of the threat landscape, it is recognised that  emerging technologies might create the grounds for malicious activities targeting smaller user  communities. This might lead to creation of new threat agent groups, even if the reach of their activity  240 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-attackers-announce-phase-4-a-5929/op-1, accessed October 2014.  241 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-24/three-things-you-should-know-about-the-syrian-electronic-army.html,  accessed October 2014.  242 http://sea.sy/index/en, accessed October 2014.  243 http://www.securityweek.com/tunisian-hackers-target-governments-banks-theweekofhorror-cyber-attacks, accessed  October 2014.  244  http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/awan_debating_the_term_cyber-terrorism_ijc_jan_2014.pdf, accessed  October 2014.  245 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/explaining-cyberterrorism/, accessed October 2014.  246 http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-director-calls-for-stronger-deterrent-strategy-to-  oppose-cyberattacks/2014/02/27/aabd3d92-9fd4-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html, accessed October 2014.  247 http://threatpost.com/cyberespionage-not-cyber-terror-is-the-major-threat-former-nsa-director-says/105223,  accessed October 2014.  248 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751896/Islamic-State-jihadists-planning-encryption-protected-cyber-  caliphate-carry-hacking-attacks-West.html, accessed October 2014.  249 http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/16/nsa-director-michael-rogers-talks-islamic-state-cybersecurity,  accessed October 2014.  250 http://www.computerweekly.com/ehandbook/Terrorist-use-of-the-internet, accessed October 2014.  251 http://www.itnews.com.au/BlogEntry/396629,being-a-script-kiddie-easier-than-ever.aspx, accessed October 2014.  http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-attackers-announce-phase-4-a-5929/op-1 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-24/three-things-you-should-know-about-the-syrian-electronic-army.html http://sea.sy/index/en http://www.securityweek.com/tunisian-hackers-target-governments-banks-theweekofhorror-cyber-attacks http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/awan_debating_the_term_cyber-terrorism_ijc_jan_2014.pdf http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/explaining-cyberterrorism/ http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-director-calls-for-stronger-deterrent-strategy-to-oppose-cyberattacks/2014/02/27/aabd3d92-9fd4-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-director-calls-for-stronger-deterrent-strategy-to-oppose-cyberattacks/2014/02/27/aabd3d92-9fd4-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html http://threatpost.com/cyberespionage-not-cyber-terror-is-the-major-threat-former-nsa-director-says/105223 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751896/Islamic-State-jihadists-planning-encryption-protected-cyber-caliphate-carry-hacking-attacks-West.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751896/Islamic-State-jihadists-planning-encryption-protected-cyber-caliphate-carry-hacking-attacks-West.html http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/16/nsa-director-michael-rogers-talks-islamic-state-cybersecurity http://www.computerweekly.com/ehandbook/Terrorist-use-of-the-internet http://www.itnews.com.au/BlogEntry/396629,being-a-script-kiddie-easier-than-ever.aspx  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  48  is limited. In the area of Smart Homes, for example, activities of harassment, abuse, sabotage, bullying,  etc. could be initiated from individuals as result of neighbourhood disputes, landlords and tenants,  etc. Just as in the case of bullying, this kind of malicious activity may cost human lives and should not  be left out of scope.  As no significant changes in threat agent profiles have been observed in the reporting period, we reuse  the threat agent taxonomy of ETL 2013 in order to provide an overview (see Figure 19). It should be  noted, that the threat agents mentioned in this chapter are depicted in the figure through the right  hand branch, annotated as Hostile Cyber Agent, whereas the left hand branch of it stays for other  agents who serve friendly tasks in cyber space.  Besides serving as an overview, this figure may be used in order to follow/comprehend eventual  interactions among the different groups, such as possible “camp changes”, concurrent roles or other  interactions among them252.

ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  50  ETL 2014: Attack Vectors  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  51  5 Attack Vectors  5.1 Attack Vectors within threat intelligence  In the ETL 2013253, we have identified attack workflow and attack patterns as important pieces of  information in order to better understand cyber threats. Such information will add value to identified  threats, as every threat description will contain information on methods used to successfully deploy  a specific threat. In this chapter we firstly position this information with regard to threats and explain  its role. Moreover, we provide some information found on this matter by means of distinct attack  methods assessed in the reporting period.  As already indicated in the used definitions (see section 2.6), in this year’s ETL we have introduced  Attack Vectors as an element of threat analysis. In the rest of this chapter, as an initial approach we  use the term attack vector as synonymous with attack pattern and attack workflow. Knowing that  these terms are already being used in threat modelling254, we will not dive into details of such concepts  for the time being255. Attack vectors will be considered rather from a practical point of view as an  additional element for the understanding of cyber threats. To this extent, we will use the following  simplistic definition of attack vectors:  If the assessed cyber threats are the malicious tools of threat agents, what are the ways these tools  are used in order to harm assets? In other words: if the cyber threats are the “what”, then what is the  “how” to achieve a successful attack? The how reflected by the attack vector.  Knowing that this definition might be very simplistic and subjective, we use it for the time being as a  sort of “pilot” to provide some information on attack vectors. Over time, this term will eventually  mature further and become more comprehensive/inclusive. For the time being, however, we would  assume attack vectors contain schematic information about the steps within an attack and the assets  that have been compromised in order to achieve the malicious objectives (i.e. actions on objectives,  as stated in kill chains).  Having stated this, we recognise that the concept of kill chains that is being used in the current threat  landscape, is related to attack vectors. Within this work, we make the assumption that a kill-chain  characterizes various phases of an attack vector. Hence, possible redundancies between kill-chain  information and attack vector information should be tolerated for the time being. Another source of  overlaps are assessed current threats: depending on the scope of each threat, it might be the case  that some information from the attack vector (i.e. about the “how”) is subsumed within the threat  definition. Examples from the current document are the threats: web based attacks (including drive- by-download attack) cyber espionage (including APT and targeted attacks), exploit kits, etc. In other  cases, a specific attack type is taken as synonymous to a threat (e.g. watering hole attack).  In order to gain information about attack vectors, an analysis of incidents needs to take place.  Depending on the level of the detail achieved/published, various levels of attack vectors will be  identifiable. The fact is, that attack vectors will be available for incidents that have been identified,  reported and analysed, eventually by using forensic evidence. Given that not all incidents are analysed  in this manner, it will not be always possible to provide this kind of information for assessed threats.  253 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed November 2014.  254 https://capec.mitre.org/, accessed November 2014.  255 This is an activity that might be taken into account within discussions with relevant stakeholders in the coming  year (2015).  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport https://capec.mitre.org/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  52  In the present chapter we deliver some preliminary information on the following attack vectors:  Targeted attack, Drive-by-attack and Web strategic compromise (watering hole attack) and Advanced  persistent threat (APT). These attack vectors have been selected as the most frequent and most  documented ones.  Before going into these attack vectors, we will provide with a short discussion on the state-of-play of  attack vector material found and the modalities used to describe attack vector information within ETL.  5.2 Describing a Cyber-Attack though Attack Information  The description of a cyber-attack is rather obvious: a threat agent uses tools (cyber threats) to abuse  weakness of some assets, thus obtaining access to these assets with the final aim to achieve their  malicious objectives (i.e. illegal profit/fraud, theft of valuable data, sabotage, etc.). This is identical to  the content depicted in figure 1 “Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit vulnerabilities” in  chapter 2.2 of ETL 2013256. To this extent, an attack may be described as a set of steps. Each step might  show an asset, its weakness/vulnerability, the tool to exploit the vulnerability and the consequences  of a successful attack. Having this information, defenders will be in the position to understand the  details of the attack and put in place defences to eliminate vulnerabilities (eventually by implementing  some security controls). This is considered as a strong tool, especially for stakeholders with reduced  threat analysis capabilities.  While information about the various steps of attacks were scarce in material found around 2010-2012,  in 2013, many vendors/organisations have provided information about the attacks. Just as ETL 2013  and 2014, some organisations collecting threat intelligence have used kill-chains to provide general  information about the phases of an attack supported by cyber threats257,258,259,260,261,262 (references  indicative and non-exhaustive). Kill-chains are definitely an important piece of information describing  the “purpose” of a cyber threat. Yet, they do not give information about the assets at stake and  vulnerabilities being abused. In some reports, a more detailed (mostly graphical) description of an  attack is being provided258,263,264,265,266,267 (references indicative and non-exhaustive).  Both kill-chains and graphical representations of attacks can be generic or campaign specific. This  would allow for structuring attack vectors according to their specificity (i.e. generic category of drive- by-attack vs. specific drive-by-attacks within a certain campaign). Although structuring existing  information in that way may be an interesting exercise, it might require significant effort. Apparently,  256 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed November 2014.  257 http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-threat-report.aspx, accessed October 2014.  258 http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/2014-04-11-de_lancaster_technical_report.pdf, accessed  November 2014.  259 http://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/fireeye-real-world-assessment.pdf, accessed November 2014.  260 http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_draft.pdf, accessed November 2014.  261 http://www.mitre.org/publications/all/ten-strategies-of-a-world-class-cybersecurity-operations-center, accessed  November 2014.  262 http://docs.ismgcorp.com/files/external/Target_Kill_Chain_Analysis_FINAL.pdf, accessed November 2014.  263 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v19_221284438.en-us.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  264 http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Inside-a-Targeted-Point-of-Sale-Data-Breach.pdf, accessed  November 2014.  265 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/greedywonk-campaign-v2.png, accessed November 2014.  266 http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-  dangerous-results/, accessed November 2014.  267 http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/threat-intelligence-center/targeted-attacks, accessed November 2014.  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-threat-report.aspx http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/2014-04-11-de_lancaster_technical_report.pdf http://www2.fireeye.com/rs/fireye/images/fireeye-real-world-assessment.pdf http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/800-150/sp800_150_draft.pdf http://www.mitre.org/publications/all/ten-strategies-of-a-world-class-cybersecurity-operations-center http://docs.ismgcorp.com/files/external/Target_Kill_Chain_Analysis_FINAL.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v19_221284438.en-us.pdf http://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Inside-a-Targeted-Point-of-Sale-Data-Breach.pdf http://www.fireeye.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/greedywonk-campaign-v2.png http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/ http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/ http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/threat-intelligence-center/targeted-attacks  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  53  sticking to kill-chains seems to be a more feasible approach, as indicated by the relatively wide  adoption of kill-chain within threat intelligence. A definite conclusion that can be drawn from this is,  that the matter of attack vectors is at an early maturity level and requires more elaboration in the  future.  Being a first pilot on attack vectors, the ETL 2014 will provide initial information on the attack vectors  mentioned in section 5.1 consisting of: a generic description of the attack, threat agents involved and  information sources found with some tags describing it (e.g. generic, campaign-specific, etc.). Due to  the fact that we are at an early phase of our learning curve regarding this topic, the level of information  provided could be characterized as initial. The material collected is not only from the reported period  but also older. This allowed us to obtain a critical mass for the initial investigation of attack vectors.  Upon discussions with stakeholders and received feedback on this topic, we will consider expanding  this information in the future by adding additional levels of description/details as deemed necessary.  5.3 Targeted attacks  Description: Targeted attacks are per definition attacks that are based on some specific knowledge  regarding the target268. Based on this knowledge, adversaries craft specific messages or other artefacts  to lure the victim. When arriving at the victims end, the malicious message is not recognised as such  due to the familiarity  that has been built in by the adversary (i.e. reference to a familiar personal,  organisational process/matter). The victim “bites” the bait and an initial infection has been achieved.  Relation to kill-chain: Targeted attacks usually cover all phases of a kill-chain. A targeted attack starts  with reconnaissance to obtain the initial knowledge about personal, internal, organisational and other  characteristics of the victim. After that a weaponisation takes place (i.e. finding the right malicious  artefact to perform the infection). The delivery takes place by means of the time point the victim “bites  the bait”. Then an exploitation takes place in that the malicious artefact finds a vulnerability to be  exploited. Eventually, the malicious artefact perform an installation (i.e. malicious code) that may  establish a communication channel with the adversary (i.e. command and control) to obtain the final  actions on objectives.  Specificities/specialisations: A targeted attack may have many forms such as: spear phishing 269 ,  watering hole attack (see dedicated description below), port attack, etc. Several of these attacks may  be crafted to fit a particular sector270,271,272. Baits for targeted attacks may be based on hypes from  breaking news, political events, crises, conflicts etc.  Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of targeted attacks the following  information was found:  268 http://marcoramilli.blogspot.gr/2014/07/cyber-intelligence-abusing-internet.html, accessed November 2014.  269 http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/definitions/spear-  phishing?typnews=Social_media#.VGNAVaNBsnM, accessed November 2014.  270http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/targeted_attacks_against  _the_energy_sector.pdf, accessed November 2014.  271 http://www.securityweek.com/spear-phishing-hooked-businesses-big-and-small-2013-symantec-report, accessed  November 2014 (provides as a summary of Symantec threat report).  272 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-  leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html, accessed November 2014.  http://marcoramilli.blogspot.gr/2014/07/cyber-intelligence-abusing-internet.html http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/definitions/spear-phishing?typnews=Social_media#.VGNAVaNBsnM http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/definitions/spear-phishing?typnews=Social_media#.VGNAVaNBsnM http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/targeted_attacks_against_the_energy_sector.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/targeted_attacks_against_the_energy_sector.pdf http://www.securityweek.com/spear-phishing-hooked-businesses-big-and-small-2013-symantec-report http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  54   (Typical) Spear phishing attack273,274   Trend Alert campaign275   Targeted attack data exfiltration276   Targeted attack with dropper277  Involved adversaries: All kinds of adversaries can be involved in targeted attacks: cyber-criminals,  online social hackers, hacktivists, nation states, corporations, employees, cyber fighters, cyber  terrorists, script kiddies.  5.4 Drive-by-attacks  Description: In a drive-by-attack, the victim visits a manipulated legitimate web site/page/application.  Through the manipulation (i.e. injection) the victim’s browser is redirected to a maliciously prepared  site. It checks the victim’s browser vulnerabilities and installs silently malware that exploits the  discovered vulnerabilities. Other variations of drive-by-attacks use manipulated advertisements or  other third party components referenced by Widgets279. Some sources refer to drive-by-downloads  via viewing of an e-mails or pop-up 278 . Victims cannot visually recognise if a legitimate web  site/page/application is compromised. This makes visual detection of drive-by-attacks by users  impossible279,280,281.  Relation to kill-chain: Drive-by-attacks have all phases of a kill-chain, apart from reconnaissance.  Weaponisation happens via vulnerability scanning of victim’s browser. Delivery is performed via  downloaders, while exploitation takes place after the execution downloaded binaries282. According to  exploits found, the malware downloads corresponding malicious code (usually a Trojan) that takes  control of the victim’s device (i.e. performing the phases command and control and action on  objectives)280.  Specificities/specialisations: Variations of drive-by attacks do exist, depending on the way a redirect is  being implemented. Besides HTML manipulations, redirects can be implemented via manipulation of  widgets (e.g. referring to advertisements). Further variations concern vulnerabilities exploited.  Besides web browser, browser add-ons, operating system or third party applications may be exploited  (Silverlight, Flash283, PDF reader or video player).  273 http://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/safety/info_management/cyberattack.html, accessed November 2014.  274 http://about-  threats.trendmicro.com/RelatedThreats.aspx?language=tw&name=Anatomy%20of%20a%20Data%20Breach, accessed  November 2014.  275 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/05/targeted-attack-trend-alert-plugx-the-old-dog-with-a- new-trick.html, accessed November 2014.  276  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/data-exfiltration-in-targeted-attacks/, accessed November  2014.  277 http://news.softpedia.com/news/RARSTONE-RAT-Used-in-Targeted-Attacks-Against-Asian-Organizations- 360843.shtml#sgal_0, accessed November 2014.  278 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download, accessed November 2014.  279 http://www.imperva.com/Resources/Glossary?term=drive_by_downloads, accessed November 2014.  280 http://blogs.sophos.com/2014/03/26/how-malware-works-anatomy-of-a-drive-by-download-web-attack-infographic/,  accessed November 2014.  281 http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2011/12/08/what-you-should-know-about-drive-by-download-attacks-part-1/,  accessed November 2014.  282 https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotbots07/tech/full_papers/provos/provos.pdf, accessed November 2014.  283 https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2014/08/shining-some-light-on-the-unknown-exploit-kit/, accessed  November 2014.  http://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/safety/info_management/cyberattack.html http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/RelatedThreats.aspx?language=tw&name=Anatomy%20of%20a%20Data%20Breach http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/RelatedThreats.aspx?language=tw&name=Anatomy%20of%20a%20Data%20Breach http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/05/targeted-attack-trend-alert-plugx-the-old-dog-with-a-new-trick.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/05/targeted-attack-trend-alert-plugx-the-old-dog-with-a-new-trick.html http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/data-exfiltration-in-targeted-attacks/ http://news.softpedia.com/news/RARSTONE-RAT-Used-in-Targeted-Attacks-Against-Asian-Organizations-360843.shtml#sgal_0 http://news.softpedia.com/news/RARSTONE-RAT-Used-in-Targeted-Attacks-Against-Asian-Organizations-360843.shtml#sgal_0 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download http://www.imperva.com/Resources/Glossary?term=drive_by_downloads http://blogs.sophos.com/2014/03/26/how-malware-works-anatomy-of-a-drive-by-download-web-attack-infographic/ http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2011/12/08/what-you-should-know-about-drive-by-download-attacks-part-1/ https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotbots07/tech/full_papers/provos/provos.pdf https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2014/08/shining-some-light-on-the-unknown-exploit-kit/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  55  Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of drive-by downloads, the following  information was found (indicative):   Drive-by-attack (also referred to as web malware attack)284,285,286,287   Drive-by-attack (Darkleech malware) 288   Drive-by download (Flash file based)289   Drive-by download (JS_WEBSTAR)290   Drive-by download (Malvertising, DOUBLE CLICK Banner, advertisement)291,292,293  Involved adversaries: The following adversaries could run a drive-by attack: cyber-criminals,  hacktivists, nation states, corporations, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists.  5.5 Strategic web compromise (watering hole attack)  Description: The watering hole attack is based on the infection of a legitimate web site that is being  trusted/visited by a group of people that are under attack294. By visiting this compromised web site,  visitors will be infected. To this extent, watering hole attacks are drive-by attacks (see 5.4) for a narrow  group of victims. Watering hole attacks are also referred to as strategic web compromise (SWC)295.  This attack is supposed to be complementary to spear phishing or other forms of phishing (i.e. are  effective in case a group is resistant against such targeted attacks, see 5.3)296.  Relation to kill-chain: The difference between SWC attacks and drive-by attacks, is that SWC starts  with a reconnaissance in order to identify web sites that the target group uses/trusts. The rest  continues as a drive-by attack: weaponisation happens via vulnerability scanning of victim’s browser.  Delivery is performed via downloaders, while exploitation takes place after the execution downloaded  binaries. Subsequently, installed malware (usually Trojan or Remote Access Trojans – RAT) performs  phases command and control and action on objectives295.  Specificities/specialisations: Watering hole attacks are classified as targeted attacks (see 5.3). This is  because through proper selection of the infected web site, adversaries may launch their attack on a  specific group of users (e.g. developers, marketing, media teams etc.). The rest of the watering hole  attack takes place as a drive-by download.  284 http://www.microsoft.com/security/assets/images/_security/sir_v11/keyfindings/rg_section_7_4.jpg, accessed  November 2014.  285 http://sophos.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/webc2a0threatsc2a0infographic.pdf, accessed November 2014.  286 http://andyrussellcronin.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/drive-by-download-attack-example.png, accessed November  2014.  287 http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/the-invisible-drive-by-download-attack-I-attacker-infrastructure-how-  it-works.php, accessed November 2014.  288 http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/darkleech-1024x350.png, accessed November 2014.  289 http://blogs.cisco.com/security/far-east-targeted-by-drive-by, accessed November 2014.  290 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/dumpImages/294201051312.jpeg, accessed November 2014.  291http://blog.armorize.com/2010/12/hdd-plus-malware-spread-through.html, accessed November 2014.  292 http://securelist.com/blog/research/66415/gaps-in-corporate-network-security-ad-networks/, assessed November  2014.  293 http://www.invincea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Micro-Targeted-Malvertising-WP-10-27-14-1.pdf, accessed  November 2014.  294 http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101, accessed November  2014.  295http://www.crowdstrike.com/sites/all/themes/crowdstrike2/css/imgs/platform/CrowdStrike_Global_Threat_Report_20  13.pdf, accessed October 2014., accessed November 2014.  296 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_Hole, accessed November 2014.  http://www.microsoft.com/security/assets/images/_security/sir_v11/keyfindings/rg_section_7_4.jpg http://sophos.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/webc2a0threatsc2a0infographic.pdf http://andyrussellcronin.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/drive-by-download-attack-example.png http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/the-invisible-drive-by-download-attack-I-attacker-infrastructure-how-it-works.php http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/the-invisible-drive-by-download-attack-I-attacker-infrastructure-how-it-works.php http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/darkleech-1024x350.png http://blogs.cisco.com/security/far-east-targeted-by-drive-by http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/dumpImages/294201051312.jpeg http://blog.armorize.com/2010/12/hdd-plus-malware-spread-through.html http://securelist.com/blog/research/66415/gaps-in-corporate-network-security-ad-networks/ http://www.invincea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Micro-Targeted-Malvertising-WP-10-27-14-1.pdf http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101 http://www.crowdstrike.com/sites/all/themes/crowdstrike2/css/imgs/platform/CrowdStrike_Global_Threat_Report_2013.pdf http://www.crowdstrike.com/sites/all/themes/crowdstrike2/css/imgs/platform/CrowdStrike_Global_Threat_Report_2013.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_Hole  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  56  Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of SWC/watering hole attacks, the  following information was found (indicative):   Strategic Web Compromise Activity (references including few campaigns)295,297,298   Watering hole attack299,300,301,302   Watering hole attack against Space Foundation303  Involved adversaries: Adversaries of SWC are almost identical to drive-by attacks: cyber-criminals,  hacktivists, nation states, corporations, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists. However, incidents indicate a  stronger engagement of threat agents with espionage aims (i.e. nation states, corporations).  5.6 Advanced persistent threat (APT)  Description: Advanced persistent threats refer to narrowly targeted campaigns that are performed  from threat agents with high capabilities. Another characteristic of these attacks is their persistence:  they usually run over a very long time period (i.e. years/months)304. The high capabilities are usually  evidenced through a high degree of orchestration, use of advanced, specially crafted malware and  extensive knowledge on details of the victim. These attacks are characteristic for espionage activities.  This is due to the fact that the degree of capabilities demonstrated within such attacks can mainly be  attributed to teams with large resources for preparation, reconnaissance, programming, vulnerability  detection, computing power, etc. It is assumed that only state sponsored espionage can explain the  provision of such an amount of resources.  Relation to kill-chain: Due to their advancement, size and quality, APTs cover the all phases of kill- chain (reconnaissance, weaponisation, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control,  action on objectives). Given their impact and importance, APT attacks have been analysed in a very  detailed manner: the phases of APTs have been specified at a detail that goes beyond kill-chain  phases305,306,307,308.  Specificities/specialisations: APTs are also targeted attacks that are initiated by threat agents with high  capabilities. Main specificity of APT is the long duration of attacks. Another important characteristic is  the differentiation of APTs: by targeting a specific victim, APTs are quite different, especially regarding  the malware used. Hence, each APT campaigns might have unique peculiarities in the preparation and  297 http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-  dangerous-results/, accessed November 2014.  298 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2014/02/operation-greedywonk-multiple-economic-and-  foreign-policy-sites-compromised-serving-up-flash-zero-day-exploit.html, accessed November 2014.  299 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/internet-explorer-zero-day-used-watering-hole-attack-qa, accessed  November 2014.  300 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/de/webattack/137/Watering+Hole+101, accessed November 2014.  301 http://zappytech.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/watering-hole.png, accessed November 2014.  302 http://bvisible.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Watering-Hole-Infographic1.png, accessed November 2014.  303 http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/01/06/forgotten-watering-hole-attacks-on-space-foundation-and-rsf-chinese/,  accessed November 2014.  304 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat, accessed November 2014.  305 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#mediaviewer/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg,  accessed November 2014.  306 http://hackmageddon.com/2011/10/13/apts-and-security-information-management/, accessed November 2014.  307 http://piratehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Picture1.png, accessed November 2014.  308 http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-aptplan/index.html, accessed November 2014.  http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/ http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/ http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2014/02/operation-greedywonk-multiple-economic-and-foreign-policy-sites-compromised-serving-up-flash-zero-day-exploit.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2014/02/operation-greedywonk-multiple-economic-and-foreign-policy-sites-compromised-serving-up-flash-zero-day-exploit.html http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/internet-explorer-zero-day-used-watering-hole-attack-qa http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/de/webattack/137/Watering+Hole+101 http://zappytech.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/watering-hole.png http://bvisible.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Watering-Hole-Infographic1.png http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/01/06/forgotten-watering-hole-attacks-on-space-foundation-and-rsf-chinese/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#mediaviewer/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg http://hackmageddon.com/2011/10/13/apts-and-security-information-management/ http://piratehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Picture1.png http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-aptplan/index.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  57  execution of the attack309,310,311,312,313 (indicative list of recent APT campaigns).

The content  of this chapter constitutes the Emerging Threat Landscape. The information presented has been  assessed by the analysis of relevant material. Besides security issues, emerging technology areas have  been identified and the level of maturity with regard to cyber security has been assessed (e.g. in the  area of network virtualisation). Thus, threat trends in emerging technology areas have been either  directly mentioned in or have been implicitly assessed from the analysed material.  In the ETL 2014, some emerging areas from last year have been kept, while some new ones have been  introduced. This occurred as a reaction to technological developments that have been identified in  various application and technology areas in the reporting period. Moreover, focus shifts on emerging  issues in well-established areas, as for example Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) have been  reflected accordingly.  Besides establishing a connection between  the threat landscape and emerging areas, this chapter  identifies a number of security issues for each area that may be subject to security considerations in  the middle term (i.e. 2015). These issues regard highlights/conclusions/open problems that have come  to our attention during the analysis of material found and/or interactions with experts within and  outside ENISA. Although not exhaustive, these issues might constitute focal points for future ENISA  work. For example, identified issues from last year’s ETL have been taken into account within detailed  threat landscapes that have been developed for smart environments409 and internet infrastructure324.  Similarly, some of the areas that are covered in this chapter may be the subject of more detailed threat  assessments within 2015, depending on feedback from ENISA stakeholders (e.g. big data, network  virtualisation or specific applications of smart environments, such as smart cities).  In particular, the emerging technology areas considered in this ETL are:   Cyber Physical Systems: Cyber physical systems have been assessed as an emerging issue,  especially within Critical Infrastructure Protection. With the current developments in areas  relevant to CIP, it is important to understand the impact of engineered environments within the  protection of critical goods, while assuring interoperability. A lot of innovations are expected to  take place in this area in the future.   Mobile Computing: The increasing role of mobile devices in the next generation IT architectures,  but also the fact that they serve as a basis of technology convergence, makes them an important  component both for users but also for operators of application services. As such, mobile devices  are increasingly getting targeted by cyber-adversaries and this trend is going to keep up in the  future.   Cloud Computing: Being another important component of next generation IT, cloud computing is  a technology that will bother users and security experts in the future. New/innovative usage  models, attack scenarios and security control implementations will be in the focus of cyber-  community in the future.   Trust Infrastructure: Trust infrastructures and authentication infrastructures in particular are the  most vital components of cyber-security. In the reporting period we have seen a lot of attacks on  these components. These attacks result in dynamic changes, introduction of good practices and  even innovations. Trust infrastructure is thus an evergreen of emerging cyber-security areas.  324 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl, accessed December 2014.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  60   Big Data: Though not yet completely explored, big data in the focus of cyber security for two  reasons: firstly it is a valuable asset and as such is being targeted by cyber-attacks; secondly, it  turns to become a very powerful tool for security professionals, as it significantly contributes to  building intelligence about threats and incident management.   Internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments: While the growth of  interconnected devices continues, smart environments and smart systems emerge in many  sectors. Under this emerging area we consider all kinds of interconnected devices that build up a  smart system, such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart cars, etc. The importance of this sector  led ENISA to perform in 2014 a sector specific threat landscape in the area of smart homes and  converged media409.  It should be noted that the above areas are not completely independent or overlap free. Mobile  computing, for example may be part of smart environments and have overlaps with trust  infrastructures and cloud computing. Assessing threat trends according to those areas, however,  allows for a better establishment of the context of each threat and helps assessing threat trends and  security issues in that area. It is worth noticing that some predictions for 2015 that have been  developed around the end of the reporting period draw similar conclusions325,326.  In the following sections a short discussion with the highlights of each particular area is given prior to  the emerging threat and trends assessed. In addition to the emerging threats, for each area we provide  a number of important issues regarding developments/challenges in cyber-security that are seen as  relevant for the particular area. For each area, whenever applicable, the top 10 threats have been  assessed. It should be noted that these threat trends are usually not the result of detailed  assessments. This is because of the emerging nature of these areas. Hence, both the prioritisation and  assessed trends are an estimation and as such rather indicative for each particular area.  References to resources indicate the sources used for the assessment. With this information,  interested readers can have a deeper insight into the relevant matter.  6.1 Cyber Physical Systems as an emerging CIP issue  Cyber physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that interact with computing equipment being  seamlessly integrated to control, manage and optimize physical processes in a variety of areas from  traditional engineering science. Examples of such areas are power supply, medical  systems/healthcare, industrial systems and manufacturing, transportation, telecommunication and  many others327. Being at the interface to physical production, distribution and deployment processes,  CPS are vital for safety, resilience, security, adaptability, scalability. When combined with intelligent  functions, CPS will bring great advantages for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and is considered  as an emerging area that will have tremendous impact for innovation, availability of utilities and  efficiency of use. To this extend, this emerging area has been selected in this year’s ETL to reflect  challenges in critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP) by covering the link to physical world,  a source of impactful, yet difficult to manage security incidents.  Being at the transition point between physical and IT worlds, CPS will aim at illuminating the interplay  between information technology and engineering. A typical example is security vs. safety: in numerous  325 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/threat-landscape-2014-and-beyond-symantec-and-norton-predictions-2015-  asia-pacific-japan, accessed December 2014.  326 http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/mcafee-lab-report-previews-2015-developments-exploits-evasion/, accessed  December 2014.  327 http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14542/nsf14542.htm, accessed November 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/threat-landscape-2014-and-beyond-symantec-and-norton-predictions-2015-asia-pacific-japan http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/threat-landscape-2014-and-beyond-symantec-and-norton-predictions-2015-asia-pacific-japan http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/mcafee-lab-report-previews-2015-developments-exploits-evasion/ http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14542/nsf14542.htm  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  61  discussions, for example in the area of Smart Grids, experts have debated about how safety issues,  long matured in the engineering area, can be adopted/supported/reflected in security controls and  vice versa. CPS seems a promising area that will facilitate transition between engineering and  information technology, thus eliminating deficiencies stemming from (quite natural) mutual  knowledge gaps between these disciplines.  In the consumer area, an important role in the interconnection of IT and physical worlds is attributed  to internet of things and smart environments. In the industrial/engineering sector this role is  attributed to Smart Grids and SCADA systems. This emerges from the necessity to efficiently  manage/assist human life and achieve more efficient energy management and manufacturing  processes. The developments in these areas have been dictated from strong market needs that can  be saturated with the adoption of IT tools. Soon, other areas of interconnection between physical and  IT world will achieve market maturity.  Top (preliminary328) emerging threats to CPS are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Due to the early stages of action in this area,  these threats are rather indicative and of possibly restricted scope in comparison to the width and depth of this area.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  62   Both in the US and in Europe the area of CPS has received considerable attention. Initial material  towards strategies, innovation actions and research are in place327,329,330,331,332,333,334. Taking into  account advancements in engineering sciences and activities within the EU, one might argue that  CPS can be a favourable area for the creation of competitive advantages for European industry  and research. To this extent, CPS is a distinct opportunity for Europe that should continue  receiving the necessary attention from industry, academia and policy. The main focus should be  on breaking silos and enabling the creation of proper grounds for the necessary interdisciplinary  cooperation. Information found on the advancement of relevant activities leave the impression  that the US is slightly ahead with regard to this area335, as compared to EU at least at the  coordination level. Though this might be quite natural (one country vs. many Member States),  this does not mean that individual EU-Member States (e.g. Germany) are not in a more advanced  stage in CPS336.   Taking a look at cyber security and CPS in performed/announced international events337,338 one  can identify the following areas of interest/state-of-the-art that are indicative for upcoming  developments (non-prioritized list): authentication and access control for CPS, availability,  recovery and auditing for CPS, key management in CPS, legacy CPS system protection, lightweight  crypto and security, vulnerability analysis for CPS, threat modelling for CPS, wireless sensor  network security, intrusion detection for CPS, adaptive attack mitigation for CPS, trusted-  computing in CPS, forensics for CPS. It is worth mentioning, the fact that these events are among  the first organised in the area of CPS is indicative for the initial maturity of the entire topic.   Although CPS is a rather new topic, this does not mean that in particular areas no progress is  being achieved. The issue here is that this progress happens on a sector-by-sector basis, e.g. smart  grids, smart homes, internet of things, smart vehicles, etc. This leads to a segmentation of the  sectors and leads to a reduced interoperability among these sectors, a matter that is of great  importance given the increased convergence, brought for example by technologies like mobile  and cloud computing.   The absence of common architectures and interfaces bears segmentation risks and thus market  failure risk. Functional isolation of developed solutions with regard to an inevitable convergence  becomes evident when looking at currently independent sectors that are necessary to create user  centric experience. An example is the area of e-health: home care, assisted living, pharmaceutical,  hospital systems and healthcare are still individual sectors, yet necessary to deliver a holistic  service to ageing citizens.

The more interconnected devices are deployed, the more content and  control is going to converge by means of mobile devices and platforms. Being a basic component of  the mobile and interconnected ecosystem, mobile devices will continue to be the targets of cyber- criminals. It is expected that mobile device evolution rates will match the evolution rates of malicious  activities being observed in the reporting period340.  Following increases of threat sophistication, both interfaces and internal functions of mobile devices  will be abused. But the main future trend will remain the abuse of mobile devices with respect to the  entire mobile ecosystem, including cloud storage, app APIs, app internals (processed data and binary  code 341 ), abuse of vetting processes, stealth attacks, etc. The trend of migrating all malicious  techniques from PC to mobile will continue, whereas attack specially crafted for mobile devices will  show up. Such attacks have been impressively demonstrated by researchers342,343.  Top emerging threats to mobile computing are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Botnets   Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 5: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Mobile Computing  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   Malware infection vectors that evade protection (i.e. sandbox) are for quite some time in the  wild345. Yet, vicious mobile infection vectors are making their debut. Examples are: “implanting”  vulnerabilities into a mobile device through rogue applications346; abusing synchronisation of  mobile device with PC347,348; spread of malware that is tracking gestures349; misusing available  functions to control the mobile device350, abuse of loss protection controls351, etc. Combined with  advances that of general malware, these methods may deliver significant incidents in mobile  devices, and not only: mobile devices are often the door to connected services such as cloud  storage352.   The announced introduction of NFC-based payments via mobile devices will revive the payment  market. Given a better penetration of mobile payments, cybercriminals are going to be target the  payment platforms, eventually using attack scenarios from e-commerce and transaction based  economy353,354. It should not be a surprise to surface attacks that are attempt tampering of  hardware, but also available authentication functions.   Mobile security controls –both implementations and operation - need to reach the maturity of  existing security controls for other non-mobile platforms. Moreover, they need to span limits of  components of the mobile computing architecture and to seamlessly interoperate without  introducing any security gaps 355 . Operators of mobile infrastructures and users need to  understand and properly deploy them.   Secure development of mobile apps moves again into the focus356. Application development of  mobile apps needs to mature and follow maturity increases demonstrated in web application  345 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-  techniques-seek-human-interaction.html, accessed November 2014.  346 http://macsecurity.net/view/50/, accessed November 2014.  347 http://www.australiansecuritymagazine.com.au/2014/06/kaspersky-discovers-new-android-ios-mobile-malware/,  accessed November 2014.  348 http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/11/06/china-wirelurker-ios-malware/, accessed November 2014.  349 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21828/hacking/screenlogging-malware-can-log-swipe-gestures-mobile.html,  accessed November 2014.  350 http://www.wired.com/2014/07/hackers-can-control-your-phone-using-a-tool-thats-already-built-into-it/, accessed  November 2014.  351 http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/05/the-mechanics-of-icloud-hack-and-how.html, accessed November 2014.  352 http://www.wired.com/2014/09/eppb-icloud/, accessed November 2014.  353 http://www.slideshare.net/emcacademics/ecommerce-fraud-protecting-data-transactions-and-consumers, accessed  November 2014.  354 http://www.zdnet.com/researchers-use-shopping-cart-to-put-mobile-nfc-payment-theft-on-wheels-7000023584/,  accessed October 2014.  355 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2840355/gigamon-says-it-can-analyze-attacker-ssl-traffic-without-affecting-  performance.html, accessed November 2014.  356 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Guide_Project, accessed November 2014.  http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-techniques-seek-human-interaction.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-techniques-seek-human-interaction.html http://macsecurity.net/view/50/ http://www.australiansecuritymagazine.com.au/2014/06/kaspersky-discovers-new-android-ios-mobile-malware/ http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2014/11/06/china-wirelurker-ios-malware/ http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/21828/hacking/screenlogging-malware-can-log-swipe-gestures-mobile.html http://www.wired.com/2014/07/hackers-can-control-your-phone-using-a-tool-thats-already-built-into-it/ http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/05/the-mechanics-of-icloud-hack-and-how.html http://www.wired.com/2014/09/eppb-icloud/ http://www.slideshare.net/emcacademics/ecommerce-fraud-protecting-data-transactions-and-consumers http://www.zdnet.com/researchers-use-shopping-cart-to-put-mobile-nfc-payment-theft-on-wheels-7000023584/ http://www.computerworld.com/article/2840355/gigamon-says-it-can-analyze-attacker-ssl-traffic-without-affecting-performance.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2840355/gigamon-says-it-can-analyze-attacker-ssl-traffic-without-affecting-performance.html https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Guide_Project  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  65  development 357 . Besides secure app application and architecture practices, reuse of code  libraries, and binary code protection will be two areas that will need to be further developed.  Such advancements will reduce the attack surface for the leakage and identity theft threats.  Finally, secure usage of identification and authentication and access control covering as much  components as possible will increase data protection and data privacy in mobile environments.  6.3 Cloud Computing  Adoption of cloud computing solutions continues to grow. Trends identified in 2014 show that cloud  plays a key role in next generation IT358,359. As indicated within this ETL report, mobile devices, cloud  storage and Bring Your Own Device approaches are be the main components in the IT paradigm shift  currently taking place358. Nonetheless, cloud computing has been massively put under pressure due  to Snowden revelations, in particular regarding data protection issues of stored information360. Both  state-sponsored surveillance and cyber-threat landscape regarding major components of the  emerging next generation IT have impacted technology decisions 361 . As a result, a significant  slowdown in the technology adoption with regard to next generation IT has been assessed. Moreover,  it is estimated that these developments may cost cloud providers significant amounts362. But also  policy has reacted on these developments: European Commission has created a framework to debate  on issue of cloud computing, thus opting for updated strategies and requirements, in particular for  public sector by means of the Digital Agenda363.  Another concern regarding could computing is related to the complexity, flexibility and level of  adoption for businesses. Inherent complexity of cloud computing, together with concerns about data  protection, compliance, continuity 364  and insider threat in particular, are sources of additional  concerns365. In particular, the management of such a massive chunk of infrastructure in a concentrated  manner is a new challenge for users: possibility of human errors, misconfiguration and even insider  threats pose significant risks to organisation366.  Last but not least, just as businesses, cybercriminals have also recognised the advantages of cloud  computing. Cost issues, better camouflage of malicious activities on legitimate sites and performance  issues are key points for this 367 . It should be expected that this trend will continue beyond the  reporting period and cloud providers would need to provide security controls and guide customers to  develop their security strategies in accordingly.

Multi-cloud strategies emerge from the need of agility, control (both technical  and costs), data protection, performance, compliance, etc370. Implementation of multiple cloud  strategies (also referred to as hybrid cloud), may require adaptation of network access to cloud  providers and interoperability. In both cases, security controls of the organisation has to be  optimised, also integrating security measures of the various providers (both cloud and network).   Data breaches and surveillance are a major concern for decision makers in order to launch cloud  based solutions. Complexity, performance and control are further issues to be surfaced. In  remains to be seen how cloud provider and customers are going to master these challenges in  order to address business concerns regarding reduced control over cloud computing, security and  mobility. In particular given the fact that these technologies, may be vulnerable due to potential  weak links in the supply chain371. Emerging security solutions including anonymity in the cloud372  368 http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-  the-evolving-state-of-cloud, accessed November 2014.  369 http://blog.equinix.com/2014/07/multicloud-management-strategies-the-hybrid-cloud-is-a-reality/, accessed  November 2014.  370 http://www.eweek.com/cloud/slideshows/developing-a-multi-cloud-strategy-10-factors-to-consider.html, accessed  November 2014.  371 http://www.cisco.com/web/offer/gist_ty2_asset/Cisco_2014_ASR.pdf, accessed October 2014.  372 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6732964, accessed November 2014.  http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-the-evolving-state-of-cloud http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-the-evolving-state-of-cloud http://blog.equinix.com/2014/07/multicloud-management-strategies-the-hybrid-cloud-is-a-reality/ http://www.eweek.com/cloud/slideshows/developing-a-multi-cloud-strategy-10-factors-to-consider.html http://www.cisco.com/web/offer/gist_ty2_asset/Cisco_2014_ASR.pdf http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6732964  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  67  and uptake of encryption practices373,374 are still subject of discussions and will be of concern to  the community in the middle term. Finally, increased transparency and reduction of complexity  in management of cloud resources will be a matter of concert, together with identity and access  management/governance366.   Collected statistics regarding posture of cloud users regarding awareness of data protection360  issues have shown that: some 50% are demonstrating an increased interest about location of  data storage; ca. 55% have increased diligence regarding cloud activities/projects; some 50%  have lost trust to public cloud services; while over 30% are changing procurement requirements  and conditions with regard to could services.   Unfortunately, for the same reasons as for legitimate users, cloud is an attractive platform for a  variety of cyber-threat agents367,375. It provides a number of advantages that are serving malicious  intent, including ease of site development to accommodate infection vectors, by at the same time  evading IP blocking due to trusted origin (i.e. IPs of major cloud providers). Moreover, the  inherent mobility of storage/applications to different clouds, adds another level of difficulty for  defenders to locate and block malicious content. It is expected that through the use of encryption  and anonymity, additional evasion mechanisms will be developed to abuse the cloud.  6.4 Trust infrastructures  With the term trust infrastructure we refer to systems, components, functions and data that  implement security functions used to establish trust in the communication between systems and  between systems and users. Examples of such functions are encryption, electronic signatures,  challenge/response processes, etc. Trust infrastructure aims at the secure provision of these  functions, the secure operation of involved components and secure storage of secret information.  Proper functioning of trust infrastructures is key for the security in all kinds of electronic transactions,  including the Internet. Consequently, any form of compromise or breach of such functions and data  are a serious incident for digital trust.  In this reporting period we have seen serious incidents related to SSL (both OpenSSL and MS-TLS) a  key component of the internet trust infrastructure376,377,378. Moreover, attempts to abuse tolerant  requirements for purchasing SSL security certificates 379  and compromise the certificate  infrastructure380 have been detected. Besides SSL and certificate infrastructure, voices regarding the  security level PGP have been raised 381 . All this is a warning on the trust level resulting current  encryption, authentication and signing in the internet and e-mail communication.

As such, security of all other areas is highly dependent  on trust infrastructures. Having such a central role in the chain of trust, it is evident that trust  infrastructure will be a premium target for cyber-criminals. Hence, further leakage threats, abuse  of trust between machines and users will be on the agenda of adversaries for the coming period.   While encryption and anonymity seem to be the solution383 for the observed reduction of trust  in the internet communication and services, at least in the reporting period they have been rather  the problem. We have seen an impressive erosion of basic security functions in this year, targeting  both encryption377,378,379 and potentially anonymisation functions384,385.  382 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/, accessed October 2014.  383 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29781/social-networks/facebook-tor-hidden-service.html, accessed November  2014.  384 https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous, accessed November 2014.  385 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html, accessed November 2014.  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/ http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29781/social-networks/facebook-tor-hidden-service.html https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  69   Authentication models and in particular their technical implementations will need to be revisited.  Based on existing good practices (i.e. financial sector386), requirements for increasing the security  level of authentication functions might be considered. The wider adoption of two factor  authentication, as introduced by leading IT-companies387,388 is going to increase trust in existing  authentication schemes. The consideration of non-repudiation schemes should also been taken  into account.   E-Mail encryption will need to be revisited. Existing encryption based on PGP receives a lot of fair  criticism, mainly pointing out the need for modernisation of the used principles and available  implementations389 . Despite or even because of pending adoption of PGP by Google 390  and  Yahoo 391 , some discussion regarding the future potential of this standard after a mass  deployment will serve the intended purpose.   Internet of things and network virtualisation functions will bring big challenges in the  establishment of trust between users and devices and among devices 392 . Risks related to  interconnected identities will be in the focus, as interconnected devices will share data on behalf  of users (i.e. implemented within the environments via chains of possibly interoperating mutually  trusted identities). The attack potential to identities will rise, together with the potential impact  of successful attacks.   Attacks on authentication functions and open source functions will persist. Attacks to  authentication functions hold the second position in OWASP top 10 risks list393. Regarding open  source functions, as a lesson learned from Heartbleed attack, industry has formed the Core  Infrastructure Initiative (CII)394 that aims at taking care of open source code that is essential for  computing (including security and trust functions). The aim of this organisation is to support the  open source developer community with funding, thus achieving higher more security awareness  and reduce the chances of bugs being introduced in the first place.  6.5 Big Data  In ETL 2013, big data has been addressed as an emerging technology, mainly from the business point  of view and its future role as potential valuable asset.

Several approaches and tools  performing data analytics based on massive log and network traffic information have been released  and took up an important role within Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)397. This  development has turned SIEM approaches into powerful tools398.  Notwithstanding the fact that currently the cyber security community views big data as a useful tool  rather than a risk, big data growth is still being considered as a risk factor399, especially given the  upwards trend of data breach threat. After NSA revelations, the cyber-security community has realized  that big data are at risk: one should consider raw data collected in a big style by national security  agencies without establishing a proper transparency in their investigation activities.  Preparatory activities with regard to relevant regulation in the US have focused on big data by  underlying its important role for society, but also stating risks to privacy and self-determination that  are connected to this asset and related technologies400. Similar activities have been in the reporting  period within the European Commission401,402. This is a very positive development, as this may help  governmental/legal action to catch up in this area, being currently behind technological  developments.

Operating such a tool, however, will require significant skills in threat information collection,  building up and maintaining threat intelligence and disseminating this information to relevant  players within the organisation. Hence, the entire-lifecycle of SIEM might be quite expensive,  while requiring adaptation of existing processes. Due to complexity and costs, it is very likely that  smaller companies (i.e. SMEs) will not be in the position to afford such solutions.   It is predicted that big data based SIEM technologies will be part of organisations defence  strategy, growing form 8% currently to 25% in 2016395. Admittedly, current uptake of big data  based security analytics is at an early phases of adoption and so is big data in general400. A few  years will be required to understand technical and organisational exploitation of big data in  general and in SIEM in particular. Current experience of early adopters of big data based SIEM  are very positive, reporting advances in threat intelligence used to operate risk-based security  controls365.   A survey365 about use of big data in SIEM has shown that surveyed participants are concerned  about protection of big data holding sensitive information (69%). 60% of participants were  concerned violating data privacy by mixing data from different geographic areas; and ca 59% see  data loss risks from wide distribution of big data. Moreover, in order to find relevant information  among big amounts of data, top five use cases have been identified404: 1. Successful exploration  of big data to understand it within decision making; 2. Holistic customer view by combining  internal and external data; 3. Creation of security/intelligence context to achieve risk based  protection in real time; 4. Achieve operational efficiency by analysing wide variety of data; and 5.  Augment big data with traditional data warehouse capabilities.   Within discussions with the ENISA ETL Stakeholder Group it has been identified that a challenge  is to master the size of big data in order to timely spot threat patterns and achieve near-time  responses. Another issue of concern regards data discovery: a very large amount of it contains  information about already available intelligence. The challenge is to discover the parts that are  related to new/unknown patterns that can attributed to malicious activities.   Some additional interesting issues assessed within the reporting period with regard to big data  are:  - Smart environments will significantly contribute to production of big data. This kind of data  will have high value, as it contains intimate life logging information of smart home users.  Potential of misuse of this information by companies, adversaries and surveillance activities  is a rather obvious conclusion.  - While currently big data based SIEM use log, alert and incident information, it is expected  that additional data will be included, such as configuration information, audit trails, web  information, dark web information, etc. (an interesting visualisation can be found in404 by  404 http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-  bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=W GW03020USEN.PDF, accessed November 2014.  http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=WGW03020USEN.PDF http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=WGW03020USEN.PDF http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=WGW03020USEN.PDF  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  72  means of a big data iceberg). Similar approaches are available within own developments of  organisations and go currently through initial maturity steps.  6.6 Internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments  Both the proliferation of mobile computing (see section 6.1) and the silent, yet considerable increase  of interconnected things (i.e. Internet of Things)405 pose challenges for cyber security. In particular  interconnected devices from areas such as smart home, smart cities, smart vehicles406, will exchange  information that has high privacy/intimacy relevance. Moreover, functions available and data  exchanged, when abused, may even impact human life 407 , 408 . Given the complexity behind  environments that take advantage of or are controlled by interconnected devices, security, trust and  privacy issues are of major importance and pull the attention of end-users, industry, governments but  also media.  Due to application scenarios implemented via interconnected devices in all relevant areas, the  network of interconnected things is going to be dynamically shaped. That is, things will join and leave  the network, different levels of trust will be maintained and various levels of information  confidentiality need to be supported. The negotiating mode of interaction is a complex issue per se.  By considering the existence of malicious motives in this interaction, it becomes apparent that attack  potential grows and that prevention will be a great challenge. Let alone that security functions  supported are rudimentary, yet immature. As an additional dimension to the technical one, one  should calculate the immense potential that social engineering attacks may have. Information from  private/intimate environments smart environments would turn a phishing message to a powerful  attack that is difficult to defend405,407. Due to the importance of this area for cyber security, in the  reporting period ENISA has performed a dedicated threat assessment by means of a threat landscape  for of smart homes and converged media409.

Denial of Service   Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 9: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   Internet of thinks and smart environments in particular consist of an increased number of  interconnected sensors and devices. The increased number of interlinked functions and activity  logs present and active will be a source of close, granular and intimate data on the activities and  behaviour of inhabitants and visitors. Hence, when approaching or even connecting to such  networks, emitted “data noise” from those devices may provide potential attack surface that can  be misused in a great variety (e.g. phishing410, misuse of trust, manipulation of information405,  denial of service411, etc.). Moreover, due to the fact that smart environments are tightly related  to personal consumption profiles, it is expected that they will be in the focus of  individualized/targeted marketing and sales campaigns412.   The smart home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and  physical space. This will create new yet unknown threat and vulnerability models that are result  of bringing together both the virtual and physical contexts. An example is the existence of assisted  living for ageing population: through the ability to track movements into the home or city  environment, this user group might be vulnerable to physical attacks 413. Let alone attacks to  medical records that are in general in the rise, due to their potential in fraudulent activities414.   The user interaction within smart environments will converge logically415. As regards the device  to manage converged information, this will probably be a mobile device or TV-set. In both cases,  these devices will attract the interest of adversaries. Having already sufficient cyber-threat  capabilities for mobile devices (see also section 6.2), adversaries will be in the position to  successfully attack important control functions of smart environments416. Given the fact that  410 http://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/internet-of-things-cyberattack, accessed November 2014.  411 http://www.mostafafouda.com/Pub/Conf/2010.ICCES%2710.pdf, accessed November 2014.  412 http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2347810/smart-homes-a-new-marketing-paradigm, accessed November 2014.  413 http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126m, accessed November 2014.  414 http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-  2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  415 http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127614-first-ios-in-the-car-integration-to-come-next-week-ferrari-volvo-and-  mercedes, accessed November 2014.  416 http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Hackers+show+auto+industry+trade+secrets/10425446/story.html, accessed  December 2014.  http://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/internet-of-things-cyberattack http://www.mostafafouda.com/Pub/Conf/2010.ICCES%2710.pdf http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2347810/smart-homes-a-new-marketing-paradigm http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126m http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127614-first-ios-in-the-car-integration-to-come-next-week-ferrari-volvo-and-mercedes http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127614-first-ios-in-the-car-integration-to-come-next-week-ferrari-volvo-and-mercedes http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Hackers+show+auto+industry+trade+secrets/10425446/story.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  74  logical convergence of technology will happen via a variety of interfaces, intercepting data traffic  will be yet another attack vector417,418.   Given economic factors in the development and manufacturing of internet of things components,  weak implementation of security controls will be encountered419. Moreover, given the untested  interplay of components of different classes and of different manufacturers, the effectiveness of  existing security controls is uncertain. Certification certifications of devices with regard to the  basis security characteristics - similar to the ones existing in the area of electrical, low voltage  equipment420 - might need to be developed in the middle term. Existing documents regarding  certification of smart environments are either outdated or cover particular segments of the entire  environments (e.g. CENELEC421, IEC422).   Current published ENISA incident statistic from the area of telecommunication, shows that ca.  20% of outages of professionally operated networks are caused by human errors 423  (e.g  configuration mistakes). This is indicative for the role of humans in the configuration and  operation of complex systems. Yet not being as complex as professional networks,  interconnected devices and smart environment will constitute a significant challenge  unexperienced users controlling them. Hence humans will remain the weakest link also within  smart, interconnected environments405.   A further interesting issue within interconnected devices and smart environments is the  possibility of conflicting interests among asset owners of the environment. For example, media  content owners may view occupants’ attempts to access licensed media content through  alternate channels as a threat to their assets, whilst occupants may interpret digital rights  management measures as barriers preventing them from accessing their assets. Different service  providers and technology vendors may be in competition with each other for both bandwidth  and data. Further conflicts may arise in cases of conflicts among owner and occupant: in cases of  disputes, for example, occupants may have an interest in breaching privacy of owner; occupants  may lock access to home appliances after leaving the house. Similar conflicts may arise within  neighbourhoods. In such situations, additional threat agents to smart environments may emerge,  whose motives and capabilities are difficult to foresee.  6.7 Network Virtualisation and Software Defined Networks  Network virtualisation (NV) is a technology based on combination of network hardware with software  into a single virtualized system, i.e. a virtual network. Virtual networks are administered via a single  software and offer network resource virtualisation 424 , 425 . Network virtualisation exists in two  417 http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/hacker-koennen-autos-ueber-funkverbindungen-aus-der-ferne-angreifen-a-  985464.html, accessed November 2014.  418 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22070/hacking/can-hacking-tools.html, accessed November 2014.  419 http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwordsm, accessed  November 2014.  420 http://www.ce-marking.org, accessed November 2014.  421 http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Smart_House/Documents/Annex_Authent.pdf, accessed November 2014.  422 http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf, accessed November 2014.  423 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-  2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed November 2014.  424 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization, accessed November 2014.  425 http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/definition/network-functions-virtualization-NFV, accessed November 2014.  http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/hacker-koennen-autos-ueber-funkverbindungen-aus-der-ferne-angreifen-a-985464.html http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/hacker-koennen-autos-ueber-funkverbindungen-aus-der-ferne-angreifen-a-985464.html http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/22070/hacking/can-hacking-tools.html http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/07/crypto-weakness-in-smart-led-lightbulbs-exposes-wi-fi-passwordsm http://www.ce-marking.org/ http://www.ictsb.org/activities/Smart_House/Documents/Annex_Authent.pdf http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62045-1%7Bed1.0%7Den.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_virtualization http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/definition/network-functions-virtualization-NFV  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  75  variations, one being external virtualisation and the second internal virtualisation. While the former  aims at the creation of virtual networks based on a number of physical networks (LANs), the latter  supports emulating a network system with software. External virtualisation is mainly an administrative  function that allows the creation of virtual networks (VLANs) out of a number of physical networks.  Internal virtualisation is used to optimise efficiency of resources. Software defined networks (SDN)  come to build upon network virtualisation: while network virtualisation created virtual networks,  software defined networks come to perform changes to virtual networks according to user  needs426,427,428.  In a similar fashion to the virtualisation of computing through could, network virtualisation and SDN  are the enablers for the development of a business model called network-as-a-service (NaaS)429.  Hence virtualisation of network and SDN will be put at a similar basis to could computing, where  network configuration and usage will be offered as an on-demand service. Combined with virtualized  computing, NV and SDN will offer a perfect model for cost reduction and elasticity. While some argue  that network virtualisation and SDN will bring advances to network security430, there are concerns  about security issues of such a virtual infrastructure431,432. All in all, one should note that security  analysis (threat, risk assessment) of NV and SDN is still in early phases and standards and products are  at early maturity stages. This is a reason for considering NV and SDN as an emerging security area.  Top (preliminary433) emerging threats to CPS are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Due to the  early stages of action in this area, these threats are rather indicative. More thorough assessments in those areas will  need to be performed.  http://www.networkworld.com/article/2174268/tech-primers/understanding-the-differences-between-software-defined-networking-network-virtualizati.html http://www.networkworld.com/article/2174268/tech-primers/understanding-the-differences-between-software-defined-networking-network-virtualizati.html https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/solution-briefs/sb-sdn-nvf-solution.pdf http://www.storagecraft.com/blog/network-virtualization-security-benefits-risks-best-practices/ http://www.cloudcomputingadmin.com/articles-tutorials/naas/naas-future-networking-cloud-based.html http://www.networkworld.com/article/2606388/virtualization/how-network-virtualization-is-used-as-a-security-tool.html http://www.networkworld.com/article/2606388/virtualization/how-network-virtualization-is-used-as-a-security-tool.html http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/news/2240214438/SDN-security-issues-How-secure-is-the-SDN-stack https://www.sdncentral.com/security-challenges-sdn-software-defined-networks/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  76  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  8.

Data breaches (network management information or network traffic being  breached)    Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 10: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of network virtualisation and SDN  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   NV and SDN are based on centralisation of control of network covering management and data  flow issues. As such, these components are single point of failure. Having the entire intelligence  of the network concentrated at one position, failures may affect the entire network. Hence,  denial of service attacks on a variety of underlying network components may affect the central  control functions (e.g. through coupling over data exchange with network switches). Besides  direct DoS attacks to the central control panel, flooding attacks may have similar failure effects434.   NV and SDN have taken care of security issues. However, the prevailing standard OpenFlow has  not been developed with the “security by design” principle. Moreover, due to the complexity of  the environment and multiplicity of supported devices, vulnerabilities found in network hard- and  software may impact availability and functionality of the entire environment. Given the existing  variety of vulnerabilities/attacks for network hardware435 and software (references taken just as  examples) 436 , 437 , it is evident that careful selection and maintenance of network soft- and  hardware are key for the security of the environment.   NV and SDN technologies are a promise towards quality of service, performance and facilitation  of network management. Yet, both existing standards and released technology are at early stages  of adoption and maturity; they still include a lot of vendor own product philosophy and  specificities. It remains to be seen what the uptake of this technology will be, what are going to  be the prevailing business models and what kind of vulnerabilities, attack vectors and security  issues in general will be surfaced. At the time being, the need for more detailed security  assessments for this technology is rather evident.   Although NV and SDN will bring new exploitation potential for network functions, they are also  going to facilitate implementation of a number of important network security functions430: firstly,  centralisation of control will increase coherency of management activities; virtual firewalling will  allow for a better protection of network and application assets; more flexible packet filtering  techniques will be implementable, for example regarding DDoS attack detection and mitigation;  434 http://www.nil.com/2014/watch-the-presentation-security-and-sdn-a-perfect-fit-or-oil-and-water/, accessed  November 2014.  435 http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article38485.htm, accessed November 2014.  436 http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/advisories/HPNetworkingSecurityAdvisory-OpenSSL-HeartbleedVulnerability.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  437 http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-nat, accessed November  2014.  http://www.nil.com/2014/watch-the-presentation-security-and-sdn-a-perfect-fit-or-oil-and-water/ http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article38485.htm http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/advisories/HPNetworkingSecurityAdvisory-OpenSSL-HeartbleedVulnerability.pdf http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-nat  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  77  IDS and IPS can be configured and operated in a more efficient way. Just as cloud computing  security, NV and SDN security will be part of the services and hence more affordable and  transparent to customers.   Page intentionally left blank  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  78  ETL 2014: Food for Thought:  Lessons Learned and Conclusions  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  79  7 Food for Thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions  7.1 Lessons learned  Lessons learned from another year of ENISA threat landscape are a collection of points regarding both  advances observed and deficiencies assessed. These points constitute highlights and are thought of as  potentially interesting points for individuals/organisations that are engaged in threat analysis/threat  intelligence. These points are divided in two categories:   Lessons from the performance of ETL process within ENISA: These are points regarding our internal  information collection and analysis exercise. This list might contain interesting points for  stakeholders performing threat analysis or consuming threat information; and   Lessons learned from the analysed content: These are points regarding conclusions drawn from  collected and analysed content. This information might be interesting for any stakeholder from  the target group of this report.  Lessons from the ETL process:   The “publicity” of threat information in related media is quite high. Threat landscape reports are  important elements in the cyber-security community. Information on cyber-threats are quickly  taken up by media. The number of publications has significantly increased in the reporting  period. In the future it will be necessary to establish cooperation (consolidate efforts) among  various players in the field to avoid duplication of work and increase quality of assessments438.   Tools and methods to support the collection and analysis process depend on the level of  detail/quality of the threat assessment. Tool landscapes for strategic, tactical and operational  information differ. Currently available tools are oriented towards collection of operational  information. It is important to understand level and structure of threat information and set up  environment, processes and tools accordingly.   As the amount of threat information grows, it is important for the collection process to:  - Find a simple classification scheme for identified resources. This may contain information on  focus/scope, role of information assessor, kind of input and output data, etc.  - Maintain some tools to locate and store this kind of information in an (semi-) automated  manner (i.e. scanning information, storing relevant information in a structured way).   Given the fact that an increasing number of projects/activities cope with cyber threats, the  creation of a taxonomy for cyber-threats would facilitate at least internal communication and  would establish a common denominator throughout all relevant efforts. Such a taxonomy would  be an important point of consolidation of acquired knowledge.   It is very important to understand what the counterparts of threat information are, what user  needs it can serve, and how this information can be disseminated to the various stakeholder  groups. A proper dissemination strategy needs to be developed.   The state of maturity of various concepts and approaches followed can be characterized as  initial. Triggering the dialogue among threat collection organisations is very important as it  438 http://www.societalsecurity.eu/uploads/Articles/2014_Boin%20Ekengren%20Rhinard_Sensemaking_FHS%20Book.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  http://www.societalsecurity.eu/uploads/Articles/2014_Boin%20Ekengren%20Rhinard_Sensemaking_FHS%20Book.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  80  would lead to cross-fertilisation of ideas and will lead to a common understanding with regard to  emerging issues for threat analysis.   It would be important to elaborate on methods to classify importance of threats based on some  prioritisation criteria. These should be based on impact, sector, detections, reported incidents,  etc. Information collection could then be facilitated according to the importance criteria at  scope. Similar exercises for the identification of threat trends might also be of use in building  threat intelligence.  Lessons from the analysed content:   Sloppiness with cyber-security continues to be number one reason for breaches (over 50%). This  is a finding for the third year in sequence and should be an alarming signal for all stakeholders  involved in cyber-security.   Threat analyses and assessments performed by various vendors/organisation should state more  clearly the scope of the assessment. This would facilitate the understanding of the assessed  information and would facilitate usage of the material.   Threat analysis and achieved results are rather complex. Ways to transfer this complex  knowledge to less skilled stakeholders is key to a better uptake of produced results. In other  words, cyber-security community could mitigate “sloppiness” by playing their role in the  education knowledge transfer chain.   Information collection from the dark net could be interesting. Knowing that some stakeholders  are performing this kind of information collection, it would be useful for the entire stakeholder  community to communicate information found more directly.   It is difficult to compile collected information to cover the entire causal chain of:  Threat Agent->Attack vector->Cyber threat->Asset->Vulnerability->Damage. This information is  very useful for end-users of threat information/threat intelligence.   Good practices on agile SIEM methods will be very important for “consumers” of threat  intelligence (i.e. use of big data). Moreover, it is important to understand the role cyber-threat  and the resulting cyber-risks within a security management process439. It might be interesting to  elaborate on such issues both at the level of vendors and standardisation bodies.   Both quality and quantity of collected information has significantly increased in the reporting  period. This is a very positive development that has as a result better threat assessment and the  availability of more detailed material to be used by end-users. The increase in quantity,  however, has to be effectively surfaces during information collection, e.g. by the adoption of  more systematic information collection practices (see also related point in process lessons  above).   ETL self-test: In the reporting period we were in the position to “test” own and other predictions  made in 2013. The comparison has been made within ETL 20137. We have found out that the  majority of predictions – both by means of emerging trends and collusions - for 2013 were  realistic.  439 http://cryptome.org/2014/10/csan-4.pdf, accessed November 2014.  http://cryptome.org/2014/10/csan-4.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  81  7.2 Conclusions  The threat landscape in 2014 has undergone significant, partially impressive developments.  Conclusions drawn in this year’s ETL are based on these developments and, towards a more clear  classification of their context, are divided into two categories, namely technical and policy/business  related (sequence of the points below is not prioritised).  Policy/business related conclusions:   Europe, in its role as a world leader in data privacy, should continue with setting up the  standards in this area. Besides contributing to increasing the currently diminishing trust in digital  life, this is a strong opportunity: it can turn it to a competitive advantage for many industry  sectors related to the provision of digital services. And can have a worldwide impact on the  cyber-threat landscape.   Cyber-security and resilience of Cyber Physical Systems is another opportunity for Europe.  Bridging engineered systems and cyber-space will be a significant field of growth. Europe should  take advantage of strong engineering capabilities to gain a foothold in this area. Combining  advances in data protection, resilience and cyber-security, this area can be a significant source of  innovation and competitiveness.   Current revelations regarding the activities of national security agencies and their role in  affecting the cyber-threat landscape have increased fragmentation risks for the internet (i.e.  Balkanisation of the internet440). A potential materialisation of this risk could threw current state  of internet and cyber-security many years back. Further, such a risk would greatly impact cyber-  threat landscape.   Surveillance is affecting cyber-threat landscape, at least from end-user perspective and has a  negative impact to the trust in the internet441. Governments are challenged to follow up on  technological developments with regulations establishing a balance between the technically  possible and legally transparent. In the middle term, governments will need to come up with  improvements of transparency rules for their surveillance measures405,442.   The unknown number of breaches and security incidents is a major concern of security experts  and in particular of law enforcement. Breach notification needs to be put on a wider basis via  corresponding regulations in various areas/sectors, eventually covering end-user impact. This  will help assessing the currently large grey numbers assumed.   New, sophisticated attacks make the development of new defences necessary. Development of  new detection methods and new security controls is an area of innovation. Examples of such  innovative controls are proactive detection of websites before they turn malicious443, or  identification of anonymous writers from their writing style444. Advanced attack methods is  440 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-revelations-balkanisation-internet, accessed November 2014.  441 http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30115679, accessed November 2014.  442 http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/world/un-urges-protection-of-privacy-in-digital-era.html?_r=3, accessed  December 2014.  443 https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-soska.pdf, accessed November 2014.  444 https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sa499/papers/oakland2014-underground.pdf, accessed November 2014.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-revelations-balkanisation-internet http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30115679 http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/world/un-urges-protection-of-privacy-in-digital-era.html?_r=3 https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-soska.pdf https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sa499/papers/oakland2014-underground.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  82  another area of innovation445. Academia and businesses should invest in such attack methods  and controls to increase innovation and competitiveness in the relevant market.  Technical conclusions:   Sophistication of cyber threats continues increasing. We see currently defence practices from  the past losing efficiency (i.e. classical signature based Anti-Virus). It is an undoubtable fact that  advanced attack methods currently used within cyber-espionage attacks are the best “food” for  cyber-criminal’s learning curve. Methods used by high capability threat actors today are adopted  by cyber-criminals tomorrow. This increases challenges in development of defence practices.   Partial take down of malicious infrastructure (i.e. botnets) has created a discussion about their  purposefulness. Do we have a similar case here as in medicine, where increased use of  antibiotics might create more resistant viral strains whose protection is not yet possible with  available means?   Trust infrastructures are under massive stress. Both open and “closed” source implementations  of basic security functions have been challenged. Shortly before finishing this report, even TOR  has allegedly been “de-anonymised”. What comes next? For sure that the entire cyber-  community and in particular cyber-security experts should worry about the robustness of the  trust infrastructure.   A definition of purpose of data usage seems to be the solution for data breaches not only for the  cloud, but throughout all processing/storage platforms. This would set the basis for a proper  data protection and management, while facilitating resolution of security issues of big data.   Threat modelling, threat intelligence over big data and setting up a novel, yet flexible security  architecture are emerging practices in coping with the dynamics of the threat landscape. It  remains to be seen how these novel approaches are going to reach smaller organisations with  reduced knowledge and resources. Are standardisation bodies going to follow these trends? And  if yes, when?   Big data, social media, mobile computing and interconnected devices, when not properly  used/protected will constitute the perfect knowledge-base for cyber-criminals, allowing for  perfectly crafted, difficult to detect phishing and other targeted attacks.  445 http://www.wired.com/2014/11/airhopper-hack/, accessed November 2014.  http://www.wired.com/2014/11/airhopper-hack/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  83  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  TP -A  E-1 4-001  -EN -N  ENISA Headquarters  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

We were able to see impressive changes in top threats, increased  complexity of attacks, successful internationally coordinated operations of law enforcement and  security vendors, but also successful attacks on vital security functions of the internet.  Many of the changes in the top threats can be attributed to successful law enforcement operations  and mobilisation of the cyber-security community:   The take down of GameOver Zeus botnet has almost immediately stopped infection campaigns  and Command and Control communication with infected machines.   Last year’s arrest of the developers of Blackhole has shown its effect in 2014 when use of the  exploit kit has been massively reduced.   NTP-based reflection within DDoS attacks are declining as a result of a reduction of infected  servers. This in turn was due to awareness raising efforts within the security community.   SQL injection, one of the main tools used to compromise web sites, is on the decline due to a  broader understanding of the issue in the web development community.   Taking off-line Silk Road 2 and another 400 hidden services in the dark net has created a shock in  TOR community, both at the attackers and TOR users ends.  But there is a dark side of the threat landscape of 2014:   SSL and TLS, the core security protocols of the internet have been under massive stress, after a  number of incidents have unveiled significant flaws in their implementation .   2014 can be called the year of data breach. The massive data breaches that have been identified  demonstrate how effectively cyber threat agents abuse security weaknesses of businesses and  governments.   A vulnerability found in the BASH shell may have a long term impact on a large number of  components using older versions, often implemented as embedded software.   Privacy violations, revealed through media reports on surveillance practices have weakened the  trust of users in the internet and e-services in general.   Increased sophistication and advances in targeted campaigns have demonstrated new qualities  of attacks, thus increasing efficiency and evasion through security defences.  In the ETL 2014, details of these developments are consolidated by means of top cyber threats and  emerging threat trends in various technological and application areas. References to over 400 relevant  sources on threats will help decision makers, security experts and interested individuals to navigate  through the threat landscape.  Lessons learned and conclusions may be useful for all stakeholders involved in the reduction of  exposure to cyber threats. Opportunities and issues in the areas of policy/business and technology  have been identified to strengthen collectively coordinated actions towards this goal. In the next year,  ENISA will try to capitalize on these conclusions by bringing together expertise to improve information  collection capabilities and to apply lessons learned to various areas of cyber security.  The figure below summarizes the top 15 assessed current cyber-threats and threat trends for  emerging technology areas. More details on the threats, emerging technology areas, threat agents  and attack methods can be found in this report.

The ETL 2014 is a continuation of the reports produced in 2012 and 2013: it follows similar approaches  for the collection, collation and analysis of publicly available information to produce the cyber-threat  assessment. The report contains a description of the methodology followed, together with some  details on use-cases of cyber-threat intelligence. The main contribution of the ETL 2014 lies in the  identification of top cyber threats within the reporting period. Together with the emerging threat  landscape, it makes up the main contribution towards identification of cyber-threats.  As in previous years, the ETL 2014 is based on publicly available material, the availability of which has  grown substantially in the reporting period. Starting from ca. 150 references in 2012, we identified ca.  250 in 2013. In 2014, we identified over 400 sources containing information on cyber threats, whereas  in all years we assume that our information collection detects ca. 60-70% of available material. This  makes the ETL 2014 a unique comprehensive collection of information regarding cyber-security  threats.  ENISA has performed information collection by means of internet searches, by using the information  provided by the CERT-EU2 and by using the web platform of Welund Horizon Ltd through free access  granted to ENISA in the reporting period.  As is explained later in this report, the ETL 2014 has been expanded to include information on attack  vectors, that is schematic representations on the course of attacks, indicating targeted assets and  exploited weaknesses/vulnerabilities. Another new component in the ETL 2014 is the elaboration of  use-cases of threat intelligence: by showing the various activities of threat analysis, we demonstrate  how the information produced can be used within various phases of security management.  Another novelty of the ETL 2014 process is the involvement of stakeholders in the identification of  issues as well as knowledge transfer and information sharing. In 2014, ENISA has established an ETL  stakeholder group consisting of 13 experts from CERTs, vendors, Member States and users. This group  has provided advice on various issues of threat analysis, including stakeholder requirements and state- of-the art developments in the area of threat intelligence.  Lessons learned and conclusions summarize the highlights of this year’s threat assessment exercise  and provide concluding remarks that are relevant for policy makers, businesses and cyber-security  experts.  Policy Context  The policy context of the ETL 2014 with regard to relevant EU-regulations is identical to that of 2013  ETL. The Cyber Security Strategy of the EU3 stresses the importance of threat analysis and emerging  trends in cyber security. The ENISA Threat Landscape is an activity contributing towards the  achievement of objectives formulated in this strategy, in particular by contributing to the  identification of emerging trends in cyber-threats and understanding the evolution of cyber-crime (see  2.4 regarding proposed role of ENISA).  2 http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html, accessed November 2014.  3 http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-  and-opportunity-cyber-security, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  http://cert.europa.eu/cert/filteredition/en/CERT-LatestNews.html http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security http://www.ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/eu-cybersecurity-plan-protect-open-internet-and-online-freedom-and-opportunity-cyber-security  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  2  Moreover, the new ENISA regulation4 mentions the need to analyse current and emerging risks (and  their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member States and, as appropriate, with  statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In particular, under Art. 3, Tasks, d), iii),  the new ENISA regulations states that ENISA should “enable effective responses to current and  emerging network and information security risks and threats”.  The ENISA Threat Landscape aims to make  a significant contribution to the implementation of the EU  Cyber Security Strategy by streamlining and consolidating available information on cyber-threats and  their evolution.  Target audience  The target audience of the ETL 2014 remains very similar to that of previous versions of this report. It  mainly targets cyber-security specialists and individuals interested in the development of cyber- threats. More precisely, these are cyber-security specialists working at the strategic, tactical and  operational levels of security management. Threat and risk assessments may be the primary concerns  of such individuals. They are busy with assessing the “external environment” and “internal  environments”5 in the framework of threat and risk assessments. In this year’s ETL, we provide a more  extensive view on the use-cases of a threat analysis process (see section 2.2). Besides the high level  discussions provided within this document, security experts will be in a position to identify detailed  issues on the assessed threats by means of numerous references to collected sources. This might make  the ETL a useful tool for long term use as it comprises a sort of contextualized “directory” to cyber- threat sources.  As the ETL contains high level information about cyber threats and emerging technology areas, it is a  good “entry point” to the subject of threat intelligence for non-experts. This target group will be  interested in the descriptions provided and the consolidated presentations of cyber threats and threat  trends. We have experiences, for example, that consolidated material of ETL 2013 has been used  within German schoolbooks.  The ETL 2014 will be of interest for policy makers: current threats and threat trends may be an  important input to policy actions in the area of cyber-security, national cyber-security preparedness  and possible coordination and cooperation initiatives among threat collection organisations and other  competent bodies.  Experience from previous ETL reports shows that media is an important target group of the ETL. The  generic cyber-threat descriptions provided can be easily understood by non-security experts. Such  descriptions help media to understand the dependencies and developments in that area. An area that  enjoys particular media attention, the latest after revelations about state sponsored surveillance  activities and related privacy risks for citizens world-wide.  Last but not least, by providing tactical and strategic guidance, The ETL 2014 could be used to support  executive management decisions and orientation of asset protection policies. This makes the ETL 2014  potentially useful for ISMS activities.  Structure of this document  The structure of the ETL 2014 is as follows:  4 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF, accessed 28 Nov 2013.  5 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-  process/crm-strategy/scope-framework, accessed 30 Oct 2013.  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:165:0041:0058:EN:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/current-risk/risk-management-inventory/rm-process/rm-process/crm-strategy/scope-framework  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  3  Chapter 2 “Purpose, Scope and Method” provides some information regarding the threat analysis  process as it is being performed within the ETL 2014. Moreover, it refers to the information flow  between threat analysis and relevant stakeholders, while it gives some information on use-cases for  threat intelligence and used definitions.  Chapter 3 “ETL 2014: Current Threat Landscape” is the heart of the ETL 2014 as it contains top 15  cyber-threats assessed in 2014. It provides detailed information on the threat with references to all  relevant resources found, trends assessed and the role of each threat within the kill-chain.  Chapter 4 “Threat Agents” is an overview of threat agents with short profiles and references to  developments that have been observed for every threat agent group in the reporting period.  Chapter 5 “Attack Vectors” contains some new content that has been adopted in this year’s ETL. It  provides information on typical attack scenarios, steps and deployed cyber-threats and is supposed to  complement the presented material by giving some initial information on the “How” of a cyber-attack.  Chapter 6 “The Emerging Threat Landscape” indicates assessed technology areas that will impact the  threat landscapes in the middle-term. Ongoing developments in those areas will influence the ways  attackers will try to achieve their aims, but also the way defences are going to be implemented.  Chapter 7 “Food for thought: Lessons Learned and Conclusions” is a summary of interesting issues  encountered within the threat analysis and provides the conclusions of this year’s ETL.  As was the case in ETL 2013, the present document has been developed in a modular way. The  chapters are as independent as possible to each other, thus allowing for an isolation of the addressed  issues so that readers can concentrate on the topic of interest. This approach also allows for  independent updates of the content, when deemed necessary (i.e. in cases of publication of additional  threat assessment summaries within a year).  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  4  ETL 2013: Purpose, Scope and Method  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  5  2 Purpose, Scope and Method  Worldwide, the cyber threat landscape – and threat analysis in general – has been assigned a central  role in practical Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM6). This is the case both in the relevant  vendor market and within end-user organisations. A plethora of related services and good practices  are available that are based on threat intelligence. They consist mainly of collection, aggregation and  correlation of data. It has been recognised that information on cyber-threats should be THE parameter  to actively adapt security protection practices towards a more agile management of security controls.  Following these trends, in this year’s ETL we have optimized threat collection and analysis practices,  whilst at the same time better reflecting on the practical applicability of threat information in  Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and SIEM.  The purpose and positioning of the ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) has been documented in ENISA’s  2013 deliverable (ETL 20137) and is still valid. Yet, based on advancements observed in the reporting  period, a more detailed view on the purpose and potential use of the delivered information is provided  in this chapter. This is done by paying attention to stakeholder requirements with regard to threat  information/threat intelligence. These requirements have been assessed within the ENISA Threat  Landscape Stakeholder Group (ETL SG), established in 2014 in order to advise ENISA on relevant  matters.  In the rest of this chapter we discuss several important aspects of threat landscape such as:   Quality and content of threat information;   End-user needs with regard to threat information;   Typical practical use case for threat information and,   Content of this year’s ETL and terminology.  2.1 Quality of Content of Threat Information  Numerous organisations create, assess and analyse information regarding cyber threats. Typically,  such information may have varying levels of detail, structure and abstraction level. The differences  are motivated by the purpose of the delivered information and the input data used to create it. In  particular, the following types of threat information can be found:  Strategic (S): this is usually the highest level information about threats. Such information is used within  forecasts of the threat landscape and emerging technological trends in order to prepare organisations  by means of assessments, prospective measures and security investments, as well as adaptation of  existing cyber security strategies. These are typical ISMS activities and stakeholders interested in this  level of information are mostly CISOs and CIOs.  Tactical (T): tactical threat information consists of condensed information describing threats and their  components, such as threat agents, threat trends, emerging trends for various technological areas,  risks to various assets, risk mitigation practices, etc. This information is important for stakeholders  engaged in long-term maintenance of security infrastructures, mostly within security management  activities. Hence, tactical threat information is also relevant to ISMS.  Operational (O): this is the most basic information about existing threats. It covers detailed technical  information about threats, incidents, vulnerabilities, etc., and usually derived from detections at the  6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management, accessed November 2014.  7 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed 30 Sept 2014.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  6  level of technical artefacts. It includes identification of cyber threats (e.g.. MD5 hash or Indicators of  Compromise (IOC) 8 ), its elements (vulnerability abuses, threat agents, attack vectors) and  corresponding countermeasures (technical controls for the elimination/reduction of threat or threat  exposure). This information is crucial for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of infrastructure  on the technical level and comprises the main input to SIEM. This area is strongly supported by many  standards and tools available on the market (both open source like MISP9 or commercial like Threat  Connect®10) which facilitate automatic (at least on some level) gathering and sharing information.  The diagram known as Pyramid of Pain 11  illustrates how to measure the trouble generated to  adversaries by using threat intelligence. Taking this approach as a basis, one can argue that while  operational information is related to the bottom layers of the pyramid, tactical information refers  rather to the top levels. Whereas both tactical and strategic information constitute the transition from  threat intelligence and SIEM to ISMS.  ETL contains mainly strategic and tactical information about cyber threats. Information collection,  aggregation and analysis, however, is often based on all types of information found in the public  domain. Operational information is used mainly as trigger to recognise/understand the whereabouts  of cyber threats which are then consolidated by means of tactical and strategic issues. The main focus  of ETL is on tactical and strategic guidance, this makes it  more relevant to asset protection policies  and practices.  2.2 End-user Needs with regard to Threat Information  It is important to analyse, understand and address end-user needs in the provision of cyber threat  information. Given the novelty of (dynamic) threat analysis processes in SIEM and ISMS, the  identification of possible use-cases that might suit end-user needs is at an early stage.  In the reporting period, ENISA has initiated a dialogue with threat information stakeholders by means  of the ETL SG. Within this group, discussions have taken place in an attempt to understand the needs  end-users have with regard to threat information. Moreover, the act of balancing threat information  provision capabilities and end-user requirements/expectations has also been elaborated.  Being at an initial state of maturity of threat intelligence, matching user expectations/needs and threat  information provision models seems to be a challenge ahead. In this chapter, an initial assessment of  user requirements on threat information is presented. Additional information on how to balance  “supply and demand” in the case of threat information/threat intelligence is currently in preparation.  End-users apply the threat assessment process mainly as a support process to SIEM and ISMS  implemented according to adaptations that meet individual organisational requirements. Usually, the  ISMS includes three components:   Assessment (threats, vulnerabilities, impact, risks);   Planning (security controls and procedures) and   Operation (security controls and security policy enforcement).  In each of these component, and according to the capability level of the organisation, end-users may  have different needs in relation to the threat assessment process. Some of them may only use threat  8 http://www.openioc.org/, accessed December 2014.  9 https://github.com/MISP/MISP, accessed December 2014.  10 http://www.threatconnect.com/, accessed December 2014.  11 http://detect-respond.blogspot.gr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html, accessed November 2014.  http://www.openioc.org/ https://github.com/MISP/MISP http://www.threatconnect.com/ http://detect-respond.blogspot.gr/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  7  information in selected phases or even outsource threat intelligence to external organisations. At this  point, cyber threat information provision models come into the scope.  Some users will need only to assess the level of threats to perform risk assessments for developing  better business processes or to provide precise pricing of their products. In this case, it is sufficient for  the threat information to be adopted from external sources. Subsequently this information is put in  scope of the internal assessment exercise.  Similarly, not all phases of the threat assessment process are used within the operational activities of  a SIEM. To operate security controls there is a need for collecting, collating and analysing data about  threats that concern specific assets and threat exposure assumptions. Moreover, for SIEM activities  not only data about the newest threats are needed; historical data are also useful in order to draw  conclusions about the efficiency of implemented security controls and revisions of the security  architecture.  Knowing the current context of received threat information (e.g. strategic, tactical or operational  guidance), users can formulate the overall organisation policies concerning cybersecurity, plan  appropriate security controls and, finally, manage investment decisions. In those three cases the most  important issue for organisations is to possess and understand the context of cyber threat  information. Depending on the origin of threat information and the internal capability level, this might  be a challenge.  The interaction between the threat assessment process and user needs is presented in Figure 1 below:  green areas correspond to the threat assessment process phases, blue areas correspond to described  user needs. S, T and O abbreviations refer to threat information levels (Strategic/Tactical/Operational)  and orange text indicates which stakeholder group is associated with which user need.  Figure 1: Threat assessment process – relation with user needs and ISMS activities  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  8  Given the presented user requirements it becomes clear that ETL is delivering information for:   Management decisions regarding expected evolution of cyber threats and in particular their  relevance to emerging technology areas;   Security policy recommendations, in particular through cyber threats, their potential impact on  assets and the extrapolation of threats to emerging technology areas;   Supporting information for risk assessments to be performed for valuable assets of the  organisation, and   Planning of security controls that will be in the position to reduce vulnerabilities that can be  potentially abused by top cyber threats.  As a collateral product of ETL, but also of cyber threat information from other sources, one should  mention the usefulness of this material in assessing the effectiveness of existing controls by utilising  provided kill-chain12 information. This approach is a typical practical example based on cyber threat  information and is discussed in the forthcoming section (see section 2.3).  2.3 Typical Practical Use Case for Threat Information  In the present section we present a practical example for the use of threat information within the  operational activities of an organisation. This example has been developed after feedback received  from threat information users using threat information within both SIEM and ISMS. It is considered as  a good practice in an agile management of security controls.  It is assumed that threat information consists of:   Threat description including targeted assets;   Threat details providing information on the “whereabouts” of an incident;   Threat agents involved and   Indicative information on attack vector (i.e. based on kill-chain).  Obviously, the more comprehensive the above information is, the more easily it can be integrated into  the SIEM and ISMS activities. Nonetheless, structure and content of cyber threat information has to  correspond to the internal capability and maturity level. In other words, threat information has to be  structured in a way that can be efficiently consumed by internal security management process. This  might be a challenging task to achieve, especially when internal capabilities are relatively low (e.g.  SMEs willing to consume threat intelligence).  Figure 2 presents an indicative workflow of this use case: starting from a selection of the threat agent  group to be addressed in the defence, it continues with the selection of relevant cyber threats and  goes ahead up to the performance of corrective actions of existing protection. In this indicative  workflow the importance of the kill-chain becomes apparent through its role within many steps.  It is worth mentioning that for the implementation of such a workflow some additional information  will be necessary (i.e. asset inventories, vulnerability information, configuration data for existing  security controls, etc.). Such information is one basic tool of ISMS within organisations.  Finally, as it is indicated in Figure 2, cyber threat information may be a useful tool for auditing existing  security controls. This will allow using similar criteria, both for the implementation and efficiency  check of available controls. Hence, this would contribute towards using a common terminology for  12 http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/information-technology/cyber-security/cyber-kill-chain.html,  accessed November 2014.  http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/information-technology/cyber-security/cyber-kill-chain.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  9  implementing and controlling actions that are inherent to ISMS. This is a significant advantage for  organisations, as differences in knowledge level between cyber security and other disciplines is often  seen as a weakening factor for the life-cycle of security controls. For this reason, the use of a common  threat taxonomy and common threat intelligence may be very beneficial.  The use cases around threat assessment/threat intelligence have been investigated in the reporting  period quite thoroughly. In this context, we have made use of an authoritative resource in this area:  “How to Collect, Refine, Utilize and Create Threat Intelligence”, of Gartner Group13. The material  published provides a comprehensive view on collection and analysis of threat information towards  the creation of threat intelligence and comprises a very useful reading for information security  professionals.  Figure 2: Indicative workflow of security management actions based on threat intelligence  2.4 Content of this year’s ETL and Terminology  This version of the ETL covers all elements found in previous versions. In particular it provides:   Information on top threats assessed in the reporting period (2014);   Trends and issues of particular interest related to these threats;   Kill-chain information per threat;   Threat agents;   Emerging threats in important technology areas;  13 http://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2014/05/15/my-threat-intelligence-and-threat-assessment-research-papers-  publish/, accessed October 2014.  http://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2014/05/15/my-threat-intelligence-and-threat-assessment-research-papers-publish/ http://blogs.gartner.com/anton-chuvakin/2014/05/15/my-threat-intelligence-and-threat-assessment-research-papers-publish/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  10  The details about structure and rationale of this information are the same as in last year’s ETL 7 (see  Chapter 2).  Following the developments in the area of cyber threat analysis and cyber threat landscape in general,  this year’s ETL has been expanded with information on attack vectors. This addition contributes  towards a more clear separation between cyber threats and common tactical methods used to deploy  an attack by combining various cyber threats.  The information on attack vectors added to the ETL 2014 is complementary to kill-chains: a kill chain  provides generic guidance about which phases of an attack the threat can be deployed; while an attack  vector provides information about the assets that can be targeted and the type of threat used per  asset. In practice, within an attack vector several threats might be combined. E.g. in a Targeted Attack  the cyber threats phishing, malicious URL and malware are being combined, targeting assets like  human, web-browser, operating system, etc.  Finally, a new element added to this year’s report is the explicit mentioning of authoritative resources.  In each relevant section, a reference has been made to the authoritative sources found for a particular  topic. This should facilitate information finding regarding the details of the particular topic. It should  be noted that the term of authoritative source is used in order to indicate an information source that  provides significant quantity of explanations/information in one topic. Hence, this term is not  indicative for qualitative differences to other sources. Thus, reports that are referenced in the  document but are not enlisted within authoritative resources are by no means of lower quality.  2.5 Used definitions  As in many complex areas, in cyber threat assessment wording matters. In this section we briefly  present the terms used. Both within and outside this report, definitions facilitate the understanding  of used terms; further, and equally importantly, consistent use of terms contributes towards better,  quicker and more efficient knowledge transfer on cyber threats. This may enhance the response  capabilities to cyber threats.  The definitions used are identical to the ones of ETL 2013. In order to visualize the relationships among  all elements of risks, we use a figure taken from ISO 15408:2005 (see Figure 3). This figure has a level  of granularity that is sufficient to illustrate most of the elements of risk mentioned in this section. It  should be noted that “owner” refers to the owner of the asset; moreover, the issue of attack vector is  displayed in this figure.

In more detailed terms, we consider  risk as being composed of the following elements:  Asset (Vulnerabilities, Controls), Threat (Threat Agent Profile, Likelihood) and Impact.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  12  ETL 2014: Current Threat Landscape  NEW YORK LONDON ISTANBUL NEW DELHI  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  13  3 Top Threats: The Current Threat Landscape  In the Current Threat Landscape 2014, related material published in the period between November  2013 and November 2014 has been compiled, thus covering approximately one year of cyber threat  developments.  The amount of material published in the reporting period has increased significantly, both in terms of  quantity and quality. From the material examined, we note that issued reports and published  information have almost doubled since ETL 201314. This is a strong indication of the important role  assigned to threat information (i.e. threat intelligence) in the cyber-security community. While being  a main component of SIEM, threat information plays and important role in ISMS because it can serve  as an important instrument to implement more agile ISMS processes based on detections and  reported incidents. This is a significant shift in security management, that has been traditionally based  on one-off assessments that had taken into account a time restricted snapshot of the threat  environment; and were often outdated shortly after they have been released.  Advances in the quality of published material has also been assessed. All organisations engaged in  threat analysis have yet developed significant experience in the coverage of all facets of threat analysis  and threat intelligence. This is indicated by the fact that the terminology used has converged, threat  agents come into the focus and details of attack vectors started appearing in the reports. Although  there is space for improvement, information available has reached a high maturity and span of  coverage that was not available in the past couple of years.  As was the case in previous versions of the ETL, the threat prioritisation has been performed mainly  by means of a combination of frequency of appearance/reference and number of incidents (i.e.  efficiency of the threat). In some cases, for example, threats that were decreasing ranked higher than  last year. This means that a higher efficiency of attacks based on this threat has been reported (e.g.  botnets).  Knowing that this approach might not be free from ambiguity, it has nevertheless been selected as it  delivers “good-enough” classification of threat importance and of threat trends. For example, it makes  clear that worms/trojans, together with web-based attacks are detected the most, while detection of  the insider threat is significantly lower. This approach is one among others, e.g. classification according  to encountered incidents, according to breached assets, according to assessed impact etc. Discussions  performed with members of the ENISA Stakeholder Group, led to the conclusion that it might be  worthwhile examining various classification schemes and allowing the users of the threat landscape  to select the one that best suits to their needs. This can be achieved by taking into account  documented impact, relevant sectors, geographical spread, etc. In the presentation of the threats  below, more frequent threats are mentioned first.  Having said that, it is worth mentioning that our aim was to present a priority of threats. However,  users of this material who wish to use it as input to their assessments, will need to consider cyber- threats according to the scope of their assessment. This might require prioritisation according to  relevant assets, vulnerabilities, impact level, etc. In such cases, the presented prioritisation might need  to be changed to fulfil the needs of the scoping exercise.  14 Due to the vast amount of published threat information and the limited resources available, it is very likely  that several publications on the topic of cyber threats escaped our attention. Hence, if readers miss some known  publications to them, these might be items that have not been spotted during information collection. Despite  potentially undetected reports, we believe that the collected material is a sufficient sample to identify threat  dynamics and trends.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  14  The following threat descriptions consist of i) a short text explaining the whereabouts of the threat, ii)  a list of findings, iii) the trend observed in the reporting period, iv) other related threats that are used  in combination with a threat, v) a list of authoritative resources and vi) the position of the threat in  the attack workflow15.  This chapter is concluded by a comparison between the current threat landscapes of the ETL 2013 and  the ETL 2014. This will help readers to easily understand the changes of the current threat landscape  in this time period.  3.1 Malicious Code: Worms/Trojans  In this reporting period, malware (worms/Trojans and Potentially Unwanted Programs – PUPs ) tops  the list of cyber threats, with worms and Trojans being the most common type of newly created  malware16 ,36. It is interesting that in the reporting period, an observed increase of adware was  observed, due to software delivered in form of bundled free software, the so called Potentially  Unwanted Programs (PUPs)17. Besides topping the cyber threats in 2014, there are some additional  interesting developments regarding malware. These developments concern: use of custom encryption  for communication with C&C servers167, file-less malware18,19 , increase of spyware20,21, provision of  multi-platform capabilities22, use of anonymity network TOR23 and obfuscation /evasion techniques24.  These advancements, together with the vast amount of malware variants per day (ca. 350.000),  decreases the efficiency of existing signature based antivirus tools44.  In this reporting period we have concluded that:   Worms are over 19% of malware. Interestingly the Conficker worm – a six year old malware -  is still the most commonly detected malware in domain computers (i.e. business  environments). In PCs it is the number one detection (also referred to as DOWNADUP) 25,36.   Due to its dynamics, complexity, sophistication and stealthiness, over 50% of malware stays  undetected by antivirus products44. This indicated the need for multi-layered security  15 Due to the scope of each cyber threat in ETL 2014, but also due the consolidation that is part of our analysis process, the  kill chains of the threats is of generic nature. In other words, it might not correspond to the phases included in a particular  detail threat assumed within this cyber-threat category. Rather it has been selected as a superset of phases found in all  threats of this kind.  16 http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/malware-still-generated-rate-160000-new-samples-day-q2- 2014/, accessed October 2014.  17 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-turning-the-tables-on-cyber- attacks.pdf, accessed October 2014.  18 https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/poweliks-the-persistent-malware-without-a-file.html, accessed November  2014.  19 http://www.faronics.com/news/blog/reboot-to-restore-new-fileless%E2%80%8B-malware-making-the-rounds-66/,  accessed October 2014.  20 http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FinFisher-Co-machen-harmlose-Katzenvideos-zur-Waffe-fuer-Cyber- Attacken-2293549.html?wt_mc=rss.ho.beitrag.atom, accessed November 2014.  21 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/06/spyware-exports-licence-new-eu-rules-military-applications,  accessed November 2014.  22 http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-security-stories/mask-sophisticated-multi-platform-malware-espionage- operation/, accessed October 2014.  23 http://threatpost.com/shedding-new-light-on-tor-based-malware/104651, accessed October 2014.  24 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-  techniques-seek-human-interaction.html, accessed October 2014.  25 http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/B/72B5DE91-04F4-42F4-A587-  9D08C55E0734/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_16_English.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/malware-still-generated-rate-160000-new-samples-day-q2-2014/ http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/press-releases/malware-still-generated-rate-160000-new-samples-day-q2-2014/ http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-turning-the-tables-on-cyber-attacks.pdf http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-turning-the-tables-on-cyber-attacks.pdf https://blog.gdatasoftware.com/blog/article/poweliks-the-persistent-malware-without-a-file.html http://www.faronics.com/news/blog/reboot-to-restore-new-fileless%E2%80%8B-malware-making-the-rounds-66/ http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FinFisher-Co-machen-harmlose-Katzenvideos-zur-Waffe-fuer-Cyber-Attacken-2293549.html?wt_mc=rss.ho.beitrag.atom http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/FinFisher-Co-machen-harmlose-Katzenvideos-zur-Waffe-fuer-Cyber-Attacken-2293549.html?wt_mc=rss.ho.beitrag.atom http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/06/spyware-exports-licence-new-eu-rules-military-applications http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-security-stories/mask-sophisticated-multi-platform-malware-espionage-operation/ http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/top-security-stories/mask-sophisticated-multi-platform-malware-espionage-operation/ http://threatpost.com/shedding-new-light-on-tor-based-malware/104651 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-techniques-seek-human-interaction.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/06/turing-test-in-reverse-new-sandbox-evasion-techniques-seek-human-interaction.html http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/B/72B5DE91-04F4-42F4-A587-9D08C55E0734/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_16_English.pdf http://download.microsoft.com/download/7/2/B/72B5DE91-04F4-42F4-A587-9D08C55E0734/Microsoft_Security_Intelligence_Report_Volume_16_English.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  15  solutions that perform malware detection at multiple levels of the infrastructure (i.e. network,  application level, etc.) 26,27,44.   In this reporting period, ca. 30% of malware used custom encryption to hide communication  of stolen data28. It is interesting, that for this purpose SSL is not used due to the overhead  related to certificates28. Besides securing communication, encryption has been also used in  order to store modules of malware as encrypted data blobs that evade forensic functions29.   The increase in numbers of malware variants is a result of the availability of malware toolkits  that can be found in the underground malware market 30 . Such tools offer obfuscation  functions that allow for automated scanning of existing signatures and creation of new ones  to evade antivirus detections103.   Open environments are the “paradise” of malware infections44. Due to access through a  variety of users (obviously maintaining poor end-point security) academic, education and  university environments were responsible for over 40% of malware detections. This  demonstrates the difficulty in imposing security controls in such open environments.   Sophistication of malware has been impressively demonstrated by means of existing banking  Trojans. Such Trojans (e.g. the Italian and Turkish jobs31), have demonstrated a great deal of  criminal energy and knowledge behind the attack: for example, as all sensitive components  have been removed right after the investigation by law enforcement agencies had started40.  Moreover, banking Trojans have been reused/reconfigured in order to steal user  information 32 . Once installed, this malware can be re-configured to attack any kind of  information, further to banking data. The efficiency in infection rates is illustrated by the fact  that one in every 500 PCs is infected with this banking malware33. This corresponds to an  increase by a factor of four within the reporting period and by a factor of 14,5 since mid-  201240.   Malware defence tactics need to be revised. While most of the tactics are mainly defending  from “commodity malware”34 new, more advanced approaches to malware defence need to  be developed. They should not be based solely on detection at the end-points, but rather  involving countermeasures at the level of network architecture. Another interesting measure  for spyware control is its inclusion in the control list on dual use items 35  (together with  surveillance equipment).  26 http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303417104579542140235850578, accessed November 2014.  27 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/antivirus-is-dead-long-live-antivirus/, accessed November 2014.  28 http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-threat-report.aspx, accessed October 2014.  29 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/regin-analysis.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  30 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v19_221284438.en-us.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  31 http://bgr.com/2014/06/25/luuuk-trojan-online-banking-malware/, accessed October 2014.  32 http://www.darkreading.com/operations/identity-and-access-management/new-citadel-attack-targets-password-  managers/d/d-id/1317642, accessed December 2014.  33 http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2370710/ibm-warns-over-proliferating-use-of-banking-trojans-in-enterprise-  attacks), accessed October 2014.  34 http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/grem/malwared-study-network-host-based-defenses-prevent-  malware-accomplishing-go_3428, accessed November 2014.  35 http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1166, accessed November 2014.  http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303417104579542140235850578 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/05/antivirus-is-dead-long-live-antivirus/ http://www.websense.com/content/websense-2014-threat-report.aspx http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/regin-analysis.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/other_resources/b-istr_appendices_v19_221284438.en-us.pdf http://bgr.com/2014/06/25/luuuk-trojan-online-banking-malware/ http://www.darkreading.com/operations/identity-and-access-management/new-citadel-attack-targets-password-managers/d/d-id/1317642 http://www.darkreading.com/operations/identity-and-access-management/new-citadel-attack-targets-password-managers/d/d-id/1317642 http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2370710/ibm-warns-over-proliferating-use-of-banking-trojans-in-enterprise-attacks http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2370710/ibm-warns-over-proliferating-use-of-banking-trojans-in-enterprise-attacks http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/grem/malwared-study-network-host-based-defenses-prevent-malware-accomplishing-go_3428 http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/papers/grem/malwared-study-network-host-based-defenses-prevent-malware-accomplishing-go_3428 http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1166  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  16  Observed current trend for this threat: increasing  Related threats: Web application/Injection attacks, Exploit Kits, Botnets, Information leakage, Identity  theft, Data breaches, Ransomware/Rogueware/Scareware, Phishing, Cyber espionage.

In 2013, this kind of attack has been referred to as “drive- by-downloads”. As was the case with other threats, in the reporting period a shift has been assessed  regarding this threat. This was due to widening of the scope of redirections (e.g.. disseminated via  phishing messages), deployment of additional techniques in mobile devices/mobile apps and a strong  decline in the use of the exploit kit Blackhole (after the arrest of its developers37). Nonetheless,  available vulnerabilities in web browsers are still most often exploited in order to achieve a redirection  to malicious sites (i.e. malicious URLs). The primary surface for exploitation are vulnerabilities of the  Java programming environment and browser exploits36,38,39.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Web-based attacks are facilitated by the fact that malicious URLs are easy to implement. In  this reporting period some 145 million unique URLs have been recognized as malicious  (responsible for 39% of web attacks). The malicious URL is by far the first malicious object  detected (72,9%)40.   It seems that short-lived domains further facilitate the creation of malicious URLs. According  to reports found41, ca. 0,4% of short life domains are malicious and have a life-cycle of ca 48  hours. These are ca. 2 million URLs every second day that are used for drive-by-  communication, botnets and malware hosting. This reduces the usefulness of blacklists and  increases maintenance effort. Therefore, in addition to blacklists, end-users need also to  introduce intrusion detection combined with end-device security (i.e. Anti-Virus and Web  Antimalware).   Web-based attacks take the first position in the threat landscape in North America and  Europe. In other continents, they are positioned in the lower middle field of top threats,  following malware36. Assuming a higher spread of online services in North America and  36 http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H1_2014.pdf, accessed October 2014.  37 http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070360/12-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested-in-russia-along-with-blackhole-  creator.html, accessed October 2014.  38 http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html, accessed October 2014.  39 http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/web-loving-malware-doubles-in-2013/, accessed October 2014.  40 https://securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_Q2_IT_Threat_evolution_EN.pdf, accessed October 2014.  41 http://www.csoonline.com/article/2599806/data-protection/spotting-web-threats-in-the-confusion-of-short-lived-  hostnames.html, accessed October 2014.  http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H1_2014.pdf http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070360/12-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested-in-russia-along-with-blackhole-creator.html http://www.pcworld.com/article/2070360/12-suspected-cybercriminals-arrested-in-russia-along-with-blackhole-creator.html http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/web-loving-malware-doubles-in-2013/ https://securelist.com/files/2014/08/KL_Q2_IT_Threat_evolution_EN.pdf http://www.csoonline.com/article/2599806/data-protection/spotting-web-threats-in-the-confusion-of-short-lived-hostnames.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2599806/data-protection/spotting-web-threats-in-the-confusion-of-short-lived-hostnames.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  17  Europe, it seems that web browsers are the main targets. Country statistics might be seen as  a validation of this assumption: 88% of malicious web resources are located in Europe and  North America36.   Although Java exploits have declined, Java is still by far the most exploited web software by  this threat. Ca. 90 percent of web exploits are Java related. Among the reasons for these rates  is the fact that a large amount of web sites (over 70%) use Java versions that are unsupported  (e.g. Java 6)42.   While malicious URLs is the most widely detected malicious object, they are responsible for  ca. 39% of detected infections. Malware infections scored higher40: several hundreds of  millions of infections took place via viruses/worms/Trojans. This led us to consider web attacks  as the second threat in the row in the ETL 2014.

In the area of web application attacks, some interesting  developments are worth noticing: firstly, a slight reduction of vulnerable applications has been  identified43. This is due to the fact that application developers have understood issues with SQL  injection and have managed to reduce the attack surface. Moreover, app stores seem to do a good  job in testing apps on malicious activities. Despite more efficient coding practices, in the reporting  period web application vulnerabilities have increased slightly.  Yet, despite proportionally less SQLi incidents, a large amount of web applications are still vulnerable  (over 90%43). Top web application threats are XSS, information leakage, authentication and access  control, insecure object references, SQLi44,45,46. Interestingly, in recent surveys, the majority of CISOs  (51%) are concerned about risks emanating from application vulnerabilities 47 , while they see  application threat exposure increasing.  42 http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html, accessed October 2014.  43 http://www.cenzic.com/downloads/Cenzic_Vulnerability_Report_2014.pdf, accessed October 2014.  44 http://www.nttcomsecurity.com/en/services/managed-security-services/threatintelligence/, accessed October 2014.  45 http://info.whitehatsec.com/rs/whitehatsecurity/images/statsreport2014-20140410.pdf, accessed October 2014.  46 http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed5.pdf, accessed December 2014.  47 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CISO_Survey_2013:_Threats_and_risks, accessed October 2014.  http://www.cisco.com/web/offers/lp/2014-annual-security-report/index.html http://www.cenzic.com/downloads/Cenzic_Vulnerability_Report_2014.pdf http://www.nttcomsecurity.com/en/services/managed-security-services/threatintelligence/ http://info.whitehatsec.com/rs/whitehatsecurity/images/statsreport2014-20140410.pdf http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed5.pdf https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CISO_Survey_2013:_Threats_and_risks  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  18  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   A reduction of web application attack surfaces has been identified: Areas where flaws were  understood by developers are: SQLi, Clickjacking and Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)48.   Besides injection attacks on web applications, mobile apps are exposed to additional threats.  This is due to an inherent shift of architectural principles from web applications to mobile  applications: this allows an attacker to deploy traditional web application threats in new  unconventional ways49. As a result, reverse engineering or modifications the app’s binary  code 50  are possible. Moreover, in the reporting period an injection method known as  Fragment Injection has been detected51.   Web application attacks are the second threat in the area of cloud computing surfaced by  cloud hosting providers75.   Web application/Injection attacks are expected to develop in the coming years. This is mainly  due to possible attacks to mobile devices, in combination with new web technologies, i.e.  HTML5. Cross Device Scripting (XDS) is such an attack, which is assessed by experts to become  a very serious threat in the future52.   Java is still by far the most exploited web software. Ca. 90 percent of web exploits are Java  related. Among the reasons for these rates is the fact that a large amount of web sites (over  70%) use Java versions that are unsupported (e.g. Java 6)53.

Activities like this have led to a reduction of PC based botnets. On the other hand,  attackers have changed strategies and moved away from botnet-driven PC infections42. In particular,  they seem to work on building up web server based botnets. The advantage of this approach lies in  the superior performance of web server machines: one web server zombie performs better than  hundreds of PCs and is far easier to administrate73. Other forms of botnets that emerged in the  reporting period include hardware based botnets abusing internet of things devices56. Speculations  about the existence of cloud based botnets do also exist, following a demonstration of feasibility from  the scientific community57.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   All in all, botnet activity has been a very serious cyber-threat: it accounted for 34% of attacks  and has thus ranked at 1st position of attack statistics44. However, due to successful law  enforcement takedowns, the number of botnets has dropped in the reporting period (number  of infected computers went down form ca. 3.5 million to ca. 2.3 million55). However, newer  forms of botnet infections have shown up, which will lead to an increase of infected devices.  As in other areas of malware, infected mobile devices will significantly contribute to the  increase of botnet nodes58.   Botnet takedowns are quite controversial59;60;61. Firstly it is a matter of fact that through  incorporated resilience mechanisms, total takedown of a botnet is not feasible55. While  disruption of a botnet may give hard times to cybercriminals, the fact that the botnet still  exists will give them the opportunity to build it up again, by potentially advancing structure  and functions36. This might be at least a risk equal to the existence of the disrupted botnet, as  experts argue. It has been reported, that during the takedown operation of ZeroAccess botnet  its operators fixed a weakness in the protocol to disrupt the ongoing takedown campaign55.   Other forms of botnets seem to be in place consisting of smaller devices that are networked  such as routers62, sensors and Internet of Things devices63. The creation and operation of such  botnets can be performed by means of an available toolkit that supports a variety of devices64.   Sophistication and stealthiness of botnets improved in this reporting period. The use of short  life domains (ca. 2 million with a life shorter than 48 hours) are being used for various  54 https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/european-cybercrime-center-ec3-first-year-report, accessed October 2014.  55 http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp, accessed October 2014.  56 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28642/cyber-crime/spike-botnet-runs-ddos.html, accessed November 2014.  57 http://www.wired.com/2014/07/how-hackers-hid-a-money-mining-botnet-in-amazons-cloud/, accessed October 2014.  58 http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2322028/24-000-android-devices-are-hit-by-xxxxapk-mobile-botnet,  accessed October 2014.  59 https://www.damballa.com/microsoft-dcu-strike-three-now-what-2/, accessed November 2014.  60 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215443/RSA-2014-Microsoft-and-partners-defend-botnet-disruption,  accessed October 2014.  61 http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-15-14VixieTestimony.pdf, accessed November 2014.  62 http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/04/more-than-300000-wireless-routers-hijacked-by-criminals-in-global-  attack/, accessed October 2014.  63 http://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-threat-landscape-report-2014.html, accessed October 2014.  64 http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-  botnet.html, accessed October 2014.  https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/european-cybercrime-center-ec3-first-year-report http://www.symantec.com/security_response/publications/threatreport.jsp http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/28642/cyber-crime/spike-botnet-runs-ddos.html http://www.wired.com/2014/07/how-hackers-hid-a-money-mining-botnet-in-amazons-cloud/ http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2322028/24-000-android-devices-are-hit-by-xxxxapk-mobile-botnet https://www.damballa.com/microsoft-dcu-strike-three-now-what-2/ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240215443/RSA-2014-Microsoft-and-partners-defend-botnet-disruption http://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/07-15-14VixieTestimony.pdf http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/04/more-than-300000-wireless-routers-hijacked-by-criminals-in-global-attack/ http://www.welivesecurity.com/2014/03/04/more-than-300000-wireless-routers-hijacked-by-criminals-in-global-attack/ http://www.incapsula.com/blog/ddos-threat-landscape-report-2014.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-botnet.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687653/data-protection/new-toolkit-seeks-routers-internet-of-things-for-ddos-botnet.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  20  malicious activities, including botnet communication41.

As with other  threats, DDoS has evolved in many ways. Firstly, bandwidth has continued its growing trend: in 2014  (Q1-Q2) the average bandwidth of attacks is ca. 70% higher than in 2013, whereas a peak of ca. 240%  higher has been observed63, 66,67. There are various reasons for this development. Firstly, reflection  attacks have been more efficient in that they take advantage of multiple protocols (NTP, SNMP, DNS),  with SNMP reflection demonstrating a comeback 67 . They bear the advantage that they can be  performed without any involvement of botnets. Secondly, the use of server-based botnets (often  hosted on performant web/cloud based servers) are more difficult to detect can be stealthy until their  activation68. This is a shift away from PC-based botnets that significantly increases performance and  C2 management67. Finally, one should mention the increased complexity of DDoS attacks: by attacking  at the infrastructure and transport layer (i.e. TLS) (layers 3 and 4) and application layer (layer 7), a  change of attack vectors in the course of single attack campaigns make their detection difficult69.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   DDoS attacks are evolving by gaining in sophistication, stealthiness and unpredictability.  Volumetric, asymmetric, computational, and vulnerability-based attacks are now in the  arsenal of threat agents70. Moreover, attack bandwidth continues growing (peak 325 Gbps  this year), while time windows of attacks become smaller (i.e. reduction of their duration).  65 http://www.tomsguide.com/us/java-botnet-mac-linux-pc,news-18260.html, accessed October 2014.  66 http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-continued-rise-of-  ddos-attacks.pdf, accessed November 2014.  67 http://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-dos-and-ddos-attack-reports.html, accessed October 2014.  68 http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/ddos-mit-ntp-grosse-attacke-mit-gefaelschten-statusabfragen-a-953079.html,  accessed October 2014.  69 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/analyst-report-idc-analyst-connection-ddos-prevention-time-for-w-  1112, accessed October 2014.  70 https://f5.com/solutions/enterprise/reference-architectures/ddos-protection, accessed October 2014.  http://www.tomsguide.com/us/java-botnet-mac-linux-pc,news-18260.html http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-continued-rise-of-ddos-attacks.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/the-continued-rise-of-ddos-attacks.pdf http://www.prolexic.com/knowledge-center-dos-and-ddos-attack-reports.html http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/ddos-mit-ntp-grosse-attacke-mit-gefaelschten-statusabfragen-a-953079.html http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/analyst-report-idc-analyst-connection-ddos-prevention-time-for-w-1112 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/whitepapers/analyst-report-idc-analyst-connection-ddos-prevention-time-for-w-1112 https://f5.com/solutions/enterprise/reference-architectures/ddos-protection  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  21   Most DDoS attacks have been launched in combination with another attack, thus used as  “smokescreening” to distract defenders from the collateral attacks happening in parallel71,72.  In particular, the main objectives of collateral attacks assessed are: Virus and Malware  installation/activation (49%), data theft (25,53%), loss of intellectual property (19,15%) and  financial theft (10,64%)71.   Volumetric attacks will continue to be the main attack type in the future. Efficient reflection  attacks and performant server-based botnets ease the deployment of such attacks69,73. The  trend of SSDP reflection growth should be observed carefully and measures to reduce this  exposure should be implemented74.   The trend of declining application attacks is continued in 2014. Nevertheless, they have picked  up during the 2nd quarter. It is worth mentioning that application layer attacks are a strong  tool as they may create significant impact and such attacks are difficult to detect and defend  against. Along with reconnaissance attacks, brute force attacks and vulnerability scans these  attacks may open new avenues of misuse of web applications through adversaries75.   In the reporting period, DDoS attacks to SSL have been detected. These are difficult to detect  without decrypting and analysing SSL traffic69, 76 . This sort of attack continues to grow.  Although SSL attacks increase computational load77, together with weaknesses regarding SSL78  they provide a considerable attack surface for this technology.   After big increases at the beginning of 2014, NTP reflection attacks are on the decline as a  result of awareness raised within the security community that led to reduction of servers to  be abused (reduction of servers responding to monlist requests)79,80.

The  impressive drop of spam compared with volumes of 2010-2011 is related to take downs of large spam  bots and successful spam blocking practices25. However, spam is still a serious cyber threat166: ca. 75%  of messages are unwanted. Phishing comprises only ca. 4% of the entire spam volume25. From  available statistics and spam volumes, it is assumed that quite some spam bots might exist in  geographic areas where Window XP is still operated81. Another characteristic of spam are unexpected  waves that come and go. In March 2014, spam numbers have been detected that are the highest of  the last two and a half years81. Just as for phishing, spammers piggyback on international events that  obtain media attention82 in order to lure their victims. Speed of spread is one important element for  spams: spam messages based on breaking news sent immediately after an event, thus making  recipients believe that the message is authentic (admittedly an overlapping method with spear  phishing, see section 3.6). Finally, it is worth mentioning that spam is rather well understood as an e- mail threat. In the reporting period, however, we have seen increased spam disseminated over  channels that are non-typical for this threat, such as Social media spam83, mobile apps, SMS, etc84.  This “mutation” of spam opens new opportunities for attackers to increase the efficiency of their  campaigns and achieve better infection rates.  In this reporting period we assessed that:   Top themes for spam worldwide are: Bank Deposit/Payment Notifications, Online Product  Purchase, Attached Photo, Shipping Notices, Online Dating, Taxes, Facebook, Gift Card or  Voucher, PayPal42.   Although rather stable, image spam is an important tool of adversaries. As being typical for  spam, however, some voluminous image spam activities have been detected in the period  between December 2013 and January 2014. It is argued that images are an interesting content  for spammers, as most spam filters are text based. Thus, spam images might evade spam-  detection capabilities81.   In the reporting period spam has been assessed as a serious mobile threat85 ,86. Through  parallel campaigns started both in social media and mobile applications, spammers try to  81 http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03050USEN#loaded,  accessed October 2014.  82 http://securelist.com/blog/58260/the-world-cup-spammers-set-their-sights-on-goal/, accessed October 2014.  83 http://nexgate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Nexgate-2013-State-of-Social-Media-Spam-Research-Report.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  84 https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/67851/spam-and-phishing-in-the-q3-of-2014/, accessed  December 2014.  85 http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/news/whatsapp-scam/, accessed October 2014.  86 http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/software/3331146/new-whatsapp-charging-hoax-surfaces/, accessed October 2014.  http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03050USEN#loaded http://securelist.com/blog/58260/the-world-cup-spammers-set-their-sights-on-goal/ http://nexgate.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Nexgate-2013-State-of-Social-Media-Spam-Research-Report.pdf https://securelist.com/analysis/quarterly-spam-reports/67851/spam-and-phishing-in-the-q3-of-2014/ http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/news/whatsapp-scam/ http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/software/3331146/new-whatsapp-charging-hoax-surfaces/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  23  create user confidence about the trustworthiness of their messages. Through convolution of  messages through various channels, it may become difficult for users to detect malicious  purpose of messages.   In social media we have seen significant spam increase rates83. It has been assessed that  during first half of 2013 social spam volume has increased by 355% (one every 200 messages),  with Facebook and YouTube leading the list of spam distribution social platforms (one every  100 messages). It is impressive that the number of spam messages increases faster than that  of comments in social media83.   With the proliferation of mobile devices, text messages (SMS) are also misused as a spam  channel. Spam text messages often aim at infecting mobile devices with malware (i.e. via  malicious URLs) or just as a reconnaissance mechanism to identify valid telephone numbers  (eventually connected to IDs in cloud services of providers, such as Apple-Cloud IDs)87.

Attackers often combine spoofed e-mails and counterfeited web sites to lure users to malicious sites  with the very objective of infecting end-user devices. The second component of phishing is social  engineering. Both components gain in efficiency from availability of breached data in the underground  market89,92. The ultimate malicious aim is to steal/intercept user names and passwords and financial  credentials 90 . In addition to these advancements, it is remarkable that phishing volumes in the  reporting period have been quite high106 (Q2 2014 has been the second highest number since Q2  2012). The premium target of phishing activities are payment services, financial and retail services and  crypto-currencies. Malicious URLs found in phishing messages demonstrate an increase of distribution  87 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-  underground-market-in-china.pdf, accessed October 2014.  88 http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-phishing-technique-outfoxes-site-owners-operation-  huyao/, accessed November 2014.  89 http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/epsilon-breach-raises-specter-of-spear-phishing/, accessed October 2014.  90 http://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q2_2014.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-underground-market-in-china.pdf http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-the-mobile-cybercriminal-underground-market-in-china.pdf http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-phishing-technique-outfoxes-site-owners-operation-huyao/ http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-phishing-technique-outfoxes-site-owners-operation-huyao/ http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/04/epsilon-breach-raises-specter-of-spear-phishing/ http://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q2_2014.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  24  of PUPs (adware, spyware) 91 . Targeted phishing campaigns combining personal identifiable  information (PII) is known as spear phishing92.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Some interesting data regarding phishing are: Europe is the region with the lowest infection  rates due to phishing messages. US is the number one country hosting phishing-based Trojans.  Supposedly, this is due to the fact that the biggest part of the .com domain is hosted in the  US90.   The proliferation of new technologies - usually bearing vulnerabilities and weak security  controls - may lead to information theft/leakage. When misused within a spear phishing  message, attacks can become extremely efficient and very difficult to defend93,94. Defending  this threat will be a significant challenge, as it is obvious that when possessing information  from the user’s intimate environment, it will be very easy to fool them. Smart Cities, smart  vehicles will constitute another big potential of phishing abuse95. In the reporting period ENISA  has produced a detailed threat landscape and good practice guide for smart homes409, that  further elaborates on these issues.   In order to understand the importance of phishing as cyber-threat, one needs to have a look  at the rankings of seriousness of cyber-attacks: in some reports, phishing is in the 3rd position  behind web based attacks and DDoS96. This fact demonstrates the importance of this threat  for adversaries.   It is common, that attackers may craft spear phishing messages by collecting publicly available  information on victims. Social networking sites are the main source of information collection.  This usually takes place during initial phases of targeted attacks, i.e. external reconnaissance97.   Social networking is also an important target for phishing. According to phishing statistics,  Social Networking sites are the third target of phishing behind payment and financial  systems98.   Defence of phishing/spear phishing is based mainly on appropriate end-user behaviour and  awareness99. This defence is difficult to achieve, as following phishing trends, enrolment of  end-user and awareness raising might be time-consuming and costly. Some information found  in the reporting period provides a deeper insight into the topic100.

Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Phishing  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 10: Position of Phishing in attack workflow  3.8 Exploit Kits  Exploit kits are a major tool of threat agents. They are automated tools, mainly detecting  vulnerabilities at user end-devices and then downloading and managing malicious content  accordingly101. The area of exploit kits has undergone significant developments in the reporting period,  being thus maybe the best example of threat landscape dynamics. Around the end of reporting period  of ETL 2013, the developer of Blackhole, of one of the prevailing exploit kits was arrested102. Since  then, we have been in the position to observe a realignment of the exploit kit “market”. Within 2014,  Blackhole has almost disappeared from the landscape (currently estimated ca 3% of exploit kit market,  while previously covering ca. 44%103). Cyber-criminals have almost immediately adapted to breaking  news and have changed to other exploit kits104. Though not yet reaching the same level of usage, new  exploit kits have come to fill the void left by Blackhole. In addition, in the reporting period we have  seen cyber-criminals increasing the sophistication of exploit kits. Examples are: checked vulnerabilities  in the victim’s systems that are considerably newer, while it has become possible to infect hosts by  injecting malware directly into existing processes105, instead of downloading the payload by means of  files. It is expected that exploit kit usage will continue to be a main threat leading to infections on the  Web. Despite a contemporary decrease, the potential to see increased usage of exploit kits in the  future is quite big106.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   Like almost all cyber threats, exploit kits become more complex/sophisticated. In the  reporting period we have seen exploit kits infecting targets with file-less malware, using  TOR107 communication between installed malware and C&C. Publication of exploit kit source  code allows more malware authors to create more innovative, new attack patterns103.   It has been assessed, that organisations deploying vulnerability management show  significantly lower infection rates from exploit kits than those without. Yet, vulnerability  management based on manual processes (i.e. excel lists) seems to be weaker than more  mature solutions based on formal methods.  101 http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf, accessed October  2014.  102 http://threatpost.com/blackhole-exploit-kit-author-arrested-in-russia/102537, accessed October 2014.  103 http://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-security-threat-report-2014.pdf, accessed October  2014.  104 http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  105 http://www.securityweek.com/malware-injected-directly-processes-angler-exploit-kit-attack, accessed October 2014.  106 http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-vulnerabilities-under-attack.pdf,  accessed December 2014.  107 http://www.isssource.com/new-exploit-kit-using-tor/, accessed October 2014.  http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf http://threatpost.com/blackhole-exploit-kit-author-arrested-in-russia/102537 http://www.sophos.com/en-us/medialibrary/PDFs/other/sophos-security-threat-report-2014.pdf http://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030743/Threat_Report_H2_2013.pdf http://www.securityweek.com/malware-injected-directly-processes-angler-exploit-kit-attack http://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/reports/rpt-vulnerabilities-under-attack.pdf http://www.isssource.com/new-exploit-kit-using-tor/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  26   The average age of vulnerabilities used within exploit kits has been reduced significantly.  While some years ago the average age of exploit kit vulnerabilities were at about two years,  recent tools contain many actual vulnerabilities of one year average age. This is considered as  another indication of increased sophistication of these malicious tools44. Other indications of  increase sophistication are found in the Angler Exploit Kit that integrates Microsoft Silverlight  vulnerabilities and uses gzip and Pack200, a compression method specially optimized for JAR  archives104. Further indications for the creativeness of adversaries are redirects that have led  Yahoo users to an exploit kit that exploited Java vulnerabilities and had installed malware  including ZeuS, Andromeda and Dorkbot/Ngrbot28. Another innovation are DNS hijacks that  redirected users to exploit kits55.   The new order in the area of exploit kits, especially after the arrest of Blackhole developer, is  reflected in the available exploit kit statistics103, according to which their spread is: Neutrino  24%, Unknown kit 21%, Redkit 19%, SweetOrange 11%, Styx 10%, Glazunov/Sibhost 5%,  Nuclear 4% , Blackhole/Cool 3%, Other 3%, while Angler exploit kit seems to gain  momentum104.   As security researchers argue, the possibility of the source code of Blackhole being published  does exist. It is being argued, that publication of source code helps malicious actors mask their  trails from investigators and detection55. This is due to improvements that may be  implemented in existing malicious code. This was already the case with BlackPOS108.

But not only personal data are subject to this threat: valuable  information, mostly with financial impact is considered to be prime target of cyber-criminals, e.g..  Bitcoins114,115. Data breaches are the result of successful cyber-attacks, materialised cyber threats, or  erroneous unintentional user activities, all leading to disclosure of confidential information. Due to  their impact but also long term consequences, data breaches are among the most thoroughly  managed and investigated cyber incidents. This is due to the fact that relevant national and  international regulations force operators of IT systems - especially in the area of Critical Infrastructure  – to report data breaches116,117,118. It is expected that more and more sectors will be obliged to join  data breach reporting schemes in the near future.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   According to extensive data breach reports, the causes of data breaches are: Weak passwords,  Vulnerable networks and application, Malware, Phishing, Incorrect user authentication,  Insider threat, Tampering, Database errors119,120. This motivates the identified need for two  factor authentication121. An observed deviation of data breach statistics/causes can be found  in various reports 122 , 123 , 124 . It should be clear that data breach reports depend on the  context/subject area in scope. Readers would need to understand the particular context and  decide on the level of concern for their organisation.   Breached information is an important tool for adversaries. This information is being utilized in  a variety of cyber-attacks with intentions ranging from fraud to targeted attacks based on  personal information and is available over underground markets125. This leads to a continuous  abuse of this information, long after the occurrence of the breach. Hence, making the  aftermath of a data breach is an important task for evaluating its impact and reduce long term  costs from potential customer regress claims.   Breached data are subject to monetisation through adversaries101. As a consequence, lost or  stolen information will be misused over a longer time frame than the time needed to  process/manage the incident. Additional costs should be calculated for assaults on businesses  as the data is being offered in underground markets17.  113 http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-4chan-shock-naked-picture-4395155, accessed October 2014.  114 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/bitcoin-exchange-mtgox-offline-amid-rumours-of-theft,  accessed October 2014.  115 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-investment-firm-collapses-due-alleged-hacking-management-disappears-1470779,  accessed October 2014.  116 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-  for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport, accessed December 2014.  117 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058, accessed December 2014.  118 http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-  laws.aspx, accessed December 2014.  119 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/, accessed October 2014.  120 http://www.datasurer.com/8-common-reasons-of-data-breach/, accessed November 2014.  121 http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476642/data-security/financial-firms-not-offering-two-factor-  authentication.html, accessed November 2014.  122 http://www.privacyrisksadvisors.com/news/beazley-announces-findings-from-analysis-of-1-500-data-breaches/,  accessed October 2014.  123 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014, accessed October 2014.  124 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-  2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2014.  125 http://www.csoonline.com/article/2691735/malware-cybercrime/what-to-do-in-the-aftermath-of-the-jpmorgan-  breach.html, accessed October 2014.  http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/celebrity-4chan-shock-naked-picture-4395155 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/25/bitcoin-exchange-mtgox-offline-amid-rumours-of-theft http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bitcoin-investment-firm-collapses-due-alleged-hacking-management-disappears-1470779 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/proposal-for-one-security-framework-for-articles-4-and-13a/at_download/fullReport http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058 http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/security-breach-notification-laws.aspx http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/ http://www.datasurer.com/8-common-reasons-of-data-breach/ http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476642/data-security/financial-firms-not-offering-two-factor-authentication.html http://www.computerworld.com/article/2476642/data-security/financial-firms-not-offering-two-factor-authentication.html http://www.privacyrisksadvisors.com/news/beazley-announces-findings-from-analysis-of-1-500-data-breaches/ http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.csoonline.com/article/2691735/malware-cybercrime/what-to-do-in-the-aftermath-of-the-jpmorgan-breach.html http://www.csoonline.com/article/2691735/malware-cybercrime/what-to-do-in-the-aftermath-of-the-jpmorgan-breach.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  28   Still relatively large unspecified/unknown number of data breach incidents are hindering  cybersecurity specialists and law enforcement in understanding the whereabouts of  successful attacks126. It will be necessary that additional data breach reporting schemes will  enter into force127.   The security preparedness of businesses for new technologies are still in early maturity  phases. Existing security mechanisms and processes are struggling to adapt to new  technological developments such as cloud and mobile, especially with regard to data  ownership in off-premises environments. Given the inevitable trend that data breaches will  happen in cloud and mobile, the availability and maturity of multilayered security controls  should be increased128.   A study regarding information loss has indicated that over 50% of data breaches is attributed  to “sloppiness” of end-users with regard to security controls/procedures129.   Recent US data breach statistics show that most breaches have been reported in the area of  medical/healthcare (ca. 42%)130. Businesses score second with 32% of reported incidents. Yet,  data breaches in businesses have the lion’s share as regards the amount of records stolen (ca.  82%). It is interesting to observe the interest of cyber-criminals in medical/health information.  This is a strong indication that this sort of information will be premium target, in particular  with the proliferation of assisted living and e-health systems within smart environments (see  also section 6.6 on internet of things).

In the reporting period, we have  seen device theft or loss to be the 3rd most important reason leading to data breaches131, following  hacking (1st position) and accidental exposure (2nd position). By summarizing all available reports122,123,  processed, one can argue that theft/loss is between second and third cause for data breaches. This  looks reasonable, if one takes into account that one in seven devices gets lost132. Taking into account  advances in hardware tampering techniques133,134, code analysis135 and bypassing security controls, it  is evident that this threat plays an important role for cyber-adversaries, including targeted attacks.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   More than 3 million smart phones were stolen in the US last year alone. Taking into account  that 34% of device owners do not use any security controls to protect information and that  around 50% are using their devices for business purposes136, this is the best demonstration of  the potential efficiency of this threat.   Inevitably, physical damage and theft is highly likely to happen in areas with social, political or  military crises. In the reporting period we have seen few physical damage events with  significant impact in crisis areas137. In such cases, besides availability issues, additional risks  emerge from unencrypted storage devices.   Physical damage may have non-human causes138 such as force majeure, extreme weather and  physical phenomena. The later has been identified a significant cause of outages in the  telecommunications sector124.   Assessments indicate that loss of devices and documents is more often reported than theft.  Interestingly, most assets have been stolen more frequently from corporate environments  than various other locations (homes, cars, transportation, etc.). This might clarify the three  most popular vectors reported for theft, namely: disabling existing protection controls,  bypassing existing protection controls and privilege abuse119. All these vectors are related  mainly to corporate locations.   Statistics on device theft/loss indicate that at the first position are mobile user devices (i.e.  smart phones, tablets), followed by laptops, documents, desktop, flash drive and disk drive119.   Though not led to device theft or loss, one of the most important consequences of access to  physically unprotected assets in the reporting period was the fraud on ATMs139. In those cases,  physical access to the ATM machines are key to manipulation of ATMs in order to initiate  fraudulent activities140.  131 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/data-breaches-put-focus-endpoint-security, accessed October 2014.  132 http://blogs.absolute.com/lojack-for-laptops/2014/07/1-7-experience-device-loss-theft-travelling/, accesses October  2014.  133 http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2344962/nsa-seen-tampering-with-cisco-kit-to-add-surveillance-tools, accessed  October 2014.  134 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hacking-atms-new-wave-malware/, accessed October 2014.  135 http://securityintelligence.com/how-to-hack-a-mobile-app-its-easier-than-you-think/#.VE9qjqNBuLM, accessed October  2014.  136 http://blogs.cisco.com/security/securing-mobile-data-in-the-event-of-device-loss-or-theft/, accessed October 2014.  137 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/russia-ukraine-information-warfare/, accessed October 2014.  138 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehFiErtjW0, accessed October 2014.  139 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/atm-fraud-c-245, accessed October 2014.  140 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/hacking-atms-no-malware-required-a-7460, accessed November 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/data-breaches-put-focus-endpoint-security http://blogs.absolute.com/lojack-for-laptops/2014/07/1-7-experience-device-loss-theft-travelling/ http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2344962/nsa-seen-tampering-with-cisco-kit-to-add-surveillance-tools http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/hacking-atms-new-wave-malware/ http://securityintelligence.com/how-to-hack-a-mobile-app-its-easier-than-you-think/#.VE9qjqNBuLM http://blogs.cisco.com/security/securing-mobile-data-in-the-event-of-device-loss-or-theft/ http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/russia-ukraine-information-warfare/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ehFiErtjW0 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/atm-fraud-c-245 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/hacking-atms-no-malware-required-a-7460  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  30   Available attacks on mobile phones allow an attacker to exploit data leakage vulnerabilities  when app developers place sensitive information or data in a location on the mobile device50.  An adversary having physical access to the device (through theft or loss) can use existing tools  to perform this attack. Hence, protection of mobile devices against theft or loss should be a  priority for owners.

Reports on the insider threat have been issued, mainly  on the initiative of or commissioned by governmental organisations or organisations enrolled in  national security and military defence141,142,143,144,145. Although these reports mainly focus on malicious  insider user activities, analysis of incidents indicates that a significant amount of insider threats stem  from unintentional user errors/mistakes, unintentional displacement of information and loss/theft124.  Whatever the grounds for insider threat materialisation might be, usually, they lead to significant  impact for the organisation. This explains significant CISO concerns assessed: more than half of  organisations believe that they are vulnerable to this threat142. On the other hand, more than half of  security professionals consider insider threats as being difficult to prevent. Admittedly, the insider  threat is not mainly a technical issue. Together with the high impact of such attacks, it is evident that  this threat is a significant concern, both for technical experts and executives.  In the reporting period we have assessed that:   The insider threat is being primarily noticed by means of technical controls (e.g. via analytics  regarding printer logs, intranet logs, unauthorised access attempts, outbound web traffic to  mistrusted sites, etc.). But technology is just one part of the problem. Being a part of the  organisation, measures that go beyond technological solutions need to be sought.  141 http://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-  %20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  142 http://www.vormetric.com/sites/default/files/ap_Vormetric-Insider_Threat_ESG_Research_Brief.pdf, accessed October  2014.  143 http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/Ponemon-RaytheonPrivilegedUserAbuseResearchReport.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  144 http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/RTN-PrivilegedUserAccessPUMA-RiskMitigationIIS2013-238WP.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  145 http://www.lancope.com/files/documents/Industry-Reports/Lancope-Ponemon-Report-Cyber-Security-Incident- Response.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-%20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf http://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/Insider_Threats/DHS%20-%20Risks%20to%20US%20Critical%20Infrastructure%20from%20Insider%20Threat%20-%2023%20Dec%2013.pdf http://www.vormetric.com/sites/default/files/ap_Vormetric-Insider_Threat_ESG_Research_Brief.pdf http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/Ponemon-RaytheonPrivilegedUserAbuseResearchReport.pdf http://www.trustedcs.com/resources/whitepapers/RTN-PrivilegedUserAccessPUMA-RiskMitigationIIS2013-238WP.pdf http://www.lancope.com/files/documents/Industry-Reports/Lancope-Ponemon-Report-Cyber-Security-Incident-Response.pdf http://www.lancope.com/files/documents/Industry-Reports/Lancope-Ponemon-Report-Cyber-Security-Incident-Response.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  31  Technological solutions need to go hand in hand with HR, awareness and employee guidance  processes145.   Materialised insider threats need particularly high efforts to contain. While average  containment of cyber-attacks is ca. 30 days, insider attacks need on average ca. 60 days146.   Insider attacks are often bypassing existing security controls due to access rights but also due  to available knowledge of the insider regarding existing protection. In addition, they are aware  of weaknesses/vulnerabilities of the organisation that can be misused in order to successfully  place an attack. Often, the best way to recognise an insider adversary is to keep an eye on  people’s behaviour to detect patterns of dissatisfaction145.   A considerable amount of insider incidents in organisations is a result of user error143. Given  the assessed fact that over 50% of data breaches are due to user sloppiness, one can argue  that significant damage is caused due to ignorance. Hence, a better remediation of insider  threat might be achieved by better user training. Over 48% of organisations participating in a  survey on insider threat have not provided any security training to their employees147. Among  the most frequent user errors are misdelivery, that is, sending information (paper or digital)  to wrong recipients119. Misdelivery is followed by publishing error, disposal error,  misconfiguration and malfunction119.   Information types that have been breached by insiders are: intellectual property (63%),  customer data (50%), unknown (24%) and financial records (22%)147. Top 5 activities of insider  misuse assessed are: privilege abuse (88%), non-approved hardware (18%), bribery (16%), e-  mail misuse and data mishandling (11%)119.   A very thorough risk assessment of the insider threat141 has impressively demonstrated that  no operator of critical systems can afford having the required level of protection to properly  mitigate insider threats. This report underlines also the potential for the combination of  insider threat with guidance from external threat agents, an issue that is often  underestimated by organisations. All in all, this report penetrates the issue of insider threat  at a considerable depth.   It seems that there is a gap between perception and reality about insider threat. Analysis of  real incidents shows that insider threats are in second position as cause of all incidents, but  are far less than outsider threats which is at the first position148 (insider threat only 8% of all  incidents).  Observed current trend for this threat: stable/ slight increase  Related threats: Malicious code, Data Breaches, Information leakage, Identity theft, Physical  damage/theft/loss, Phishing, Web-based attacks, Web application attacks / Injection attacks.

Such information is then abused as is, or within other threats and  attacks. Information leakage is different from data breach, in that it mainly concerns exploitation of  technical and organisational weaknesses to obtain information that is then fed to other attacks. Data  breach, on the other hand, is the threat of compromising of confidentiality of massively stored  business information. In the reporting period we have experienced leakage incidents, one of which –  Heartbleed - has been classified by the security community as “one of the most serious to affect the  Internet”149,150. However, some months later, another leakage vulnerability of SSL has been found151.  Concluding one can say that increased complexity of internet architectures (i.e. web and application  services) as well as decentralisation and virtualisation of processing, open doors to information left- overs during processing. This information is targeted by this threat.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Heartbleed was a serious blow to OpenSSL, one of the basic components of secure  communication in the internet. Though good guidance was given to remove the vulnerability,  delays, update errors and even non-corrections of the used SSL version have been observed.  Yet, this incident has demonstrated the complexity in losing trust to a basic security  component: certificates need to be re-issued and dependencies of existing software need to  be analysed and fixed. It is expected that this incident will continue bothering security experts  for some time150. A second leakage incident related to SSL is indicative for the continuous  attempt to challenge the security of trust functions of the internet151.   Among application vulnerabilities (XXS, Information leakage, Session Management, etc.),  none has demonstrated an increase similar to information leakage, which has nearly doubled  in comparison to 2012. It is assumed that this was due to accidental leakage of sensitive  information through data transmission error messages43. Others argue that due to increased  complexity and low level of awareness for a good error handling, information storage and  application architecture issues, information leakage will increase152. In the reporting period,  information leakage weaknesses have been assessed to be within the top three in application  vulnerabilities45.  149 http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet, accessed October 2014.  150 http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03057USEN#loaded,  accessed October 2014.  151 https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2014/10/14/poodle-unleashed-understanding-the-ssl-30-  vulnerability, accessed October 2014.  152 http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1571359#.VFCVzaNBsnO, accessed October 2014.  http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?infotype=SA&subtype=WH&htmlfid=WGL03057USEN#loaded https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2014/10/14/poodle-unleashed-understanding-the-ssl-30-vulnerability https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2014/10/14/poodle-unleashed-understanding-the-ssl-30-vulnerability http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1571359#.VFCVzaNBsnO  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  33   Social media remain a major channel for information leakage that can be used in other (e.g.  targeted) attacks153. Creating awareness with regard to social media/networking applications  can be considered as a “work in progress” area154. Important personal information can be  found in social media such as: copies of driver licenses, ID cards, passports, registration cards,  school ID cards or credit cards155.   Due to the need to transfer information among servers, mobile applications, cloud servers,  etc. it is necessary to introduce/use security controls to avoid data exfiltration for data that  are on the move or reside in end-devices that are not properly managed, at least security wise.  Such controls need to be positioned at all components interacting by means of application  scenarios, both within and outside the organisation156.   A relevant study shows that over 50% of tested applications exhibit weaknesses regarding  information leakage related to application, its implementation, user data, etc. Moreover, over  30% of applications are prone to information leakage due to poor error handling. This fact  opens windows for abuse through information leakage threat152. This indicates an increased  need for secure application development practices.   Among the most common leaks found in applications are: information found in comments  (e.g. filename), cookie retrieval, internal IP addresses and server versions152.

As  such, identity theft is not overlap free with data breach and information leakage threats (see Annex B  in119). This threat is considered individually, because PII is a valuable asset that is often targeted in  cyber space by means of specific tools and attack vectors. As a matter of fact, PII can be part of a data  153http://www.academia.edu/6179116/Social_Information_Leakage_Effects_of_Awareness_and_Peer_Pressure_on_User_  Behavior, accessed October 2014.  154 http://research.itpro.co.uk/content34207, accessed October 2014.  155 http://www.cert.pl/PDF/Report_CP_2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  156 http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/2014-04-11-de_lancaster_executive_report.pdf, accessed  October 2014.  http://www.academia.edu/6179116/Social_Information_Leakage_Effects_of_Awareness_and_Peer_Pressure_on_User_Behavior http://www.academia.edu/6179116/Social_Information_Leakage_Effects_of_Awareness_and_Peer_Pressure_on_User_Behavior http://research.itpro.co.uk/content34207 http://www.cert.pl/PDF/Report_CP_2013.pdf http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2014/2014-04-11-de_lancaster_executive_report.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  34  breach, just as PII can be subject of information leakage. Relevant sources on this topic 157 ,158 ,159  underline the importance of identity theft and fraud as a consumer issue: following an observed  irregularity in financial transactions, credit card information or other identification information,  consumers consider their identity being compromised and/or used for fraud. Accordingly, they  proceed with notification to corresponding/competent organisations (e.g. Identity Theft Resource  Centre in the US160). To this extent, identity theft/fraud is an important term for consumers who have  experienced a successful attack that has revealed their PII.  In this reporting period we assessed that:   Increasing numbers of identity theft/fraud161 incidents have led to consumer mistrust in using  digital means for performing financial transactions. Over 50% of consumers have expressed  their concerns about reclaiming their identity in case they fall victim of this threat. This is  double the number assessed in 2011157. This concern is justified, as they constantly hear news  and reports about fraud in the areas financial, medical/health, taxation, POS, etc. It is  understandable that the trust to the protection offered by their service providers vanishes157.   Both emerging, yet security immature innovations but also older pieces of technology in the  area of home environments will become targets for identity theft: due to weakly implemented  or operated security controls, a variety of PII will flow through a number of interacting  components. Potential areas of PII to be exposed is entertainment, gaming, medical and  consumer information94.   An increased activity in the area of identity theft has been assessed by national authorities.  Threat agents have deployed more sophisticated methods, such as keyloggers, virtual  kidnapping using ransomware and phishing attacks, to perform identity theft and fraud  targeting small medium enterprises but also larger organisations180.   The role of interoperable identities increases together with the interoperability of applications  in the consumer market162. While delivering advancements in application usability and user  comfort, interoperable identities may introduce significant risks if one of those identities will  be subject to identity theft. Through the interoperability, the adversary may obtain access to  a number of other credentials by breaching only one94.   Businesses need to be prepared to manage customer reports on identity theft and fraud, as  this threat has been assessed to be at the first position of overall customer complains,  (increasing by 14% within 2013-2014158). Especially identity fraud in the area of medical care  is on the rise: in a survey on medical identity fraud, it has been estimated that ca. 2 million US  citizens will spend over $12 billion as consequence of identity fraud159,55.  157 http://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/global-consumers-losing-confidence-in-the-battle-against-  fraud-report, accessed October 2014.  158 http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-  2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  159https://www.privacyrights.org/sites/privacyrights.org/files/ID%20Experts%204th%20Annual%20Patient%20Privacy%20  &%20Data%20Security%20Report%20FINAL.pdf, accessed October 2014.  160 http://www.idtheftcenter.org/, accessed October 2014.  161 http://time.com/2953428/data-breaches-identity-theft/, accessed October 2014.  162 http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_050742.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_050742,  accessed October 2014.  http://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/global-consumers-losing-confidence-in-the-battle-against-fraud-report http://www.aciworldwide.com/-/media/files/collateral/global-consumers-losing-confidence-in-the-battle-against-fraud-report http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf https://www.privacyrights.org/sites/privacyrights.org/files/ID%20Experts%204th%20Annual%20Patient%20Privacy%20&%20Data%20Security%20Report%20FINAL.pdf https://www.privacyrights.org/sites/privacyrights.org/files/ID%20Experts%204th%20Annual%20Patient%20Privacy%20&%20Data%20Security%20Report%20FINAL.pdf http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ http://time.com/2953428/data-breaches-identity-theft/ http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_050742.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_050742  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  35   Top types of PII breached between October 2013 and September 2014 are: real names,  government ID numbers and home addresses163.

Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation Installation Command and Control  Actions on Objectives  Identity theft/fraud  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Figure 16: Position of Identity Theft/Fraud in attack workflow  3.14 Cyber espionage  This threat has been introduced in the top threats due to the significant amount of incidents attributed  to nation states and corporations (see also section 4.2 on Threat Agents).With this cyber threat we  would like to refer mainly to APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and to Targeted Attacks, knowing that  the later kind of attacks is not only deployed within espionage campaigns164. Moreover, from assessed  material it becomes clear that APT is nothing more than a targeted attack that is being initiated by a  threat agent with very high capabilities and resources. It is also clear, that cyber espionage consists of  a combination of threats mentioned in this chapter. Hence, just as other threats in the present  chapter, the cyber espionage threat is not overlap-free with other threats mentioned. To this extent,  this threat refers rather to certain tools and tactics that match the profile of espionage threat agents:  cyber espionage is rather a tactical approach than technical165. As it is the case with some reports  found, cyber espionage is worth classifying according to campaigns encountered165. Whatever the  classification of this threat might be, it assumes a high level capability and corresponding motivation.  Moreover, this kind of attack and especially the reconnaissance phases may persist over a very long  time period, while attribution is very difficult, especially in case of state sponsored espionage. In the  reporting period we have seen cyber espionage on the rise: reports about incidents state a growth  that is close to 3% compared to last year166.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:  163 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-september-2014, accessed October 2014.  164 Due to the terminology diffusion regarding what is a threat and what is an attack vector, in ETL 2014 we have  introduced an extra chapter on the topic of attack vectors to further analyse this matter (see Chapter 5  “Attack Vectors”).  165 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/resources/threat-intelligence/targeted-attack-trends/rpt-targeted-attack-trends- 2h-2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  166 http://media.kaspersky.com/en/IT_Security_Risks_Survey_2014_Global_report.pdf, accessed October 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-september-2014 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/resources/threat-intelligence/targeted-attack-trends/rpt-targeted-attack-trends-2h-2013.pdf http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/resources/threat-intelligence/targeted-attack-trends/rpt-targeted-attack-trends-2h-2013.pdf http://media.kaspersky.com/en/IT_Security_Risks_Survey_2014_Global_report.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  36   Quite some targeted attack campaigns have demonstrated an increase in focus, sophistication  and persistence55. We have seen attacks more narrowly tailored, addressing a reduced  number of recipients and organisations but increasing significantly in frequency. Spear  phishing and Strategic Web Compromise167 (SWC, aka Watering Hole) are important tools  used for initial phases of the attack (i.e. reconnaissance, weaponisation and delivery). Spyware  Trojans, Bootkits40 and remote access trojans168 (RAT) are often used malware in the phases  exploitation and persistence55,169.   Statistics show important trends observed in the reporting period55: there is an increase of  industry sectors targeted (11%) (i.e. wider campaigns). While the number of recipients  targeted has decreased (62%) (i.e. more targeted campaigns). Average duration of targeted  attacks increased (105%) (i.e. more persistent campaigns); and number of detected campaigns  increased significantly (472%).   The observed cascade of sophistication, complexity and capability levels start with advanced  persistent threat, go over to targeted attacks and end at cyber-criminals. With the  advancement of attacks, technology used today within APT and targeted attacks, will be  adopted over time by cyber-criminals167,169,170.   New attack methods that can be used in targeted and advanced persistent threat attacks  emerge in the area of research171. It can be assumed that advancements in new methods will  arise in the military and national security sectors172.   The volume of attacks by industry sector shows that the most popular targets of targeted  attacks are: governments (80%), computer/IT (4%), followed by Aerospace, Industrial,  Electrical, Telecommunications and Military (3% each)55,169. This fact clearly manifests the  areas of interest and motives behind cyber-espionage, being collection of intelligence  regarding political, strategic, technological and industrial developments.   Primarily within APTs but also targeted attacks, involved adversaries have demonstrated the  ability to evade existing controls, at least automated ones145. It is therefore advisable to  consider strengthening defences at the level of human-based controls, such as trainings  regarding phishing and spam and awareness raising measures in general.

In the reporting period we have seen ransomware  gaining importance as a malicious tool. Though some reduction of this threat has been expected after  law enforcement success of last year (Police Virus173, Zeus-Botnet174), a significant revival of this threat  has been assessed, in particular for mobile devices. Equally significant is the fact that ransom shows  growth potential due to updates performed in corresponding malicious tools, especially regarding  distribution, encryption and used payment methods. It seems that ransomware has gone through  improvements adopted from malware17. Moreover, it seems reasonable to speculate on the potential  entrance of a ransomware development kit in the cyber-crime market 175 ,36. Although ransom  decreased in the reporting period, the inclusion of mobile devices and the new features mentioned  above, create the impression that this threat will be increased in the future.  In this reporting period we have assessed that:   Advancements in functionality of ransomware have shown up after the announcement of a  Trojan encryption tool for sale in underground market for Android. Right after this  announcement, the first mobile malware embracing this functionality was detected. By the  end of second quarter of 2014, some 47 versions on the Trojan have been detected40. All  ransom attempts have used social engineering techniques to exert pressure on the victims40.   For the communication with the C&C server, one version of the Trojan has used the TOR  network. Although the use of the anonymity network is seen as an advancement, researchers  argue that this increases detectability both of the malware and the underlying botnet176. It  remains to be observed how TOR functionality usage within malware will evolve over the time.   It is interesting to observe how protective functions of mobile devices have been misused to  block phones and require a ransom: by attacking the Apple ID on iOS devices, adversaries  managed to completely block the device and as money to unlock the device177.   Thee ransomware threat can create damage, especially to businesses, while it is highly  profitable for cyber-criminals. As opposed to the past, available anonymous payment schemes  such as MoneyPack and QIWI VISA Wallet, facilitate cash flow to the cyber-criminals.

These  approaches build on the old saying “opportunity makes the thief.” In cyber-crime the situation is not  much different. In the reporting period we have seen cyber threat agents looking for opportunities to  better target their attacks and more easily fool their victims. The examples are self-speaking:  international sport events, specially crafted phishing attacks based on personal profiles/habits,  targeted campaigns to find weak links, etc.  Considering the opportunity factor in cyber-crime might be an important tool for defenders in order  to understand motivation and techniques that are likely to be used. By taking into account the issue  of opportunities in cyber-crime, it can be concluded that:   Cyber-crime opportunities often have location and time relevance: It is typical that, as ordinary  criminals, cyber criminals seek to abuse collective mind-sets that are formed within big  events182,183,184. Moreover, events with international political impact are main triggers for cyber-  crime, especially hacktivism, cyber-fighters and state sponsored espionage185,186,187,188.   Cyber-crime tries to increase opportunity specificity: cyber-crime seeks for specific opportunities  that increase success rates. In the reporting period we have experienced a shift towards more  targeted attacks to sets of opportunities that are concentrated to exploiting specific weaknesses.  Hence, instead of looking for victims in the wild, cyber attackers concentrate their attacks on set  of users, e.g. by abusing breached information189.   Cyber-crime produces opportunities for cyber-crime: The emergence of underground markets for  hacking tools and hacked information (i.e. cyber-crime as a service) shows clearly that cyber-crime  leads to cyber-crime. Cyber-crime underground forums, cyber-crime market places and offerings  are a clear indication hereto190.   Social and technological changes create cyber-crime opportunities: Building the basis of cyber-  crime for years now, social and technical changes are THE opportunity abused, especially in phases  181 http://skywallnet.com/data_server/CA/OMT_PP_CP.pdf, accessed October 2014.  182 http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/anonymous-threatens-cyber-attack-on-fifa-world-cup-sponsors-533657,  accessed October 2014.  183 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sochi-olympics-2014-cyber-threats-mean-there-no-privacy-winter-olympics-  1435387#channel=f32fe627f65f00c&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.co.uk, accessed October 2014.  184 http://www.eweek.com/security/world-cup-spurs-cyber-attacks-digital-protests.html, accessed October 2014.  185 http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/565988/20140911/isis-islamic-state-al-qaeda-caliphate.htm#.VDZLpqP6jZ4, accessed  October 2014.  186 http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/hong-kong-protesters-fight-cyber-attacks/2477307.html, accessed  October 2014.  187 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-  Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmis sion%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223, accessed  October 2014.  188 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18294/security/fireeye-nation-state-driven-cyber-attacks.html, accessed October  2014.  189 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small- businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard %20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_, accessed October 2014.  190 http://securityintelligence.com/underground-cybercrime-exploits-for-sale/#.VDY-ZqP6jZ4, accessed October 2014.  http://skywallnet.com/data_server/CA/OMT_PP_CP.pdf http://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/anonymous-threatens-cyber-attack-on-fifa-world-cup-sponsors-533657 http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sochi-olympics-2014-cyber-threats-mean-there-no-privacy-winter-olympics-1435387#channel=f32fe627f65f00c&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.co.uk http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sochi-olympics-2014-cyber-threats-mean-there-no-privacy-winter-olympics-1435387#channel=f32fe627f65f00c&origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.co.uk http://www.eweek.com/security/world-cup-spurs-cyber-attacks-digital-protests.html http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/565988/20140911/isis-islamic-state-al-qaeda-caliphate.htm#.VDZLpqP6jZ4 http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/hong-kong-protesters-fight-cyber-attacks/2477307.html http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmission%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmission%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240223145/Syrian-hacktivists-find-new-way-to-target-Reuters?asrc=EM_ERU_30745331&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=ERU&utm_campaign=20140624_ERU%20Transmission%20for%2006/24/2014%20(UserUniverse:%20919769)_myka-reports@techtarget.com&src=5262223 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/18294/security/fireeye-nation-state-driven-cyber-attacks.html http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small-businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard%20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small-businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard%20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_ http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240232029/JP-Morgan-breach-affects-7-million-small-businesses?asrc=EM_MDN_34980641&utm_medium=EM&utm_source=MDN&utm_campaign=20141008_MasterCard%20launches%20cyber%20hacking%20protection%20software_ http://securityintelligence.com/underground-cybercrime-exploits-for-sale/#.VDY-ZqP6jZ4  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  42  of growth, mass deployment/marketing and end of support. Knowing that, introduction of social  and technical changes should be “secure by design”. In the reporting period we have seen some  EU-Member States introducing security in early stages of technology adoption191,192 in order to  effectively reduce the window of this opportunity.  Yet not always feasible and obvious, with some awareness, these opportunities could be recognised  by defenders, thus contributing to situational prevention. In cyber-space this might mean adapting  defences, level of preparedness and expectations.  Looking at ways to better understand the methods used for opportunity emergence and opportunity  exploitation, might lead to a better cyber-defence. It is considered appropriate to more systematically  analyse this field and capitalized on existing experience from the area of criminology193.  4.2 Overview of Threat Agents  In the reporting period, we have seen evidence for the existence of almost all of threat agents  described in previous ETLs 194 . Hence, the same group of threat agents will be maintained, by  introducing a ranking according to attribution statistics found.  Generally speaking, some trends in the way threat agents place their attacks have been identified in  the reporting period: the most active threat agents seem to perform more targeted attacks. Speaking  in terms of opportunities, cyber threat agents are more effective in finding means for identification of  windows of opportunities. This is a new trend: cyber-criminals can better target their attacks and be  more successful in exploitation of vulnerabilities, while using more effectively malicious tools and  attack methods.  One reason assumed for this trend is advancements in capabilities of finding vulnerabilities  (technical/human). Breached/leaked information is considered as main tool to achieve this goal.  Secondly, advancements in attack techniques allow certain types of attacks to “fly under the radar”  by leaving no traces behind195,196. Finally, new attack practices combined with reconnaissance attacks  on web applications (e.g. smokescreening197) increase their efficiency, while reducing detections.  These tactics have led to the changes of threat landscape assessed within the ETL 2014.  191 https://blog.cyberwar.nl/2014/07/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-4/, accessed October 2014.  192 https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/#downloads, accessed October 2014.  193 http://www.cybercrimejournal.com/broadhurstetalijcc2014vol8issue1.pdf, accessed October 2014.  194 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2014.  195 http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601140/hackers-make-driveby-download-attacks-stealthier-with-fileless-  infections.html, accessed October 2014.  196 http://rt.com/news/175912-critroni-ransomware-tor-network/, accessed October 2014.  197 http://www.neustar.biz/resources/whitepapers/ddos-protection/2014-annual-ddos-attacks-and-impact-report.pdf,  accessed October 2014.  https://blog.cyberwar.nl/2014/07/cyber-security-assessment-netherlands-4/ https://www.cyberstreetwise.com/cyberessentials/#downloads http://www.cybercrimejournal.com/broadhurstetalijcc2014vol8issue1.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601140/hackers-make-driveby-download-attacks-stealthier-with-fileless-infections.html http://www.pcworld.com/article/2601140/hackers-make-driveby-download-attacks-stealthier-with-fileless-infections.html http://rt.com/news/175912-critroni-ransomware-tor-network/ http://www.neustar.biz/resources/whitepapers/ddos-protection/2014-annual-ddos-attacks-and-impact-report.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  43  In this chapter we provide an overview of the threat agents. In 2014, few elaborated descriptions  were found on this topic198,199,200,201,202,203,204. However, no significant changes in the typology of  Threat Agents could be observed. All in all, data collected in 2014 provides some additional  information, yet not much differing from previous reporting periods.  However, it should be mentioned that this observation regards publicly available information. There  are reports that law enforcement agencies work on profiling cyber criminals205. Yet this information  is kept confidential and as such not accessible for this report.  In order to better understand Threat Agents, advancements in attribution are necessary. Attribution  of incidents to various groups is difficult and laborious. In most cases attribution can be performed  with the cooperation of various players triggered through law enforcement. Attribution of incidents  to threat agents is an area that has significant development potential.  Moreover, observation of relevant underground market and its dynamics helps in understanding  important dependencies among various Threat Agents as well as their product and technology level.  It is worth mentioning that in the reporting period significant insights into the relevant market for  cyber-crime tools and stolen data has been found (Authoritative Resource: Report of Rand National  Security Research Division “Markets for Cybercrime Tools and Stolen Data”206).  The above developments aim at the validation of Threat Agent description and provide additional  details regarding motives and capabilities. While the threat agents from ETL 2013 still remain relevant,  the details assessed this year provide the basis for a ranking based on statistical information from  incidents (mainly reported incidents207 and data breaches208). The top five attributions of incidents  refer to the target groups: Cybercriminals, Hacktivists and Cyber Espionage, Insider Threat and Cyber  War. Accordingly, major threat agents identified are as follows (prioritised):  Cybercriminals: This threat agent group is the most widely known as its objective is to obtain profit  from illegal/criminal activities in cyberspace. In the reporting period, most of the observed incidents  have been attributed to this group. The main motivations behind their activities are intelligence and  monetisation. One main characteristic is the availability of large time and money budgets, while being  technically highly skilled and very well equipped. Often they use high-performance computing  resources and might be part of highly organised groups (i.e. organised crime in Far East and Eastern  Europe). Given existing crime opportunities and profitability of cybercrime, it is expected that  organised crime groups will increasingly engage in this field.  198 https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-  _an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf, accessed October  2014.  199 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/how-well-do-you-understand-your-cyber-adversary-part-1/,  accessed October 2014.  200 http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/well-understand-cyber-adversary-part-3/, accessed October  2014.  201 http://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijict_spl/ijictv4n3spl_06.pdf, accessed October 2014.  202 http://technical.cloud-journals.com/index.php/IJACSIT/article/download/Tech-136/pdf, accessed October 2014.  203 http://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/infographic-the-many-faces-of-todays-hackers/a/d-  id/1317039?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT, accessed November 2014.  204 http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/9-notorious-hackers-of-2013/d/d-id/1113140,  accessed November 2014.  205 http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/6449644-74/hackers-bukh-criminals#axzz3FjI4gCyZ, accessed October 2014.  206 http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf, accessed October  2014.  207 http://hackmageddon.com/, accessed October 2014.  208 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014, accessed October 2014.  https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf https://www.nccgroup.com/media/481272/2014-04-09_-_security_of_things_-_an_implementers_guide_to_cyber_security_for_internet_of_things_devices_and_beyond-2.pdf http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/how-well-do-you-understand-your-cyber-adversary-part-1/ http://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2014/05/well-understand-cyber-adversary-part-3/ http://www.ripublication.com/irph/ijict_spl/ijictv4n3spl_06.pdf http://technical.cloud-journals.com/index.php/IJACSIT/article/download/Tech-136/pdf http://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/infographic-the-many-faces-of-todays-hackers/a/d-id/1317039?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT http://www.darkreading.com/perimeter/infographic-the-many-faces-of-todays-hackers/a/d-id/1317039?_mc=RSS_DR_EDT http://www.informationweek.com/security/attacks-and-breaches/9-notorious-hackers-of-2013/d/d-id/1113140 http://triblive.com/news/editorspicks/6449644-74/hackers-bukh-criminals#axzz3FjI4gCyZ http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR600/RR610/RAND_RR610.pdf http://hackmageddon.com/ http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/symantec-intelligence-report-may-2014  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  44  Cybercriminals are typically involved in fraud regarding all kinds of sectors engaged in cyber-space: e- finance, e-commerce, e-payment, ransomware, cybercrime-as-a-service209, delivery and development  of malicious tools and infrastructures. Taking into account aspects of the cybercrime market, one can  discriminate among some specialized roles (often building hierarchical structures)193,206. Such roles are  administrators, specialized experts in various areas of cybercrime, intermediaries, brokers and  vendors. In the figure provided in this section, roles at the “productive” end of the cybercrime are  depicted by means of providers/developers/operators.  The cybercriminal market allows its suppliers/customers to obtain the means needed for their hostile  activities, such as knowledge, tools and breached data. By taking as given that this group possesses  significant monetary resources, it should be considered as being in the position to occupy additional  workforce in order to enhance capabilities210. Finally the utilisation of anonymisation, encryption and  virtual currencies, allows cyber criminals to move in a “dark market”, hence impeding detection and  attribution efforts.  Online Social Hackers: given the important role of phishing and stalking in targeting cyber-attacks,  this group is considered as part of criminal activities in cyber space211,212. Therefore this threat agent  group plays a key role when deploying cyber threats. Online social hackers are skilled with social  engineering knowledge, are in the position to analyse and understand behaviour and psychology of  social targets, thus evading privacy of potential victims. Main tools used are analysis of social  engineering information, profiling of user (e.g. by using loggers, social media accounts, breached  data). Even when not using high-tech methodologies and tools, activities of this threat agent group  may cause significant privacy impact especially in areas of identity theft, collection of confidential  personal data, user credentials, cyber bullying, etc. 213 , 214 . The capabilities of this group can be  characterised as low to medium as regards the use of technology. However their social engineering  skills are high. With increasing use of social networking, it is expected that the importance of this  group in cyber-attacks will play a significant role, as phishing is becoming an important tool for placing  cyber-attacks.  Hacktivists: Hacktivists is a threat agent group that has enjoyed great media attention, as they are  politically motivated activists. Their motivation emerges mainly from political ideology, they proclaim  social justice and sincerity and aim at propaganda and influence in political decision making. According  to their motive and ideological direction, they can dynamically form groups/subgroups, usually lacking  a central organisation structure. Typical reasons for their mobilisation are political decisions,  political/social crises and assumed injustice and unfairness towards social groups. Their reactions are  triggered during riots, international sport events and other major events with international attention.  In the reporting period we have seen quite few engagements of this target agent group in  209 http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240231663/Service-model-driving-cyber-crime-says-Europol-report,  accessed October 2014.  210 http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-  careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html, accessed October 2014.  211 http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/jpmorgan-cybersecurity-idUSL2N0RY1CC20141003, accessed October  2014.  212 https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/iocta2014_summary_findings_and_recommendations.  pdf, accessed October 2014.  213 http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/social-media/people-hack-social-media-accounts/, accessed October  2014.  214 http://hackerspace.lifehacker.com/social-hacking-for-introverts-1554859929, accessed October 2014.  http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240231663/Service-model-driving-cyber-crime-says-Europol-report http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/silk-road-mastermind-ross-william-ulbricht-tripped-up-by-careless-online-mistake-20131003-2utky.html http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/03/jpmorgan-cybersecurity-idUSL2N0RY1CC20141003 https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/iocta2014_summary_findings_and_recommendations.pdf https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publications/iocta2014_summary_findings_and_recommendations.pdf http://www.pandasecurity.com/mediacenter/social-media/people-hack-social-media-accounts/ http://hackerspace.lifehacker.com/social-hacking-for-introverts-1554859929  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  45  corresponding occasions215,216,217,218. The main malicious activities of this group include: DDoS attacks,  leakage, defacement, hacking219.  Due to the dynamics behind this group, it is difficult to give it a sharp profile: in some cases, threat  agents of other groups – e.g. script kiddies - join hacktivists activities in order to co-protest or to serve  other purposes (e.g. express their sympathy, perform knowledge transfer, provide tools, etc.). Due to  these dynamics, alleged hacktivist activities might be a façade used by groups with different  motives220.  Targets are selected in such a way, that media attention to successful cyber-attacks creates high  visibility (e.g. government sites, big companies, media, public and private infrastructure components,  etc.). Typical actions of successful attacks include publishing of breached data and video messages to  maximize public attention. Defence costs against threats of hacktivists are considered as moderate. In  the reporting period it has been reported for first time that security agencies have performed counter- attacks to defend hacktivist activities221.  Nation States: The Snowden revelations in 2013-2014 have shed a new light in hostile activities that  emerge as part of national security and intelligence/counter-intelligence regimes of nation states. The  true dimension behind the potential of this threat agent group is a main ongoing focus of media since  then (here few indicative references due to the large amount222). In the reporting period the state- sponsored espionage threat has created concerns to media223, security experts224,225,226 and industry  alike, while has ranked at third position in attribution of cyber-incidents.  In the meantime, various nation states have developed cyber-intelligence capabilities227. Due to non- transparent policies and regimes, it can be assumed that all countries with such capabilities could  potentially be involved in cyber-attacks, with a significant part being in the area of  intelligence/counter-intelligence. Even within allies, no clear no-spy policies exist 228 . Taking into  account resources and budget availability, hostile cyber-activities of nation states are a severe threat  that can cause high defence costs, while creating severe impact both at governmental and corporate  levels. Main targets of this threat agent group are state secrets, military secrets, data on intelligence,  as well as threatening the availability of critical infrastructures.

As it is the case with espionage in general, nation state  activities aim at the creation of intelligence, strategic, psychological and political advantages229.  Corporations: The growth of activities in corporate espionage follows the trends in state-sponsored  cyber-espionage: it grows by targeting corporate information230,231,232. The aim is to collect business  intelligence, stealing competitive information (e.g. research results, analyses, innovation ideas,  planned procurements etc.), breach intellectual property rights (IPR), or even cause damage/sabotage  to competitors. Being significantly budgeted and having sufficient knowledge, potential attacks from  this threat agent group could cause high costs233. Generally speaking, corporations may be involved in  reconnaissance activities, intrusion and data breach. Being in close cooperation with state, industrial  espionage may use existing state cyber-resources to achieve their objectives 234 . Moreover,  corporations may engage salaried threat agents from other groups to achieve their objectives.  Employees (current, ex, internal and external): motivated by extortion, revenge, sabotage or profit,  this group has a significant role in the materialisation of cyber threats, especially those that lead to  data breaches235. Referred to as Insider Threat, this threat group embraces both own and contracted  employees, i.e. staff, contractors, operational staff, former employees, etc. Threats emanating from  this target group may be both intentional and unintentional (i.e. i.e. lax handling of security  procedures, user error or even malicious intent). ENISA incident reporting, for example, has shown  that in the telecommunication sector Human Error and Third Party Failure are within the top 5 causes  for large outages236. The effort required to protect assets against such threats can be quite high237.  Therefore it is important to identify employee unhappiness, spot knowledge-gaps and get alerted  when attacks abuse publicly unknown vulnerabilities202.  Cyber Fighters: Cyber fighters are groups of nationally motivated citizens who possess significant  striking power. Their attacks are politically motivated and, in a similar manner to hacktivists, are  concentrating mainly to sabotage, by often publishing of breached data and video messages to  maximize public attention. Such groups might have strong feelings when their political, national or  religious values seem to be threatened by another group and are capable of launching cyber-attacks.  To certain extent, such groups may be supporters of totalitarian regimes and, rightly or wrongly, act  on behalf of their supporting parties (i.e. governments) by contributing to national activities in the  cyber-space238,239.  229 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_spying, accessed October 2014.  230 http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/robert-gates-most-countries-conduct-economic-espionage/, accessed October 2014.  231 http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/corporate-espionage-gavin-haynes-284, accessed October 2014.  232 http://www.dw.de/german-businesses-face-rising-threat-of-industrial-espionage/a-17798275, accessed October 2014.  233 http://cybertinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HARKONNEN-OPERATION-CYBER-ESPIONAGE1.pdf, accessed  October 2014.  234 http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/26/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126, accessed  October 2014.  235 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_Verizon-DBIR-2014_en_xg.pdf, accessed October 2014.  236 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-  reports-2013/at_download/fullReport, accessed October 2014.  237 http://www.vormetric.com/resources/Infographics/the-2014-vormetric-insider-threat-report-european-edition,  accessed October 2014.  238 http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background, accessed October 2014.  239 http://cybershafarat.com/2014/10/13/post-9-abu-bahgat-hatem-deeb-syrian-electronic-army-leadership/, accessed  October 2014.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_spying http://thediplomat.com/2014/05/robert-gates-most-countries-conduct-economic-espionage/ http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/corporate-espionage-gavin-haynes-284 http://www.dw.de/german-businesses-face-rising-threat-of-industrial-espionage/a-17798275 http://cybertinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/HARKONNEN-OPERATION-CYBER-ESPIONAGE1.pdf http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/26/us-security-snowden-germany-idUSBREA0P0DE20140126 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/reports/rp_Verizon-DBIR-2014_en_xg.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports/annual-incident-reports-2013/at_download/fullReport http://www.vormetric.com/resources/Infographics/the-2014-vormetric-insider-threat-report-european-edition http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background http://cybershafarat.com/2014/10/13/post-9-abu-bahgat-hatem-deeb-syrian-electronic-army-leadership/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  47  In the reporting period we have seen more systematic and well organised activities from this threat  agent group240,241,242,243. Activities of this target group from this year are characterized by increased  maturity and sophistication of attack methods used.  Cyber Terrorists: cyber terrorism continued to be controversially discussed in the reporting period244.  In this time, more extensive descriptions of this threat agent group could be found245. Supposedly,  cyber terrorists are targeting large-scale sabotage to harm national security and society, mainly aiming  at critical infrastructure. Characteristic of this threat agent group is the indiscriminate use of violence  in order to influence decisions/actions of states towards their politically or relationally motivated  objectives. As a matter of fact, no publicly known incident has been attributed to this target group in  the reporting period. Nevertheless, national cyber-security strategies rate cyber-terrorism risks quite  high and have developed numerous defences for protection 246 . At the same time it has been  recognised that risks from cyber-crime and not cyber-terrorism is the major threat for western  countries247. In the reporting period we have seen some evidence that terrorists may use technology  as means for improving their communication while avoiding state surveillance. Yet, according to the  definition of this threat agent group this is not a hostile activity. However, such an engagement may  lead to increasing knowledge of related tools that can be then used to launch attacks248,249. In this  reporting period a report was found that gives an interesting overview of potential misuse of the  Internet by terrorists. It provides a detailed list of use-cases, potential actions and tools250.  Script Kiddies: This target group consists of young individuals who might be thrilled about  achievements and skills of tech savvy individuals who assumedly gave a lesson to persons,  organisations or brands considered outrageous. Although they are not be present in incident statistics  in the reporting period, script kiddies are still considered as threat agents. The rationale behind this  is, that due to the ease of obtaining malicious tools, tech savvy teenagers will purchase and use  them251. Consequently, due to potentially low level of knowledge about the use of hacking tools, low  threshold of self-control, overestimation of own skills and the consequences of their activities, script  kiddies may achieve great impact. Although it is not expected that significant incidents will be  attributed to this threat agent group, it is considered within the ETL 2014for the sake of completeness.  As a short reflection to forthcoming developments of the threat landscape, it is recognised that  emerging technologies might create the grounds for malicious activities targeting smaller user  communities. This might lead to creation of new threat agent groups, even if the reach of their activity  240 http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-attackers-announce-phase-4-a-5929/op-1, accessed October 2014.  241 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-24/three-things-you-should-know-about-the-syrian-electronic-army.html,  accessed October 2014.  242 http://sea.sy/index/en, accessed October 2014.  243 http://www.securityweek.com/tunisian-hackers-target-governments-banks-theweekofhorror-cyber-attacks, accessed  October 2014.  244  http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/awan_debating_the_term_cyber-terrorism_ijc_jan_2014.pdf, accessed  October 2014.  245 http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/explaining-cyberterrorism/, accessed October 2014.  246 http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-director-calls-for-stronger-deterrent-strategy-to-  oppose-cyberattacks/2014/02/27/aabd3d92-9fd4-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html, accessed October 2014.  247 http://threatpost.com/cyberespionage-not-cyber-terror-is-the-major-threat-former-nsa-director-says/105223,  accessed October 2014.  248 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751896/Islamic-State-jihadists-planning-encryption-protected-cyber-  caliphate-carry-hacking-attacks-West.html, accessed October 2014.  249 http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/16/nsa-director-michael-rogers-talks-islamic-state-cybersecurity,  accessed October 2014.  250 http://www.computerweekly.com/ehandbook/Terrorist-use-of-the-internet, accessed October 2014.  251 http://www.itnews.com.au/BlogEntry/396629,being-a-script-kiddie-easier-than-ever.aspx, accessed October 2014.  http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/ddos-attackers-announce-phase-4-a-5929/op-1 http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-24/three-things-you-should-know-about-the-syrian-electronic-army.html http://sea.sy/index/en http://www.securityweek.com/tunisian-hackers-target-governments-banks-theweekofhorror-cyber-attacks http://www.internetjournalofcriminology.com/awan_debating_the_term_cyber-terrorism_ijc_jan_2014.pdf http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/explaining-cyberterrorism/ http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-director-calls-for-stronger-deterrent-strategy-to-oppose-cyberattacks/2014/02/27/aabd3d92-9fd4-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-director-calls-for-stronger-deterrent-strategy-to-oppose-cyberattacks/2014/02/27/aabd3d92-9fd4-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html http://threatpost.com/cyberespionage-not-cyber-terror-is-the-major-threat-former-nsa-director-says/105223 http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751896/Islamic-State-jihadists-planning-encryption-protected-cyber-caliphate-carry-hacking-attacks-West.html http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2751896/Islamic-State-jihadists-planning-encryption-protected-cyber-caliphate-carry-hacking-attacks-West.html http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/16/nsa-director-michael-rogers-talks-islamic-state-cybersecurity http://www.computerweekly.com/ehandbook/Terrorist-use-of-the-internet http://www.itnews.com.au/BlogEntry/396629,being-a-script-kiddie-easier-than-ever.aspx  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  48  is limited. In the area of Smart Homes, for example, activities of harassment, abuse, sabotage, bullying,  etc. could be initiated from individuals as result of neighbourhood disputes, landlords and tenants,  etc. Just as in the case of bullying, this kind of malicious activity may cost human lives and should not  be left out of scope.  As no significant changes in threat agent profiles have been observed in the reporting period, we reuse  the threat agent taxonomy of ETL 2013 in order to provide an overview (see Figure 19). It should be  noted, that the threat agents mentioned in this chapter are depicted in the figure through the right  hand branch, annotated as Hostile Cyber Agent, whereas the left hand branch of it stays for other  agents who serve friendly tasks in cyber space.  Besides serving as an overview, this figure may be used in order to follow/comprehend eventual  interactions among the different groups, such as possible “camp changes”, concurrent roles or other  interactions among them252.

ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  50  ETL 2014: Attack Vectors  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  51  5 Attack Vectors  5.1 Attack Vectors within threat intelligence  In the ETL 2013253, we have identified attack workflow and attack patterns as important pieces of  information in order to better understand cyber threats. Such information will add value to identified  threats, as every threat description will contain information on methods used to successfully deploy  a specific threat. In this chapter we firstly position this information with regard to threats and explain  its role. Moreover, we provide some information found on this matter by means of distinct attack  methods assessed in the reporting period.  As already indicated in the used definitions (see section 2.6), in this year’s ETL we have introduced  Attack Vectors as an element of threat analysis. In the rest of this chapter, as an initial approach we  use the term attack vector as synonymous with attack pattern and attack workflow. Knowing that  these terms are already being used in threat modelling254, we will not dive into details of such concepts  for the time being255. Attack vectors will be considered rather from a practical point of view as an  additional element for the understanding of cyber threats. To this extent, we will use the following  simplistic definition of attack vectors:  If the assessed cyber threats are the malicious tools of threat agents, what are the ways these tools  are used in order to harm assets? In other words: if the cyber threats are the “what”, then what is the  “how” to achieve a successful attack? The how reflected by the attack vector.  Knowing that this definition might be very simplistic and subjective, we use it for the time being as a  sort of “pilot” to provide some information on attack vectors. Over time, this term will eventually  mature further and become more comprehensive/inclusive. For the time being, however, we would  assume attack vectors contain schematic information about the steps within an attack and the assets  that have been compromised in order to achieve the malicious objectives (i.e. actions on objectives,  as stated in kill chains).  Having stated this, we recognise that the concept of kill chains that is being used in the current threat  landscape, is related to attack vectors. Within this work, we make the assumption that a kill-chain  characterizes various phases of an attack vector. Hence, possible redundancies between kill-chain  information and attack vector information should be tolerated for the time being. Another source of  overlaps are assessed current threats: depending on the scope of each threat, it might be the case  that some information from the attack vector (i.e. about the “how”) is subsumed within the threat  definition. Examples from the current document are the threats: web based attacks (including drive- by-download attack) cyber espionage (including APT and targeted attacks), exploit kits, etc. In other  cases, a specific attack type is taken as synonymous to a threat (e.g. watering hole attack).  In order to gain information about attack vectors, an analysis of incidents needs to take place.  Depending on the level of the detail achieved/published, various levels of attack vectors will be  identifiable. The fact is, that attack vectors will be available for incidents that have been identified,  reported and analysed, eventually by using forensic evidence. Given that not all incidents are analysed  in this manner, it will not be always possible to provide this kind of information for assessed threats.  253 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-  overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport, accessed November 2014.  254 https://capec.mitre.org/, accessed November 2014.  255 This is an activity that might be taken into account within discussions with relevant stakeholders in the coming  year (2015).  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape-2013-overview-of-current-and-emerging-cyber-threats/at_download/fullReport https://capec.mitre.org/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  52  In the present chapter we deliver some preliminary information on the following attack vectors:  Targeted attack, Drive-by-attack and Web strategic compromise (watering hole attack) and Advanced  persistent threat (APT). These attack vectors have been selected as the most frequent and most  documented ones.  Before going into these attack vectors, we will provide with a short discussion on the state-of-play of  attack vector material found and the modalities used to describe attack vector information within ETL.  5.2 Describing a Cyber-Attack though Attack Information  The description of a cyber-attack is rather obvious: a threat agent uses tools (cyber threats) to abuse  weakness of some assets, thus obtaining access to these assets with the final aim to achieve their  malicious objectives (i.e. illegal profit/fraud, theft of valuable data, sabotage, etc.). This is identical to  the content depicted in figure 1 “Threats targeting an asset by trying to exploit vulnerabilities” in  chapter 2.2 of ETL 2013256. To this extent, an attack may be described as a set of steps. Each step might  show an asset, its weakness/vulnerability, the tool to exploit the vulnerability and the consequences  of a successful attack. Having this information, defenders will be in the position to understand the  details of the attack and put in place defences to eliminate vulnerabilities (eventually by implementing  some security controls). This is considered as a strong tool, especially for stakeholders with reduced  threat analysis capabilities.  While information about the various steps of attacks were scarce in material found around 2010-2012,  in 2013, many vendors/organisations have provided information about the attacks. Just as ETL 2013  and 2014, some organisations collecting threat intelligence have used kill-chains to provide general  information about the phases of an attack supported by cyber threats257,258,259,260,261,262 (references  indicative and non-exhaustive). Kill-chains are definitely an important piece of information describing  the “purpose” of a cyber threat. Yet, they do not give information about the assets at stake and  vulnerabilities being abused. In some reports, a more detailed (mostly graphical) description of an  attack is being provided258,263,264,265,266,267 (references indicative and non-exhaustive).  Both kill-chains and graphical representations of attacks can be generic or campaign specific. This  would allow for structuring attack vectors according to their specificity (i.e. generic category of drive- by-attack vs. specific drive-by-attacks within a certain campaign). Although structuring existing  information in that way may be an interesting exercise, it might require significant effort.

A definite conclusion that can be drawn from this is,  that the matter of attack vectors is at an early maturity level and requires more elaboration in the  future.  Being a first pilot on attack vectors, the ETL 2014 will provide initial information on the attack vectors  mentioned in section 5.1 consisting of: a generic description of the attack, threat agents involved and  information sources found with some tags describing it (e.g. generic, campaign-specific, etc.). Due to  the fact that we are at an early phase of our learning curve regarding this topic, the level of information  provided could be characterized as initial. The material collected is not only from the reported period  but also older. This allowed us to obtain a critical mass for the initial investigation of attack vectors.  Upon discussions with stakeholders and received feedback on this topic, we will consider expanding  this information in the future by adding additional levels of description/details as deemed necessary.  5.3 Targeted attacks  Description: Targeted attacks are per definition attacks that are based on some specific knowledge  regarding the target268. Based on this knowledge, adversaries craft specific messages or other artefacts  to lure the victim. When arriving at the victims end, the malicious message is not recognised as such  due to the familiarity  that has been built in by the adversary (i.e. reference to a familiar personal,  organisational process/matter). The victim “bites” the bait and an initial infection has been achieved.  Relation to kill-chain: Targeted attacks usually cover all phases of a kill-chain. A targeted attack starts  with reconnaissance to obtain the initial knowledge about personal, internal, organisational and other  characteristics of the victim. After that a weaponisation takes place (i.e. finding the right malicious  artefact to perform the infection). The delivery takes place by means of the time point the victim “bites  the bait”. Then an exploitation takes place in that the malicious artefact finds a vulnerability to be  exploited. Eventually, the malicious artefact perform an installation (i.e. malicious code) that may  establish a communication channel with the adversary (i.e. command and control) to obtain the final  actions on objectives.  Specificities/specialisations: A targeted attack may have many forms such as: spear phishing 269 ,  watering hole attack (see dedicated description below), port attack, etc. Several of these attacks may  be crafted to fit a particular sector270,271,272. Baits for targeted attacks may be based on hypes from  breaking news, political events, crises, conflicts etc.  Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of targeted attacks the following  information was found:  268 http://marcoramilli.blogspot.gr/2014/07/cyber-intelligence-abusing-internet.html, accessed November 2014.  269 http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/definitions/spear-  phishing?typnews=Social_media#.VGNAVaNBsnM, accessed November 2014.  270http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/targeted_attacks_against  _the_energy_sector.pdf, accessed November 2014.  271 http://www.securityweek.com/spear-phishing-hooked-businesses-big-and-small-2013-symantec-report, accessed  November 2014 (provides as a summary of Symantec threat report).  272 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-  leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html, accessed November 2014.  http://marcoramilli.blogspot.gr/2014/07/cyber-intelligence-abusing-internet.html http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/definitions/spear-phishing?typnews=Social_media#.VGNAVaNBsnM http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/definitions/spear-phishing?typnews=Social_media#.VGNAVaNBsnM http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/targeted_attacks_against_the_energy_sector.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/targeted_attacks_against_the_energy_sector.pdf http://www.securityweek.com/spear-phishing-hooked-businesses-big-and-small-2013-symantec-report http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/malware-research/2014/03/spear-phishing-the-news-cycle-apt-actors-leverage-interest-in-the-disappearance-of-malaysian-flight-mh-370.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  54   (Typical) Spear phishing attack273,274   Trend Alert campaign275   Targeted attack data exfiltration276   Targeted attack with dropper277  Involved adversaries: All kinds of adversaries can be involved in targeted attacks: cyber-criminals,  online social hackers, hacktivists, nation states, corporations, employees, cyber fighters, cyber  terrorists, script kiddies.  5.4 Drive-by-attacks  Description: In a drive-by-attack, the victim visits a manipulated legitimate web site/page/application.  Through the manipulation (i.e. injection) the victim’s browser is redirected to a maliciously prepared  site. It checks the victim’s browser vulnerabilities and installs silently malware that exploits the  discovered vulnerabilities. Other variations of drive-by-attacks use manipulated advertisements or  other third party components referenced by Widgets279. Some sources refer to drive-by-downloads  via viewing of an e-mails or pop-up 278 . Victims cannot visually recognise if a legitimate web  site/page/application is compromised. This makes visual detection of drive-by-attacks by users  impossible279,280,281.  Relation to kill-chain: Drive-by-attacks have all phases of a kill-chain, apart from reconnaissance.  Weaponisation happens via vulnerability scanning of victim’s browser. Delivery is performed via  downloaders, while exploitation takes place after the execution downloaded binaries282. According to  exploits found, the malware downloads corresponding malicious code (usually a Trojan) that takes  control of the victim’s device (i.e. performing the phases command and control and action on  objectives)280.  Specificities/specialisations: Variations of drive-by attacks do exist, depending on the way a redirect is  being implemented. Besides HTML manipulations, redirects can be implemented via manipulation of  widgets (e.g. referring to advertisements). Further variations concern vulnerabilities exploited.  Besides web browser, browser add-ons, operating system or third party applications may be exploited  (Silverlight, Flash283, PDF reader or video player).  273 http://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/safety/info_management/cyberattack.html, accessed November 2014.  274 http://about-  threats.trendmicro.com/RelatedThreats.aspx?language=tw&name=Anatomy%20of%20a%20Data%20Breach, accessed  November 2014.  275 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/05/targeted-attack-trend-alert-plugx-the-old-dog-with-a- new-trick.html, accessed November 2014.  276  http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/data-exfiltration-in-targeted-attacks/, accessed November  2014.  277 http://news.softpedia.com/news/RARSTONE-RAT-Used-in-Targeted-Attacks-Against-Asian-Organizations- 360843.shtml#sgal_0, accessed November 2014.  278 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download, accessed November 2014.  279 http://www.imperva.com/Resources/Glossary?term=drive_by_downloads, accessed November 2014.  280 http://blogs.sophos.com/2014/03/26/how-malware-works-anatomy-of-a-drive-by-download-web-attack-infographic/,  accessed November 2014.  281 http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2011/12/08/what-you-should-know-about-drive-by-download-attacks-part-1/,  accessed November 2014.  282 https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotbots07/tech/full_papers/provos/provos.pdf, accessed November 2014.  283 https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2014/08/shining-some-light-on-the-unknown-exploit-kit/, accessed  November 2014.  http://www.nec.com/en/global/solutions/safety/info_management/cyberattack.html http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/RelatedThreats.aspx?language=tw&name=Anatomy%20of%20a%20Data%20Breach http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/RelatedThreats.aspx?language=tw&name=Anatomy%20of%20a%20Data%20Breach http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/05/targeted-attack-trend-alert-plugx-the-old-dog-with-a-new-trick.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/cyber-exploits/2013/05/targeted-attack-trend-alert-plugx-the-old-dog-with-a-new-trick.html http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/data-exfiltration-in-targeted-attacks/ http://news.softpedia.com/news/RARSTONE-RAT-Used-in-Targeted-Attacks-Against-Asian-Organizations-360843.shtml#sgal_0 http://news.softpedia.com/news/RARSTONE-RAT-Used-in-Targeted-Attacks-Against-Asian-Organizations-360843.shtml#sgal_0 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-by_download http://www.imperva.com/Resources/Glossary?term=drive_by_downloads http://blogs.sophos.com/2014/03/26/how-malware-works-anatomy-of-a-drive-by-download-web-attack-infographic/ http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2011/12/08/what-you-should-know-about-drive-by-download-attacks-part-1/ https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotbots07/tech/full_papers/provos/provos.pdf https://blog.malwarebytes.org/exploits-2/2014/08/shining-some-light-on-the-unknown-exploit-kit/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  55  Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of drive-by downloads, the following  information was found (indicative):   Drive-by-attack (also referred to as web malware attack)284,285,286,287   Drive-by-attack (Darkleech malware) 288   Drive-by download (Flash file based)289   Drive-by download (JS_WEBSTAR)290   Drive-by download (Malvertising, DOUBLE CLICK Banner, advertisement)291,292,293  Involved adversaries: The following adversaries could run a drive-by attack: cyber-criminals,  hacktivists, nation states, corporations, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists.  5.5 Strategic web compromise (watering hole attack)  Description: The watering hole attack is based on the infection of a legitimate web site that is being  trusted/visited by a group of people that are under attack294. By visiting this compromised web site,  visitors will be infected. To this extent, watering hole attacks are drive-by attacks (see 5.4) for a narrow  group of victims. Watering hole attacks are also referred to as strategic web compromise (SWC)295.  This attack is supposed to be complementary to spear phishing or other forms of phishing (i.e. are  effective in case a group is resistant against such targeted attacks, see 5.3)296.  Relation to kill-chain: The difference between SWC attacks and drive-by attacks, is that SWC starts  with a reconnaissance in order to identify web sites that the target group uses/trusts. The rest  continues as a drive-by attack: weaponisation happens via vulnerability scanning of victim’s browser.  Delivery is performed via downloaders, while exploitation takes place after the execution downloaded  binaries. Subsequently, installed malware (usually Trojan or Remote Access Trojans – RAT) performs  phases command and control and action on objectives295.  Specificities/specialisations: Watering hole attacks are classified as targeted attacks (see 5.3). This is  because through proper selection of the infected web site, adversaries may launch their attack on a  specific group of users (e.g. developers, marketing, media teams etc.). The rest of the watering hole  attack takes place as a drive-by download.  284 http://www.microsoft.com/security/assets/images/_security/sir_v11/keyfindings/rg_section_7_4.jpg, accessed  November 2014.  285 http://sophos.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/webc2a0threatsc2a0infographic.pdf, accessed November 2014.  286 http://andyrussellcronin.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/drive-by-download-attack-example.png, accessed November  2014.  287 http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/the-invisible-drive-by-download-attack-I-attacker-infrastructure-how-  it-works.php, accessed November 2014.  288 http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/darkleech-1024x350.png, accessed November 2014.  289 http://blogs.cisco.com/security/far-east-targeted-by-drive-by, accessed November 2014.  290 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/dumpImages/294201051312.jpeg, accessed November 2014.  291http://blog.armorize.com/2010/12/hdd-plus-malware-spread-through.html, accessed November 2014.  292 http://securelist.com/blog/research/66415/gaps-in-corporate-network-security-ad-networks/, assessed November  2014.  293 http://www.invincea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Micro-Targeted-Malvertising-WP-10-27-14-1.pdf, accessed  November 2014.  294 http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101, accessed November  2014.  295http://www.crowdstrike.com/sites/all/themes/crowdstrike2/css/imgs/platform/CrowdStrike_Global_Threat_Report_20  13.pdf, accessed October 2014., accessed November 2014.  296 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_Hole, accessed November 2014.  http://www.microsoft.com/security/assets/images/_security/sir_v11/keyfindings/rg_section_7_4.jpg http://sophos.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/webc2a0threatsc2a0infographic.pdf http://andyrussellcronin.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/drive-by-download-attack-example.png http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/the-invisible-drive-by-download-attack-I-attacker-infrastructure-how-it-works.php http://www.proofpoint.com/threatinsight/posts/the-invisible-drive-by-download-attack-I-attacker-infrastructure-how-it-works.php http://www.techweekeurope.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/darkleech-1024x350.png http://blogs.cisco.com/security/far-east-targeted-by-drive-by http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/dumpImages/294201051312.jpeg http://blog.armorize.com/2010/12/hdd-plus-malware-spread-through.html http://securelist.com/blog/research/66415/gaps-in-corporate-network-security-ad-networks/ http://www.invincea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Micro-Targeted-Malvertising-WP-10-27-14-1.pdf http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/web-attack/137/watering-hole-101 http://www.crowdstrike.com/sites/all/themes/crowdstrike2/css/imgs/platform/CrowdStrike_Global_Threat_Report_2013.pdf http://www.crowdstrike.com/sites/all/themes/crowdstrike2/css/imgs/platform/CrowdStrike_Global_Threat_Report_2013.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_Hole  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  56  Existing representations overviews/resources: On attack vectors of SWC/watering hole attacks, the  following information was found (indicative):   Strategic Web Compromise Activity (references including few campaigns)295,297,298   Watering hole attack299,300,301,302   Watering hole attack against Space Foundation303  Involved adversaries: Adversaries of SWC are almost identical to drive-by attacks: cyber-criminals,  hacktivists, nation states, corporations, cyber fighters, cyber terrorists. However, incidents indicate a  stronger engagement of threat agents with espionage aims (i.e. nation states, corporations).  5.6 Advanced persistent threat (APT)  Description: Advanced persistent threats refer to narrowly targeted campaigns that are performed  from threat agents with high capabilities. Another characteristic of these attacks is their persistence:  they usually run over a very long time period (i.e. years/months)304. The high capabilities are usually  evidenced through a high degree of orchestration, use of advanced, specially crafted malware and  extensive knowledge on details of the victim. These attacks are characteristic for espionage activities.  This is due to the fact that the degree of capabilities demonstrated within such attacks can mainly be  attributed to teams with large resources for preparation, reconnaissance, programming, vulnerability  detection, computing power, etc. It is assumed that only state sponsored espionage can explain the  provision of such an amount of resources.  Relation to kill-chain: Due to their advancement, size and quality, APTs cover the all phases of kill- chain (reconnaissance, weaponisation, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control,  action on objectives). Given their impact and importance, APT attacks have been analysed in a very  detailed manner: the phases of APTs have been specified at a detail that goes beyond kill-chain  phases305,306,307,308.  Specificities/specialisations: APTs are also targeted attacks that are initiated by threat agents with high  capabilities. Main specificity of APT is the long duration of attacks. Another important characteristic is  the differentiation of APTs: by targeting a specific victim, APTs are quite different, especially regarding  the malware used. Hence, each APT campaigns might have unique peculiarities in the preparation and  297 http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-  dangerous-results/, accessed November 2014.  298 http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2014/02/operation-greedywonk-multiple-economic-and-  foreign-policy-sites-compromised-serving-up-flash-zero-day-exploit.html, accessed November 2014.  299 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/internet-explorer-zero-day-used-watering-hole-attack-qa, accessed  November 2014.  300 http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/de/webattack/137/Watering+Hole+101, accessed November 2014.  301 http://zappytech.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/watering-hole.png, accessed November 2014.  302 http://bvisible.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Watering-Hole-Infographic1.png, accessed November 2014.  303 http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/01/06/forgotten-watering-hole-attacks-on-space-foundation-and-rsf-chinese/,  accessed November 2014.  304 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat, accessed November 2014.  305 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#mediaviewer/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg,  accessed November 2014.  306 http://hackmageddon.com/2011/10/13/apts-and-security-information-management/, accessed November 2014.  307 http://piratehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Picture1.png, accessed November 2014.  308 http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-aptplan/index.html, accessed November 2014.  http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/ http://blog.shadowserver.org/2012/05/15/cyber-espionage-strategic-web-compromises-trusted-websites-serving-dangerous-results/ http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2014/02/operation-greedywonk-multiple-economic-and-foreign-policy-sites-compromised-serving-up-flash-zero-day-exploit.html http://www.fireeye.com/blog/technical/targeted-attack/2014/02/operation-greedywonk-multiple-economic-and-foreign-policy-sites-compromised-serving-up-flash-zero-day-exploit.html http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/internet-explorer-zero-day-used-watering-hole-attack-qa http://about-threats.trendmicro.com/de/webattack/137/Watering+Hole+101 http://zappytech.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/watering-hole.png http://bvisible.ie/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Watering-Hole-Infographic1.png http://eromang.zataz.com/2013/01/06/forgotten-watering-hole-attacks-on-space-foundation-and-rsf-chinese/ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#mediaviewer/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg http://hackmageddon.com/2011/10/13/apts-and-security-information-management/ http://piratehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Picture1.png http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-aptplan/index.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  57  execution of the attack309,310,311,312,313 (indicative list of recent APT campaigns). An interesting piece of  information found in the reporting period provides some evidence on the efficiency of existing APT  detection tools314.

The content  of this chapter constitutes the Emerging Threat Landscape. The information presented has been  assessed by the analysis of relevant material. Besides security issues, emerging technology areas have  been identified and the level of maturity with regard to cyber security has been assessed (e.g. in the  area of network virtualisation). Thus, threat trends in emerging technology areas have been either  directly mentioned in or have been implicitly assessed from the analysed material.  In the ETL 2014, some emerging areas from last year have been kept, while some new ones have been  introduced. This occurred as a reaction to technological developments that have been identified in  various application and technology areas in the reporting period. Moreover, focus shifts on emerging  issues in well-established areas, as for example Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) have been  reflected accordingly.  Besides establishing a connection between  the threat landscape and emerging areas, this chapter  identifies a number of security issues for each area that may be subject to security considerations in  the middle term (i.e. 2015). These issues regard highlights/conclusions/open problems that have come  to our attention during the analysis of material found and/or interactions with experts within and  outside ENISA. Although not exhaustive, these issues might constitute focal points for future ENISA  work. For example, identified issues from last year’s ETL have been taken into account within detailed  threat landscapes that have been developed for smart environments409 and internet infrastructure324.  Similarly, some of the areas that are covered in this chapter may be the subject of more detailed threat  assessments within 2015, depending on feedback from ENISA stakeholders (e.g. big data, network  virtualisation or specific applications of smart environments, such as smart cities).  In particular, the emerging technology areas considered in this ETL are:   Cyber Physical Systems: Cyber physical systems have been assessed as an emerging issue,  especially within Critical Infrastructure Protection. With the current developments in areas  relevant to CIP, it is important to understand the impact of engineered environments within the  protection of critical goods, while assuring interoperability. A lot of innovations are expected to  take place in this area in the future.   Mobile Computing: The increasing role of mobile devices in the next generation IT architectures,  but also the fact that they serve as a basis of technology convergence, makes them an important  component both for users but also for operators of application services. As such, mobile devices  are increasingly getting targeted by cyber-adversaries and this trend is going to keep up in the  future.   Cloud Computing: Being another important component of next generation IT, cloud computing is  a technology that will bother users and security experts in the future. New/innovative usage  models, attack scenarios and security control implementations will be in the focus of cyber-  community in the future.   Trust Infrastructure: Trust infrastructures and authentication infrastructures in particular are the  most vital components of cyber-security. In the reporting period we have seen a lot of attacks on  these components. These attacks result in dynamic changes, introduction of good practices and  even innovations. Trust infrastructure is thus an evergreen of emerging cyber-security areas.  324 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl, accessed December 2014.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/iitl  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  60   Big Data: Though not yet completely explored, big data in the focus of cyber security for two  reasons: firstly it is a valuable asset and as such is being targeted by cyber-attacks; secondly, it  turns to become a very powerful tool for security professionals, as it significantly contributes to  building intelligence about threats and incident management.   Internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments: While the growth of  interconnected devices continues, smart environments and smart systems emerge in many  sectors. Under this emerging area we consider all kinds of interconnected devices that build up a  smart system, such as smart homes, smart buildings, smart cars, etc. The importance of this sector  led ENISA to perform in 2014 a sector specific threat landscape in the area of smart homes and  converged media409.  It should be noted that the above areas are not completely independent or overlap free. Mobile  computing, for example may be part of smart environments and have overlaps with trust  infrastructures and cloud computing. Assessing threat trends according to those areas, however,  allows for a better establishment of the context of each threat and helps assessing threat trends and  security issues in that area. It is worth noticing that some predictions for 2015 that have been  developed around the end of the reporting period draw similar conclusions325,326.  In the following sections a short discussion with the highlights of each particular area is given prior to  the emerging threat and trends assessed. In addition to the emerging threats, for each area we provide  a number of important issues regarding developments/challenges in cyber-security that are seen as  relevant for the particular area. For each area, whenever applicable, the top 10 threats have been  assessed. It should be noted that these threat trends are usually not the result of detailed  assessments. This is because of the emerging nature of these areas. Hence, both the prioritisation and  assessed trends are an estimation and as such rather indicative for each particular area.  References to resources indicate the sources used for the assessment. With this information,  interested readers can have a deeper insight into the relevant matter.  6.1 Cyber Physical Systems as an emerging CIP issue  Cyber physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that interact with computing equipment being  seamlessly integrated to control, manage and optimize physical processes in a variety of areas from  traditional engineering science. Examples of such areas are power supply, medical  systems/healthcare, industrial systems and manufacturing, transportation, telecommunication and  many others327. Being at the interface to physical production, distribution and deployment processes,  CPS are vital for safety, resilience, security, adaptability, scalability. When combined with intelligent  functions, CPS will bring great advantages for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and is considered  as an emerging area that will have tremendous impact for innovation, availability of utilities and  efficiency of use. To this extend, this emerging area has been selected in this year’s ETL to reflect  challenges in critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP) by covering the link to physical world,  a source of impactful, yet difficult to manage security incidents.  Being at the transition point between physical and IT worlds, CPS will aim at illuminating the interplay  between information technology and engineering. A typical example is security vs. safety: in numerous  325 http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/threat-landscape-2014-and-beyond-symantec-and-norton-predictions-2015-  asia-pacific-japan, accessed December 2014.  326 http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/mcafee-lab-report-previews-2015-developments-exploits-evasion/, accessed  December 2014.  327 http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14542/nsf14542.htm, accessed November 2014.  http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/threat-landscape-2014-and-beyond-symantec-and-norton-predictions-2015-asia-pacific-japan http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/threat-landscape-2014-and-beyond-symantec-and-norton-predictions-2015-asia-pacific-japan http://www.informationsecuritybuzz.com/mcafee-lab-report-previews-2015-developments-exploits-evasion/ http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14542/nsf14542.htm  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  61  discussions, for example in the area of Smart Grids, experts have debated about how safety issues,  long matured in the engineering area, can be adopted/supported/reflected in security controls and  vice versa. CPS seems a promising area that will facilitate transition between engineering and  information technology, thus eliminating deficiencies stemming from (quite natural) mutual  knowledge gaps between these disciplines.  In the consumer area, an important role in the interconnection of IT and physical worlds is attributed  to internet of things and smart environments. In the industrial/engineering sector this role is  attributed to Smart Grids and SCADA systems. This emerges from the necessity to efficiently  manage/assist human life and achieve more efficient energy management and manufacturing  processes. The developments in these areas have been dictated from strong market needs that can  be saturated with the adoption of IT tools. Soon, other areas of interconnection between physical and  IT world will achieve market maturity.  Top (preliminary328) emerging threats to CPS are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1. Malicious code: Worms/Trojans   2. Web based attacks   3. Spam (as instrument to infect IT and affect CPS)   4. Phishing (as instrument to infect IT and affect CPS)   5.

Information leakage   Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 4: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of cyber physical systems  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:  328 Assessed threats for this area are assumed by extrapolating threat landscapes of IoT, Smart Grid and SCADA, as initial CPS  areas that have received attention from the cyber-security community. Due to the early stages of action in this area,  these threats are rather indicative and of possibly restricted scope in comparison to the width and depth of this area.  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  62   Both in the US and in Europe the area of CPS has received considerable attention. Initial material  towards strategies, innovation actions and research are in place327,329,330,331,332,333,334. Taking into  account advancements in engineering sciences and activities within the EU, one might argue that  CPS can be a favourable area for the creation of competitive advantages for European industry  and research. To this extent, CPS is a distinct opportunity for Europe that should continue  receiving the necessary attention from industry, academia and policy. The main focus should be  on breaking silos and enabling the creation of proper grounds for the necessary interdisciplinary  cooperation. Information found on the advancement of relevant activities leave the impression  that the US is slightly ahead with regard to this area335, as compared to EU at least at the  coordination level. Though this might be quite natural (one country vs. many Member States),  this does not mean that individual EU-Member States (e.g. Germany) are not in a more advanced  stage in CPS336.   Taking a look at cyber security and CPS in performed/announced international events337,338 one  can identify the following areas of interest/state-of-the-art that are indicative for upcoming  developments (non-prioritized list): authentication and access control for CPS, availability,  recovery and auditing for CPS, key management in CPS, legacy CPS system protection, lightweight  crypto and security, vulnerability analysis for CPS, threat modelling for CPS, wireless sensor  network security, intrusion detection for CPS, adaptive attack mitigation for CPS, trusted-  computing in CPS, forensics for CPS. It is worth mentioning, the fact that these events are among  the first organised in the area of CPS is indicative for the initial maturity of the entire topic.   Although CPS is a rather new topic, this does not mean that in particular areas no progress is  being achieved. The issue here is that this progress happens on a sector-by-sector basis, e.g. smart  grids, smart homes, internet of things, smart vehicles, etc. This leads to a segmentation of the  sectors and leads to a reduced interoperability among these sectors, a matter that is of great  importance given the increased convergence, brought for example by technologies like mobile  and cloud computing.   The absence of common architectures and interfaces bears segmentation risks and thus market  failure risk. Functional isolation of developed solutions with regard to an inevitable convergence  becomes evident when looking at currently independent sectors that are necessary to create user  centric experience. An example is the area of e-health: home care, assisted living, pharmaceutical,  hospital systems and healthcare are still individual sectors, yet necessary to deliver a holistic  service to ageing citizens.

The more interconnected devices are deployed, the more content and  control is going to converge by means of mobile devices and platforms. Being a basic component of  the mobile and interconnected ecosystem, mobile devices will continue to be the targets of cyber- criminals. It is expected that mobile device evolution rates will match the evolution rates of malicious  activities being observed in the reporting period340.  Following increases of threat sophistication, both interfaces and internal functions of mobile devices  will be abused. But the main future trend will remain the abuse of mobile devices with respect to the  entire mobile ecosystem, including cloud storage, app APIs, app internals (processed data and binary  code 341 ), abuse of vetting processes, stealth attacks, etc. The trend of migrating all malicious  techniques from PC to mobile will continue, whereas attack specially crafted for mobile devices will  show up. Such attacks have been impressively demonstrated by researchers342,343.  Top emerging threats to mobile computing are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Botnets   Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 5: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Mobile Computing  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   Malware infection vectors that evade protection (i.e. sandbox) are for quite some time in the  wild345. Yet, vicious mobile infection vectors are making their debut. Examples are: “implanting”  vulnerabilities into a mobile device through rogue applications346; abusing synchronisation of  mobile device with PC347,348; spread of malware that is tracking gestures349; misusing available  functions to control the mobile device350, abuse of loss protection controls351, etc. Combined with  advances that of general malware, these methods may deliver significant incidents in mobile  devices, and not only: mobile devices are often the door to connected services such as cloud  storage352.   The announced introduction of NFC-based payments via mobile devices will revive the payment  market. Given a better penetration of mobile payments, cybercriminals are going to be target the  payment platforms, eventually using attack scenarios from e-commerce and transaction based  economy353,354. It should not be a surprise to surface attacks that are attempt tampering of  hardware, but also available authentication functions.   Mobile security controls –both implementations and operation - need to reach the maturity of  existing security controls for other non-mobile platforms. Moreover, they need to span limits of  components of the mobile computing architecture and to seamlessly interoperate without  introducing any security gaps 355 . Operators of mobile infrastructures and users need to  understand and properly deploy them.   Secure development of mobile apps moves again into the focus356.

Besides secure app application and architecture practices, reuse of code  libraries, and binary code protection will be two areas that will need to be further developed.  Such advancements will reduce the attack surface for the leakage and identity theft threats.  Finally, secure usage of identification and authentication and access control covering as much  components as possible will increase data protection and data privacy in mobile environments.  6.3 Cloud Computing  Adoption of cloud computing solutions continues to grow. Trends identified in 2014 show that cloud  plays a key role in next generation IT358,359. As indicated within this ETL report, mobile devices, cloud  storage and Bring Your Own Device approaches are be the main components in the IT paradigm shift  currently taking place358. Nonetheless, cloud computing has been massively put under pressure due  to Snowden revelations, in particular regarding data protection issues of stored information360. Both  state-sponsored surveillance and cyber-threat landscape regarding major components of the  emerging next generation IT have impacted technology decisions 361 . As a result, a significant  slowdown in the technology adoption with regard to next generation IT has been assessed. Moreover,  it is estimated that these developments may cost cloud providers significant amounts362. But also  policy has reacted on these developments: European Commission has created a framework to debate  on issue of cloud computing, thus opting for updated strategies and requirements, in particular for  public sector by means of the Digital Agenda363.  Another concern regarding could computing is related to the complexity, flexibility and level of  adoption for businesses. Inherent complexity of cloud computing, together with concerns about data  protection, compliance, continuity 364  and insider threat in particular, are sources of additional  concerns365. In particular, the management of such a massive chunk of infrastructure in a concentrated  manner is a new challenge for users: possibility of human errors, misconfiguration and even insider  threats pose significant risks to organisation366.  Last but not least, just as businesses, cybercriminals have also recognised the advantages of cloud  computing. Cost issues, better camouflage of malicious activities on legitimate sites and performance  issues are key points for this 367 . It should be expected that this trend will continue beyond the  reporting period and cloud providers would need to provide security controls and guide customers to  develop their security strategies in accordingly.

Multi-cloud strategies emerge from the need of agility, control (both technical  and costs), data protection, performance, compliance, etc370. Implementation of multiple cloud  strategies (also referred to as hybrid cloud), may require adaptation of network access to cloud  providers and interoperability. In both cases, security controls of the organisation has to be  optimised, also integrating security measures of the various providers (both cloud and network).   Data breaches and surveillance are a major concern for decision makers in order to launch cloud  based solutions. Complexity, performance and control are further issues to be surfaced. In  remains to be seen how cloud provider and customers are going to master these challenges in  order to address business concerns regarding reduced control over cloud computing, security and  mobility. In particular given the fact that these technologies, may be vulnerable due to potential  weak links in the supply chain371. Emerging security solutions including anonymity in the cloud372  368 http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-  the-evolving-state-of-cloud, accessed November 2014.  369 http://blog.equinix.com/2014/07/multicloud-management-strategies-the-hybrid-cloud-is-a-reality/, accessed  November 2014.  370 http://www.eweek.com/cloud/slideshows/developing-a-multi-cloud-strategy-10-factors-to-consider.html, accessed  November 2014.  371 http://www.cisco.com/web/offer/gist_ty2_asset/Cisco_2014_ASR.pdf, accessed October 2014.  372 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6732964, accessed November 2014.  http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-the-evolving-state-of-cloud http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/whitepaper/alert-logic-cloud-security-report-spring-2014-research-on-the-evolving-state-of-cloud http://blog.equinix.com/2014/07/multicloud-management-strategies-the-hybrid-cloud-is-a-reality/ http://www.eweek.com/cloud/slideshows/developing-a-multi-cloud-strategy-10-factors-to-consider.html http://www.cisco.com/web/offer/gist_ty2_asset/Cisco_2014_ASR.pdf http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?reload=true&arnumber=6732964  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  67  and uptake of encryption practices373,374 are still subject of discussions and will be of concern to  the community in the middle term. Finally, increased transparency and reduction of complexity  in management of cloud resources will be a matter of concert, together with identity and access  management/governance366.   Collected statistics regarding posture of cloud users regarding awareness of data protection360  issues have shown that: some 50% are demonstrating an increased interest about location of  data storage; ca. 55% have increased diligence regarding cloud activities/projects; some 50%  have lost trust to public cloud services; while over 30% are changing procurement requirements  and conditions with regard to could services.   Unfortunately, for the same reasons as for legitimate users, cloud is an attractive platform for a  variety of cyber-threat agents367,375. It provides a number of advantages that are serving malicious  intent, including ease of site development to accommodate infection vectors, by at the same time  evading IP blocking due to trusted origin (i.e. IPs of major cloud providers). Moreover, the  inherent mobility of storage/applications to different clouds, adds another level of difficulty for  defenders to locate and block malicious content. It is expected that through the use of encryption  and anonymity, additional evasion mechanisms will be developed to abuse the cloud.  6.4 Trust infrastructures  With the term trust infrastructure we refer to systems, components, functions and data that  implement security functions used to establish trust in the communication between systems and  between systems and users. Examples of such functions are encryption, electronic signatures,  challenge/response processes, etc. Trust infrastructure aims at the secure provision of these  functions, the secure operation of involved components and secure storage of secret information.  Proper functioning of trust infrastructures is key for the security in all kinds of electronic transactions,  including the Internet. Consequently, any form of compromise or breach of such functions and data  are a serious incident for digital trust.  In this reporting period we have seen serious incidents related to SSL (both OpenSSL and MS-TLS) a  key component of the internet trust infrastructure376,377,378. Moreover, attempts to abuse tolerant  requirements for purchasing SSL security certificates 379  and compromise the certificate  infrastructure380 have been detected. Besides SSL and certificate infrastructure, voices regarding the  security level PGP have been raised 381 . All this is a warning on the trust level resulting current  encryption, authentication and signing in the internet and e-mail communication.

This will become  important within the upcoming web of trust needed for Internet of Things, smart environments,  payment, etc.  Top emerging threats to trust infrastructure are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1. Web based attacks   2. Phishing (67% of cyber espionage campaigns start with a phishing attack382)   3. Malware: Worms/Trojans    4. Web application attacks: Code Injection   5.

Cyber espionage   Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 7: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of trust infrastructure  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   Trust infrastructure is an area that is horizontal to many other emerging areas, in particular the  ones covered in this chapter (i.e. mobile computing, Internet of Things, could computing, network  virtualisation and cyber physical systems). As such, security of all other areas is highly dependent  on trust infrastructures. Having such a central role in the chain of trust, it is evident that trust  infrastructure will be a premium target for cyber-criminals. Hence, further leakage threats, abuse  of trust between machines and users will be on the agenda of adversaries for the coming period.   While encryption and anonymity seem to be the solution383 for the observed reduction of trust  in the internet communication and services, at least in the reporting period they have been rather  the problem. We have seen an impressive erosion of basic security functions in this year, targeting  both encryption377,378,379 and potentially anonymisation functions384,385.  382 http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/, accessed October 2014.  383 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29781/social-networks/facebook-tor-hidden-service.html, accessed November  2014.  384 https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous, accessed November 2014.  385 http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html, accessed November 2014.  http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/ http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/29781/social-networks/facebook-tor-hidden-service.html https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/30202/hacking/tor-traffic-analysis-attack.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  69   Authentication models and in particular their technical implementations will need to be revisited.  Based on existing good practices (i.e. financial sector386), requirements for increasing the security  level of authentication functions might be considered. The wider adoption of two factor  authentication, as introduced by leading IT-companies387,388 is going to increase trust in existing  authentication schemes. The consideration of non-repudiation schemes should also been taken  into account.   E-Mail encryption will need to be revisited. Existing encryption based on PGP receives a lot of fair  criticism, mainly pointing out the need for modernisation of the used principles and available  implementations389 . Despite or even because of pending adoption of PGP by Google 390  and  Yahoo 391 , some discussion regarding the future potential of this standard after a mass  deployment will serve the intended purpose.   Internet of things and network virtualisation functions will bring big challenges in the  establishment of trust between users and devices and among devices 392 . Risks related to  interconnected identities will be in the focus, as interconnected devices will share data on behalf  of users (i.e. implemented within the environments via chains of possibly interoperating mutually  trusted identities). The attack potential to identities will rise, together with the potential impact  of successful attacks.   Attacks on authentication functions and open source functions will persist. Attacks to  authentication functions hold the second position in OWASP top 10 risks list393. Regarding open  source functions, as a lesson learned from Heartbleed attack, industry has formed the Core  Infrastructure Initiative (CII)394 that aims at taking care of open source code that is essential for  computing (including security and trust functions). The aim of this organisation is to support the  open source developer community with funding, thus achieving higher more security awareness  and reduce the chances of bugs being introduced in the first place.  6.5 Big Data  In ETL 2013, big data has been addressed as an emerging technology, mainly from the business point  of view and its future role as potential valuable asset. While this expectation for big data is still valid,  in the reporting period this threat landscape, the cyber-security community has been focusing on the  386http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2s/progress/pdf/tg/crg/crg24/t2s_0466_bfd.pdf??ac7a536fed2f1643c5e52ac556e30  61e, accessed November 2014.  387 https://www.google.com/landing/2step/, accessed November 2014.  388 http://www.zdnet.com/tutorial-facebook-2-factor-authentication-step-by-step-7000028372/, accessed November  2014.  389 http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/whats-matter-with-pgp.html, accessed November 2014.  390 http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.gr/2014/06/making-end-to-end-encryption-easier-to.html, accessed November  2014.  391 http://www.pcworld.com/article/2462852/yahoo-mail-to-support-end-to-end-pgp-encryption-by-2015.html, accessed  November 2014.  392 http://www.nist.gov/nstic/gp-interoperability.html, accessed November 2014.  393 https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management, accessed  November 2014.  394 http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/core-infrastructure-initiative, accessed November 2014.  http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2s/progress/pdf/tg/crg/crg24/t2s_0466_bfd.pdf??ac7a536fed2f1643c5e52ac556e3061e http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2s/progress/pdf/tg/crg/crg24/t2s_0466_bfd.pdf??ac7a536fed2f1643c5e52ac556e3061e https://www.google.com/landing/2step/ http://www.zdnet.com/tutorial-facebook-2-factor-authentication-step-by-step-7000028372/ http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/whats-matter-with-pgp.html http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.gr/2014/06/making-end-to-end-encryption-easier-to.html http://www.pcworld.com/article/2462852/yahoo-mail-to-support-end-to-end-pgp-encryption-by-2015.html http://www.nist.gov/nstic/gp-interoperability.html https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A2-Broken_Authentication_and_Session_Management http://www.linuxfoundation.org/programs/core-infrastructure-initiative  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  70  practical use of big data as a tool to build threat intelligence395,396,404. Several approaches and tools  performing data analytics based on massive log and network traffic information have been released  and took up an important role within Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)397. This  development has turned SIEM approaches into powerful tools398.  Notwithstanding the fact that currently the cyber security community views big data as a useful tool  rather than a risk, big data growth is still being considered as a risk factor399, especially given the  upwards trend of data breach threat. After NSA revelations, the cyber-security community has realized  that big data are at risk: one should consider raw data collected in a big style by national security  agencies without establishing a proper transparency in their investigation activities.  Preparatory activities with regard to relevant regulation in the US have focused on big data by  underlying its important role for society, but also stating risks to privacy and self-determination that  are connected to this asset and related technologies400. Similar activities have been in the reporting  period within the European Commission401,402. This is a very positive development, as this may help  governmental/legal action to catch up in this area, being currently behind technological  developments.

Operating such a tool, however, will require significant skills in threat information collection,  building up and maintaining threat intelligence and disseminating this information to relevant  players within the organisation. Hence, the entire-lifecycle of SIEM might be quite expensive,  while requiring adaptation of existing processes. Due to complexity and costs, it is very likely that  smaller companies (i.e. SMEs) will not be in the position to afford such solutions.   It is predicted that big data based SIEM technologies will be part of organisations defence  strategy, growing form 8% currently to 25% in 2016395. Admittedly, current uptake of big data  based security analytics is at an early phases of adoption and so is big data in general400. A few  years will be required to understand technical and organisational exploitation of big data in  general and in SIEM in particular. Current experience of early adopters of big data based SIEM  are very positive, reporting advances in threat intelligence used to operate risk-based security  controls365.   A survey365 about use of big data in SIEM has shown that surveyed participants are concerned  about protection of big data holding sensitive information (69%). 60% of participants were  concerned violating data privacy by mixing data from different geographic areas; and ca 59% see  data loss risks from wide distribution of big data. Moreover, in order to find relevant information  among big amounts of data, top five use cases have been identified404: 1. Successful exploration  of big data to understand it within decision making; 2. Holistic customer view by combining  internal and external data; 3. Creation of security/intelligence context to achieve risk based  protection in real time; 4. Achieve operational efficiency by analysing wide variety of data; and 5.  Augment big data with traditional data warehouse capabilities.   Within discussions with the ENISA ETL Stakeholder Group it has been identified that a challenge  is to master the size of big data in order to timely spot threat patterns and achieve near-time  responses. Another issue of concern regards data discovery: a very large amount of it contains  information about already available intelligence. The challenge is to discover the parts that are  related to new/unknown patterns that can attributed to malicious activities.   Some additional interesting issues assessed within the reporting period with regard to big data  are:  - Smart environments will significantly contribute to production of big data. This kind of data  will have high value, as it contains intimate life logging information of smart home users.  Potential of misuse of this information by companies, adversaries and surveillance activities  is a rather obvious conclusion.  - While currently big data based SIEM use log, alert and incident information, it is expected  that additional data will be included, such as configuration information, audit trails, web  information, dark web information, etc. (an interesting visualisation can be found in404 by  404 http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-  bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=W GW03020USEN.PDF, accessed November 2014.  http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=WGW03020USEN.PDF http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=WGW03020USEN.PDF http://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?subtype=WH&infotype=SA&appname=SWGE_WG_WG_USEN&htmlfid=WGW03020USEN&attachment=WGW03020USEN.PDF  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  72  means of a big data iceberg). Similar approaches are available within own developments of  organisations and go currently through initial maturity steps.  6.6 Internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments  Both the proliferation of mobile computing (see section 6.1) and the silent, yet considerable increase  of interconnected things (i.e. Internet of Things)405 pose challenges for cyber security. In particular  interconnected devices from areas such as smart home, smart cities, smart vehicles406, will exchange  information that has high privacy/intimacy relevance. Moreover, functions available and data  exchanged, when abused, may even impact human life 407 , 408 . Given the complexity behind  environments that take advantage of or are controlled by interconnected devices, security, trust and  privacy issues are of major importance and pull the attention of end-users, industry, governments but  also media.  Due to application scenarios implemented via interconnected devices in all relevant areas, the  network of interconnected things is going to be dynamically shaped. That is, things will join and leave  the network, different levels of trust will be maintained and various levels of information  confidentiality need to be supported. The negotiating mode of interaction is a complex issue per se.  By considering the existence of malicious motives in this interaction, it becomes apparent that attack  potential grows and that prevention will be a great challenge. Let alone that security functions  supported are rudimentary, yet immature. As an additional dimension to the technical one, one  should calculate the immense potential that social engineering attacks may have. Information from  private/intimate environments smart environments would turn a phishing message to a powerful  attack that is difficult to defend405,407. Due to the importance of this area for cyber security, in the  reporting period ENISA has performed a dedicated threat assessment by means of a threat landscape  for of smart homes and converged media409.

Denial of Service   Legend:  Declining,  Stable,  Increasing  Table 9: Emerging threats and their trends in the area of Internet of things/interconnected devices/smart environments  Besides the above emerging threat landscape, the following issues have been identified:   Internet of thinks and smart environments in particular consist of an increased number of  interconnected sensors and devices. The increased number of interlinked functions and activity  logs present and active will be a source of close, granular and intimate data on the activities and  behaviour of inhabitants and visitors. Hence, when approaching or even connecting to such  networks, emitted “data noise” from those devices may provide potential attack surface that can  be misused in a great variety (e.g. phishing410, misuse of trust, manipulation of information405,  denial of service411, etc.). Moreover, due to the fact that smart environments are tightly related  to personal consumption profiles, it is expected that they will be in the focus of  individualized/targeted marketing and sales campaigns412.   The smart home is a point of intense contact between networked information technology and  physical space. This will create new yet unknown threat and vulnerability models that are result  of bringing together both the virtual and physical contexts. An example is the existence of assisted  living for ageing population: through the ability to track movements into the home or city  environment, this user group might be vulnerable to physical attacks 413. Let alone attacks to  medical records that are in general in the rise, due to their potential in fraudulent activities414.   The user interaction within smart environments will converge logically415. As regards the device  to manage converged information, this will probably be a mobile device or TV-set. In both cases,  these devices will attract the interest of adversaries. Having already sufficient cyber-threat  capabilities for mobile devices (see also section 6.2), adversaries will be in the position to  successfully attack important control functions of smart environments416. Given the fact that  410 http://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/internet-of-things-cyberattack, accessed November 2014.  411 http://www.mostafafouda.com/Pub/Conf/2010.ICCES%2710.pdf, accessed November 2014.  412 http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2347810/smart-homes-a-new-marketing-paradigm, accessed November 2014.  413 http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126m, accessed November 2014.  414 http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-  2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf, accessed October 2014.  415 http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127614-first-ios-in-the-car-integration-to-come-next-week-ferrari-volvo-and-  mercedes, accessed November 2014.  416 http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Hackers+show+auto+industry+trade+secrets/10425446/story.html, accessed  December 2014.  http://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/internet-of-things-cyberattack http://www.mostafafouda.com/Pub/Conf/2010.ICCES%2710.pdf http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2347810/smart-homes-a-new-marketing-paradigm http://www.igi-global.com/chapter/wireless-technologies-ambient-assisted-living/47126m http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-january-december-2013/sentinel-cy2013.pdf http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127614-first-ios-in-the-car-integration-to-come-next-week-ferrari-volvo-and-mercedes http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/127614-first-ios-in-the-car-integration-to-come-next-week-ferrari-volvo-and-mercedes http://www.leaderpost.com/life/Hackers+show+auto+industry+trade+secrets/10425446/story.html  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  74  logical convergence of technology will happen via a variety of interfaces, intercepting data traffic  will be yet another attack vector417,418.   Given economic factors in the development and manufacturing of internet of things components,  weak implementation of security controls will be encountered419. Moreover, given the untested  interplay of components of different classes and of different manufacturers, the effectiveness of  existing security controls is uncertain. Certification certifications of devices with regard to the  basis security characteristics - similar to the ones existing in the area of electrical, low voltage  equipment420 - might need to be developed in the middle term. Existing documents regarding  certification of smart environments are either outdated or cover particular segments of the entire  environments (e.g. CENELEC421, IEC422).   Current published ENISA incident statistic from the area of telecommunication, shows that ca.  20% of outages of professionally operated networks are caused by human errors 423  (e.g  configuration mistakes). This is indicative for the role of humans in the configuration and  operation of complex systems. Yet not being as complex as professional networks,  interconnected devices and smart environment will constitute a significant challenge  unexperienced users controlling them. Hence humans will remain the weakest link also within  smart, interconnected environments405.   A further interesting issue within interconnected devices and smart environments is the  possibility of conflicting interests among asset owners of the environment. For example, media  content owners may view occupants’ attempts to access licensed media content through  alternate channels as a threat to their assets, whilst occupants may interpret digital rights  management measures as barriers preventing them from accessing their assets. Different service  providers and technology vendors may be in competition with each other for both bandwidth  and data. Further conflicts may arise in cases of conflicts among owner and occupant: in cases of  disputes, for example, occupants may have an interest in breaching privacy of owner; occupants  may lock access to home appliances after leaving the house. Similar conflicts may arise within  neighbourhoods. In such situations, additional threat agents to smart environments may emerge,  whose motives and capabilities are difficult to foresee.  6.7 Network Virtualisation and Software Defined Networks  Network virtualisation (NV) is a technology based on combination of network hardware with software  into a single virtualized system, i.e. a virtual network. Virtual networks are administered via a single  software and offer network resource virtualisation 424 , 425 .

While the former  aims at the creation of virtual networks based on a number of physical networks (LANs), the latter  supports emulating a network system with software. External virtualisation is mainly an administrative  function that allows the creation of virtual networks (VLANs) out of a number of physical networks.  Internal virtualisation is used to optimise efficiency of resources. Software defined networks (SDN)  come to build upon network virtualisation: while network virtualisation created virtual networks,  software defined networks come to perform changes to virtual networks according to user  needs426,427,428.  In a similar fashion to the virtualisation of computing through could, network virtualisation and SDN  are the enablers for the development of a business model called network-as-a-service (NaaS)429.  Hence virtualisation of network and SDN will be put at a similar basis to could computing, where  network configuration and usage will be offered as an on-demand service. Combined with virtualized  computing, NV and SDN will offer a perfect model for cost reduction and elasticity. While some argue  that network virtualisation and SDN will bring advances to network security430, there are concerns  about security issues of such a virtual infrastructure431,432. All in all, one should note that security  analysis (threat, risk assessment) of NV and SDN is still in early phases and standards and products are  at early maturity stages. This is a reason for considering NV and SDN as an emerging security area.  Top (preliminary433) emerging threats to CPS are:  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  1.

Due to the  early stages of action in this area, these threats are rather indicative. More thorough assessments in those areas will  need to be performed.  http://www.networkworld.com/article/2174268/tech-primers/understanding-the-differences-between-software-defined-networking-network-virtualizati.html http://www.networkworld.com/article/2174268/tech-primers/understanding-the-differences-between-software-defined-networking-network-virtualizati.html https://www.opennetworking.org/images/stories/downloads/sdn-resources/solution-briefs/sb-sdn-nvf-solution.pdf http://www.storagecraft.com/blog/network-virtualization-security-benefits-risks-best-practices/ http://www.cloudcomputingadmin.com/articles-tutorials/naas/naas-future-networking-cloud-based.html http://www.networkworld.com/article/2606388/virtualization/how-network-virtualization-is-used-as-a-security-tool.html http://www.networkworld.com/article/2606388/virtualization/how-network-virtualization-is-used-as-a-security-tool.html http://searchsdn.techtarget.com/news/2240214438/SDN-security-issues-How-secure-is-the-SDN-stack https://www.sdncentral.com/security-challenges-sdn-software-defined-networks/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  76  Emerging Threat Threat Trend  8.

As such, these components are single point of failure. Having the entire intelligence  of the network concentrated at one position, failures may affect the entire network. Hence,  denial of service attacks on a variety of underlying network components may affect the central  control functions (e.g. through coupling over data exchange with network switches). Besides  direct DoS attacks to the central control panel, flooding attacks may have similar failure effects434.   NV and SDN have taken care of security issues. However, the prevailing standard OpenFlow has  not been developed with the “security by design” principle. Moreover, due to the complexity of  the environment and multiplicity of supported devices, vulnerabilities found in network hard- and  software may impact availability and functionality of the entire environment. Given the existing  variety of vulnerabilities/attacks for network hardware435 and software (references taken just as  examples) 436 , 437 , it is evident that careful selection and maintenance of network soft- and  hardware are key for the security of the environment.   NV and SDN technologies are a promise towards quality of service, performance and facilitation  of network management. Yet, both existing standards and released technology are at early stages  of adoption and maturity; they still include a lot of vendor own product philosophy and  specificities. It remains to be seen what the uptake of this technology will be, what are going to  be the prevailing business models and what kind of vulnerabilities, attack vectors and security  issues in general will be surfaced. At the time being, the need for more detailed security  assessments for this technology is rather evident.   Although NV and SDN will bring new exploitation potential for network functions, they are also  going to facilitate implementation of a number of important network security functions430: firstly,  centralisation of control will increase coherency of management activities; virtual firewalling will  allow for a better protection of network and application assets; more flexible packet filtering  techniques will be implementable, for example regarding DDoS attack detection and mitigation;  434 http://www.nil.com/2014/watch-the-presentation-security-and-sdn-a-perfect-fit-or-oil-and-water/, accessed  November 2014.  435 http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article38485.htm, accessed November 2014.  436 http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/advisories/HPNetworkingSecurityAdvisory-OpenSSL-HeartbleedVulnerability.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  437 http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-nat, accessed November  2014.  http://www.nil.com/2014/watch-the-presentation-security-and-sdn-a-perfect-fit-or-oil-and-water/ http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article38485.htm http://h17007.www1.hp.com/docs/advisories/HPNetworkingSecurityAdvisory-OpenSSL-HeartbleedVulnerability.pdf http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-nat  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  77  IDS and IPS can be configured and operated in a more efficient way.

These points constitute highlights and are thought of as  potentially interesting points for individuals/organisations that are engaged in threat analysis/threat  intelligence. These points are divided in two categories:   Lessons from the performance of ETL process within ENISA: These are points regarding our internal  information collection and analysis exercise. This list might contain interesting points for  stakeholders performing threat analysis or consuming threat information; and   Lessons learned from the analysed content: These are points regarding conclusions drawn from  collected and analysed content. This information might be interesting for any stakeholder from  the target group of this report.  Lessons from the ETL process:   The “publicity” of threat information in related media is quite high. Threat landscape reports are  important elements in the cyber-security community. Information on cyber-threats are quickly  taken up by media. The number of publications has significantly increased in the reporting  period. In the future it will be necessary to establish cooperation (consolidate efforts) among  various players in the field to avoid duplication of work and increase quality of assessments438.   Tools and methods to support the collection and analysis process depend on the level of  detail/quality of the threat assessment. Tool landscapes for strategic, tactical and operational  information differ. Currently available tools are oriented towards collection of operational  information. It is important to understand level and structure of threat information and set up  environment, processes and tools accordingly.   As the amount of threat information grows, it is important for the collection process to:  - Find a simple classification scheme for identified resources. This may contain information on  focus/scope, role of information assessor, kind of input and output data, etc.  - Maintain some tools to locate and store this kind of information in an (semi-) automated  manner (i.e. scanning information, storing relevant information in a structured way).   Given the fact that an increasing number of projects/activities cope with cyber threats, the  creation of a taxonomy for cyber-threats would facilitate at least internal communication and  would establish a common denominator throughout all relevant efforts. Such a taxonomy would  be an important point of consolidation of acquired knowledge.   It is very important to understand what the counterparts of threat information are, what user  needs it can serve, and how this information can be disseminated to the various stakeholder  groups. A proper dissemination strategy needs to be developed.   The state of maturity of various concepts and approaches followed can be characterized as  initial. Triggering the dialogue among threat collection organisations is very important as it  438 http://www.societalsecurity.eu/uploads/Articles/2014_Boin%20Ekengren%20Rhinard_Sensemaking_FHS%20Book.pdf,  accessed November 2014.  http://www.societalsecurity.eu/uploads/Articles/2014_Boin%20Ekengren%20Rhinard_Sensemaking_FHS%20Book.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  80  would lead to cross-fertilisation of ideas and will lead to a common understanding with regard to  emerging issues for threat analysis.   It would be important to elaborate on methods to classify importance of threats based on some  prioritisation criteria. These should be based on impact, sector, detections, reported incidents,  etc. Information collection could then be facilitated according to the importance criteria at  scope. Similar exercises for the identification of threat trends might also be of use in building  threat intelligence.  Lessons from the analysed content:   Sloppiness with cyber-security continues to be number one reason for breaches (over 50%). This  is a finding for the third year in sequence and should be an alarming signal for all stakeholders  involved in cyber-security.   Threat analyses and assessments performed by various vendors/organisation should state more  clearly the scope of the assessment. This would facilitate the understanding of the assessed  information and would facilitate usage of the material.   Threat analysis and achieved results are rather complex. Ways to transfer this complex  knowledge to less skilled stakeholders is key to a better uptake of produced results. In other  words, cyber-security community could mitigate “sloppiness” by playing their role in the  education knowledge transfer chain.   Information collection from the dark net could be interesting. Knowing that some stakeholders  are performing this kind of information collection, it would be useful for the entire stakeholder  community to communicate information found more directly.   It is difficult to compile collected information to cover the entire causal chain of:  Threat Agent->Attack vector->Cyber threat->Asset->Vulnerability->Damage. This information is  very useful for end-users of threat information/threat intelligence.   Good practices on agile SIEM methods will be very important for “consumers” of threat  intelligence (i.e. use of big data). Moreover, it is important to understand the role cyber-threat  and the resulting cyber-risks within a security management process439. It might be interesting to  elaborate on such issues both at the level of vendors and standardisation bodies.   Both quality and quantity of collected information has significantly increased in the reporting  period. This is a very positive development that has as a result better threat assessment and the  availability of more detailed material to be used by end-users. The increase in quantity,  however, has to be effectively surfaces during information collection, e.g. by the adoption of  more systematic information collection practices (see also related point in process lessons  above).   ETL self-test: In the reporting period we were in the position to “test” own and other predictions  made in 2013. The comparison has been made within ETL 20137. We have found out that the  majority of predictions – both by means of emerging trends and collusions - for 2013 were  realistic.  439 http://cryptome.org/2014/10/csan-4.pdf, accessed November 2014.  http://cryptome.org/2014/10/csan-4.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  81  7.2 Conclusions  The threat landscape in 2014 has undergone significant, partially impressive developments.  Conclusions drawn in this year’s ETL are based on these developments and, towards a more clear  classification of their context, are divided into two categories, namely technical and policy/business  related (sequence of the points below is not prioritised).  Policy/business related conclusions:   Europe, in its role as a world leader in data privacy, should continue with setting up the  standards in this area. Besides contributing to increasing the currently diminishing trust in digital  life, this is a strong opportunity: it can turn it to a competitive advantage for many industry  sectors related to the provision of digital services. And can have a worldwide impact on the  cyber-threat landscape.   Cyber-security and resilience of Cyber Physical Systems is another opportunity for Europe.  Bridging engineered systems and cyber-space will be a significant field of growth. Europe should  take advantage of strong engineering capabilities to gain a foothold in this area. Combining  advances in data protection, resilience and cyber-security, this area can be a significant source of  innovation and competitiveness.   Current revelations regarding the activities of national security agencies and their role in  affecting the cyber-threat landscape have increased fragmentation risks for the internet (i.e.  Balkanisation of the internet440). A potential materialisation of this risk could threw current state  of internet and cyber-security many years back. Further, such a risk would greatly impact cyber-  threat landscape.   Surveillance is affecting cyber-threat landscape, at least from end-user perspective and has a  negative impact to the trust in the internet441. Governments are challenged to follow up on  technological developments with regulations establishing a balance between the technically  possible and legally transparent. In the middle term, governments will need to come up with  improvements of transparency rules for their surveillance measures405,442.   The unknown number of breaches and security incidents is a major concern of security experts  and in particular of law enforcement. Breach notification needs to be put on a wider basis via  corresponding regulations in various areas/sectors, eventually covering end-user impact. This  will help assessing the currently large grey numbers assumed.   New, sophisticated attacks make the development of new defences necessary. Development of  new detection methods and new security controls is an area of innovation. Examples of such  innovative controls are proactive detection of websites before they turn malicious443, or  identification of anonymous writers from their writing style444. Advanced attack methods is  440 http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-revelations-balkanisation-internet, accessed November 2014.  441 http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30115679, accessed November 2014.  442 http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/world/un-urges-protection-of-privacy-in-digital-era.html?_r=3, accessed  December 2014.  443 https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-soska.pdf, accessed November 2014.  444 https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sa499/papers/oakland2014-underground.pdf, accessed November 2014.  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/nsa-revelations-balkanisation-internet http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30115679 http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/world/un-urges-protection-of-privacy-in-digital-era.html?_r=3 https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-soska.pdf https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sa499/papers/oakland2014-underground.pdf  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  82  another area of innovation445. Academia and businesses should invest in such attack methods  and controls to increase innovation and competitiveness in the relevant market.  Technical conclusions:   Sophistication of cyber threats continues increasing. We see currently defence practices from  the past losing efficiency (i.e. classical signature based Anti-Virus). It is an undoubtable fact that  advanced attack methods currently used within cyber-espionage attacks are the best “food” for  cyber-criminal’s learning curve. Methods used by high capability threat actors today are adopted  by cyber-criminals tomorrow. This increases challenges in development of defence practices.   Partial take down of malicious infrastructure (i.e. botnets) has created a discussion about their  purposefulness. Do we have a similar case here as in medicine, where increased use of  antibiotics might create more resistant viral strains whose protection is not yet possible with  available means?   Trust infrastructures are under massive stress. Both open and “closed” source implementations  of basic security functions have been challenged. Shortly before finishing this report, even TOR  has allegedly been “de-anonymised”. What comes next? For sure that the entire cyber-  community and in particular cyber-security experts should worry about the robustness of the  trust infrastructure.   A definition of purpose of data usage seems to be the solution for data breaches not only for the  cloud, but throughout all processing/storage platforms. This would set the basis for a proper  data protection and management, while facilitating resolution of security issues of big data.   Threat modelling, threat intelligence over big data and setting up a novel, yet flexible security  architecture are emerging practices in coping with the dynamics of the threat landscape. It  remains to be seen how these novel approaches are going to reach smaller organisations with  reduced knowledge and resources. Are standardisation bodies going to follow these trends? And  if yes, when?   Big data, social media, mobile computing and interconnected devices, when not properly  used/protected will constitute the perfect knowledge-base for cyber-criminals, allowing for  perfectly crafted, difficult to detect phishing and other targeted attacks.  445 http://www.wired.com/2014/11/airhopper-hack/, accessed November 2014.  http://www.wired.com/2014/11/airhopper-hack/  ENISA Threat Landscape 2014  Overview of current and emerging cyber-threats  December 2014  Page  83  PO Box 1309, 710 01 Heraklion, Greece  Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  TP -A  E-1 4-001  -EN -N  ENISA Headquarters  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Athens Office  1 Vass.

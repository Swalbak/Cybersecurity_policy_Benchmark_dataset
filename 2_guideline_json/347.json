CONCLUSIONS 14  5.1 KEY TAKEWAYS 14  5.2 OBSERVATIONS 14  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Electronic trust services are a range of services around digital signatures, digital certificates,  electronic seals, timestamps, etc. which are used in electronic transactions, to make them  secure. eIDAS, an EU regulation, is the EU wide legal framework ensuring interoperability and  security of these electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of eIDAS is to ensure  that electronic transactions can have the same legal standing as traditional paper based  transactions. eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses  and citizens to work and use services across the EU. The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July  2014 and came into force in 2016. Article 19 of eIDAS introduces mandatory security breach  notification requirements for TSPs in the EU:   Trust service providers notify the national supervisory body about security breaches  with significant impact.   National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is cross-border  impact.   Every year national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the  notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2019 gives an aggregated  overview of these breaches, showing root causes, statistics and trends. It marks the fourth  round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector. The annual summary  reporting for 2019 totalled 32 incident reports. A total of 27 EU countries and 2 EFTA countries  take part in annual summary reporting.  The key statistics relating to the 2019 incidents are:   A significant increase in notified incidents: In 2019 the notified incidents almost  doubled with respect to last year, increasing by nearly 80%. This is not necessarily a  sign of security getting worse. From discussions with supervisory bodies we conclude  that this increase in notifications is a sign that trust service providers are becoming  more familiar with the breach reporting process and their obligations.   System failures is the dominant root cause: Most incidents (63%, 20 incidents) are  caused by system failures. Over the last 4 years of annual incident reporting in this  sector, system failures have consistently been the most common root cause of  reported incidents. Τypically, these cases are hardware failures and software bugs.  Human errors account for almost 30% of incidents reported in 2019 while only 9% of  incidents were flagged as malicious actions.  Figure 1: Total reported incidents vs system failures  2019 ANNUAL  REPORT  The number of notified  incidents almost  doubled.  System failures account  for more than half of the  incidents  System failures have  been the dominant root  cause in the last 4 years  of incident reporting.  1  10 8  20  1  14  18  32  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  2016 2017 2018 2019  System failures Total incidents  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  4   Most reported incidents concerned qualified trust services: More than three  quarters of total incidents (78%) had an impact on qualified trust services. In general,  non-qualified trust services are widely used. However in the set of all reported  incidents, only a small number of security breaches concerns a non-qualified trust  service (20%, 13 incidents). In most cases (80%, 52 incidents) the notification is done  by a TSP also offering qualified services, reporting an incident which has affected both  their qualified and non-qualified services   Most of the incidents were minor. Almost a third had large impact: 31% of  incidents reported in 2019 were rated as having large impact. In contrast to the two  previous years, there was no incident with “very large” (disastrous) impact. We also  observe a significant increase of the “minor” incidents. This is another indication that  the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to the providers; they are  reporting more incident regardless of their severity.  Figure 2: Severity of impact Trust services incidents in the EU - reported over 2016-2019  This year ENISA publishes statistics about trust services security incidents in an online visual  tool. This tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns1.  ENISA will continue to support the national supervisory bodies with implementing the breach  reporting under Article 19 of eIDAS and to work towards making this process efficient and  effective, yielding useful data, for the supervising bodies, for the authorities of other sectors, as  well as for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services.  Based on the experience of 4 years of eIDAS security incident reporting, the Article 19 group  has provided advice and input to the Commission review of the eIDAS regulation (ongoing in  2020).  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-  analysis/visual-tool  19  9  3  6  1  9  7  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-  incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  5  1. INTRODUCTION  According to Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation2, Electronic Trust Service Providers (TSPs) in  the EU have to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents.  Annually the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA.  Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of these security incidents. This  document gives an aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the  supervisory bodies over 2019.  This annual report marks the fourth round of security incident reporting in the EU’s trust services  sector, covering the security incidents of 2019. This document is structured as follows: In  section 2 we briefly summarize the policy context, the underlying eIDAS reporting framework  and we give an idea about the type of incidents reported; we mention some specific but  anonymised examples. In Section 3, we dive into the reported incidents, by presenting the root  cause categories, the detailed causes and the affected services. In section 4 we look at  multiannual trends over the years 2016-2019. In Section 5, we draw some conclusions and  make some observations.  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does  not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed  discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert  group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the  practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a representative from  RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and supports the group  with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  6  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 19 of eIDAS requires trust service providers in the EU to 1) assess risks 2) take  appropriate security measures to mitigate security breaches, and 3) notify/report security  incidents/breaches.  2.1 OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS  The mandatory security breach notification process has 3 steps:   Trust service providers notify the national supervisory body about security  breaches with significant impact.   National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is cross-  border impact.   National supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified  breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  Figure 3: Incident Reporting Framework for Trust Services  2.2 EXAMPLES OF SECURITY INCIDENTS  We give some anonymized examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents notified  to the national supervisory bodies this year:   [Service affected: eSignature – generation, Detailed cause: Software bug]:  Vulnerability in the software of the fingerprint sensor of some well-known mobile  devices. The secure elements of the device did not meet the security requirements as  a second authentication factor for creating remote signatures. For this reason, the  affected secure elements was temporarily excluded as a second authentication factor  until there was a software update which fixed the problem.  eIDAS Article 19  requires trust  service providers in  the EU to:  1) Assess risks  2) Take appropriate  security measures  to mitigate security  breaches,  3) Notify breaches  to the national  supervisory bodies.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  7   [Service affected: eSignature – generation, Detailed cause: Faulty software  change/update]: Certificate templates have been misconfigured. The QC statement  \"qualified certificate\" is missing from the profile. Electronic signatures created with  these certificates are not qualified signatures. Thousands of certificates were  generated with this profile defect over a period of more than a year. The users  concerned are in several EU countries.   [Service affected: eSignature – generation, Detailed cause: Policy/procedure  flaw]: Certificate issued to a wrong name because  a registration officer didn’t comply  with TSP’s procedures. The certificate was revoked when the mistake was discovered.   [Service affected: eSignature, eTimestamp, Detailed cause: Theft or loss of  equipment]: The TSP was the victim of theft of equipment. Laptops used by main site  system administrators were stolen. A report was made on the spot and a notification to  the insurer was sent. The credentials were all revoked and no admins account was  used before the revocation. Additional training on physical security has been  implemented for staff.   [Service affected: eSignature, eSeal, webCertificate, Detailed cause: software  bug]: Abnormal behaviour of services, during connection to the Database. Monitoring  systems detected a general slowdown accessing CA services. The anomaly was  immediately detected by internal monitoring and rescheduling activities started. As a  result of overloading of requests, there were problems related to accessing the DB  which caused delays and timeouts. In the indicated time slot, the user could not access  the CA services, while it obtained occasional timeout during authentication.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  8  3. INCIDENT ANALYSIS  The 2019 annual summary reporting, by the 27 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries  participating in this process, included in total 32 security incidents3. This is the fourth round of  annual summary reporting, because eIDAS came into force only recently, on the 1st of July  2016.  Figure 4: Trust Services Reported incidents  We observe an increase of nearly 80% in terms of reported incidents compared to the previous  year. We expect the number of notified security breaches to continue to increase as the trust  services market continues to grow and providers become more familiar with the breach  reporting process.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  According to data received by member states, system failures are the dominant root cause  accounting for nearly two thirds of total incidents reported (63%, 20 incidents). Typically, these  cases are hardware failures and software bugs. Almost 30% of incidents were categorised as  human errors and a minor 9% of total incidents were flagged as malicious actions. There was  no incident due to natural phenomena.  Figure 5: Root causes of TSP security incidents - 2019  3 Note that three of the reported incidents were indicated as incidents with no impact but included in the analysis  1  14  18  32  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  2016 2017 2018 2019  80%  is the increase  of reported  incidents  compared to  the previous  year.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  9  The above graph depicts the distribution of the incidents according to their root cause. There  are four main (4) categories of root causes: systems failures, human errors, malicious actions  and natural phenomena. In some cases the root cause of the incidents have been reported to  be also related to third-party failure. The latter is an additional cause category which can only be  selected in combination with one of the above root causes. In total over 2019, 25% of incidents  were flagged as third-party failures related. The division, is shown in the chart below.  Figure 6: Root causes vs. third party failures – 2019  3.2 DETAILED CAUSES  The three most common causes of incidents are hardware failures, software bugs and faulty  software change/update. Note that an incident is often not only triggered by one cause but can  involve multiple detailed causes, a chain of events. This explains why the total number in the  chart here add up to more than 32 which is the number of reported incidents for 2019.

Electronic seals and  timestamps were affected by one fourth (25%) and one fifth (21%) of the incidents respectively.  Overall, 83% of the reported incidents in the last four years had affected electronic signature  services. Both with electronic seals (29%) and timestamps services (20%) remained at the top  three services affected over the years of reporting.  Figure 8: Impact of the incidents  Below we show the impact of the incidents on the subservices. The services related to the  generation of signatures/seals/timestamps (56%) and certificate management (47%) are the  most affected subservices.  Figure 9: Impact of incidents on subservices  3.4 QUALIFIED SERVICES VERSUS NON-QUALIFIED SERVICES  This year, approximately three quarters of total incidents (78%) had an impact on qualified  services (i.e. qualified signature certificate creation, qualified seal certificate creation, etc.). The  corresponding percentage for non-qualified services is almost a quarter. Note that one incident  report could involve multiple trust services, which explains why the percentages in the charts  here add up to more than 100%.  87%  25%  21%  6%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  eSignature  eSeal  eTimestamp  webCertificate  56%  47%  12% 9%  3%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Generation Certificate management  Validation Undefined types Preservation  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  11  Figure 10: Reported Incidents affecting services (Qualified vs Non-qualified)  3.5 NUMBER OF INCIDENTS (OUTAGES) AND USER HOURS  Below we focus on the incidents with impact on the availability of the services (outages) and we  look at the user hours lost4. Interestingly only a few human errors (2 incidents) account for  almost the half of the lost users hours (48%, 20 M user hours). The other half is caused by  system failures (13 incidents, 52%, 22 M user hours).  Figure 11: Total user-hours lost vs root cause  4 User hours is a metric used to quantify the impact of an incident; it is the product of the number of  users affected with the  duration of the incident in hours. For example, 1M User Hours means 1M users were affected for one hour, or 2M users for  half an hour, etc  78%  25%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Qualified services Non qualified services  22M 20M  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  U se  rh o  u rs  lo st  ( M  ill io  n s)  13 Incidents 2 Incidents  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  12  4. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS 2016-2019  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2016. In this section, we look  at multiannual trends over the last 4 years, covering the period from 2016 to 2019. This dataset  contains 65 reported incidents in total.  4.1 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Over the 4 years of trust services security incident reporting, the most common root cause is  system failures (60%). For this root cause, the most common causes were hardware failures  (35%) and software bugs (33%). This is also the trend in the electronic communication services5  where system failures account for almost two thirds (67%) of total incidents (722 out of 1093  incidents).  Figure 12: Root cause categories Trust services incidents in the EU - reported over 2016-2019  Around a fifth of the reported incidents (18%) were due to malicious actions and another fifth  were flagged as human errors. Natural phenomena is not a common root cause in this sector.  This sector operates differently than the telecom one. With large-scale aboveground  infrastructure for the mobile networks, the telecom sector is more vulnerable to natural  phenomena.  4.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND SEVERITY OF IMPACT  We compare the statistics for severity with the previous rounds of reporting. We follow the EU  Cybersecurity incident taxonomy where the severity of the impact has the following values: no  impact, minor, large and very large impact6.  The number of incidents with large impact is almost stable the last three years. It is interesting  to see that there was a significant increase of the “minor” incidents last year. This is an  5 See ENISA Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019  6 CG Publication 04/2018 - Cybersecurity incident taxonomy  60%  of incidents are  due to system  failures. The  most common  causes were  hardware failures  (35%) and  software bugs  (33%)  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  13  indication that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar and effective;  providers are reporting more incident regardless of their severity. In contrast to the previous  year, there was no very large (disastrous) incident during 2019.

CONCLUSIONS  5.1 KEY TAKEWAYS  The key takeaways from the 2019 incidents are:   A significant increase of notified incidents: In 2019 there is a raise of nearly 80% in  terms of reported incidents compared to the previous year. This was actually expected  and is attributed to the increased adoption of trust services market and growing  familiarity with this breach reporting process.   System failures is the dominant root cause: Most incidents (63%, 20 incidents) are  caused by system failures. Looking back at the 4 years of annual incident reporting in  this sector, we observe that every year, system failures are the most common root  cause of reported incidents. Typically, these cases are hardware failures and software  bugs. Human errors have been the cause for almost 30% of incidents reported in 2019  while a minor 9% of total incidents were flagged as malicious actions.   Most reported incidents concerned qualified trust services: More than three  quarters of total incidents (78%) had an impact on qualified services while the  corresponding percentage for non-qualified services is almost a quarter.   Most of the incidents were minor. Almost a third had large impact: 31% of  incidents reported in 2019 were rated as having large impact. In contrast to the two  previous years, there was no incident with “very large” (disastrous) impact. We also  observe a significant increase of the “minor” incidents. This is another indication that  the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to the providers; they are  reporting more incident regardless of their severity.  5.2 OBSERVATIONS  Beyond the numbers in the incident reports, we make two general observations below about the  overall process, based on our experience with eIDAS incident reporting and discussions in the  Article 19 group:   Supervision of, and incident reporting by, non-qualified services: Non-qualified  trust services are widely used. A good example is website (TLS) certificates, which are  a staple of online/internet security. Globally around 80% of websites use web  certificates. LetsEncrypt alone had issued a billion website certificates in February  2020.  There have been scores of major security incidents with web certificates, also in  Europe. Take for example, the Diginotar incident7 of 2011 (Certificate authority hacked,  fake certificates for google.com), which led to a major disruption of Dutch e-  government and eavesdropping of Iranian citizens, or, more recently, the DNSpionage8  attacks of 2018-2019, in which DNS poisoning and fake certificates were used to  eavesdrop on public and private sector organizations in the EU.  However, in the set of reported incidents, only a small number of security breaches  affect a non-qualified trust service (20%, 13 incidents). In most cases (80%, 52  7 https://threatpost.com/what-you-need-know-about-diginotar-hack-090211/75611/  8 https://www.wired.com/story/sea-turtle-dns-hijacking/  https://threatpost.com/what-you-need-know-about-diginotar-hack-090211/75611/ https://www.wired.com/story/sea-turtle-dns-hijacking/  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  15  incidents) the notification is done by a TSP also offering qualified services, reporting an  incident which has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.  This suggests there is under-reporting of security breaches with non-qualified trust  services. It is good to mention here that under eIDAS, non-qualified services are  subject to ex-post supervision. This means that only after a security breach, the  supervisory can take action and assess the security of the trust services. This explains  that supervisory bodies are not always aware of, or in contact with, the trust service  providers and their services. When an incident happens, the supervisory body often  learns about it in media reports, and does not get informed about incidents directly.   Reporting about vulnerabilities and attacks-in-the-wild: There is a clear need to  exchange information not only about actual incidents with impact at a TSP’s trust  service, but also about attacks and vulnerabilities. Since the ROCA case happened,  information sharing between supervisory bodies has improved. There were more  recent examples of such cases, like the Minerva attack9 and the attacks bypassing the  signature validation in pdf10. These cases highlight, once more, the need for raising  awareness and exchange information with a broad group of entities, i.e. research  communities, CSIRTs, national supervisory bodies, owners of potentially affected eID  schemes, etc. Good information exchange and communication between competent  authorities enables timely assessment of the situation and makes it easier to respond  and prevent or mitigate incidents.  ENISA facilitates the information sharing between national authorities by providing the  technical means to the supervisory bodies for sharing this kind of information. We are  also adapting and extending the CIRAS incident reporting tool to better support this  kind of cross-border communication better. We are currently piloting with the owners of  the national eID schemes, who need to notify incidents under article 10 of the eIDAS.  And there are other types of incidents which are noteworthy and interesting to  exchange information about, like near-misses, or incidents prevent by activation of  security measures like revocation of devices or certificates.  The eIDAS Regulation and the eIDAS incident reporting have been in place for more than 4  years now. We have been improving the incident reporting process, together with the Article 19  group. This year, under eIDAS Article 49, the European Commission is reviewing the eIDAS  Regulation itself, in order to report to the European parliament and to the Council. This eIDAS  review is an opportunity to address some of the above-mentioned issues and gaps. We look  forward to supporting the Commission and the EU Member States with implementing eIDAS  security incident reporting in an efficient and effective manner.  9 https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/  10 https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/ei/veroeffentlichungen/2019/02/12/report.pdf  https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/ https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/ei/veroeffentlichungen/2019/02/12/report.pdf  T P  -A K  -2 0  -0 0  1 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The mission of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, by actively supporting Member States,  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity.

CONCLUSIONS 14  5.1 KEY TAKEWAYS 14  5.2 OBSERVATIONS 14  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  Electronic trust services are a range of services around digital signatures, digital certificates,  electronic seals, timestamps, etc. which are used in electronic transactions, to make them  secure. eIDAS, an EU regulation, is the EU wide legal framework ensuring interoperability and  security of these electronic trust services across the EU. One of the goals of eIDAS is to ensure  that electronic transactions can have the same legal standing as traditional paper based  transactions. eIDAS is important for the European digital market because it allows businesses  and citizens to work and use services across the EU. The eIDAS regulation was adopted in July  2014 and came into force in 2016. Article 19 of eIDAS introduces mandatory security breach  notification requirements for TSPs in the EU:   Trust service providers notify the national supervisory body about security breaches  with significant impact.   National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is cross-border  impact.   Every year national supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the  notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  This document, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2019 gives an aggregated  overview of these breaches, showing root causes, statistics and trends. It marks the fourth  round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector. The annual summary  reporting for 2019 totalled 32 incident reports. A total of 27 EU countries and 2 EFTA countries  take part in annual summary reporting.  The key statistics relating to the 2019 incidents are:   A significant increase in notified incidents: In 2019 the notified incidents almost  doubled with respect to last year, increasing by nearly 80%. This is not necessarily a  sign of security getting worse. From discussions with supervisory bodies we conclude  that this increase in notifications is a sign that trust service providers are becoming  more familiar with the breach reporting process and their obligations.   System failures is the dominant root cause: Most incidents (63%, 20 incidents) are  caused by system failures. Over the last 4 years of annual incident reporting in this  sector, system failures have consistently been the most common root cause of  reported incidents. Τypically, these cases are hardware failures and software bugs.  Human errors account for almost 30% of incidents reported in 2019 while only 9% of  incidents were flagged as malicious actions.  Figure 1: Total reported incidents vs system failures  2019 ANNUAL  REPORT  The number of notified  incidents almost  doubled.  System failures account  for more than half of the  incidents  System failures have  been the dominant root  cause in the last 4 years  of incident reporting.  1  10 8  20  1  14  18  32  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  2016 2017 2018 2019  System failures Total incidents  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  4   Most reported incidents concerned qualified trust services: More than three  quarters of total incidents (78%) had an impact on qualified trust services. In general,  non-qualified trust services are widely used. However in the set of all reported  incidents, only a small number of security breaches concerns a non-qualified trust  service (20%, 13 incidents). In most cases (80%, 52 incidents) the notification is done  by a TSP also offering qualified services, reporting an incident which has affected both  their qualified and non-qualified services   Most of the incidents were minor. Almost a third had large impact: 31% of  incidents reported in 2019 were rated as having large impact. In contrast to the two  previous years, there was no incident with “very large” (disastrous) impact. We also  observe a significant increase of the “minor” incidents. This is another indication that  the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to the providers; they are  reporting more incident regardless of their severity.  Figure 2: Severity of impact Trust services incidents in the EU - reported over 2016-2019  This year ENISA publishes statistics about trust services security incidents in an online visual  tool. This tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns1.  ENISA will continue to support the national supervisory bodies with implementing the breach  reporting under Article 19 of eIDAS and to work towards making this process efficient and  effective, yielding useful data, for the supervising bodies, for the authorities of other sectors, as  well as for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services.  Based on the experience of 4 years of eIDAS security incident reporting, the Article 19 group  has provided advice and input to the Commission review of the eIDAS regulation (ongoing in  2020).  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-  analysis/visual-tool  19  9  3  6  1  9  7  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-  incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  5  1. INTRODUCTION  According to Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation2, Electronic Trust Service Providers (TSPs) in  the EU have to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents.  Annually the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA.  Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of these security incidents. This  document gives an aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the  supervisory bodies over 2019.  This annual report marks the fourth round of security incident reporting in the EU’s trust services  sector, covering the security incidents of 2019. This document is structured as follows: In  section 2 we briefly summarize the policy context, the underlying eIDAS reporting framework  and we give an idea about the type of incidents reported; we mention some specific but  anonymised examples. In Section 3, we dive into the reported incidents, by presenting the root  cause categories, the detailed causes and the affected services. In section 4 we look at  multiannual trends over the years 2016-2019. In Section 5, we draw some conclusions and  make some observations.  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does  not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed  discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert  group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the  practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a representative from  RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and supports the group  with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  6  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 19 of eIDAS requires trust service providers in the EU to 1) assess risks 2) take  appropriate security measures to mitigate security breaches, and 3) notify/report security  incidents/breaches.  2.1 OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS  The mandatory security breach notification process has 3 steps:   Trust service providers notify the national supervisory body about security  breaches with significant impact.   National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is cross-  border impact.   National supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified  breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  Figure 3: Incident Reporting Framework for Trust Services  2.2 EXAMPLES OF SECURITY INCIDENTS  We give some anonymized examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents notified  to the national supervisory bodies this year:   [Service affected: eSignature – generation, Detailed cause: Software bug]:  Vulnerability in the software of the fingerprint sensor of some well-known mobile  devices. The secure elements of the device did not meet the security requirements as  a second authentication factor for creating remote signatures. For this reason, the  affected secure elements was temporarily excluded as a second authentication factor  until there was a software update which fixed the problem.  eIDAS Article 19  requires trust  service providers in  the EU to:  1) Assess risks  2) Take appropriate  security measures  to mitigate security  breaches,  3) Notify breaches  to the national  supervisory bodies.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  7   [Service affected: eSignature – generation, Detailed cause: Faulty software  change/update]: Certificate templates have been misconfigured. The QC statement  \"qualified certificate\" is missing from the profile. Electronic signatures created with  these certificates are not qualified signatures. Thousands of certificates were  generated with this profile defect over a period of more than a year. The users  concerned are in several EU countries.   [Service affected: eSignature – generation, Detailed cause: Policy/procedure  flaw]: Certificate issued to a wrong name because  a registration officer didn’t comply  with TSP’s procedures. The certificate was revoked when the mistake was discovered.   [Service affected: eSignature, eTimestamp, Detailed cause: Theft or loss of  equipment]: The TSP was the victim of theft of equipment. Laptops used by main site  system administrators were stolen. A report was made on the spot and a notification to  the insurer was sent. The credentials were all revoked and no admins account was  used before the revocation. Additional training on physical security has been  implemented for staff.   [Service affected: eSignature, eSeal, webCertificate, Detailed cause: software  bug]: Abnormal behaviour of services, during connection to the Database. Monitoring  systems detected a general slowdown accessing CA services. The anomaly was  immediately detected by internal monitoring and rescheduling activities started. As a  result of overloading of requests, there were problems related to accessing the DB  which caused delays and timeouts. In the indicated time slot, the user could not access  the CA services, while it obtained occasional timeout during authentication.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  8  3. INCIDENT ANALYSIS  The 2019 annual summary reporting, by the 27 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries  participating in this process, included in total 32 security incidents3. This is the fourth round of  annual summary reporting, because eIDAS came into force only recently, on the 1st of July  2016.  Figure 4: Trust Services Reported incidents  We observe an increase of nearly 80% in terms of reported incidents compared to the previous  year. We expect the number of notified security breaches to continue to increase as the trust  services market continues to grow and providers become more familiar with the breach  reporting process.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  According to data received by member states, system failures are the dominant root cause  accounting for nearly two thirds of total incidents reported (63%, 20 incidents). Typically, these  cases are hardware failures and software bugs. Almost 30% of incidents were categorised as  human errors and a minor 9% of total incidents were flagged as malicious actions. There was  no incident due to natural phenomena.  Figure 5: Root causes of TSP security incidents - 2019  3 Note that three of the reported incidents were indicated as incidents with no impact but included in the analysis  1  14  18  32  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  2016 2017 2018 2019  80%  is the increase  of reported  incidents  compared to  the previous  year.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  9  The above graph depicts the distribution of the incidents according to their root cause. There  are four main (4) categories of root causes: systems failures, human errors, malicious actions  and natural phenomena. In some cases the root cause of the incidents have been reported to  be also related to third-party failure. The latter is an additional cause category which can only be  selected in combination with one of the above root causes. In total over 2019, 25% of incidents  were flagged as third-party failures related. The division, is shown in the chart below.  Figure 6: Root causes vs. third party failures – 2019  3.2 DETAILED CAUSES  The three most common causes of incidents are hardware failures, software bugs and faulty  software change/update. Note that an incident is often not only triggered by one cause but can  involve multiple detailed causes, a chain of events. This explains why the total number in the  chart here add up to more than 32 which is the number of reported incidents for 2019.

Electronic seals and  timestamps were affected by one fourth (25%) and one fifth (21%) of the incidents respectively.  Overall, 83% of the reported incidents in the last four years had affected electronic signature  services. Both with electronic seals (29%) and timestamps services (20%) remained at the top  three services affected over the years of reporting.  Figure 8: Impact of the incidents  Below we show the impact of the incidents on the subservices. The services related to the  generation of signatures/seals/timestamps (56%) and certificate management (47%) are the  most affected subservices.  Figure 9: Impact of incidents on subservices  3.4 QUALIFIED SERVICES VERSUS NON-QUALIFIED SERVICES  This year, approximately three quarters of total incidents (78%) had an impact on qualified  services (i.e. qualified signature certificate creation, qualified seal certificate creation, etc.). The  corresponding percentage for non-qualified services is almost a quarter. Note that one incident  report could involve multiple trust services, which explains why the percentages in the charts  here add up to more than 100%.  87%  25%  21%  6%  0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%  eSignature  eSeal  eTimestamp  webCertificate  56%  47%  12% 9%  3%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Generation Certificate management  Validation Undefined types Preservation  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  11  Figure 10: Reported Incidents affecting services (Qualified vs Non-qualified)  3.5 NUMBER OF INCIDENTS (OUTAGES) AND USER HOURS  Below we focus on the incidents with impact on the availability of the services (outages) and we  look at the user hours lost4. Interestingly only a few human errors (2 incidents) account for  almost the half of the lost users hours (48%, 20 M user hours). The other half is caused by  system failures (13 incidents, 52%, 22 M user hours).  Figure 11: Total user-hours lost vs root cause  4 User hours is a metric used to quantify the impact of an incident; it is the product of the number of  users affected with the  duration of the incident in hours. For example, 1M User Hours means 1M users were affected for one hour, or 2M users for  half an hour, etc  78%  25%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  Qualified services Non qualified services  22M 20M  0  5  10  15  20  25  30  35  U se  rh o  u rs  lo st  ( M  ill io  n s)  13 Incidents 2 Incidents  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  12  4. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS 2016-2019  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2016. In this section, we look  at multiannual trends over the last 4 years, covering the period from 2016 to 2019. This dataset  contains 65 reported incidents in total.  4.1 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Over the 4 years of trust services security incident reporting, the most common root cause is  system failures (60%). For this root cause, the most common causes were hardware failures  (35%) and software bugs (33%). This is also the trend in the electronic communication services5  where system failures account for almost two thirds (67%) of total incidents (722 out of 1093  incidents).  Figure 12: Root cause categories Trust services incidents in the EU - reported over 2016-2019  Around a fifth of the reported incidents (18%) were due to malicious actions and another fifth  were flagged as human errors. Natural phenomena is not a common root cause in this sector.  This sector operates differently than the telecom one. With large-scale aboveground  infrastructure for the mobile networks, the telecom sector is more vulnerable to natural  phenomena.  4.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND SEVERITY OF IMPACT  We compare the statistics for severity with the previous rounds of reporting. We follow the EU  Cybersecurity incident taxonomy where the severity of the impact has the following values: no  impact, minor, large and very large impact6.  The number of incidents with large impact is almost stable the last three years. It is interesting  to see that there was a significant increase of the “minor” incidents last year. This is an  5 See ENISA Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019  6 CG Publication 04/2018 - Cybersecurity incident taxonomy  60%  of incidents are  due to system  failures. The  most common  causes were  hardware failures  (35%) and  software bugs  (33%)  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  13  indication that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar and effective;  providers are reporting more incident regardless of their severity. In contrast to the previous  year, there was no very large (disastrous) incident during 2019.

CONCLUSIONS  5.1 KEY TAKEWAYS  The key takeaways from the 2019 incidents are:   A significant increase of notified incidents: In 2019 there is a raise of nearly 80% in  terms of reported incidents compared to the previous year. This was actually expected  and is attributed to the increased adoption of trust services market and growing  familiarity with this breach reporting process.   System failures is the dominant root cause: Most incidents (63%, 20 incidents) are  caused by system failures. Looking back at the 4 years of annual incident reporting in  this sector, we observe that every year, system failures are the most common root  cause of reported incidents. Typically, these cases are hardware failures and software  bugs. Human errors have been the cause for almost 30% of incidents reported in 2019  while a minor 9% of total incidents were flagged as malicious actions.   Most reported incidents concerned qualified trust services: More than three  quarters of total incidents (78%) had an impact on qualified services while the  corresponding percentage for non-qualified services is almost a quarter.   Most of the incidents were minor. Almost a third had large impact: 31% of  incidents reported in 2019 were rated as having large impact. In contrast to the two  previous years, there was no incident with “very large” (disastrous) impact. We also  observe a significant increase of the “minor” incidents. This is another indication that  the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to the providers; they are  reporting more incident regardless of their severity.  5.2 OBSERVATIONS  Beyond the numbers in the incident reports, we make two general observations below about the  overall process, based on our experience with eIDAS incident reporting and discussions in the  Article 19 group:   Supervision of, and incident reporting by, non-qualified services: Non-qualified  trust services are widely used. A good example is website (TLS) certificates, which are  a staple of online/internet security. Globally around 80% of websites use web  certificates. LetsEncrypt alone had issued a billion website certificates in February  2020.  There have been scores of major security incidents with web certificates, also in  Europe. Take for example, the Diginotar incident7 of 2011 (Certificate authority hacked,  fake certificates for google.com), which led to a major disruption of Dutch e-  government and eavesdropping of Iranian citizens, or, more recently, the DNSpionage8  attacks of 2018-2019, in which DNS poisoning and fake certificates were used to  eavesdrop on public and private sector organizations in the EU.  However, in the set of reported incidents, only a small number of security breaches  affect a non-qualified trust service (20%, 13 incidents). In most cases (80%, 52  7 https://threatpost.com/what-you-need-know-about-diginotar-hack-090211/75611/  8 https://www.wired.com/story/sea-turtle-dns-hijacking/  https://threatpost.com/what-you-need-know-about-diginotar-hack-090211/75611/ https://www.wired.com/story/sea-turtle-dns-hijacking/  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  JULY 2020  15  incidents) the notification is done by a TSP also offering qualified services, reporting an  incident which has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.  This suggests there is under-reporting of security breaches with non-qualified trust  services. It is good to mention here that under eIDAS, non-qualified services are  subject to ex-post supervision. This means that only after a security breach, the  supervisory can take action and assess the security of the trust services. This explains  that supervisory bodies are not always aware of, or in contact with, the trust service  providers and their services. When an incident happens, the supervisory body often  learns about it in media reports, and does not get informed about incidents directly.   Reporting about vulnerabilities and attacks-in-the-wild: There is a clear need to  exchange information not only about actual incidents with impact at a TSP’s trust  service, but also about attacks and vulnerabilities. Since the ROCA case happened,  information sharing between supervisory bodies has improved. There were more  recent examples of such cases, like the Minerva attack9 and the attacks bypassing the  signature validation in pdf10. These cases highlight, once more, the need for raising  awareness and exchange information with a broad group of entities, i.e. research  communities, CSIRTs, national supervisory bodies, owners of potentially affected eID  schemes, etc. Good information exchange and communication between competent  authorities enables timely assessment of the situation and makes it easier to respond  and prevent or mitigate incidents.  ENISA facilitates the information sharing between national authorities by providing the  technical means to the supervisory bodies for sharing this kind of information. We are  also adapting and extending the CIRAS incident reporting tool to better support this  kind of cross-border communication better. We are currently piloting with the owners of  the national eID schemes, who need to notify incidents under article 10 of the eIDAS.  And there are other types of incidents which are noteworthy and interesting to  exchange information about, like near-misses, or incidents prevent by activation of  security measures like revocation of devices or certificates.  The eIDAS Regulation and the eIDAS incident reporting have been in place for more than 4  years now. We have been improving the incident reporting process, together with the Article 19  group. This year, under eIDAS Article 49, the European Commission is reviewing the eIDAS  Regulation itself, in order to report to the European parliament and to the Council. This eIDAS  review is an opportunity to address some of the above-mentioned issues and gaps. We look  forward to supporting the Commission and the EU Member States with implementing eIDAS  security incident reporting in an efficient and effective manner.  9 https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/  10 https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/ei/veroeffentlichungen/2019/02/12/report.pdf  https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/ https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/ei/veroeffentlichungen/2019/02/12/report.pdf  T P  -A K  -2 0  -0 0  1 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The mission of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high  common level of cybersecurity across the Union, by actively supporting Member States,  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in improving cybersecurity.

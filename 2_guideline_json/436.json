To help  solve this, multiple countries have initiated national cybersecurity competitions for students, security  professionals and even non-IT professionals, all with a common goal: find cyber talents and encourage all  of them to pursue a career in cybersecurity. The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) builds upon  these competitions adding a pan-European layer.  The ECSC is an initiative of multiple European countries supported by the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) that aims at engaging cybersecurity talent across Europe and  connecting high potentials.  This report contains a detailed list of the lessons learned from previous ECSCs, of which the key takeaways  are:   The quality of the ECSC is crucial in meeting the participants’ expectations. The scenario, stability and  complexity of the platform used during the ECSC are key success factors in order to provide a  challenging competition that attracts top cyber talent from all over Europe.   Public relations and communication activities are key in order to meet the objectives on participation  and sponsorship.   The event agenda should be tailored to the participants needs and expectations, and include activities  that relate to their interests and subject matter expertise.   Given the current growth objectives of the ECSC (plus five countries per year), solid back-office  processes regarding the organisation of the event are necessary to meet the rising quality expectations  from stakeholders. This includes, amongst others, a proper governance structure with clear roles,  responsibilities, decision-making, agreed-upon principles and rules with regard to fair play and  transparency.   Sharing lessons learned and recommendations between organisers and participating states is crucial  in order to improve the quality of the event and implement best practices.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  05  1. Purpose of this document  The European Cyber Security Challenge is gaining momentum and increasing in scale. In order to meet the  rising quality expectations of all stakeholders, including participants, organisers and sponsors, the capacity  and maturity of the ECSC organisation should increase accordingly.  In order to achieve the target maturity, exchanging lessons learned and recommendations is crucial. This  document aims at listing the observations and improvement areas as captured during previous ECSCs and  at providing guidance for future editions.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  06  2. Methodology  Representative feedback has been captured from both organisers and participants by means of an online  survey and stakeholder interviews. The objective of capturing this feedback was to assess the overall  experience of the attendees and to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement.  The online survey contained both open and closed questions. Open questions encouraged the respondents  to provide qualitative feedback, while the closed questions were included to obtain quantitative feedback  that enabled comparison and statistical analysis.  Stakeholder interviews were held on behalf of ENISA prior to and during the ECSC2017 event. Multiple  conference calls have been set up between previous ECSC organising States to discover key success factors  and best practices. During the ECSC2017 event, stakeholder interviews were held to grasp the overall  experience of the event and to capture any potential issues or improvement areas.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  07  3. ECSC editions  The ECSC has been strongly influenced by an ENISA study on the status of cyber security competitions in  the EU in November 20141. This study assessed the current state with regard to objectives, mission and  vision, and maturity of existing cyber security challenges.  Pre-existing national competitions (Austrian, Swiss, Spanish, Romanian, United Kingdom), and private  challenges were part of the study. The feedback of multiple stakeholders from both private and public  domains were captured and included in the report, resulting in a document that includes guidelines for “a  pan-European cyber challenge competition”.  The main conclusion of the study was that there was a fertile ground for the emergence of a European  level challenge:  “the importance of the European Commission’s active involvement in getting on board policymakers in  Member States, the expertise of the EU’s cybersecurity agency, ENISA, in involving the best experts in  the field and the responsibility of public and private stakeholders in understanding that the target is  set very high and that they should engage to the best of their ability.”  The emergence of the ECSC was thus the result of private and public stakeholders committing to a  common goal: to place cybersecurity at the service of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful  society concerned with the preservation of democratic values, freedom of taught, dignity and critical  thinking.  The abovementioned is one of the principles of the European Cyber Security Charter.  The following section gives an overview of all ECSC events until 2016.  ECSC 2014  The ECSC2014 event was the first of its kind and the  initial pilot event; it took place from 3rd to 5th  November 2014 in Fürstenfeld, Austria. The finals  took the form of a competition between teams from  Austria, Germany and Switzerland, who competed  against each other in different live challenges. After  the event, the teams travelled to an awards  ceremony at the Museum of Military History in  Vienna, in the presence of politicians, economists  and representatives of government bodies.  The ECSC 2014 platform and challenges included several challenges such as an APT Network Forensic  Challenge, Java Hash Collisions, HQL injections and License Key Circumventions.  1 Cybersecurity competitions – the status in Europe, ENISA, November 2014.

Six teams from six different countries  (Austria, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK and  Switzerland) attended the event. This edition  marked also the involvement of ENISA in the project.  This year's competition saw a new format in which  teams had to fix security holes in software  applications while attacking other teams' assets.  ECSC 2016  One hundred European cyber security talents, representing 10 EU Member States and EFTA countries, met  in Düsseldorf for the ECSC2016 event from the 7th to the 9th of November.  All teams had to protect their own infrastructure  while attacking that of the opposing teams,  while deciphering hidden messages and solving  hacking challenges.  Participants were able to meet and talk with  representatives of academia  Figure 2 - ECSC 2015 finalists  Figure 3 - ECSC 2016 finalists  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  09  4. Lessons Learned  The following lessons learned serve as guidelines for maintaining and increasing the quality of the ECSC with  regard to logistics, technical challenges, communication, scalability, accommodation and budget.  Public relations and communication strategy   Since creating awareness about the event is key to stimulate the scaling of the Challenge, national  organisers, participating teams and ENISA should define and execute a consistent and optimised  communication strategy in order to meet its full potential.   The potential of social media should be leveraged to obtain maximum exposure amongst the target  audience and the cybersecurity community.   A PR timeline supports this objective by defining dates, channels and messages. The timeline implies a  consistent timing of the publication of posts across multiple channels.   A cross-country PR timeline should be established in collaboration with all participating States and  ENISA to maximise exposure and visibility by maintaining coherence in the communication strategy.  Budget and sponsorship   The national organisers of the previous ECSCs and the ECSC Steering Committee stress that external  sponsorship is key to funding the event.   The national organisers of previous challenges have received significant funding from both private and  public partners. The organisations experienced a very proactive attitude from private organisations  towards offering funding. This is the result of proactive communication about the challenge and  informing the industry of the benefits of a potential sponsorship.   In order to establish an attractive climate for investors, the national organisers established a  sponsorship scheme that results in different benefits according to the funding amount. For example:   Gold sponsorship (full exposure, access to talent, additional marketing and advertising opportunities)   Silver sponsorship (medium exposure, access to talent)   Bronze sponsorship (limited exposure)   Sponsors that obtain access to talent should tailor their presence to the expectations of the audience.  Traditional “HR booths” do not appeal to cyber security talent. The sponsors should be encouraged  to explore innovative and non-conventional ways to interact with participants. This will result in a  high return-on-investment from the sponsors’ perspective, and a high satisfaction rate from the  participants’ perspective.   Sponsors that provide conferences or presentations should tailor the content to the target audience.  Challenge  Design   Participants expect a challenge that is encouraging them to push their limits and expect to face  situations that involve multiple aspects of cybersecurity such as capture-the-flags (CTF) and jeopardy.   The design of the technical challenges should reflect a reasonable learning curve in accordance with  the level of the participants. The design should anticipate a divergent level of expertise by involving  self-contained steps and real-time feedback in order to support contestants to reach the next steps.   The challenges should reflect real-life scenarios that prepare the participants for their future career.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  10   The technical infrastructure of the challenge should be secure and resilient in order to guarantee  availability during the competition. A loss of availability of the challenge platform drastically affects the  overall experience.   The scoring mechanism should be transparent with regard to attribution and distribution of points  over the challenge.   The challenge design should aim at maximizing the interaction between the teams in order to  stimulate the competitive aspect of the challenge.   The design of the challenges should also take into account the continuous growth of the competition.  Service providers   The service providers should guarantee the functionality and security of the challenge platforms and  supporting systems.   The service providers should foresee measures in order to prevent, detect and respond to any  incidents that could impact the availability and integrity of their systems. This includes, but is not  limited to testing of infrastructure and platform and setting up back-up infrastructure.   The service providers should provide adequate support during the competition to participants and  organisers in case of incidents in order to safeguard the continuity of the competition.   The host and the ECSC Steering Committee should closely follow-up with the service providers on the  progress of the platform development and deployment in order to detect, prevent and respond to  events that might affect the delivery of the platform.  Rules   The rules should be clear, unambiguous and agreed-upon by all participating countries.   Clear communication about the rules to the teams is key to ensure the fairness of the competition.   Compliance to the rules should be monitored and taken into account in order to avoid malicious  activities such as cheating or unfair competition.   Amendments to the rules should be backed-up by reasonable argumentation and discussed during  the Steering Committee meetings at the earliest convenience.  Presentations   The presentations held by the participants as part of the Challenge should be aligned with the  objectives of the challenge with regard to building expertise.   Clear guidelines on the practicalities such as the submission should be provided from the Jury and  organisers to the participants.  Logistics   The location should be determined taking into account the overall connectivity and infrastructural  capacity. The selected venue and city should be able to provide accommodation capacity, reliable and  qualitative infrastructure, as well as efficient accessibility for participating teams from all over Europe.   Selecting the accommodation and location of events should reflect – and be tailored to – the  preferences of the participants.   Taking into account the satisfaction of the sponsors in terms of exposure to talent, the location should  also consider the student and talent population within the region. Having multiple universities is an  asset that positively influences the exposure of private organisations towards students, and stimulates  the attendance rate to the side conference and job fair.   Should a national organiser believe the ECSC date should be rescheduled, this should be formally  brought up in a timely manner to the complete ECSC group to avoid overlap or conflicts with other  national initiatives.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  11   In general, the earliest time to organise the ECSC event is October. Any deviation from the original  planning should be discussed and decided upon with the formal input of all the members of the ECSC  organisation.   When unforeseen logistical problems arise, the participants and organisers should be informed  immediately.  Conferences, job fair and social event   Although cybersecurity puzzles are the focus of the event, activities such as the conferences, job fair  and social event add value to the ECSC. The link between these events and the actual challenge  should be established and these activities should be embedded in the event.   The ECSC should not be seen as another traditional cyber security conference, but rather focuses on  the potential added value of the challenge where top cyber security talent from Europe are invited to  compete, collaborate, meet and network with private sector organisations.   The social event agenda and activities should reflect the interests of the participants.   The conferences should be tailored to the target audience and add value to the development of  technical knowledge.   The job fair and recruiting activities should be embedded and aligned with the actual conference.  Traditional “booth job fairs” should be reconsidered as they have limited effect on participants. The  involved private organisations should be encouraged to propose innovative and non–conventional  recruiting activities.  Jury and Steering Committee   The Steering Committee should focus on its main function of being a decision making body that  serves the improvement of the ECSC. The efficiency of the Steering Committee is crucial in order to  implement recommendations and increase the maturity and capacity of the event.   The Steering Committee meetings should be highly effective and have a clear and agreed-upon  agenda that is strictly followed to ensure all topics are covered and timing is respected.   Decisions taken by the Steering Committee should be logged in a decision-making register that  allows for reference in following meetings. This logbook will contain information about decisions,  owners and actions.   The Steering Committee meetings should not reflect upon already taken decisions. Should certain  points require further discussion, this should be communicated to the Secretariat in advance.   The Jury should be transparent about its decision towards participants and organisers.   The role of an independent jury and referees should be considered.  Scalability   When organising the European Cyber Security Challenge, national organisers should consider the  scalability aspects of the event. The ultimate goal of the ECSC is to grow and expand every year with  regard to quantity and quality.   Establishing a robust framework that includes a clear governance structure, marketing and  communications plan, and other organisational, planning and logistic support is necessary to enable  the ECSC to scale towards the future.   The goal is to formalise the key decisions in a structured way, leading to a framework that reduces  the organisational efforts in the planning and organising of future ECSC events.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  12  5. Recommendations  The following recommendations serve as guidelines for maintaining and increasing the quality of the ECSC  based on the lessons learned as described in the previous chapter4.  Organisation team (ECSC hosting country)   The national organiser should establish a dedicated team to organise the ECSC. The team should  describe clear roles and responsibilities in order to facilitate the correct ownership of tasks and project  management. The team can consist of members of the national organisation body and external  consultants or volunteers.   The organisation team should be in close contact with the pan-European ECSC community to ensure  the implementation of best practices and a coherent communication strategy.   The host should be in close contact with the ECSC Steering Committee and ENISA during the  implementation of the project. Transparent status reporting is crucial.  Attending countries   The hosts for future editions should be established well in advance in order to facilitate proper  planning and budgeting.   Countries interested in attending the challenge should be given the opportunity to announce their  intention at least one year prior to the event.   The scope of the challenge in terms of attending countries should be defined (European vs EU+EFTA).   All countries should ensure that in addition to their team’s players a number of additional (or backup)  team members are chosen and also trained in order to take care of unforeseen events.  Public relations and communication strategy   Establish a common public relations and communications strategy, including social media, to ensure a  consistent approach across all participating States and achieve maximum exposure and visibility.   Encourage and incentivise participants’ social media engagement with the #ECSC20XX tag.   Capture, analyse and share online communication statistics in order to strengthen the ECSC business  case and attract sponsors.  Budget and sponsorship   Establish an attractive sponsoring scheme for private organisations. The sponsoring scheme should  ideally provide multiple levels of sponsorship based on the amount of funding to stimulate substantial  contributions.   Reach out to national government and public organisations to promote the event and potentially  obtain sponsorship and leadership commitment.   Consider the potential of entry fees for non-participants for the conference, job fair and spectating.  Challenge   Ensure the stability and security of the platform during the challenge and take into account any  unforeseen circumstances that might affect the continuity of the event. This includes regular and  adequate testing by the service provider to build capacity to prevent, detect and respond to incidents.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  13   Achieve a challenge design that meets the requirements as set out in the ECSC curricula that takes the  expectations of the participants into account.   Be transparent about any decisions made by the Steering Committee or organisers that could affect  the course of the challenge.   Clearly communicate the rules and agreements to participants on beforehand to avoid any  ambiguity or misunderstanding.   Clearly communicate the agreements and expectations with regard to the presentations. The  content of the presentations should meet the expectations of the participants.   Perform a capacity and quality assessment of the platform service provider in order to ensure the  ability to meet the requirements and expectations of the ECSC.  Logistics   Determine the challenge venue by taking into account the overall connectivity, mobility and  infrastructural capacity. The selected venue should be accessible in a comfortable manner by the  participating teams all over Europe.   Decorate the venue to reflect the activity of the event and meet the participants’ interests.   Transparently communicate unforeseen events with regard to logistics to the participants and  organisers.  Conferences, job fair and social event   Identify and engage with speakers and panellists for the conferences that reflect the interests of the  participants. The conferences should be tailored to the target audience and relate to their interests.   Integrate the conferences in the ECSC so it is not perceived as a necessary side event but rather an  integral part of the overall experience. The conferences should add value to the technical expertise of  the participants rather than promote products, services or organisations.   Ensure a clear link between the cybersecurity challenge and the content of the conferences and  social event. These activities should appeal to the participants.   Encourage private organisations to propose innovative and non-conventional job fair formats that  appeal to the participants. Focus on the mutual benefit for both organisations and students.  Jury and Steering Committee   Define a clear agenda for every Steering Committee and avoid any deviation from the foreseen  timeframe in order to avoid delays and maintain efficient decision-making.   Capture and document all decisions made during the Steering Committee meetings, including  decisions, actions and owners, in a decision-making log.   Transparently communicate the decisions made by the Steering Committee to all relevant  stakeholders including participants and organisers.   Appoint a single point of contact (SPOC) of the platform and service providers to represent the  provider during the ECSC event. This SPOC could join the Steering Committee in case an incident  occurs or a representative of the service provider is required.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  14  Scalability   The national organiser should adequately document the activities related to the organisation of the  European Cyber Security Challenge in order to optimise the process for the following editions.   In order to scale the event, improving the maturity of the organisation process is crucial. The first step  in improving the maturity is to document all steps leading to a successful event. This documentation  stimulates a debate between national organisers, and the exchange of best practices.   All relevant working documents and project management tools should be shared amongst the  national organisers to optimise the process. The intention is to formalise the key decisions in  structured way, leading to a framework that reduces the organisational efforts in the planning and  organising of future ECSC events.

To help  solve this, multiple countries have initiated national cybersecurity competitions for students, security  professionals and even non-IT professionals, all with a common goal: find cyber talents and encourage all  of them to pursue a career in cybersecurity. The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC) builds upon  these competitions adding a pan-European layer.  The ECSC is an initiative of multiple European countries supported by the European Union Agency for  Network and Information Security (ENISA) that aims at engaging cybersecurity talent across Europe and  connecting high potentials.  This report contains a detailed list of the lessons learned from previous ECSCs, of which the key takeaways  are:   The quality of the ECSC is crucial in meeting the participants’ expectations. The scenario, stability and  complexity of the platform used during the ECSC are key success factors in order to provide a  challenging competition that attracts top cyber talent from all over Europe.   Public relations and communication activities are key in order to meet the objectives on participation  and sponsorship.   The event agenda should be tailored to the participants needs and expectations, and include activities  that relate to their interests and subject matter expertise.   Given the current growth objectives of the ECSC (plus five countries per year), solid back-office  processes regarding the organisation of the event are necessary to meet the rising quality expectations  from stakeholders. This includes, amongst others, a proper governance structure with clear roles,  responsibilities, decision-making, agreed-upon principles and rules with regard to fair play and  transparency.   Sharing lessons learned and recommendations between organisers and participating states is crucial  in order to improve the quality of the event and implement best practices.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  05  1. Purpose of this document  The European Cyber Security Challenge is gaining momentum and increasing in scale. In order to meet the  rising quality expectations of all stakeholders, including participants, organisers and sponsors, the capacity  and maturity of the ECSC organisation should increase accordingly.  In order to achieve the target maturity, exchanging lessons learned and recommendations is crucial. This  document aims at listing the observations and improvement areas as captured during previous ECSCs and  at providing guidance for future editions.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  06  2. Methodology  Representative feedback has been captured from both organisers and participants by means of an online  survey and stakeholder interviews. The objective of capturing this feedback was to assess the overall  experience of the attendees and to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement.  The online survey contained both open and closed questions. Open questions encouraged the respondents  to provide qualitative feedback, while the closed questions were included to obtain quantitative feedback  that enabled comparison and statistical analysis.  Stakeholder interviews were held on behalf of ENISA prior to and during the ECSC2017 event. Multiple  conference calls have been set up between previous ECSC organising States to discover key success factors  and best practices. During the ECSC2017 event, stakeholder interviews were held to grasp the overall  experience of the event and to capture any potential issues or improvement areas.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  07  3. ECSC editions  The ECSC has been strongly influenced by an ENISA study on the status of cyber security competitions in  the EU in November 20141. This study assessed the current state with regard to objectives, mission and  vision, and maturity of existing cyber security challenges.  Pre-existing national competitions (Austrian, Swiss, Spanish, Romanian, United Kingdom), and private  challenges were part of the study. The feedback of multiple stakeholders from both private and public  domains were captured and included in the report, resulting in a document that includes guidelines for “a  pan-European cyber challenge competition”.  The main conclusion of the study was that there was a fertile ground for the emergence of a European  level challenge:  “the importance of the European Commission’s active involvement in getting on board policymakers in  Member States, the expertise of the EU’s cybersecurity agency, ENISA, in involving the best experts in  the field and the responsibility of public and private stakeholders in understanding that the target is  set very high and that they should engage to the best of their ability.”  The emergence of the ECSC was thus the result of private and public stakeholders committing to a  common goal: to place cybersecurity at the service of humankind, with a view to promoting a peaceful  society concerned with the preservation of democratic values, freedom of taught, dignity and critical  thinking.  The abovementioned is one of the principles of the European Cyber Security Charter.  The following section gives an overview of all ECSC events until 2016.  ECSC 2014  The ECSC2014 event was the first of its kind and the  initial pilot event; it took place from 3rd to 5th  November 2014 in Fürstenfeld, Austria. The finals  took the form of a competition between teams from  Austria, Germany and Switzerland, who competed  against each other in different live challenges. After  the event, the teams travelled to an awards  ceremony at the Museum of Military History in  Vienna, in the presence of politicians, economists  and representatives of government bodies.  The ECSC 2014 platform and challenges included several challenges such as an APT Network Forensic  Challenge, Java Hash Collisions, HQL injections and License Key Circumventions.  1 Cybersecurity competitions – the status in Europe, ENISA, November 2014.

Six teams from six different countries  (Austria, Germany, Spain, Romania, UK and  Switzerland) attended the event. This edition  marked also the involvement of ENISA in the project.  This year's competition saw a new format in which  teams had to fix security holes in software  applications while attacking other teams' assets.  ECSC 2016  One hundred European cyber security talents, representing 10 EU Member States and EFTA countries, met  in Düsseldorf for the ECSC2016 event from the 7th to the 9th of November.  All teams had to protect their own infrastructure  while attacking that of the opposing teams,  while deciphering hidden messages and solving  hacking challenges.  Participants were able to meet and talk with  representatives of academia  Figure 2 - ECSC 2015 finalists  Figure 3 - ECSC 2016 finalists  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  09  4. Lessons Learned  The following lessons learned serve as guidelines for maintaining and increasing the quality of the ECSC with  regard to logistics, technical challenges, communication, scalability, accommodation and budget.  Public relations and communication strategy   Since creating awareness about the event is key to stimulate the scaling of the Challenge, national  organisers, participating teams and ENISA should define and execute a consistent and optimised  communication strategy in order to meet its full potential.   The potential of social media should be leveraged to obtain maximum exposure amongst the target  audience and the cybersecurity community.   A PR timeline supports this objective by defining dates, channels and messages. The timeline implies a  consistent timing of the publication of posts across multiple channels.   A cross-country PR timeline should be established in collaboration with all participating States and  ENISA to maximise exposure and visibility by maintaining coherence in the communication strategy.  Budget and sponsorship   The national organisers of the previous ECSCs and the ECSC Steering Committee stress that external  sponsorship is key to funding the event.   The national organisers of previous challenges have received significant funding from both private and  public partners. The organisations experienced a very proactive attitude from private organisations  towards offering funding. This is the result of proactive communication about the challenge and  informing the industry of the benefits of a potential sponsorship.   In order to establish an attractive climate for investors, the national organisers established a  sponsorship scheme that results in different benefits according to the funding amount. For example:   Gold sponsorship (full exposure, access to talent, additional marketing and advertising opportunities)   Silver sponsorship (medium exposure, access to talent)   Bronze sponsorship (limited exposure)   Sponsors that obtain access to talent should tailor their presence to the expectations of the audience.  Traditional “HR booths” do not appeal to cyber security talent. The sponsors should be encouraged  to explore innovative and non-conventional ways to interact with participants. This will result in a  high return-on-investment from the sponsors’ perspective, and a high satisfaction rate from the  participants’ perspective.   Sponsors that provide conferences or presentations should tailor the content to the target audience.  Challenge  Design   Participants expect a challenge that is encouraging them to push their limits and expect to face  situations that involve multiple aspects of cybersecurity such as capture-the-flags (CTF) and jeopardy.   The design of the technical challenges should reflect a reasonable learning curve in accordance with  the level of the participants. The design should anticipate a divergent level of expertise by involving  self-contained steps and real-time feedback in order to support contestants to reach the next steps.   The challenges should reflect real-life scenarios that prepare the participants for their future career.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  10   The technical infrastructure of the challenge should be secure and resilient in order to guarantee  availability during the competition. A loss of availability of the challenge platform drastically affects the  overall experience.   The scoring mechanism should be transparent with regard to attribution and distribution of points  over the challenge.   The challenge design should aim at maximizing the interaction between the teams in order to  stimulate the competitive aspect of the challenge.   The design of the challenges should also take into account the continuous growth of the competition.  Service providers   The service providers should guarantee the functionality and security of the challenge platforms and  supporting systems.   The service providers should foresee measures in order to prevent, detect and respond to any  incidents that could impact the availability and integrity of their systems. This includes, but is not  limited to testing of infrastructure and platform and setting up back-up infrastructure.   The service providers should provide adequate support during the competition to participants and  organisers in case of incidents in order to safeguard the continuity of the competition.   The host and the ECSC Steering Committee should closely follow-up with the service providers on the  progress of the platform development and deployment in order to detect, prevent and respond to  events that might affect the delivery of the platform.  Rules   The rules should be clear, unambiguous and agreed-upon by all participating countries.   Clear communication about the rules to the teams is key to ensure the fairness of the competition.   Compliance to the rules should be monitored and taken into account in order to avoid malicious  activities such as cheating or unfair competition.   Amendments to the rules should be backed-up by reasonable argumentation and discussed during  the Steering Committee meetings at the earliest convenience.  Presentations   The presentations held by the participants as part of the Challenge should be aligned with the  objectives of the challenge with regard to building expertise.   Clear guidelines on the practicalities such as the submission should be provided from the Jury and  organisers to the participants.  Logistics   The location should be determined taking into account the overall connectivity and infrastructural  capacity. The selected venue and city should be able to provide accommodation capacity, reliable and  qualitative infrastructure, as well as efficient accessibility for participating teams from all over Europe.   Selecting the accommodation and location of events should reflect – and be tailored to – the  preferences of the participants.   Taking into account the satisfaction of the sponsors in terms of exposure to talent, the location should  also consider the student and talent population within the region. Having multiple universities is an  asset that positively influences the exposure of private organisations towards students, and stimulates  the attendance rate to the side conference and job fair.   Should a national organiser believe the ECSC date should be rescheduled, this should be formally  brought up in a timely manner to the complete ECSC group to avoid overlap or conflicts with other  national initiatives.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  11   In general, the earliest time to organise the ECSC event is October. Any deviation from the original  planning should be discussed and decided upon with the formal input of all the members of the ECSC  organisation.   When unforeseen logistical problems arise, the participants and organisers should be informed  immediately.  Conferences, job fair and social event   Although cybersecurity puzzles are the focus of the event, activities such as the conferences, job fair  and social event add value to the ECSC. The link between these events and the actual challenge  should be established and these activities should be embedded in the event.   The ECSC should not be seen as another traditional cyber security conference, but rather focuses on  the potential added value of the challenge where top cyber security talent from Europe are invited to  compete, collaborate, meet and network with private sector organisations.   The social event agenda and activities should reflect the interests of the participants.   The conferences should be tailored to the target audience and add value to the development of  technical knowledge.   The job fair and recruiting activities should be embedded and aligned with the actual conference.  Traditional “booth job fairs” should be reconsidered as they have limited effect on participants. The  involved private organisations should be encouraged to propose innovative and non–conventional  recruiting activities.  Jury and Steering Committee   The Steering Committee should focus on its main function of being a decision making body that  serves the improvement of the ECSC. The efficiency of the Steering Committee is crucial in order to  implement recommendations and increase the maturity and capacity of the event.   The Steering Committee meetings should be highly effective and have a clear and agreed-upon  agenda that is strictly followed to ensure all topics are covered and timing is respected.   Decisions taken by the Steering Committee should be logged in a decision-making register that  allows for reference in following meetings. This logbook will contain information about decisions,  owners and actions.   The Steering Committee meetings should not reflect upon already taken decisions. Should certain  points require further discussion, this should be communicated to the Secretariat in advance.   The Jury should be transparent about its decision towards participants and organisers.   The role of an independent jury and referees should be considered.  Scalability   When organising the European Cyber Security Challenge, national organisers should consider the  scalability aspects of the event. The ultimate goal of the ECSC is to grow and expand every year with  regard to quantity and quality.   Establishing a robust framework that includes a clear governance structure, marketing and  communications plan, and other organisational, planning and logistic support is necessary to enable  the ECSC to scale towards the future.   The goal is to formalise the key decisions in a structured way, leading to a framework that reduces  the organisational efforts in the planning and organising of future ECSC events.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  12  5. Recommendations  The following recommendations serve as guidelines for maintaining and increasing the quality of the ECSC  based on the lessons learned as described in the previous chapter4.  Organisation team (ECSC hosting country)   The national organiser should establish a dedicated team to organise the ECSC. The team should  describe clear roles and responsibilities in order to facilitate the correct ownership of tasks and project  management. The team can consist of members of the national organisation body and external  consultants or volunteers.   The organisation team should be in close contact with the pan-European ECSC community to ensure  the implementation of best practices and a coherent communication strategy.   The host should be in close contact with the ECSC Steering Committee and ENISA during the  implementation of the project. Transparent status reporting is crucial.  Attending countries   The hosts for future editions should be established well in advance in order to facilitate proper  planning and budgeting.   Countries interested in attending the challenge should be given the opportunity to announce their  intention at least one year prior to the event.   The scope of the challenge in terms of attending countries should be defined (European vs EU+EFTA).   All countries should ensure that in addition to their team’s players a number of additional (or backup)  team members are chosen and also trained in order to take care of unforeseen events.  Public relations and communication strategy   Establish a common public relations and communications strategy, including social media, to ensure a  consistent approach across all participating States and achieve maximum exposure and visibility.   Encourage and incentivise participants’ social media engagement with the #ECSC20XX tag.   Capture, analyse and share online communication statistics in order to strengthen the ECSC business  case and attract sponsors.  Budget and sponsorship   Establish an attractive sponsoring scheme for private organisations. The sponsoring scheme should  ideally provide multiple levels of sponsorship based on the amount of funding to stimulate substantial  contributions.   Reach out to national government and public organisations to promote the event and potentially  obtain sponsorship and leadership commitment.   Consider the potential of entry fees for non-participants for the conference, job fair and spectating.  Challenge   Ensure the stability and security of the platform during the challenge and take into account any  unforeseen circumstances that might affect the continuity of the event. This includes regular and  adequate testing by the service provider to build capacity to prevent, detect and respond to incidents.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  13   Achieve a challenge design that meets the requirements as set out in the ECSC curricula that takes the  expectations of the participants into account.   Be transparent about any decisions made by the Steering Committee or organisers that could affect  the course of the challenge.   Clearly communicate the rules and agreements to participants on beforehand to avoid any  ambiguity or misunderstanding.   Clearly communicate the agreements and expectations with regard to the presentations. The  content of the presentations should meet the expectations of the participants.   Perform a capacity and quality assessment of the platform service provider in order to ensure the  ability to meet the requirements and expectations of the ECSC.  Logistics   Determine the challenge venue by taking into account the overall connectivity, mobility and  infrastructural capacity. The selected venue should be accessible in a comfortable manner by the  participating teams all over Europe.   Decorate the venue to reflect the activity of the event and meet the participants’ interests.   Transparently communicate unforeseen events with regard to logistics to the participants and  organisers.  Conferences, job fair and social event   Identify and engage with speakers and panellists for the conferences that reflect the interests of the  participants. The conferences should be tailored to the target audience and relate to their interests.   Integrate the conferences in the ECSC so it is not perceived as a necessary side event but rather an  integral part of the overall experience. The conferences should add value to the technical expertise of  the participants rather than promote products, services or organisations.   Ensure a clear link between the cybersecurity challenge and the content of the conferences and  social event. These activities should appeal to the participants.   Encourage private organisations to propose innovative and non-conventional job fair formats that  appeal to the participants. Focus on the mutual benefit for both organisations and students.  Jury and Steering Committee   Define a clear agenda for every Steering Committee and avoid any deviation from the foreseen  timeframe in order to avoid delays and maintain efficient decision-making.   Capture and document all decisions made during the Steering Committee meetings, including  decisions, actions and owners, in a decision-making log.   Transparently communicate the decisions made by the Steering Committee to all relevant  stakeholders including participants and organisers.   Appoint a single point of contact (SPOC) of the platform and service providers to represent the  provider during the ECSC event. This SPOC could join the Steering Committee in case an incident  occurs or a representative of the service provider is required.  The European Cyber Security Challenge: Lessons Learned report  Version 1.0  |  December 2017  14  Scalability   The national organiser should adequately document the activities related to the organisation of the  European Cyber Security Challenge in order to optimise the process for the following editions.   In order to scale the event, improving the maturity of the organisation process is crucial. The first step  in improving the maturity is to document all steps leading to a successful event. This documentation  stimulates a debate between national organisers, and the exchange of best practices.   All relevant working documents and project management tools should be shared amongst the  national organisers to optimise the process. The intention is to formalise the key decisions in  structured way, leading to a framework that reduces the organisational efforts in the planning and  organising of future ECSC events.

The efficiency of the Steering Committee is crucial in order to implement recommendations and increase the  maturity and capacity of the event.  ● The Steering Committee meetings should be highly effective and have a clear and agreed-upon agenda that is strictly  followed to ensure all topics are covered and timing is respected.  ● Decisions taken by the Steering Committee should be logged in a decision-making register that allows for reference in  following meetings. This logbook will contain information about decisions, owners and actions.  ● The Steering Committee meetings should not reflect upon already taken decisions. Should certain points require further  discussion, this should be communicated to the Secretariat in advance.  ● The Jury should be transparent about its decision towards participants and organisers.  Timeframe Implementation actions  1 year before next ECSC   Define a clear agenda for every Steering Committee and avoid any deviation from the  foreseen timeframe in order to avoid delays and maintain efficient decision-making.   Capture and document all decisions made during the Steering Committee meetings, including  decisions, actions and owners, in a decision-making log.   Transparently communicate the decisions made by the Steering Committee to all relevant  stakeholders including participants and organisers.   Appoint a single point of contact (SPOC) of the platform provider to represent the provider  during the ECSC event. This SPOC could join the Steering Committee in case an incident  occurs or a representative of the service provider is required.

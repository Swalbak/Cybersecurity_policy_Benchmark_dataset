Qualified trust service providers  (QTSPs) and the qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide are bound by more stringent  responsibilities, including in relation to quality and supervision.  As a prerequisite to entering the market and providing QTS, a prospective QTSP/QTS must first  be audited by an eIDAS accredited conformity assessment body (CAB) to confirm, through a  conformity assessment (audit) report (a CAR) that the QTSP and the QTS it provides meet the  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Once the CAR has been created, the prospective QTSP  must provide notice of its intention to provide QTS to its competent national supervisory body  (SB). The SB will verify the conformance of the prospective QTSP/QTS to the eIDAS Regulation  based on the submitted CAR and will grant or decline a qualified status.  The eIDAS Regulation however does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any  conformity assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited.  Instead, the eIDAS Regulation requires the CAB to be accredited in the framework of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008], which is the generic European regulation in  relation to accreditation. It furthermore requires that the conformity assessment scheme (CAS)  used by the CAB is eIDAS specific.  Currently, 30 eIDAS CABs are accredited to perform conformity assessments in 11 EU Member  States (MS), based on an accreditation scheme, which is recommended by the European  cooperation for Accreditation (EA). The EA is the body recognised under Regulation (EC) No  765/2008 to manage a peer evaluation system across national accreditation bodies (NABs)  from the EU Member States and other European countries. However, this scheme is not  mandatory under the eIDAS Regulation, and EU MS may therefore elect to choose another  scheme, provided that it can be shown to satisfy the eIDAS requirements. The scheme chosen  requires eIDAS CABs to be certification bodies meeting the requirements of ISO/IEC 17065  supplemented by EN 319 403, with the eIDAS Regulation itself being the normative document  against which the conformance of QTSP/QTS needs to be evaluated. The competence of the  CAB to conduct such evaluations needs to be accredited by its NAB.  The challenge – variations in practice and the need for better harmonisation  A specific feature of the eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by the EA, and intrinsically  of the eIDAS Regulation as the normative document, is that the requirements against which the  QTSP/QTS must be certified are technology neutral legal requirements, expressed in terms of  functional objectives. Furthermore, no standard may be mandatorily imposed upon the QTSP  for providing QTS in conformance with the Regulation in order not to negatively impact  innovation and/or harm competition.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  7  In addition, no eIDAS secondary legislation has been adopted to date to reference any standard  that would create a legal presumption of compliance with any requirement of the eIDAS  Regulation for the QTSP. As a result, there is significant margin of interpretation and for policy  choices in creating, interpreting and applying accreditation and certification approaches.  The difference in approach and in assessment effort for accreditation of CABs and for the  certification of QTSP/QTS is reported by a vast majority of stakeholders (including EA) as  hindering the mutual recognition of accredited certification of electronic trust services.  The present report aims to propose ways in which the eIDAS assessment regime can be  strengthened based on the current regime of the eIDAS Regulation, the stakeholders’ concerns  and the legitimate need to move towards a more harmonised approach with regards to the  assessment by CABs of the conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of that Regulation.  It focuses in particular on actions towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for  QTSP/QTS.  The solution – potential roads forward  This report lists the following recommendations in moving towards a harmonised CAS for  QTSP/QTS:   Actions regarding legal instrument(s). Formalisation of the CAS by the European  Commission as an official scheme with legal recognition across EU via legal  document(s).   Actions regarding the design of the harmonised CAS. The design of a harmonised  CAS by ENISA and the European Commission (under the Cybersecurity Act) or by the  European Commission (under the eIDAS Regulation) can be based on ISO/IEC 17065,  EN 319 403-1 and TS 119 403-3 “Additional req. for CABs assessing EU QTSPs”,  designed in accordance with ISO/IEC 17067 “Fundamentals of product certification  and guidelines for product certification schemes”.   Actions regarding continuous improvement of CAS: Define process and involved  actors for a harmonised CAS, governed by a scheme management authority (i.e.  scheme owner) together with EU-wide representative working group, under a defined  review method.   Quick wins. EA, ETSI, and CABs actions could be implemented by each of them  individually in the short term. Examples constitute the update of EN 319 403 and  consequently TS 119 403-3, the update of EA-recommendations to refer to TS 119  403-3, and the non-issuance of certificates of conformity with identified pending non-  conformities.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 SETTING THE SCENE  Regulation (EU) N°910/2014, on electronic identification and trust services for electronic  transactions in the internal market [eIDAS, 2014] (hereinafter eIDAS Regulation), introduced  legal provisions at the EU level in relation to qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) listed in  the Regulation, and to the qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide (hereinafter collectively  referred to as QTSP/QTSs).  A key policy choice made by the eIDAS Regulation is that, in order to be granted qualified  status that allows providing QTSs, trust service providers (TSPs) and the QTSs they plan to  make available must first demonstrate that they meet the requirements of the Regulation. This  implies that TSPs and the QTSs at hand need to undergo a specific process and receive a  ‘green light’ from a competent national supervisory body (SB) to attest to their compliance. If  successful, this process then leads to their inclusion in the national trusted list attesting their  qualified status.  As part of this process, the prospective QTSP/QTS must be audited by an eIDAS accredited  conformity assessment body (CAB) to confirm, through a conformity assessment (audit) report  (CAR), that they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  As the next step of the process, the prospective QTSP notifies its intention to provide QTS to its  competent national supervisory body (SB) together with the positive CAR resulting from such an  assessment. Considering such CAR, the SB will verify the conformance of the prospective  QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation and will decide to whether or not to grant, a qualified  status.  Figure 1. eIDAS QTSP/QTS compliance assessment and verification process  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  9  The eIDAS Regulation does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any conformity  assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited. Instead, the  eIDAS Regulation requires the CAB to be accredited:   In the framework of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008]   For the execution of a conformity assessment scheme that is eIDAS specific, i.e.  confirming that, for a specific type of QTSP/QTS, a QTSP/QTS is meeting the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The European cooperation for Accreditation1 (EA) is the body recognised under Regulation (EC)  No 765/2008 to manage a peer evaluation system across national accreditation bodies (NABs)  from the EU Member States and other European countries. EA has adopted the  recommendation2 to use an eIDAS accreditation scheme based on the [ISO/IEC 17065]  accreditation framework, supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403], as one possible route for CABs  to assess conformity with relevant requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by the EA requires:   The accreditation of the CAB is based on the [ISO/IEC 17065] framework.   The [ISO/IEC 17065] accreditation framework of the CAB to be supplemented by [ETSI  EN 319 403], which specifies additional dedicated requirements for CABs carrying out  the certification of TSP/TS, towards defined criteria against which they claim  conformance (those criteria being identified as the “Normative Document”).   The accreditation of the CAB to confirm the skills and competence of the CAB to  conduct conformity assessments of QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. Indeed, the scheme defines the Regulation as the Normative Document  laying down criteria/requirements against which the QTSP/QTS conformance is to be  assessed.  Figure 2: eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by EA  A specific characteristic of the eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by the EA, and  intrinsically of the eIDAS Regulation as Normative Document, is that the requirements against  which the QTSP/QTS have to be certified are not technical requirements, but technology neutral  legal requirements expressed in terms of functional objectives. This is largely a continuation of  the eIDAS Regulation general policy preference for technical neutrality. The Normative  1 http://www.european-accreditation.org/  2 EA Resolution 2014 (34) 22 and EA document EAGA(14)31: https://european-accreditation.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/10/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-.pdf  http://www.european-accreditation.org/ https://european-accreditation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-.pdf https://european-accreditation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-.pdf  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  10  Document is therefore not a technical standard but the QTSP/QTS applicable requirements  from the eIDAS Regulation itself. Neither the eIDAS Regulation nor the EA specify the effective  technical criteria or the technical certification scheme stemming from the provisions of the  eIDAS Regulation.  Furthermore, no standard is mandated, and no standard may be mandated, under the eIDAS  Regulation, in relation to QTSPs or QTS to be granted a qualified status. QTSPs are free to  implement any standard, or they may choose to implement no standard at all, provided they can  demonstrate that they and the QTS provided meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Finally, no eIDAS secondary legislation has been adopted to date to reference any standard  that would create a legal presumption of compliance with any requirement of the eIDAS  Regulation for the QTSP that choose to adhere to that standard or for the QTS it provides.  However, even if such secondary legislation would have been adopted, compliance to such  standards would still remain voluntary for QTSPs: their use remains optional.  1.2 THE NEED FOR A HARMONISED eIDAS QTSP/QTS CERTIFICATION  SCHEME  The eIDAS accreditation approach that is recommended by the EA has been widely adopted by  the European NABs (national accreditation bodies) that have accredited CABs in the context of  the eIDAS Regulation. However, based on the situation described above and the legal and  policy choices made by the European legislator, there is still significant diversity regarding the  conformity assessment (certification) schemes used by those CABs in practice. This diversity  results from the current accreditation framework that de facto requires CABs to define their own  conformity assessment scheme.  There is no obligation for NABs or competent national supervisory bodies to provide guidance to  CABs for designing an appropriate eIDAS conformity assessment scheme. It seems that very  few NAB actually mandate CABs they accredit to go through a specific, [ISO/IEC 17067] based,  process to define such an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme. Amongst the few other NABs  and/or supervisory bodies, that are providing guidance on the list of controls and control  objectives that should be used to assess QTSP/QTSs conformance to eIDAS, most of them are  leveraging on ETSI standards3, as is or by profiling them.  Despite the fact that most of the certification schemes defined by CABs (with or without  guidance from competent authorities) are in whole or in part based on ETSI standards, when  such standards are available, there is no visible coordination and no enforcement of a single  scheme at EU level.  The quality of those standards, their adequacy for use by QTSP/QTSs to meet the requirements  of the eIDAS Regulation and hence their eligibility for being referenced to meet the  requirements are still to be formally assessed and demonstrated.  Most CABs do not make conformity assessment scheme documents they use in practice  publicly available. As a result, relying parties are hampered in their legitimate quest for trust and  accountability, and cannot obtain a reasonable confidence that QTSP/QTSs meet the  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Furthermore, despite the peer review mechanism imposed at the level of NABs by Regulation  (EC) 765/2008, there is little or no assurance on the quality of the currently accredited CAB  certification schemes to enable the CAB to confirm effectively that assessed QTSP/QTSs meet  3 See section 6.2.2.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  11  the eIDAS requirements. QTSPs may use a CAB located anywhere in the EU and accredited by  a NAB from a different country than the one in which the QTSP is established. Supervisory  bodies experienced that CARs from different eIDAS accredited CABs may differ significantly not  only a difference in the formal approach used by such CABs, but also and more importantly a  diversity in terms of quality and adequacy of their assessments against the eIDAS Regulation.  Concerning non-EU countries, it became clear that the IAF MLA driven accreditation scheme  based on [ISO/IEC 17065] (potentially supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403]) is a candidate for  such countries to base their national QTSP/QTS certification scheme on, particularly for other  QTS than issuing qualified certificates4. Moreover, it is possible and usual for such 3rd countries  to expand and finalise the ETSI EN 319 403-based scheme by the establishment of a  harmonised, specific and complete certification scheme. This scheme will lay down to a  sufficient level of technical details, the exact set of controls and control objectives that the CAB  will have to use to conduct a conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against more generic legal  provisions. This may be facilitated by the fact that national legislations may reference standards  as binding normative documents (contrary to the eIDAS Regulation). Moreover, 3rd countries  point out that the EA recommended scheme is incomplete and falls short of a harmonised  eIDAS certification scheme. This jeopardizes a mutual recognition of EU QTSP/QTSs, simply  because the diversity in conducting the audits of QTSP/QTS over EU might not guarantee an  acceptable level of reliability compared to the 3rd country applicable scheme.  Figure 3: Existing diversity in CAS creates issues  One of the prime purposes of the eIDAS Regulation is to establish an EU wide recognition of  the legal effects attributed to qualified trust services and their outputs (e.g. “A qualified  electronic signature based on a qualified certificate issued in one Member State shall be  recognised as a qualified electronic signature in all other Member States”, Art.25(3)). To this  4 The scheme based on ISO/IEC 17065 and supplemented by ETSI EN 319 403 is applicable to any type of TSP/TS for  being assessed to any type of standard, technical specification or regulation. It is completely independent of the eIDAS  Regulation. The EA recommended eIDAS scheme is adding to this generic scheme the eIDAS Regulation as the normative  documents against which the QTSP/QTS need to be assessed conformant. Any non-EU 3rd country may act similarly by  adding its own regulatory or technical specifications as normative criteria against which national TSP/TS need to be  assessed conformant.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  12  extent, it is critical for the requirements against which QTSP/QTSs are assessed to be  comprehensive, consistently applied and sufficiently detailed to reduce the scope for variances  in the assurance provided in the trustworthiness across different QTSP/QTSs. The lack of a  harmonised scheme concerning the accreditation of CABs and the conformity assessment  (certification) of QTSP/QTSs may:   Introduce risks due to inconsistent standards and controls being applied.   Diminish potentially the overall confidence in the eIDAS regulated QTSs.   Impact negatively the trustworthiness and acceptability of these QTSs not only in the EU  internal market, but also when interoperability with non-EU countries or international  organisations is considered, and when recognition of QTSs in widely deployed  applications or browsers is targeted.  Therefore, a key issue to address is the move toward harmonisation of conformity assessment  of QTSP/QTSs, and of related conformity assessment schemes in particular.  1.3 PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT  The present report aims to propose ways in which the eIDAS assessment regime can be  strengthened based on the current regime of the eIDAS Regulation, stakeholders’ concerns and  legitimate needs to move towards a more harmonised approach for the assessment of the  conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of that Regulation,. It focusses in particular on  actions towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS.   Section 2 describes inputs collected from relevant stakeholders on the assessment of  QTSP/QTSs in the context of eIDAS.   Section 3 analyses the available legal framework and instruments to support actions  towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS.   Section 4 analyses the gaps towards such a harmonised scheme.   Section 5 proposes concrete actions towards such a harmonised eIDAS QTSP/QTS  conformity assessment scheme.

STAKEHOLDERS’ INPUTS  2.1 INTRODUCTION  This part addresses inputs concerning the assessment of QTSP/QTSs in the context of eIDAS  as collected from relevant stakeholders, including (Supervisory Bodies) SBs, NABs, CABs,  QTSPs, and other stakeholders such as browser or application vendors.  2.2 THE VIEWPOINT OF SUPERVISORY BODIES  2.2.1 Foreword  The study team received inputs from 7 SBs out of the 31 SBs. All responsive SBs agree on the  need for harmonisation of QTSP/QTSs conformity assessment (or certification) schemes used  by eIDAS accredited CABs. Their main inputs may be summarised as follows.  2.2.2 On the EA recommended accreditation scheme  While the EA recommended scheme based on ISO/IEC 17065 in combination with [ETSI EN  319 403] is accepted to be the correct way in going forward towards harmonising the eIDAS  CAB accreditation and QTSP/QTS certification schemes at the EU level, the need for a number  of improvements have been identified by most of the responsive Member States:  a) Clarification on details and content of audit reports and conformity declarations:   It appears that at times, NABs might not be fully aware of the importance and the  purpose of the CAR in the eIDAS framework. The fact that the CAR must be sent to  the SB (where in general use of the [ISO/IEC 17065] for product or service certification,  the assessment report is for the certification holder only) and the fact that the SB relies  heavily on the content and the completeness of the CAR are new to most of the actors  involved. In the context of its recommended eIDAS scheme, the EA should consider  clarifying the importance of the CAR as essential input for the decision of the SB and  that no barrier should be placed to its dissemination to the competent SB.   The recent publication of [ETSI TS 119 403-3] is welcomed as it specifies additional  requirements for CABs assessing eIDAS QTSP/QTSs focusing on the structure and  content of eIDAS CAR. The CAR is an essential element for the SB to base its  SB / EU MS  Urging for harmonised CAS, with:   Clarifying CAR details and contents   Hermonisation in NABs delivering accreditation   Handling multipurpose audits (need for clear eIDAS compliance statement)   Clarifying composite certification approach   Allowing for national specificities   Clear ownership and maintenance   Legal instrument support  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  14  verification of the compliance of the assessed QTSP/QTS with the applicable eIDAS  requirements and, if granting a qualified status, to express in a correct way the  corresponding qualification decision in the Trusted List. Responsive SBs experience  significant differences in the scope and quality of the received CARs (e.g. minimum  content not always present, length and level of details highly varied and sometimes  insufficient, occurrences of significant errors or omissions, and sometimes not  sufficiently elaborated evaluation reports). EA should consider extending its currently  recommended eIDAS scheme with this [ETSI TS 119 403-3] standard.   The next update of the current version of [ETSI EN 319 403] (expected to be published  under the reference EN 319 403-1) should also be considered for updating the current  EA recommended scheme. Particularly, EN 319 403-1 should include important  corrections regarding the management of non-conformities in the process of issuing  certification declarations (attestations). Reporting requirements and the way for  handling non-conformities and/or other non-critical issues (e.g. area of improvements)  must be part of the accreditation scheme.   Further guidance should be provided on the minimum audit time and effort for  completion of the full assessment and surveillance assessment respectively. The  quality and the credibility of an assessment are based primarily5 on two factors: (1) the  audit time for completion of full assessment and (2) the level of expert-knowledge of  the auditor/audit team. Taking into consideration that these factors are also the main  cost-drivers, the risk exists that in a competitive market, the quality and credibility of  the assessment becomes subordinate to the price of the assessment.  b) Further harmonization between the different NABs delivering accreditation:   The way NABs are wording the scope of the accreditation of CABs in the context of  eIDAS is far from being harmonised. The feeling exists that the NABs are not fully aware  of the nine types of QTSP/QTSs specified in the eIDAS Regulation and that the  corresponding certification scheme(s) must target the corresponding requirements (or  articles) of the eIDAS Regulation.   The way CAB accreditation certificates are maintained by NABs is also not harmonised  and does not seem to ensure the provision of historical information regarding the grant  of the accreditation on a per QTSP/QTS type basis.   When the EA recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme is not used or not entirely  used, it is not easy to identify whether the alternative scheme has been determined  equivalent and under which basis. From a supervisory point of view, responsive SBs  believe it is highly desirable to have [ETSI EN 319 403] being part of the requirements.  2.2.3  (Multipurpose) Certification scheme  Most of the eIDAS certification schemes used by CABs, that the reporting SBs have  experienced, are based on relevant ETSI standards. Especially for certificate-based trust  services, many of these schemes are multi-purpose certification schemes. They include  requirements from the CA/Browser Forum (Baseline [BRG] and EV [EVG]) as well as  local/national requirements.  Already in the context of a single-purpose (eIDAS) certification scheme, it is experienced that it  can be very difficult to identify which certification scheme, and hence which requirements,  criteria, checks and/or tests, have been used by the CAB to conduct the assessment and the  extent to which they have been used. Even if the certification scheme is referred to in the CAR,  5 Other factors such as for example efficient audit procedures and used tools for automation of audits should be taken into  account to define the quality and the credibility of an assessment.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  15  it is not always clear which concrete measures are put in place by the QTSP and assessed by  the CAB before delivering a conformity attestation.  As the eIDAS requirements are expressed in terms of functional objectives, there is a need for  more concrete criteria (technical and organizational) for allowing proper assessment. The use of  the QTSP/QTS relevant requirements in the appropriate ETSI and CEN standards are  recommended as a basis for designing QTSP/QTSs harmonised certification schemes. It is  believed that this can be done in a way not hindering the technology neutral approach of the  eIDAS Regulation and leaving QTSP freedom of choosing the technical standards of choice.  Reporting requirements and the way for handling non-conformities and/or other non-critical  issues (e.g. area of improvements) must be part of the certification scheme if not explicitly  handled in the accreditation scheme.  In general, and in particular for multi-purpose certification schemes, it is advised to make use of  as many distinct declarations (attestations) of conformity as there are identified purposes.  There is an expectation that a good policy choice to develop eIDAS certification schemes could  stem from the recommendations of [ISO/IEC 17067].  2.2.4 Composite certification approach  Splitting operations and responsibilities regarding the provision of a trust service into various  component services used between the TSP itself and 3rd parties is common practice among  customers. For example, a TSP issuing electronic certificates may limit its effective operation to  bear the overall and final liability on the trust service it provides on its contracted customers,  while outsourcing completely the operation of all component services (including registration and  enrolment of customers (RA), certificate validity status information services, repository services,  PKI factory services, etc).  It is also a trend for such 3rd parties to specialize in the provision of (Q)TS component services  and to offer their expertise to many different TSPs.  Responsive Member States believe that a harmonised certification model to allow different  (Q)TS components to be assessed independently, with the aim for an appropriate aggregation  to support the assessment of the overall (Q)TS, without having to repeat a full assessment of all  components again. This would allow the CAB to take into consideration earlier audit  reports/certification decisions when performing the assessment of a QTSP/QTS. Rules for  accepting existing and underlying certification must nevertheless be established, e.g.:   Valid certificate not older than “x” (e.g.12) months;   Components may only be used as long as they maintain a valid certification of an  accredited CAB;   Usage of the component must be discontinued once the components certification  expires or is withdrawn;   The way earlier assessments and certifications are taken into account must be described  in the certification scheme and documented in the assessment report;   Verifying how an earlier “generic” certification of a component service applies in the case  of a specific instantiation (or use) of that certified component service in the context of  the assessment of the overall QTS. The integration of the component service into the  assessed QTS must be examined: in particular the interface(s) through which the  component is integrated must be considered.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  16  The certification of “Remote QSCD operation and management”6, of “(Q)TS managed service  components”, of “registration authorities” and in particular the certification of \"remote  identification procedures\" foreseen in Art.24(1) of eIDAS are amongst the first composite  certification schemes needed.  2.2.5 Nationally defined schemes – Private schemes  In several Member States, a scheme for the accreditation of CABs and for the certification of  QTSP/QTSs has been defined and managed either by a national competent authority (usually a  SB, or a NAB in collaboration with a SB) or by a private entity.  While most, when not all, of these schemes are built upon the same set of European standards  (e.g. ETSI x19 xxx and CEN 419 xxx series) and international standards, they include variances  (sometimes significant) in the standard references or profiling. This may induce  different/unequal treatment of CAB between Member States and force CABs willing to operate  in different Member States to consider as many different interpretations as there are nationally-  defined schemes, despite the “certified once, recognised everywhere” International  Accreditation Forum IAF principle to which European NABs and Regulation (EU) 765/2008  subscribe.  2.2.6 Ownership and maintenance of harmonised certification scheme  As a lesson learned from experience with such nationally-defined or private schemes,  responsive EU MS believe it is vital to have an active scheme owner that maintains the scheme  and provides documented guidance on how to apply it. TSPs tend to innovate, technology is in  constant evolution, and so are the risks and challenges around trust services. This means CABs  using the certification scheme will encounter new situations and will require guidance on how to  apply the scheme in consequence. The work of harmonising an EU-wide eIDAS certification  scheme would be incomplete if it did not address appropriately how the scheme can be  maintained and how harmonised guidance can be provided to its users in the future.  2.2.7 Legal instruments  Responsive SBs believe guidance on the accreditation scheme for CABs should be settled in  EU legislation. They stress the current absence of implementing acts, in particular concerning  CAB accreditation and rules on auditing and audit reporting (i.e. Art.20. 4 of eIDAS) but also  concerning QTSP/QTS requirements. Some of those SBs would prefer to see CAB related  standards become mandatory.  6 Note the ILNAS, the LU SB, provide “requirements for qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates for  electronic signature or for electronic seal in the case where the electronic signature creation data resp. electronic seal  creation data are managed by the qualified trust service provider on behalf of the signatory resp. creator of seal”. CAB has  to check whether those requirements are fulfilled.  https://portail-qualite.public.lu/content/dam/qualite/fr/documentations/confiance-numerique/surveillance- psc/procedures/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en.pdf  https://portail-qualite.public.lu/content/dam/qualite/fr/documentations/confiance-numerique/surveillance-psc/procedures/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en.pdf https://portail-qualite.public.lu/content/dam/qualite/fr/documentations/confiance-numerique/surveillance-psc/procedures/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en.pdf  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  17  2.3 THE VIEWPOINT OF NATIONAL ACCREDITATION BODIES  2.3.1 EA inputs  EA has recommended [ETSI EN 319 403], supplementing the [ISO/IEC 17065] accreditation  framework as a suitable scheme for the accreditation of CABs assessing QTSP/QTSs against  the eIDAS Regulation as normative document. It is a preferred option, not a compulsory one.  Each NAB may adopt it for use or use another scheme, provided the framework they use is  equivalent to [ETSI EN 319 403] (at least, if they are EA members). E.g. UKAS uses two  schemes, namely [ETSI EN 319 403] and tScheme7.  The EA may not impose its recommended ISO/IEC17065+EN319403+eIDAS scheme; it may  simply try to convince competent authorities of the merits when using it. The eIDAS Regulation  does not give any mandate to the EA for doing so and is not specific for what regards  accreditation8. The EA believes it would be up to the EC, or the legislative body, to make a  decision on the (mandatory) use of [ETSI 319 403].  Note 1: Ideally, [ETSI TS 119 403-3] should better be used as the basis for the EA  recommended eIDAS scheme, supplementing [ETSI EN 319 403], or even better  supplementing the next updated version of that EN to be published as ETSI EN 319  403-1.  Note 2: The adoption of an implementing Act pursuant to Art.20.4 of eIDAS would  allow referring to [ETSI 319 403] or better [ETSI TS 119 403-3] further supplementing  its updated version EN 319 403-1. However, it is unlikely that these standards will be  made mandatory via this legal instrument to NAB for the accreditation of CABs under  eIDAS (and for CABs to carry out their conformity assessment of the qualified trust  7 https://www.tscheme.org/  8 Basically, it is the same issue as the one that applies for TSP’s audit criteria but at the level of the CAB’s accreditation  framework.  SB / EU MS  Agreeing on benefits from harmonised CAS   EA has no mandate/authority to define CAS or to amend standards to refine scheme   Cureent EA recommended scheme may be exended to CAR specification (e.g. TS 119  403-3)   Current EA recommeneded scheme might be promoted at IAF level  https://www.tscheme.org/  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  18  service providers). The current revision process of the eIDAS Regulation would also be  an option for the amended Regulation to be more prescriptive on the standards for  accrediting CABs, for the conformity assessment report and for the rules on conducting  QTSP assessments. Another option would be the certification scheme adoption  process foreseen in the EU Cybersecurity Act [CyberAct, 2019]. Section 3 in this report  sets outfurther discussions on appropriate legal instruments.  The EA recognises that having one single accreditation/certification scheme would be beneficial  and that this scheme should go as deep as to address the scoping against the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. At such a deeper level, EA noted that there is however  no guidance at the EA level on scoping [ETSI EN 319 403] against the Regulation being the  normative document. In other words, there is no EA guidance on detailing how to design an  appropriate eIDAS certification scheme, i.e. on detailing which criteria to be used by CABs to  evaluate and demonstrate QTSP/QTS conformance to eIDAS.  It should be stressed that EA and NABs do not have the authority to amend standards to further  refine the accreditation scheme down to the level of CAB certification scheme. Another  “authority” should take this under its responsibility (e.g. ESO, ENISA, EU MS, EU MS SBs,  eIDAS EU MS Experts Group). There is a need for cooperation between the relevant  “authorities” to define such schemes and probably as many schemes as there are types of  QTSP/QTS defined in eIDAS. Such definitions may or should leverage on existing and  potentially amended versions of relevant ETSI standards for QTSP/QTSs.  In collaboration with the study team, EA will conduct a survey amongst its members in  preparation of one of the next EA Certification Committee meetings. After three years of  implementation of the EA recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme, it would indeed be the  time for identifying and analysing some return on experience and lessons learned. Based on the  EA Certification Committee’s decision on this topic, the EA Working Group - ICT and Data  Security (WG ICTDS) could be solicited to propose ideas and/or concrete actions. At the date of  finalising this report, the survey was not completed. However, preliminary feedback provided by  the EA confirms the diversity of approaches used by EA members with regards to guidance or  requirements on conformity assessment schemes (CASs), within a common generic framework  based on ISO/IEC 17065 and ETSI EN 319 403. It also indicates that EA members that did not  benefit from a nationally defined CAS experienced issues with CAR suitability to support  sufficiently a SB’s informed decision to grant a qualified status. Most of the responsive member  urge for the establishment of an EU harmonised CAS. The difference in approach and in  assessment effort for accreditation of CABs is reported by a member as hindering the mutual  recognition of accredited certification of electronic trust services.  Concerning the extension of the accreditation scope (e.g. ISO/IEC 17065 + EN 319 403) to  [ETSI TS 119 403-3], existing EA defined procedures can be used by NABs at the request of  CABs. CABs may apply and ask their NAB to include TS 119 403-3 in the scope of their  accreditation. National authorities (e.g. SBs) might also require the CABs to do so, e.g. to  facilitate SBs’ decision process for granting or confirming a qualified status to (Q)TSP/(Q)TSs.  Regarding the international aspects, i.e. the promotion of [ETSI EN 319 403]-based  accreditation scheme at IAF level, EA may approach the IAF Technical Committee to enquire  about the applicable and relevant process to promote [ETSI EN 319 403] (or [ETSI TS 119 403-  3]) based accreditation scheme at the IAF level. However, such a process is likely to take quite  a long time to reach concrete results. EA believes that an ideal option would be for [ETSI EN  319 403] (or [ETSI TS 119 403-3]) to become an ISO standard or to create a bridge standard  between relevant ISO and ETSI standards.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  19  2.4 THE VIEWPOINT OF CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT BODIES  2.4.1 Foreword  All 30 CABs informally reported by the EC9 as accredited against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation have been accredited under the [ISO/IEC 17065] framework. For two of them, the  “scope of accreditation” provided by the corresponding NAB does not (clearly) indicate this  framework being supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403], however both CAB certification schemes  claim to abide by this standard.  Amongst the currently 30 eIDAS accredited CABs, very few are publishing or providing upon  request a copy of their accredited eIDAS conformity assessment (or certification) scheme.  Making this information available on request is, however, an obligation for ISO/IEC 17065  accredited CABs, as per clause 4.6 of [ISO/IEC 17065].  Amongst the identified CASs used by the eIDAS accredited CABs, four main categories can be  identified:   CASs that are fully specified by national authorities (e.g. SBs in CZ, SK) and are  mandatory for use by CABs nationally accredited under eIDAS;   CASs that are fully established by national authorities (e.g. SB from FR), which are not  mandatory for use by CABs accredited under eIDAS but may be used by them, providing  a presumption of compliance to assessed QTSP/QTS when successfully audited against  these CAS;   CASs that are partially guided by specific requirements driven by national authorities  (e.g. SBs and/or NABs like in BE, ES, IT, LU, MT, NL);   CASs that are fully driven and defined by CABs without specific guidance from national  authorities.  The next subsections summarise the input provided by the CABs to the study team.  2.4.2 Being accredited as a CAB for eIDAS conformity assessments  Being accredited as a CAB may represent both a significant investment and risk for newcomer  bodies. For a market to be open and efficient, new players usually ask for certainty and clear rules  9 See https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity-assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements- eidas-regulation  CABS  Agreeing on benefits from harmonised CAS   Providing for guidance in evaluating compliance with eIDAS   Clarifying certification decision versus SB’s decision to grant or not a qualified status   Supporting set-up of cooperation working group betewwn CABs   Handling composite and multipurpose audits   Handling national specificities   Innovation supportive   Harmonising efforts and surveillance programms  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity-assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity-assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  20  on how to be compliant, making sure in advance that their investment will result in their successful  accreditation. The absence of clear rules, or at least of sufficient guidance, may represent an  entry barrier and favour existing players, hampering the diversity of CABs.  In the absence of an EU-wide harmonised conformity assessment scheme or of guidance from  national authorities (e.g. SBs), each CAB has to define its own scheme. New CABs are in  search of guidance that they typically find in ETSI standards, ENISA guidelines, or nationally-  defined schemes (e.g. [ANSSI, 2017], [NSA-CS], [DKPv2]). This significant upfront investment  for a definition of a scheme may be thought unnecessary, as the resulting situation is that most  of the certification schemes defined by CABs are in whole or in part based on the same ETSI  standards. As the CAR needs to demonstrate meeting each applicable eIDAS requirement, the  schemes are structured typically as a mapping for each of the eIDAS requirements for  QTSP/QTS. These requirements are guided from controls (criteria) and control (criteria)  objectives taken from these ETSI standards, supplemented for identified gaps by more generic  standards such as ISO 27001, or other legal frameworks such as GDPR for data protection.  Would a CAB aim to target a wider market than its homeland market, the variances between  applicable nationally-defined schemes10 may create additional burden to align the scheme of  the CAB. Coordination / harmonization / centralization among CABs, NABs and SBs would  greatly improve the process, and additionally lower the above-mentioned entry barrier.  It is worth noting that the ETSI standards aimed to support the implementation of the eIDAS  Regulation were drafted first as standardized requirements for specific PKI-based  implementations of QTSP/QTS. They provide less guidance or no guidance at all for the audit of  “alternative”, “innovative” or “creative” implementations of the eIDAS requirements. In these  specific cases, the CAB may have to transpose its regular practices, checklists and controls.  This ad hoc transposition usually occurs “on the spot” during the preparation phase between  stage 1 and stage 2 of that audit. In addition, as the demonstration of skills and competence of  the CAB during its accreditation by the NAB was performed most probably on an “ETSI-based  standard case” and not against the Regulation, the quality of this particular conformity  assessment might be at risk.  2.4.3 eIDAS CABs are certification bodies  As CABs accredited under [ISO/IEC 17065] are certification bodies, they issue a certificate in  addition to the CAR resulting from their audit of a QTSP/QTS. The situation may be misleading  as this certificate testifies that the assessed QTSP/QTS conforms to the applicable eIDAS  requirements from the viewpoint of the CAB. Such a certificate of conformity is (as required by  EN 319 403) published on the CAB’s website as soon as the audit is successful, which will likely  occur before the decision of the SB to grant a qualified status to the assessed QTSP/QTS. As  the decision to grant such a qualified status is ultimately the responsibility of the competent SB,  it may happen that the decision of the SB differs from the CAB’s certification decision. This may  create confusion for relying parties and should be addressed as much as possible in the  harmonised certification scheme.  2.4.4 Cooperation - competition  The eIDAS Regulation does not regulate or address the cooperation between CABs. Most  CABs are private companies, and in competition with each other in an open market. This may  make a CAB cooperation working group difficult to setup as existing players may typically  protect their long-invested expertise, as opposed to newcomers who will likely be in favour of  sharing experiences.  10 The variances pointed to here do not only address areas where the EU Member States are entitled to adopt national  provisions (e.g. certificate suspension, Art.24(1).d alternative identification methods) but address those variances in  interpreting the way common provisions from the eIDAS Regulation should be implemented by QTSP/QTS.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  21  Nevertheless, the establishment of such a CAB cooperation-working group could facilitate  harmonization of the application of conformity assessment approaches and criteria, particularly  in a situation where each CAB designed its own scheme. Even in the case of a harmonised EU-  wide certification scheme, equally accredited CABs may differently interpret and apply the  conformity assessment criteria, resulting in hard to compare certifications of QTSP/QTSs. Some  related ETSI standards help to partially mitigate these discrepancies, but not to an acceptable  extent. Additionally, there is currently no 'legally resilient' link between eIDAS and the ETSI  standards.  The set-up and functioning of such a CAB cooperation working group would only be efficient if  every eIDAS accredited CAB, as well as CABs interested in becoming eIDAS accredited, could  participate free of charge and on a voluntary basis11, all having equal voice and vote.12 It would  be key as well that such a group shall tightly cooperate with SBs (e.g. FESA, EU MS eIDAS  expert group members), ENISA and the European Standardisation Organisations.  2.4.5 Composite audits  With the growing number of specialised component service providers (e.g. CA factory,  identification service provider under Article 24.1(d) of eIDAS, QTSP hosting a remote QSCD,  service provider for eRDS), the harmonised certification scheme should take into account the  handling of composite audits, where components of a QTS are audited separately by different  CABs.  National frameworks exist for the recognition of such component audits by CABs in charge of  the QTS audit, such as in Germany13 or in The Netherlands under former Directive  1999/93/EC14. The recognition of such component audits at the European level should be  included in the harmonised scheme, including the handling of possibly different validity periods  for each of the resulting audit reports.  2.4.6 Multipurpose audits  The most common situations where multipurpose audits are required by (Q)TSPs to address  their need or wish to be assessed as conformant to CA/Browser Forum requirements, and/or to  specific ETSI standards.  2.4.7 National specificities  In practice, a CAB has to take into account the national specificities of the country of  establishment of the QTSP (e.g. certificate suspension is forbidden in several EU countries, the  existence of nationally-defined eIDAS certification schemes, or SB-specific requirements). This  leads to the definition of a mainly common scheme with national variations. An EU-wide  harmonised certification scheme should address this issue and resolve it.  2.4.8 Other aspects  The fact that most of the certification schemes defined by CABs are in whole or in part based on  the same ETSI standards could be seen as hampering the technological neutrality of eIDAS.  QTSPs may favour the lower risk “ETSI path” for implementing their QTS instead of a “creative”  one where the demonstration of conformity to eIDAS would be more complex and the outcome  of the eIDAS audit uncertain.  11 Alternatively, membership could be automatic.  12 Different initiatives have popped up recently like www.acab-c.com or the German working group of (German) recognized  certification bodies (AGAB). Unfortunately, none of these initiatives managed to group a significant number of eIDAS  accredited CABs and so far may not be considered as representative of the eIDAS CABs.  13 Composite certification approach exists in Germany since 2007 for QTSP/QTS (or CSP at that time). It was part of the  German assessment scheme for German eSignature Act (called Module-Confirmation).  14 Composite assessment was covered by the TTP.nl scheme maintained by the iTrust foundation as a scheme operator,  and actively used by all CABs operating in NL at that time.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  22  In the absence of recognition of composite audit, a QTSP is forced (or at least highly  constrained in its choice) to select the same CAB as the one having audited the component  they use, for purely organisational and economic reasons. The risk that another CAB would  challenge the outcome of the audit of the component is avoided, and the CAB may propose  shorter audit time and lower budget because of the existing “partial audit”. (Note: This is  particularly the case if the component is located in another country and its audit would involve  travels and associated costs).  Regarding the recurrence of audits, the carrying out of surveillance audits is typically at the  discretion of the CAB, where the eIDAS Regulation only enforces 2-yearly audit of QTSP/QTSs.  When imposed by the CAB or by a nationally-defined scheme or SB, the surveillance audit is  typically performed on a yearly basis between two full audits. This may also be a topic for  harmonisation.  The treatment of non-conformities is not harmonised and some CABs / SBs considered that  QTS could be listed with pending (minor) non-conformities. This is also mainly due to a wrong  approach in the current version of [ETSI EN 319 403], which should be corrected in the  upcoming updated version, to be published as EN 319 403-1.  2.5 THE VIEWPOINT OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS  2.5.1 Browser Vendors  Discussions have been initiated between the European Commission and browsers and  applications industry stakeholders for the recognition of eIDAS QTS in their widely deployed  products and services.  Despite the highly visible and notorious integration of EU trusted lists-based validation of eIDAS  qualified electronic signatures and seals in the Adobe Acrobat™ suites15, those discussions  have not led to significant progress in integrating QTS, qualified website authentication  certificates (QWACs) in particular, in the widely deployed browsers. From the viewpoint of  browser vendors (BVs), this is less a question of distrust (even if there are areas for  15 https://acrobat.adobe.com/be/en/sign/capabilities/eidas.html  BROWSER VENDORS  Supporting CAS harmonisation with more   Transparency, consistency, accountability and enforcement mechanisms   Clear aim and scope of audit reports   Monitoring  However mutual recognition is not part of the BVs’ trust framework  They do not envisage surrending their ability to enforce policies or  requirements to CAs and their ability to exlude or distrust any non-  conformant CA.  They plead for unkeyed QWACs attesting link between domanin name and  its owner.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  23  improvements) than a question of not delegating any trust decision regarding their trust  frameworks or programs.  As a general approach, browser vendors claim to operate their own mature trust framework for  entrusting (CA) certificates in their products and applications. In a similar way as EU MS SBs  are acting towards QTSP/QTS, BVs act towards CA (TSP issuing certificates) verifying and  deciding themselves on whether they are meeting   CAs own policies as defined in their applicable CP/CPS,   policies and requirements defined by the CA/Browser Forum, and   additional requirements defined in their CA trust store program.  BVs ultimately own the trust decision for which CAs are included in their trust framework.  As part of this BV-driven verification and decision process, BVs require 3rd party audits to attest  that the CA have complied with the above two first set of policies and requirements. All BVs  recognise and “trust” both the WebTrust and ETSI audit schemes (the latter being commonly  used to support the eIDAS framework as well). It is commonly stated by BVs that both audit  tracks have areas of concern and potential improvement. However, as these audits are “only”  one element amongst others supporting each decision on trusting a CA, trusting the audit  scheme is not an absolute necessity. On top of these audits, BVs are conducting their own  regular (risk) assessments to inform their trust decisions. They also support such decisions by  active and transparent technical (PKI) monitoring.  When comparing the two types of trust frameworks, namely the one(s) established by BVs on  one hand and the eIDAS framework on the other hand, it is important to stress that, contrary to  the eIDAS framework, the BVs do not have and do not aim to implement mutual recognition. In  the BVs’ trust framework, there is no room for accepting trust decisions made by 3rd parties to  lead (automatically) to trust decisions within the BV framework. In case of an Art.14 based  mutual recognition between the EU and a 3rd country, the EU MS will not have to verify whether  new or existing 3rd country trust services meet the eIDAS requirements. Verifications by the 3rd  country, under the terms of the Art.14-based agreement will be automatically trusted by all the  EU MS and the corresponding 3rd country verified trust services will be recognised as  equivalent to QTS in the EU. This does not and is not likely to occur with BVs, who will base  their CA trust decisions on the basis of their own verification of the conformance of each and  every CA with their own requirements, irrespective whether they are otherwise qualified under  eIDAS (or even already trusted by another BV). BVs do not rely on another entity’s trust  decision or delegate trust decision to any entity. They use other entities’ decisions as input to  better informed decisions, such as external audits which are part of BV’s requirements. BVs  may trust differently WebTrust and ETSI certification schemes, as well as auditors performing  them. The overall BV’s own decision process adjusts and corrects these differences, as the  overarching goal is to evaluate all the available information against BV specific trust framework  policies and requirements to ensure their users are secure.  It is worth noting that most of the BVs do not have a contractual relationship with CAs (TSPs).  This means that those BVs have no legal recourse if a CA fails to meet their requirements. The  relationship is based on whether or not the CA’s root certificate is and remains to be included in  BV’s root store, based on the CA’s continued compliance with BV’s requirements. BVs authority  rests in the ability to choose which CAs are members of their program. Taking that away greatly  diminishes BVs’ ability to influence good CA behaviour.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  24  Regarding the ETSI audit track (which is also typically the basis for eIDAS conformity  assessments), BVs identify opportunities for improvement falling into the categories of  consistency, transparency, and enforcement.  The aim and scope of the audit reports must be very clear. Since no standards may be imposed  to QTSPs issuing QWACs for being assessed compliant to eIDAS, being certified against  eIDAS does not mean being certified compliant with any standard, even if used as benchmark  criteria by auditors, unless the scope of certification makes it clear that, in addition to being  eIDAS compliant, the QTSP/QTS are compliant to specific standard(s).  The eIDAS  requirements are intrinsically non-technical but functional and legal; the BVs’ requirements are  essentially technically oriented. When several audit tracks are supported by the same standards  or a single audit is aimed to demonstrate compliance with eIDAS and BV requirements  respectively, the attestation letter and/or conformity assessment certificate must ideally be  separate. At the least such letters/certificates should express clearly, against which framework  the assessed CA is conformant. Furthermore, the attestation report or certification (audit) report  should also ideally be separate or at least include clear and consistent demonstration of the  conformance with each of the targeted frameworks. It is worth noting that BVs refer to the “ETSI  audit track”, a technical track, as being accepted to support their decision of trust in the context  of their trust framework, not the legal technology-neutral “eIDAS audit track” per se.  However, the bigger concern is about the consistency of audit criteria across SBs. An audit  conducted by two different CABs accredited by two different SBs should produce the same  results. BVs strongly support works towards harmonising the accreditation and certification  schemes at the EU level, for CABs assessing (Q)TSP/(Q)TS  Transparency is a characteristic in which BV trust frameworks have invested. The more  transparency the more a BV and other interested parties can be confident that a TSP is  behaving according to the rules, is trusted and that BV users are protected. Certificate  transparency, CA certificate disclosure requirements, publicly available CA data, publicly  available non-conformities and publicly available incident and even CA audit reports are  examples of tools and information required to be available to the public for use to monitor and  improve the health of the CA ecosystem. Under eIDAS, none of this information is required to  be public.  There is also a legitimately perceived lack of transparency in the current de facto adopted  eIDAS accreditation (and certification) scheme in particular with respect to the following: the  scope of the eIDAS certification scheme used by the eIDAS accredited CAB, the effective  targeted criteria, the targeted audience, the corresponding assessments, including the tests  performed of evaluated, their results, and the auditor’s judgement or opinion on whether those  results meet the stated objectives.  The lack of strong enforcement mechanisms in the eIDAS framework is also perceived by the  BVs as an issue. CAs are required to notify their eIDAS accredited CAB whenever a non-  conformity is identified but BVs reported having rarely, if ever, observed CABs and SBs taking  apparent action/sanction against them. This may lead CAs to be comforted in making decisions  favouring their own interests. Similarly, CABs issuing CAR reported to be of insufficient quality  have not been (publicly) observed to be sanctioned by their competent NAB. Individual NABs  are perceived by BVs to apply different level of rigor when overseeing CABs, which they  accredited. On the contrary, WebTrust licensed practitioners are under a centralized  governance model, believed by BVs to be a more consistent level of oversight than the eIDAS  one, where CABs oversight is delegated to separate NABs from each EU MS.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  25  BVs also believe the monitoring regime undertaken by CABs and by SBs is another area for  improvement. Except for the initial and 2-yearly assessment of the risk management approach  implied by eIDAS, the level of active monitoring exercised by CABs and SBs is unclear, not  transparent and potentially inconsistent. On the opposite side, BVs’ trust frameworks are almost  exclusively focused on managing risk and protecting their users, for example by proactive  actions, fast responses following active monitoring, or CA notified security issues (as BVs  require). The lack of transparency regarding active monitoring of QTSP issuing qualified  certificates as a QTS (and of other QTSP/QTS) may lead to the wrong perception by BVs that  the eIDAS trust framework relies exclusively on audits. It is unclear to BVs (and probably not  only to them) how factors such as CA’s (QTSP’s) competence, responsiveness and  transparency when responding to an incident or CA’s (QTSP’s) fame or reputation or, credibility,  or prior incidents are taken into account in the process of granting a qualified status.  In short, implementing mutual recognition is not part of the BVs’ trust framework because they  do not envisage surrendering their ability to enforce policies or requirements to CAs and their  ability to exclude or distrust any non-conformant CA. The relationship between BVs and CAs is  a direct one-to-one relationship-based BV-driven requirements imposed by each BV on each  CA and is likely to remain so.  Better convergence and quicker alignment between the ETSI standards and the CA/Browser  requirements driving all BV trust frameworks may be an additional area of improvement to foster  convergence with the eIDAS framework, when supported by ETSI standards.  Furthermore, from a technical point of view, BV believe using TLS is not the only technical  solution for implementing QWACs in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation. BVs reported that,  in informal discussions with the EC, they suggested alternative technical solutions, other than  using TLS, that could facilitate the recognition of QWACs. These technical solutions are based  on the fact that Annex IV of the eIDAS Regulation does not require QWACs to include any  “private key”. QWACS could be implemented as “simple” signed or sealed attestations that a  legal or natural person is linked to a domain name; such attestations could then be consumed,  verified and/or displayed alongside the TLS connection. The technical feasibility, relevance,  market adoption and standardisation of one or more of those alternative solutions still need to  be progressed.  2.5.2 Adobe  Adobe has not provided any direct input to the context of the study. However, Adobe’s AATL  principles to the recognition of trustworthiness in certificate-based digital IDs and timestamp  services are highlighted and assessed here by the study team for the interesting approach in a  clean separation between a “legal” and “standard” processing of the EU Member States trusted  lists and regarding them as trustworthy. In other words, on the one hand, considering the EU  legal constitutive value of EU MS trusted lists16 to validate qualified electronic signatures or  seals and display the validation results in consequence. On the other hand, trusting those  QTSPs issuing qualified certificates having been listed in the EUMS TL for being recognised as  trustworthy as those CAs and TSPs having actively applied for and accepted in the Adobe  Approved Trust List (AATL) program17.  The AATL is a CA certificate trust store program that onboards certificate authorities (CAs) and  trust service providers (TSPs) that demonstrated compliance with the AATL program  requirements. The applicant CA must pass an audit from one of the audit schemes that are  16 Called “EUTL” by Adobe, to clearly separate them from the “AATL”.  17 https://helpx.adobe.com/be_fr/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html  https://helpx.adobe.com/be_fr/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  26  accepted by Adobe to support the vetting by Adobe that the applicant conforms to AATL  requirements, namely:   A compliance audit against [ETSI EN 319 411-1] NCP, [ETSI EN 319 411-2] QCP-n or  QCP-l, conducted by an auditor that is accredited under the [ISO/IEC 17065]  framework supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403].   A WebTrustTM for CA v2.0 or later conducted by a WebTrustTM licensed Practitioner for  WebTrustTM audits.   A compliance audit against [ISO 21188] conducted by an auditor that is accredited  against [ISO/IEC 17065] for [ISO 21188] audits.  As an alternative18 to the presentation of a conformity assessment report confirming the  conformity against one or more of the above listed audit schemes specifications, demonstrating  compliance with the AATL requirement can be achieved when the submitted CA “is listed and  granted a CA/QC qualified status in one of the European Member State national Trusted Lists  (EUTL) as a qualified trust service for the issuance of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures or electronic seals and the trusted list indicates directly, or indirectly through the  certificate, that the certificate is stored on a Qualified Signature Creation Device”.  Independently of an active application by a TSP/CA to the AATL program, Adobe digital  signature solutions also work with every QTSP offering qualified trust services listed in the  European Union Trust List (EUTL). Without the need for the corresponding QTSPs to apply for  the AATL program, Adobe solutions validate all EU qualified electronic signatures and qualified  electronic seals by processing the EU Member States trusted lists. The validation results are  displayed in conformance with the eIDAS Regulation requirements for the validation of such  signatures or seals (cf. Art.(32) of the Regulation), identifying if the signature/seal is supported  by a qualified certificate, if the private key resides in a qualified signature/Seal creation device  and hence if the signature is qualified under eIDAS.  In the study team’s opinion, this illustrates in practice an interesting approach in a clean  separation between processing the EU MS TLs and recognising them, or the underlying line of  assessment, as trustworthy for joining the AATL program.  18 Another alternative is for the applicant CA to meet the Medium Hardware Assurance Requirements of the US Federal  Bridge, the SAFE-BioPharma bridge, or the CertiPath commercial bridge, by privilege of having the Supplied Certificate  cross-certified to the bridge.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  27  3. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE  LEGAL FRAMEWORKS  3.1 INTRODUCTION  The eIDAS Regulation does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any conformity  assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited and QTSP/QTSs  be assessed. It limits itself to requiring the CAB to be accredited within the framework of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008], and specifies the need for the execution of a  conformity assessment scheme that is eIDAS specific - i.e. a scheme which confirms that, for a  specific type of QTSP/QTS, a QTSP/QTS satisfies the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. However, the Regulation does not mandate EA to establish either a complete  accreditation framework or certification schemes for each type of QTSP/QTS.  When looking at potential future actions aiming to establish a more comprehensive framework in  relation to the auditing of QTSP/QTSs and working towards harmonising related EU certification  schemes, three main approaches can be envisaged.  The first approach, within the current scope of the eIDAS Regulation, relates to the adoption of  secondary legislation. Pursuant to Article 20(4) of eIDAS Regulation the European Commission  may, by means of implementing acts, establish a reference number of standards on the  accreditation of CABs, on CARs, and on auditing rules under which CABs will carry out their  conformity assessment of QTSP/QTSs. The EC could by means of implementing Acts, establish  reference number of standards allowing for presumption of compliance of QTSP/QTS with the  applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The 2020 revision of the eIDAS Regulation is the second approach that may be used to address  the problem, by explicitly including references to relevant schemes and certification frameworks.  A third promising approach that has recently become viable consists of the adoption of a  certification scheme under the Cybersecurity Act [CyberAct, 2019]. The latter two options could  be combined, by revising the eIDAS Regulation to clarify that the Cybersecurity Act may be  used as an instrument to designate schemes that address the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  The next section explores these three different legal options available at the EU level to support  a more harmonised approach to the certification of QTS/QTS.  3.2 eIDAS SECONDARY LEGISLATION  A proposal towards a more harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS can be  legally formalised through Article 20(4) of the eIDAS Regulation, which gives to the European  Commission the competence, by means of implementing acts, to “establish reference number of  the following standards:  (a) accreditation of the conformity assessment bodies and for the conformity assessment  report referred to in paragraph 1;  (b) auditing rules under which conformity assessment bodies will carry out their conformity  assessment of the qualified trust service providers as referred to in paragraph 1”.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  28  While the eIDAS Regulation thus permits the Commission to reference a scheme through an  implementing Act, this path has not been used so far. The currently available candidate  standards are [ETSI EN 319 403] and [ETSI TS 119 403-3], the latter building upon the first. It is  worth noting the current version of [ETSI EN 319 403] suffers from some substantive issues19  and is currently under revision. Those standards, after completing the revisions, would likely be  good candidates for referencing under point (a) of Art.20(4).  However, none of those standards fully addresses the list of criteria, controls and control  objectives an accredited CAB would use to conduct an assessment of the conformity of a  QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation (cf. point (b) of Art.20(4)). So far, (European)  standardisation bodies have developed no standard addressing such a list, which would allow  CABs to assess the conformance of QTSP/QTS against the applicable eIDAS requirements,  irrespective of the conformance of those QTSP/QTS with best practice technical standards.  CEN/CENELEC and ETSI have however developed standards for such best practices, for each  type of QTSP/QTS, with annexed tables mapping the requirements of the Regulation to the  relevant clauses of the standards. However:   No formal assessment of their suitability has been completed, particularly with the  perspective of being referenced in an eIDAS implementing act.   These are standards that QTSPs remain free to abide by or not; the standards are binding  on the activities of CABs, not of the QTSPs.  The current wording of Art.20(4) (i.e. “establish reference number of […] standards”) does not  allow the EC to profile the standards in order to amend standardised specifications in any way.  In other words, the provision does not allow the EC to define itself the relevant specifications of  an eIDAS QTSP/QTS conformity assessment (certification) scheme. At most, some of the  requirements defined in a standard may be excluded from the reference in an implementing Act.  So, when failures of candidate standards are identified during their eligibility assessments for  being referenced by eIDAS implementing acts, those failures cannot be rectified through  legislation. Rather, the problems would need to be notified to the competent standardisation  organisations with a view of updating the standards accordingly and republishing them, and  then referencing them as the legislation requires.  As a result, the adoption of an implementing Act pursuant to Article 20(4) would not, in the  absence of standard(s) fully specifying a CAS, preferably created for each of the QTSP/QTS  types, be an option to fully harmonise the auditing of eIDAS QTSP/QTS. However, referring to  ETSI TS 119 403-3 (with revisions) in an implementing Act adopted pursuant to Article 20(4)  would be a constructive step towards such harmonisation.  The EC could, by means of implementing Acts20, establish reference numbers of standards  allowing for presumption of compliance of QTSP/QTS with the applicable requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation. This would contribute to reducing the diversity in the existing certification  schemes, which have been defined by each individual CAB, by providing common roots for  such schemes. However, the implementing Acts as foreseen by the eIDAS Regulation do not  allow full coverage of the requirements applicable to QTSP/QTS for such presumption of  19 When the decision to certify a QTSP/QTS is the confirmation that the assessed QTSP/QTS meet the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation (i.e. the normative document, identified as the “product (read service) requirements”  in ISO/IEC 17065), it shall not be possible to take such decision with pending non-conformities to these requirements, i.e.  when the assessed QTSP/QTS actually fail to meet all the normative (eIDAS) requirements.  When a certification has been issued to a conformant QTSP/QTS (i.e. confirming that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets the  requirements of eIDAS), and that a non-conformity with eIDAS requirements is substantiated, either as a result of  surveillance or otherwise, it shall not be considered “an appropriate action” to maintain valid the certification (confirmation)  that the certified QTSP/QTS is conformant, while there is still any unresolved non-conformity to the normative (eIDAS)  requirements (i.e. when the assessed QTSP/QTS actually fail to meet all the eIDAS requirements).  20 Namely, pursuant to Art.24(5), Art.27(4), Art.28(6), Art.32(3), Art.33(2), Art.34(2), Art.37(4), Art.38(6), Art.40, Art.42(2),  Art.44(2), and Art.45(2).  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  29  compliance. This may moreover be a politically complex path. Despite prior initiatives from  some EU MS, discussions on adopting such implementing Acts have not been initiated thus far.  The 2020 revision of the eIDAS Regulation is an opportunity that could be used to take account  of the drawbacks of this first approach. For example, the EA, or another body, could be  mandated to establish a complete accreditation framework and certification schemes for each  type of QTSP/QTS, and to extend the coverage of other implementing Acts to all QTSP/QTS  requirements as described above.  That revision may also be used to facilitate a third promising approach that has recently become  viable to formalise an accreditation framework. This would consist in the adoption of a  certification scheme under the Cybersecurity Act [CyberAct, 2019].  Figure 4: eIDAS secondary legislation as legal instrument toward harmonised CAS  Implementing acts (IAs) pursuant to eIDAS  Negative   Not possible to achieve CAS harmonisation due to dependence  on the existence and completeness of standards:  o No existing standard on CAS  o No mandate to EC to amend existing standards  o No mandate to EC to define its own specifications   Unclear legal effect to referencing standard under Art.20(4)   Potentially politically complex path.  Positive   Art.20.4 IA would allow to legally support EA recommended  accreditation scheme based on EN 39 403 and extend it to CAS  specifications (ST 119 403-3)   Various other provisions permit adoption of IAs for each type of  QTSP/QTS   Reducing diversity in CABs’ assessment schemes  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  30  3.3 THE CYBERSECURITY ACT  A key challenge – apart from agreeing on the definition of the requirements for a harmonised  conformity assessment scheme for QTSs – is its formalisation as an official scheme with legal  recognition across the EU. While the eIDAS Regulation could permit it to do so by referencing a  scheme through an implementing act, this path has not been used so far. The Cybersecurity Act  [CyberAct, 2019], which entered into effect on 27 June 2019, provides an alternative avenue.  The Cybersecurity Act, providing for a stronger and permanent legal mandate for ENISA,  introduces a framework for the adoption of European cybersecurity certification schemes. The  Cybersecurity Act allows the European Commission (or exceptionally the European  Cybersecurity Certification Group established under the Act) to request ENISA to prepare a  candidate certification scheme, which would apply to ICT products, services and processes.  The definition of these concepts is broad: notably, an ‘ICT process’ is defined as “a set of  activities performed to design, develop, deliver or maintain an ICT product or ICT service”. This  could plausibly apply to a QTSP/QTS conformity assessment scheme, so that a harmonised  scheme would be eligible for formalisation under the Cybersecurity Act.  The process of adoption involves several entities. If a request to ENISA to prepare a candidate  scheme is issued, article 49 of the Act requires ENISA to consult relevant stakeholders through  a formal, open, transparent and inclusive consultation process. In addition, ENISA must  establish an ad hoc working group to finalise a candidate scheme; the results of the present  report could act as a basis for this work. After consultation with the aforementioned European  Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG), which is composed of representatives of national  cybersecurity certification authorities or representatives of other relevant national authorities,  ENISA can submit its finalised candidate scheme to the European Commission, who may adopt  it via an implementing Act under the Cybersecurity Act.  Once adopted, ENISA will publish the information on the certification scheme via ENISA’s  website. Furthermore, article 56 of the Act stipulates that any ICT products, ICT services and  ICT processes that have been certified under an adopted scheme shall be presumed to comply  with the requirements of such a scheme – which in the present case would relate to the security  requirements for QTSPs/QTSs, mainly as dictated by the eIDAS Regulation.  The legal presumption of compliance, created by cybersecurity certification, with the targeted  security requirements would nevertheless be subordinated to verification by the competent SB  that the certified QTSP/QTS meets the eIDAS requirements, and to the SB’s decision to grant a  qualified status (or not) to the certified QTSP/QTS. In other words, certification is an element  attesting to compliance with explicitly defined security requirements, but it does not  automatically result in a qualified status being granted under the eIDAS Regulation.  Under the Cybersecurity Act, cybersecurity certification against a specific scheme approved  under the Act is voluntary, since compliance with the certification scheme is not currently made  mandatory by any existing legislation. Although this can of course change, depending on future  developments of the eIDAS Regulation. QTSPs would therefore retain the possibility of  demonstrating compliance with the law using any other method until legislation is introduced  that changes this picture.  Crucially though, article 57 of the Act addresses the impact of adoption of schemes on any  national cybersecurity certification schemes, stating that these “shall cease to produce effects  from the date established in the implementing act”, and that Member States are barred from  adopting new national cybersecurity certification schemes with a scope covered by an EU level  certification scheme. In other words, Member States would not be able to lend any legal value  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  31  to any national schemes that they may have defined in the application of the eIDAS Regulation.  The notion of a “national cybersecurity certification scheme” is defined as “a comprehensive set  of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures developed and adopted by a  national public authority and that apply to the certification or conformity assessment of ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes falling under the scope of the specific scheme” – i.e.  it covers only requirements emanating from a public authority. Article 57 of the Cybersecurity  Act thus has no impact on purely private sector schemes, or on schemes, which have not been  formally adopted but are simply influential in practice.  The Act allows schemes to rely both on self-assessments and on formal certification. Support  for self-assessments in a scheme is however not mandatory under the Act, and given current  practices for QTSP/QTS, self-assessment does not seem to be in line with market expectations,  or with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. A candidate scheme under the Act targeting  conformity assessment for QTSPs/QTSs in all likelihood would therefore rely solely on  certification. The process of certification must be elaborated in the scheme itself, but can be  drafted to function in largely the same way as is done currently under the eIDAS Regulation.  The Act permits a scheme to contain several levels of assurance, ranging from ‘basic’ to  ‘substantial’ and ‘high’, linked to the level of the risk associated with the intended use of the  product, service or process, in terms of the probability and impact of an incident. Assuming that  certification of QTSPs/QTSs would require a high level of assurance, Article 56.6 of the Act  requires certificates to be issued by national cybersecurity certification authorities, which must  be designated by the Members States. However, the national cybersecurity certification  authorities may delegate this task to their CABs who are accredited by NABs under Regulation  (EC) No 765/2008 to issue the required certificates. Therefore, the certification process would  be highly comparable to current practice under the eIDAS Regulation.  As noted above, if QTSPs/QTSs are indeed expected to be certified under assurance level  ‘high’ – which seems plausible – then Member States have the option of allowing certificates to  be issued by their national cybersecurity certification authorities, who may not be accredited as  CABs under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. This would not be in line with the requirements of  the eIDAS Regulation, which defines a CAB as “a body defined in point 13 of Article 2 of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the  qualified trust services it provides”. In other words, while Member States would have the option  under the Cybersecurity Act to allow certificates to be issued by a national cybersecurity  certification authority who is not itself a CAB, this would not be able to satisfy the requirements  of the eIDAS Regulation. Therefore, the scheme should make it clear that any certificate issued  under an adopted scheme must be issued by a CAB.  As a relevant nuance, it might be argued that the Cybersecurity Act focuses on cybersecurity,  i.e. the activities necessary to protect network and information systems, the users of such  systems, and other persons affected by cyber threats (as defined in the Act); and not on legal  compliance in general. Since CABs under article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation must confirm that  the QTSPs and QTSs fulfil the requirements of the Regulation in general (and not only in  relation to cybersecurity)21, a scheme under the Cybersecurity Act risks not comprehensively  covering the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation if it only focuses on the security elements.  The Act nevertheless stresses the need to adopt a broad and general notion of cybersecurity for  the purpose of certification. While it imposes minimal contents for a scheme (notably mandatory  21 In addition to security requirements specified in its Art.19, the eIDAS Regulation also comprises requirements on the  scope and functionality of QTS, for QTSP operational continuity, staffing, liability, contractual transparency towards  customers, and other QTS related elements, which have only an indirect link to cybersecurity.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  32  security objectives and minimal elements to be included), the Act does not forbid explicitly the  inclusion of other (non-security related) requirements. Therefore, it could be argued that the  inclusion of non-security related elements in a scheme could be justified in case of qualified  trust services, given that the objective of the eIDAS Regulation is to ensure that such services  meet a high threshold of security and trustworthiness.  This would in practice imply that all requirements of the eIDAS Regulation could be integrated in  a scheme. As such, an adopted security scheme under the Cybersecurity Act to streamline  conformity assessment for QTSPs/QTSs would be very beneficial to reduce market  fragmentation in relation to information security. It would then be recommended that this broad  position would also be taken by the Commission when requesting schemes, or by ENISA (or its  expert groups) when preparing a candidate scheme for harmonising QTSP/QTS certification of  conformance with the requirements.  Figure 5: Cybersecurity Act as legal instrument toward harmonised CAS  3.4 eIDAS revision or amendment  Conceptually, an alternative process could also be to take the opportunity of the currently  ongoing revision of the eIDAS Regulation to address specifically the establishment process, the  specifications and maintenance of eIDAS QTSP/QTSs certification scheme(s).  Under this option, article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation could be rewritten in a manner that makes  it clear that the scheme creation process envisaged under the Cybersecurity Act should not be  limited to information security aspects but could also be used to establish comprehensive  QTSPs/QTSs certification scheme(s). It could clarify that the contents of such schemes should  consider the entirety of the eIDAS Regulation requirements as being relevant to supporting the  security of QTSPs/QTSs. In that way, it would be unambiguously clear that, in the context of the  eIDAS Regulation, the Act is a suitable and viable avenue for establishing the required  schemes. It is worth noting that, from a legal point of view, whether this would be at all possible  would depend on the scope of the Cybersecurity Act. Indeed, the eIDAS Regulation cannot  amend this Act.  Alternatively, if the Cybersecurity Act would not be considered a valid option, the 2020 revision  of the eIDAS Regulation may be used to compensate the drawbacks of the first approach, by  mandating EA. A standardisation body, or another body entitled to play the role of scheme  owner, to establish a complete accreditation framework and certification schemes for each type  of QTSP/QTS. It may also present the opportunity to extend the coverage of other implementing  acts to all QTSP/QTS requirements.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  33  4. GAP ANALYSIS – TOWARD A  HARMONISED SCHEME  4.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES  4.1.1 eIDAS Regulation driven  A CAR needs to demonstrate the fulfilment of each applicable eIDAS requirement. Therefore,  an EU-wide harmonised conformity assessment scheme would start from the eIDAS  requirements for QTSP/QTS, with a common part for all types of QTS together with specificities  for each, then detailing controls and control objectives about them.  4.1.2 In-depth list of controls and control objectives  Because the eIDAS requirements are legal high-level requirements, the scheme shall identify as  detailed as possible technical/operational criteria and criteria objectives concerning each of  these applicable eIDAS requirements that can serve as a basis for audits. Information and  guidance for this identification may be taken from:   ETSI / CEN standards relevant to support the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.   ENISA guidelines, in particular guidelines mapping the above standards to the eIDAS  requirements and identifying remaining gaps.   Nationally-defined schemes (e.g. from Slovakia, Czech Republic, or France) and  private sector schemes (e.g. UK tScheme). It should be noted that these schemes  have shown to be conflicting in some aspects, and the definition of an EU-wide  scheme should take these issues into consideration.   Being supplemented for identified gaps by more “generic” standards such as ISO/IEC  27001, ISO/IEC 27701 or other legal frameworks such as GDPR for data protection.  4.1.3 Technological neutrality – QTSP freedom of implementation  The outcome of the definition of criteria and criteria objectives described above could lead to  checklists aiming to support efficiently the CAB in assessing the conformity of a QTSP/QTS  against the eIDAS Regulation. Setting up these checklists will be a challenge, as they will have  to meet conflicting objectives:   Being specific and detailed enough to enable a clear and precise assessment of the  conformity of a QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation, and its demonstration.   Being generic enough to be technology-neutral, as eIDAS aims to be. It is worth noting  that the above-mentioned standards were drafted first as standardized requirements  for specific PKI-based implementations of QTSP/QTS, providing less guidance or no  guidance at all for the audit of “alternative” or “creative” implementations of the eIDAS  requirements. The same applies to the above-mentioned ENISA guidelines and  nationally-defined or private schemes, that all rely, with some variances, on those  standards. These standards should remain “one possible path” of implementing the  eIDAS requirements.  For ease of use, one checklist would be identified for each QTS, and potentially for each  relevant “component” service.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  34  4.1.4 Specific Member State requirements  Because some requirements are left open22 by the eIDAS Regulation and specific to each  country (e.g. suspension of certificates, video onboarding), the resulting checklists should take  into account these specificities depending on which country of Europe the QTSP is established  in, and allow the possibility to refer to “conditional controls” for each.  It is worth noting that it is key to limit national specificities to aspects explicitly identified by the  eIDAS Regulation as nationally specific, in order to limit the possibilities of divergence.  4.1.5 Scheme owner & maintenance  Once established, this EU-wide eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification scheme shall be maintained  appropriately to ensure it remains fit for purpose in the long run.  A continuous improvement process shall be defined for such scheme, and shall include the  definition of a scheme management authority (i.e. scheme owner), an EU-wide representative  working group and a review process.  4.2 MULTIPURPOSE AUDITS  The process towards the definition of harmonised QTSP/QTS certification schemes should take  into consideration that some QTSPs might operate in an international environment and in this  regard, they may need to be audited for other purposes than eIDAS compliance. The usual  example cited by stakeholders relates to the CA/Browser Forum23 requirements. However,  another case for multipurpose audits deals with the potential certification of information security  management systems (ISMS) and privacy information management systems (PIMS) used by  QTSP to provide QTS. QTSPs may benefit from prior audit focussing on these aspects (e.g.  against ISO/IEC 27001 and/or ISO/IEC 27701) or be keen to obtain related certifications. It  must be stressed however that to be relevant to eIDAS, the respective statements of  applicability (scope) of these ISMS and PIMS must address the provision of QTS by QTSP. In  this context, it would be key to make sure the EA recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme  would allow eIDAS accredited CABs to conduct those side audits and certifications.  An acceptable certification scheme should support multi-purpose audits wherever possible to  avoid QTSPs undergo multiple audits. To that extent, it should be noted that such multi-purpose  audits shall need to result in as many different CARs / audit reports and certification decisions  as there would be “Normative Documents” against which the conformity of QTSP/QTS should  be confirmed.  It is of paramount importance to consider that CARs in the context of Articles 21.1, 20.1 and  20.2 of the eIDAS Regulation shall confirm the conformity of QTSP/QTSs to the requirements of  the eIDAS Regulation and not to any standard. Yet, in practice, standards may be of great help  for TSPs to ensure best practices, and of great help for CABs in their activities of assessing  these TSPs claiming compliance to the standard or the normative document, in particular when  the CAB they select is building its eIDAS certification scheme upon identified standards.  22 These requirements are not “open” in the sense that they are voluntary. But in order to achieve a certain objective,  Member States enjoy the freedom to choose different means. The use of video for onboarding when issuing qualified  certificates for instance (cf. point (d) of Art.24(1)), if confirmed by an eIDAS accredited CAB as being equivalent in terms of  reliability to physical presence of the person to whom the certificate is issued.  23 https://cabforum.org/  https://cabforum.org/  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  35  4.3 COMPOSITE AUDITS IN THE CONTEXT OF eIDAS REGULATION  As has been explained in the feedback from CABs and SBs, composite audit is a key concept to  take into account in the definition of harmonised eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification scheme(s).  When appropriately applied, it may save significant effort (by QTSPs and by CABs) and,  simultaneously, retain the assurance level of conformity assessment. It is key to design the  composite certification approach in a way which ensures no decrease in the assurance level of  the assessment result and no distortion of the competition between CABs.  4.4 INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS  In addition to the international aspect resulting from the need for QTSP/QTS to meet other  (international) compliance schemes, the international promotion and recognition of the eIDAS  auditing model (accreditation of CABs under eIDAS and QTSP/QTS certification scheme(s)  used by eIDAS accredited CABs) are key elements for:   Facilitating international mutual recognition foreseen in Article 14 of the eIDAS Regulation.   Expanding eIDAS accredited CABs’ market from EU to international.  The IAF MLA driven accreditation scheme based on ISO/IEC 17065 (ideally to be  supplemented by ETSI EN 319 403-1) is a very natural and interesting candidate for 3rd  countries to base their national QTSP/QTS certification scheme on, particularly for QTS other  than issuing qualified certificates. Promoting ETSI EN 319 403-1 at ISO level would also be an  alternative to envisage.  4.5 ISO/IEC 17067  With [ISO/IEC 17065] being the cornerstone for the EA recommended scheme, a good policy  choice would be to develop EU-wide harmonised eIDAS certification schemes based on the  recommendations of [ISO/IEC 17067].  4.6 LEGAL INSTRUMENTS  It is unclear at this stage which legal instrument(s) would actually be selected to reference or  establish future EU harmonised eIDAS certification scheme(s) for QTSPs/QTSs. As argued  above, the Cybersecurity Act could be an appropriate avenue, if its provisions are given a broad  interpretation so that all requirements of the eIDAS Regulation could be covered as being  relevant to security (rather than only those that are explicitly and exclusively targeting security  requirements in the strictest sense).  Whatever option is chosen, it would be key that the design process of such schemes would be  conducted in such a way to federate, consult and involve as many relevant types of  stakeholders (or representatives) through a formal, open, transparent and inclusive consultation  process.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  36  5. RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1 OVERVIEW  Based on the stakeholders’ collected input, on the current eIDAS regime and the analysis of the  present report, action should be taken as proposed hereafter. The goal is to meet stakeholders’  concerns and legitimate needs to move towards a more harmonised approach with regards to  the assessment by CABs of the conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  5.2 ACTIONS REGARDING LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TOWARDS AN EU  HARMONISED eIDAS CAS  Note: The entity responsible for taking LEG-x recommendations forward is the European  Commission (either autonomously under the eIDAS Regulation, or by granting a mandate to  ENISA and then formalising the outcome under the Cybersecurity Act).  LEG-1. The track offered by the Cybersecurity Act is suggested to be the favoured option  concerning the creation of a harmonised certification scheme for each of the (nine)  types of QTSP/QTS specified in the eIDAS Regulation.  Additional certification schemes could also be created to cover the need to  assess/audit QTSP service components or processes in the context of Annex II.3 & 4  and in the context of implementation of Art.24.1(d) of the eIDAS Regulation.  As this might be a lengthy process, the currently available mechanism of adopting implementing  Acts under the eIDAS Regulation could be used to:  LEG-2. Reference the ETSI TS 119 403-3 standard pursuant to Art.20.4 of the Regulation to  address both points (a) and (b) of Art.20.4. The eligibility of that standard for such a  referencing should be formally assessed. It is currently conditioned to the  replacement of its normative reference towards EN 319 403 by a normative reference  to EN 319 403-1 where this standard updates of the current version of EN 319 403 to  prevent CABs to issue (or maintain valid) certificates of conformity with non-  conformities to the eIDAS Regulation.  This adoption would not fulfil the need for a harmonised CAS but at least would  formalise the recognition of the current recommended EA eIDAS accreditation  scheme. It would also clarify the requirement for CABs accredited under this scheme  to have a suitable and appropriate CAS leading to the production of a CAR fulfilling a  minimum set of requirements largely demanded by EU MS SBs.  LEG-3. Reference formally assessed appropriate standards regarding (Q)TSP and the QTS  they provide, in particular pursuant to Art.19.4, Art.24.5, Art.28.6, Art.32.2, Art.33.2,  Art.34.2, Art.38.6, Art.40, Art.42.2, Art.44.2, and Art.45.2.  It is a fact that such referencing may not confer to these standards a presumption of  compliance to the entire set of the eIDAS requirements applicable to each type of  QTSP/QTS. However, this may lower significantly the level of uncertainty on the side  of QTSPs, and remove barriers to QTS market development and adoption.  In the absence of harmonised CAS(s), such adoptions may also facilitate the work of  the CABs and contribute to increasing the number of CABs accredited to assess  more types of QTS.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  37  Adopting such implementing Acts has however revealed to be a quite lengthy and  uncertain process as so far, none of the above-mentioned Acts has been adopted  despite numerous attempts from EU MSs to have such adoption process started. It is  also subject to the eligibility of the current standards to be referenced and to the  impossibility to amend those standards by means of the implementing Act when parts  would need to be changed. The current shape of the Regulation does not give the  mandate to the Commission to do so or to create the specifications itself. So, when  failures of candidate standards are identified during the eligibility assessments, those  would need to be notified to the competent standardisation organisations for updating  the standards accordingly and republishing them.  LEG-4. In the context of Art.49 review of the application of the eIDAS Regulation, and as the  deadline for the related review report is approaching (01.07.2020), for potential  proposals for improvement, it is advisable to consider modifying the scope or the  specific provisions of the Regulation:  a. If the Cybersecurity Act track is an option, rewrite Article 20 of the eIDAS  Regulation, e.g. in a manner that makes it clear that the scheme creation  process envisaged under the Cybersecurity Act should not be limited to  information security aspects but could also be used to establish QTSP/QTS  certification scheme(s). It could clarify that the contents of such schemes  should consider the entirety of the eIDAS Regulation requirements as being  relevant to supporting the security of QTSP/QTS. In that way, it would be  more unambiguously clear that the Act is a suitable and viable path for  establishing the required schemes.  b. In the absence of such an option:  i. Consider clarifying the mandatory aspect of standards referenced under  Art.20.4 of the eIDAS Regulation.  ii. Require the adoption of an implementing Act specifying a harmonised  CAS for each of the types of QTSP/QTS specified by the Regulation,  covering the confirmation that certified QTSP/QTSs meet all applicable  requirements of the Regulation. CAS should be added for  assessing/auditing QTSP processes in the context of Annex II.3 & 4 and  in the context of implementation of Art.24.1(d).  iii. Extend current implementing Act coverage to all applicable requirements  of the Regulation for each of the types of QTSP/QTS specified in the  Regulation.  Figure 7: Flow of legal actions toward EU Harmonised eIDAS CAS(s)  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  38  5.3 ACTIONS REGARDING THE DESIGN OF EU HARMONISED QTSP/QTS  CAS  Note: The entity responsible for taking all of the CAS-x recommendations forward is/are the  body(ies) that will be assigned the task to develop EU harmonised CAS within the selected legal  approach.  Irrespective of the chosen legal instrument, EU harmonised CASs should be established for  each of the (nine) types of QTSP/QTS and for assessing/auditing QTSP component service or  processes in the context of Annex II.3 & 4 and of Art.24.1(d). These CASs should be designed  in accordance with the following recommendations:  CAS-1. Include the harmonised CAS(s) in an accreditation framework based on ISO/IEC  17065, supplemented by EN 319 403-1 and by TS 119 403-3;  CAS-2. Design the harmonised CAS(s) in accordance with ISO/IEC 17067;  CAS-3. Design the harmonised CAS(s) to be suitable and efficient in confirming that the  assessed QTSP/QTS is meeting the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. For example, specifying sufficient concrete requirements, criteria,  criteria objectives, checks and tests, to be used by the CAB to conduct the  assessment of QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation;  CAS-4. Structure the assessment and assessment reporting in accordance with the list of  requirements (following the numbering of the articles) of the Regulation while  mapping them with the list of criteria and criteria objectives, the checks, tests and  evaluations the CAB shall conduct to demonstrate the assessed QTSP/QTS meet  the corresponding requirements;  CAS-5. Identify as detailed as possible technical/operational criteria and criteria objectives  about each of these applicable eIDAS requirements that can serve as a basis for  audits. Information and guidance for this identification may be taken from relevant  ESO standards, ENISA guidelines, nationally defined and/or private sector  schemes;  CAS-6. Leverage on the existing relevant standards whose technical compliance is aimed  to facilitate the demonstration of QTSP/QTS compliance with the eIDAS Regulation  requirements (e.g. CEN/CENELEC & ETSI EN/TS x19 xxx standards, ISO/IEC  27001, ISO/IEC 27701);  CAS-7. Leverage on the existing conformance testing facilities provided by ESOs and/or,  by the EC (e.g. CEF building blocks reference implementations or testing facilities),  that are suitable to support the conformance of implementation of QTSP/QTS with  the eIDAS Regulation requirements;  CAS-8. Design the harmonised CAS(s) in a way not hindering the technology neutral  approach of the eIDAS Regulation and leaving QTSP free to select the technical  standards of their choice. Allow for alternative controls/measures exhibiting  equivalent assurance and security;  CAS-9. Provide guidance (or requirements) on the minimum audit time and effort for  completion of full assessments and surveillance assessments. This guidance (or  the requirements) would aim to ensure a sufficient level of quality and bring  credibility to the assessment outcome. Factors include the audit time for completion  of full assessment, the level of expert-knowledge of the auditor/audit team, efficient  audit procedures and used tools for automation of audits;  CAS-10. Allow the harmonised CAS to be combined with other-purpose assessments (e.g.  ISMS, PIMS, CA/Browser Forum) and ensure that for multi-purpose certification  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  39  schemes, it is requested to make use of as many distinct declarations (attestations)  of conformity as there are identified purposes;  CAS-11. Allow for the inclusion of requirements defined at national level, when and only  when such national specificities are foreseen or allowed by the eIDAS Regulation.  For example, suspension rules for qualified certificates for electronic signatures  and/or for electronic seals, and identification of persons in the context of Article  24.1(d) of the Regulation.  CAS-12. Allow for composite certification, and handling of composite audits, where  components (and/or processes) of a QTS are audited separately by different CABs,  in a way that  a. Service component certification schemes are designed separately or clearly  identified in the corresponding QTS certification scheme allowing distinct QTS  components to be assessed independently with the aim of an appropriate  aggregation to support the assessment of the overall QTS, without having to  repeat a full assessment of all components again.  b. CABs can take into considerations earlier audit reports/certification decisions  when performing the assessment of a QTSP/QTS.  c. Rules for accepting existing and underlying certification are clearly  established24.  d. The certification of “Remote QSCD operation and management”, of “(Q)TS  factory services”, of “registration authorities” and in particular the certification  of \"remote identification procedures\" foreseen in Art.24.1(d) of eIDAS are  amongst the first composite certification schemes needed.  CAS-13. Consider harmonising surveillance activities and their periodicity.  5.4 CAS OWNER(S)  Once established, the EU-wide eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification schemes should be maintained  appropriately (including in a transparent, consistent, and agile way) to ensure they remain fit for  purpose in the long run.  A continuous improvement process shall be defined for such scheme. This implies the  designation of a scheme management authority (i.e. scheme owner), of an EU-wide  representative working group and the design of a review process. The working group should  include relevant stakeholders, including NABs (potentially represented by EA), EA, EU MS  representatives (e.g. members of the eIDAS experts group), EU MS SBs, FESA, each and  every eIDAS accredited CAB and candidate CABs, independent experts and/or academics,  ESOs, QTSPs and ENISA. In particular, rules must be defined for:   Maintaining the scheme(s)   Providing documented guidance on how to apply it(them)   Dealing with new situations encountered by CABs and/or SBs and consequently  providing/updating guidance on how to apply the scheme in consequence.  5.5 “QUICK WINS”  Note: The responsible entity for taking each QW-x recommendation forward is the individual  entity mentioned in each of the respective sections (ETSI, EA or CABs).  The following quick wins should be implemented as of now:  QW-1. ETSI to be advised  a. to provide the appropriate corrections to ETSI EN 319 403 when updating it  under EN 319 403-1 (see section 3.3)  24 See section 2.3.4  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  40  b. to update TS 119 403-3 to normatively refer to EN 319 403-1 instead of  referring to EN 319 403.  QW-2. EA to be advised  a. to update its recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme to ISO/IEC 17065,  supplemented by ETSI EN 319 403-1 and by ETSI TS 119 403-3 in an  updated version to refer to EN 319 403-1.  b. to clarify towards its members (i.e. the NABs):  i. the wording to be used in order to indicate the scope of the  accreditation of CABs in the context of eIDAS. Clear guidance  should be provided for each of the nine types of QTS specified by  the eIDAS Regulation.  ii. the need to include in the eIDAS accreditation attestation or  certificate issued to a CAB, the location where the corresponding  accredited conformity assessment scheme (or certification scheme)  is available for each type of QTS the CAB is accredited for  conducting audits against the eIDAS Regulation.  iii. the need to ensure the provision of historical information regarding  the grant of the accreditation on a per QTSP/QST type basis.  iv. the need to provide an indication, when the EA recommended eIDAS  accreditation scheme is not used or not entirely used, that the  alternative scheme used has been determined equivalent and under  which basis.  c. To promote the eIDAS recommended accreditation scheme to the IAF level  (see section 4.4).  QW-3. Currently accredited eIDAS CABs to be advised  a. to request extending the scope of their eIDAS accreditation to ETSI TS 119  403-3, as they may already do so towards their competent NAB.  b. not issuing eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification of conformity with the eIDAS  Regulation as long as there exist non-conformities to this Regulation25.  c. for multi-purpose certification schemes, to make use of as many distinct  declarations (attestations) of conformity as there are identified purposes.  QW-4. All eIDAS accredited CABs to be advised to create a CAB cooperation working  group gathering each and every eIDAS accredited CAB, as well as candidates,  on a free of charge and automatic (or voluntary) basis, all having equal voice and  vote. This group would aim to facilitate harmonization of the application of eIDAS  QTSP/QTS conformity assessment schemes, approaches and criteria.  It would  be key as well for this group to cooperate tightly with SBs (e.g. FESA, EU MS  eIDAS expert group members), ENISA and the European Standardisation  Organisations.  25 This would actually be illegal under the eIDAS Regulation.

Qualified trust service providers  (QTSPs) and the qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide are bound by more stringent  responsibilities, including in relation to quality and supervision.  As a prerequisite to entering the market and providing QTS, a prospective QTSP/QTS must first  be audited by an eIDAS accredited conformity assessment body (CAB) to confirm, through a  conformity assessment (audit) report (a CAR) that the QTSP and the QTS it provides meet the  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. Once the CAR has been created, the prospective QTSP  must provide notice of its intention to provide QTS to its competent national supervisory body  (SB). The SB will verify the conformance of the prospective QTSP/QTS to the eIDAS Regulation  based on the submitted CAR and will grant or decline a qualified status.  The eIDAS Regulation however does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any  conformity assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited.  Instead, the eIDAS Regulation requires the CAB to be accredited in the framework of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008], which is the generic European regulation in  relation to accreditation. It furthermore requires that the conformity assessment scheme (CAS)  used by the CAB is eIDAS specific.  Currently, 30 eIDAS CABs are accredited to perform conformity assessments in 11 EU Member  States (MS), based on an accreditation scheme, which is recommended by the European  cooperation for Accreditation (EA). The EA is the body recognised under Regulation (EC) No  765/2008 to manage a peer evaluation system across national accreditation bodies (NABs)  from the EU Member States and other European countries. However, this scheme is not  mandatory under the eIDAS Regulation, and EU MS may therefore elect to choose another  scheme, provided that it can be shown to satisfy the eIDAS requirements. The scheme chosen  requires eIDAS CABs to be certification bodies meeting the requirements of ISO/IEC 17065  supplemented by EN 319 403, with the eIDAS Regulation itself being the normative document  against which the conformance of QTSP/QTS needs to be evaluated. The competence of the  CAB to conduct such evaluations needs to be accredited by its NAB.  The challenge – variations in practice and the need for better harmonisation  A specific feature of the eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by the EA, and intrinsically  of the eIDAS Regulation as the normative document, is that the requirements against which the  QTSP/QTS must be certified are technology neutral legal requirements, expressed in terms of  functional objectives. Furthermore, no standard may be mandatorily imposed upon the QTSP  for providing QTS in conformance with the Regulation in order not to negatively impact  innovation and/or harm competition.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  7  In addition, no eIDAS secondary legislation has been adopted to date to reference any standard  that would create a legal presumption of compliance with any requirement of the eIDAS  Regulation for the QTSP. As a result, there is significant margin of interpretation and for policy  choices in creating, interpreting and applying accreditation and certification approaches.  The difference in approach and in assessment effort for accreditation of CABs and for the  certification of QTSP/QTS is reported by a vast majority of stakeholders (including EA) as  hindering the mutual recognition of accredited certification of electronic trust services.  The present report aims to propose ways in which the eIDAS assessment regime can be  strengthened based on the current regime of the eIDAS Regulation, the stakeholders’ concerns  and the legitimate need to move towards a more harmonised approach with regards to the  assessment by CABs of the conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of that Regulation.  It focuses in particular on actions towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for  QTSP/QTS.  The solution – potential roads forward  This report lists the following recommendations in moving towards a harmonised CAS for  QTSP/QTS:   Actions regarding legal instrument(s). Formalisation of the CAS by the European  Commission as an official scheme with legal recognition across EU via legal  document(s).   Actions regarding the design of the harmonised CAS. The design of a harmonised  CAS by ENISA and the European Commission (under the Cybersecurity Act) or by the  European Commission (under the eIDAS Regulation) can be based on ISO/IEC 17065,  EN 319 403-1 and TS 119 403-3 “Additional req. for CABs assessing EU QTSPs”,  designed in accordance with ISO/IEC 17067 “Fundamentals of product certification  and guidelines for product certification schemes”.   Actions regarding continuous improvement of CAS: Define process and involved  actors for a harmonised CAS, governed by a scheme management authority (i.e.  scheme owner) together with EU-wide representative working group, under a defined  review method.   Quick wins. EA, ETSI, and CABs actions could be implemented by each of them  individually in the short term. Examples constitute the update of EN 319 403 and  consequently TS 119 403-3, the update of EA-recommendations to refer to TS 119  403-3, and the non-issuance of certificates of conformity with identified pending non-  conformities.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  8  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 SETTING THE SCENE  Regulation (EU) N°910/2014, on electronic identification and trust services for electronic  transactions in the internal market [eIDAS, 2014] (hereinafter eIDAS Regulation), introduced  legal provisions at the EU level in relation to qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) listed in  the Regulation, and to the qualified trust services (QTSs) they provide (hereinafter collectively  referred to as QTSP/QTSs).  A key policy choice made by the eIDAS Regulation is that, in order to be granted qualified  status that allows providing QTSs, trust service providers (TSPs) and the QTSs they plan to  make available must first demonstrate that they meet the requirements of the Regulation. This  implies that TSPs and the QTSs at hand need to undergo a specific process and receive a  ‘green light’ from a competent national supervisory body (SB) to attest to their compliance. If  successful, this process then leads to their inclusion in the national trusted list attesting their  qualified status.  As part of this process, the prospective QTSP/QTS must be audited by an eIDAS accredited  conformity assessment body (CAB) to confirm, through a conformity assessment (audit) report  (CAR), that they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  As the next step of the process, the prospective QTSP notifies its intention to provide QTS to its  competent national supervisory body (SB) together with the positive CAR resulting from such an  assessment. Considering such CAR, the SB will verify the conformance of the prospective  QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation and will decide to whether or not to grant, a qualified  status.  Figure 1. eIDAS QTSP/QTS compliance assessment and verification process  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  9  The eIDAS Regulation does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any conformity  assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited. Instead, the  eIDAS Regulation requires the CAB to be accredited:   In the framework of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008]   For the execution of a conformity assessment scheme that is eIDAS specific, i.e.  confirming that, for a specific type of QTSP/QTS, a QTSP/QTS is meeting the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The European cooperation for Accreditation1 (EA) is the body recognised under Regulation (EC)  No 765/2008 to manage a peer evaluation system across national accreditation bodies (NABs)  from the EU Member States and other European countries. EA has adopted the  recommendation2 to use an eIDAS accreditation scheme based on the [ISO/IEC 17065]  accreditation framework, supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403], as one possible route for CABs  to assess conformity with relevant requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by the EA requires:   The accreditation of the CAB is based on the [ISO/IEC 17065] framework.   The [ISO/IEC 17065] accreditation framework of the CAB to be supplemented by [ETSI  EN 319 403], which specifies additional dedicated requirements for CABs carrying out  the certification of TSP/TS, towards defined criteria against which they claim  conformance (those criteria being identified as the “Normative Document”).   The accreditation of the CAB to confirm the skills and competence of the CAB to  conduct conformity assessments of QTSP/QTS against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. Indeed, the scheme defines the Regulation as the Normative Document  laying down criteria/requirements against which the QTSP/QTS conformance is to be  assessed.  Figure 2: eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by EA  A specific characteristic of the eIDAS accreditation scheme recommended by the EA, and  intrinsically of the eIDAS Regulation as Normative Document, is that the requirements against  which the QTSP/QTS have to be certified are not technical requirements, but technology neutral  legal requirements expressed in terms of functional objectives. This is largely a continuation of  the eIDAS Regulation general policy preference for technical neutrality. The Normative  1 http://www.european-accreditation.org/  2 EA Resolution 2014 (34) 22 and EA document EAGA(14)31: https://european-accreditation.org/wp- content/uploads/2018/10/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-.pdf  http://www.european-accreditation.org/ https://european-accreditation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-.pdf https://european-accreditation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/34th-ea-ga-approved-resolutions-.pdf  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  10  Document is therefore not a technical standard but the QTSP/QTS applicable requirements  from the eIDAS Regulation itself. Neither the eIDAS Regulation nor the EA specify the effective  technical criteria or the technical certification scheme stemming from the provisions of the  eIDAS Regulation.  Furthermore, no standard is mandated, and no standard may be mandated, under the eIDAS  Regulation, in relation to QTSPs or QTS to be granted a qualified status. QTSPs are free to  implement any standard, or they may choose to implement no standard at all, provided they can  demonstrate that they and the QTS provided meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Finally, no eIDAS secondary legislation has been adopted to date to reference any standard  that would create a legal presumption of compliance with any requirement of the eIDAS  Regulation for the QTSP that choose to adhere to that standard or for the QTS it provides.  However, even if such secondary legislation would have been adopted, compliance to such  standards would still remain voluntary for QTSPs: their use remains optional.  1.2 THE NEED FOR A HARMONISED eIDAS QTSP/QTS CERTIFICATION  SCHEME  The eIDAS accreditation approach that is recommended by the EA has been widely adopted by  the European NABs (national accreditation bodies) that have accredited CABs in the context of  the eIDAS Regulation. However, based on the situation described above and the legal and  policy choices made by the European legislator, there is still significant diversity regarding the  conformity assessment (certification) schemes used by those CABs in practice. This diversity  results from the current accreditation framework that de facto requires CABs to define their own  conformity assessment scheme.  There is no obligation for NABs or competent national supervisory bodies to provide guidance to  CABs for designing an appropriate eIDAS conformity assessment scheme. It seems that very  few NAB actually mandate CABs they accredit to go through a specific, [ISO/IEC 17067] based,  process to define such an eIDAS conformity assessment scheme. Amongst the few other NABs  and/or supervisory bodies, that are providing guidance on the list of controls and control  objectives that should be used to assess QTSP/QTSs conformance to eIDAS, most of them are  leveraging on ETSI standards3, as is or by profiling them.  Despite the fact that most of the certification schemes defined by CABs (with or without  guidance from competent authorities) are in whole or in part based on ETSI standards, when  such standards are available, there is no visible coordination and no enforcement of a single  scheme at EU level.  The quality of those standards, their adequacy for use by QTSP/QTSs to meet the requirements  of the eIDAS Regulation and hence their eligibility for being referenced to meet the  requirements are still to be formally assessed and demonstrated.  Most CABs do not make conformity assessment scheme documents they use in practice  publicly available. As a result, relying parties are hampered in their legitimate quest for trust and  accountability, and cannot obtain a reasonable confidence that QTSP/QTSs meet the  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  Furthermore, despite the peer review mechanism imposed at the level of NABs by Regulation  (EC) 765/2008, there is little or no assurance on the quality of the currently accredited CAB  certification schemes to enable the CAB to confirm effectively that assessed QTSP/QTSs meet  3 See section 6.2.2.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  11  the eIDAS requirements. QTSPs may use a CAB located anywhere in the EU and accredited by  a NAB from a different country than the one in which the QTSP is established. Supervisory  bodies experienced that CARs from different eIDAS accredited CABs may differ significantly not  only a difference in the formal approach used by such CABs, but also and more importantly a  diversity in terms of quality and adequacy of their assessments against the eIDAS Regulation.  Concerning non-EU countries, it became clear that the IAF MLA driven accreditation scheme  based on [ISO/IEC 17065] (potentially supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403]) is a candidate for  such countries to base their national QTSP/QTS certification scheme on, particularly for other  QTS than issuing qualified certificates4. Moreover, it is possible and usual for such 3rd countries  to expand and finalise the ETSI EN 319 403-based scheme by the establishment of a  harmonised, specific and complete certification scheme. This scheme will lay down to a  sufficient level of technical details, the exact set of controls and control objectives that the CAB  will have to use to conduct a conformity assessment of a QTSP/QTS against more generic legal  provisions. This may be facilitated by the fact that national legislations may reference standards  as binding normative documents (contrary to the eIDAS Regulation). Moreover, 3rd countries  point out that the EA recommended scheme is incomplete and falls short of a harmonised  eIDAS certification scheme. This jeopardizes a mutual recognition of EU QTSP/QTSs, simply  because the diversity in conducting the audits of QTSP/QTS over EU might not guarantee an  acceptable level of reliability compared to the 3rd country applicable scheme.  Figure 3: Existing diversity in CAS creates issues  One of the prime purposes of the eIDAS Regulation is to establish an EU wide recognition of  the legal effects attributed to qualified trust services and their outputs (e.g. “A qualified  electronic signature based on a qualified certificate issued in one Member State shall be  recognised as a qualified electronic signature in all other Member States”, Art.25(3)). To this  4 The scheme based on ISO/IEC 17065 and supplemented by ETSI EN 319 403 is applicable to any type of TSP/TS for  being assessed to any type of standard, technical specification or regulation. It is completely independent of the eIDAS  Regulation. The EA recommended eIDAS scheme is adding to this generic scheme the eIDAS Regulation as the normative  documents against which the QTSP/QTS need to be assessed conformant. Any non-EU 3rd country may act similarly by  adding its own regulatory or technical specifications as normative criteria against which national TSP/TS need to be  assessed conformant.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  12  extent, it is critical for the requirements against which QTSP/QTSs are assessed to be  comprehensive, consistently applied and sufficiently detailed to reduce the scope for variances  in the assurance provided in the trustworthiness across different QTSP/QTSs. The lack of a  harmonised scheme concerning the accreditation of CABs and the conformity assessment  (certification) of QTSP/QTSs may:   Introduce risks due to inconsistent standards and controls being applied.   Diminish potentially the overall confidence in the eIDAS regulated QTSs.   Impact negatively the trustworthiness and acceptability of these QTSs not only in the EU  internal market, but also when interoperability with non-EU countries or international  organisations is considered, and when recognition of QTSs in widely deployed  applications or browsers is targeted.  Therefore, a key issue to address is the move toward harmonisation of conformity assessment  of QTSP/QTSs, and of related conformity assessment schemes in particular.  1.3 PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT  The present report aims to propose ways in which the eIDAS assessment regime can be  strengthened based on the current regime of the eIDAS Regulation, stakeholders’ concerns and  legitimate needs to move towards a more harmonised approach for the assessment of the  conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of that Regulation,. It focusses in particular on  actions towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS.   Section 2 describes inputs collected from relevant stakeholders on the assessment of  QTSP/QTSs in the context of eIDAS.   Section 3 analyses the available legal framework and instruments to support actions  towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS.   Section 4 analyses the gaps towards such a harmonised scheme.   Section 5 proposes concrete actions towards such a harmonised eIDAS QTSP/QTS  conformity assessment scheme.

STAKEHOLDERS’ INPUTS  2.1 INTRODUCTION  This part addresses inputs concerning the assessment of QTSP/QTSs in the context of eIDAS  as collected from relevant stakeholders, including (Supervisory Bodies) SBs, NABs, CABs,  QTSPs, and other stakeholders such as browser or application vendors.  2.2 THE VIEWPOINT OF SUPERVISORY BODIES  2.2.1 Foreword  The study team received inputs from 7 SBs out of the 31 SBs. All responsive SBs agree on the  need for harmonisation of QTSP/QTSs conformity assessment (or certification) schemes used  by eIDAS accredited CABs. Their main inputs may be summarised as follows.  2.2.2 On the EA recommended accreditation scheme  While the EA recommended scheme based on ISO/IEC 17065 in combination with [ETSI EN  319 403] is accepted to be the correct way in going forward towards harmonising the eIDAS  CAB accreditation and QTSP/QTS certification schemes at the EU level, the need for a number  of improvements have been identified by most of the responsive Member States:  a) Clarification on details and content of audit reports and conformity declarations:   It appears that at times, NABs might not be fully aware of the importance and the  purpose of the CAR in the eIDAS framework. The fact that the CAR must be sent to  the SB (where in general use of the [ISO/IEC 17065] for product or service certification,  the assessment report is for the certification holder only) and the fact that the SB relies  heavily on the content and the completeness of the CAR are new to most of the actors  involved. In the context of its recommended eIDAS scheme, the EA should consider  clarifying the importance of the CAR as essential input for the decision of the SB and  that no barrier should be placed to its dissemination to the competent SB.   The recent publication of [ETSI TS 119 403-3] is welcomed as it specifies additional  requirements for CABs assessing eIDAS QTSP/QTSs focusing on the structure and  content of eIDAS CAR. The CAR is an essential element for the SB to base its  SB / EU MS  Urging for harmonised CAS, with:   Clarifying CAR details and contents   Hermonisation in NABs delivering accreditation   Handling multipurpose audits (need for clear eIDAS compliance statement)   Clarifying composite certification approach   Allowing for national specificities   Clear ownership and maintenance   Legal instrument support  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  14  verification of the compliance of the assessed QTSP/QTS with the applicable eIDAS  requirements and, if granting a qualified status, to express in a correct way the  corresponding qualification decision in the Trusted List. Responsive SBs experience  significant differences in the scope and quality of the received CARs (e.g. minimum  content not always present, length and level of details highly varied and sometimes  insufficient, occurrences of significant errors or omissions, and sometimes not  sufficiently elaborated evaluation reports). EA should consider extending its currently  recommended eIDAS scheme with this [ETSI TS 119 403-3] standard.   The next update of the current version of [ETSI EN 319 403] (expected to be published  under the reference EN 319 403-1) should also be considered for updating the current  EA recommended scheme. Particularly, EN 319 403-1 should include important  corrections regarding the management of non-conformities in the process of issuing  certification declarations (attestations). Reporting requirements and the way for  handling non-conformities and/or other non-critical issues (e.g. area of improvements)  must be part of the accreditation scheme.   Further guidance should be provided on the minimum audit time and effort for  completion of the full assessment and surveillance assessment respectively. The  quality and the credibility of an assessment are based primarily5 on two factors: (1) the  audit time for completion of full assessment and (2) the level of expert-knowledge of  the auditor/audit team. Taking into consideration that these factors are also the main  cost-drivers, the risk exists that in a competitive market, the quality and credibility of  the assessment becomes subordinate to the price of the assessment.  b) Further harmonization between the different NABs delivering accreditation:   The way NABs are wording the scope of the accreditation of CABs in the context of  eIDAS is far from being harmonised. The feeling exists that the NABs are not fully aware  of the nine types of QTSP/QTSs specified in the eIDAS Regulation and that the  corresponding certification scheme(s) must target the corresponding requirements (or  articles) of the eIDAS Regulation.   The way CAB accreditation certificates are maintained by NABs is also not harmonised  and does not seem to ensure the provision of historical information regarding the grant  of the accreditation on a per QTSP/QTS type basis.   When the EA recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme is not used or not entirely  used, it is not easy to identify whether the alternative scheme has been determined  equivalent and under which basis. From a supervisory point of view, responsive SBs  believe it is highly desirable to have [ETSI EN 319 403] being part of the requirements.  2.2.3  (Multipurpose) Certification scheme  Most of the eIDAS certification schemes used by CABs, that the reporting SBs have  experienced, are based on relevant ETSI standards. Especially for certificate-based trust  services, many of these schemes are multi-purpose certification schemes. They include  requirements from the CA/Browser Forum (Baseline [BRG] and EV [EVG]) as well as  local/national requirements.  Already in the context of a single-purpose (eIDAS) certification scheme, it is experienced that it  can be very difficult to identify which certification scheme, and hence which requirements,  criteria, checks and/or tests, have been used by the CAB to conduct the assessment and the  extent to which they have been used. Even if the certification scheme is referred to in the CAR,  5 Other factors such as for example efficient audit procedures and used tools for automation of audits should be taken into  account to define the quality and the credibility of an assessment.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  15  it is not always clear which concrete measures are put in place by the QTSP and assessed by  the CAB before delivering a conformity attestation.  As the eIDAS requirements are expressed in terms of functional objectives, there is a need for  more concrete criteria (technical and organizational) for allowing proper assessment. The use of  the QTSP/QTS relevant requirements in the appropriate ETSI and CEN standards are  recommended as a basis for designing QTSP/QTSs harmonised certification schemes. It is  believed that this can be done in a way not hindering the technology neutral approach of the  eIDAS Regulation and leaving QTSP freedom of choosing the technical standards of choice.  Reporting requirements and the way for handling non-conformities and/or other non-critical  issues (e.g. area of improvements) must be part of the certification scheme if not explicitly  handled in the accreditation scheme.  In general, and in particular for multi-purpose certification schemes, it is advised to make use of  as many distinct declarations (attestations) of conformity as there are identified purposes.  There is an expectation that a good policy choice to develop eIDAS certification schemes could  stem from the recommendations of [ISO/IEC 17067].  2.2.4 Composite certification approach  Splitting operations and responsibilities regarding the provision of a trust service into various  component services used between the TSP itself and 3rd parties is common practice among  customers. For example, a TSP issuing electronic certificates may limit its effective operation to  bear the overall and final liability on the trust service it provides on its contracted customers,  while outsourcing completely the operation of all component services (including registration and  enrolment of customers (RA), certificate validity status information services, repository services,  PKI factory services, etc).  It is also a trend for such 3rd parties to specialize in the provision of (Q)TS component services  and to offer their expertise to many different TSPs.  Responsive Member States believe that a harmonised certification model to allow different  (Q)TS components to be assessed independently, with the aim for an appropriate aggregation  to support the assessment of the overall (Q)TS, without having to repeat a full assessment of all  components again. This would allow the CAB to take into consideration earlier audit  reports/certification decisions when performing the assessment of a QTSP/QTS. Rules for  accepting existing and underlying certification must nevertheless be established, e.g.:   Valid certificate not older than “x” (e.g.12) months;   Components may only be used as long as they maintain a valid certification of an  accredited CAB;   Usage of the component must be discontinued once the components certification  expires or is withdrawn;   The way earlier assessments and certifications are taken into account must be described  in the certification scheme and documented in the assessment report;   Verifying how an earlier “generic” certification of a component service applies in the case  of a specific instantiation (or use) of that certified component service in the context of  the assessment of the overall QTS. The integration of the component service into the  assessed QTS must be examined: in particular the interface(s) through which the  component is integrated must be considered.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  16  The certification of “Remote QSCD operation and management”6, of “(Q)TS managed service  components”, of “registration authorities” and in particular the certification of \"remote  identification procedures\" foreseen in Art.24(1) of eIDAS are amongst the first composite  certification schemes needed.  2.2.5 Nationally defined schemes – Private schemes  In several Member States, a scheme for the accreditation of CABs and for the certification of  QTSP/QTSs has been defined and managed either by a national competent authority (usually a  SB, or a NAB in collaboration with a SB) or by a private entity.  While most, when not all, of these schemes are built upon the same set of European standards  (e.g. ETSI x19 xxx and CEN 419 xxx series) and international standards, they include variances  (sometimes significant) in the standard references or profiling. This may induce  different/unequal treatment of CAB between Member States and force CABs willing to operate  in different Member States to consider as many different interpretations as there are nationally-  defined schemes, despite the “certified once, recognised everywhere” International  Accreditation Forum IAF principle to which European NABs and Regulation (EU) 765/2008  subscribe.  2.2.6 Ownership and maintenance of harmonised certification scheme  As a lesson learned from experience with such nationally-defined or private schemes,  responsive EU MS believe it is vital to have an active scheme owner that maintains the scheme  and provides documented guidance on how to apply it. TSPs tend to innovate, technology is in  constant evolution, and so are the risks and challenges around trust services. This means CABs  using the certification scheme will encounter new situations and will require guidance on how to  apply the scheme in consequence. The work of harmonising an EU-wide eIDAS certification  scheme would be incomplete if it did not address appropriately how the scheme can be  maintained and how harmonised guidance can be provided to its users in the future.  2.2.7 Legal instruments  Responsive SBs believe guidance on the accreditation scheme for CABs should be settled in  EU legislation. They stress the current absence of implementing acts, in particular concerning  CAB accreditation and rules on auditing and audit reporting (i.e. Art.20. 4 of eIDAS) but also  concerning QTSP/QTS requirements. Some of those SBs would prefer to see CAB related  standards become mandatory.  6 Note the ILNAS, the LU SB, provide “requirements for qualified trust service providers issuing qualified certificates for  electronic signature or for electronic seal in the case where the electronic signature creation data resp. electronic seal  creation data are managed by the qualified trust service provider on behalf of the signatory resp. creator of seal”. CAB has  to check whether those requirements are fulfilled.  https://portail-qualite.public.lu/content/dam/qualite/fr/documentations/confiance-numerique/surveillance- psc/procedures/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en.pdf  https://portail-qualite.public.lu/content/dam/qualite/fr/documentations/confiance-numerique/surveillance-psc/procedures/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en.pdf https://portail-qualite.public.lu/content/dam/qualite/fr/documentations/confiance-numerique/surveillance-psc/procedures/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en/ilnas-pscq-pr001-supervision-en.pdf  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  17  2.3 THE VIEWPOINT OF NATIONAL ACCREDITATION BODIES  2.3.1 EA inputs  EA has recommended [ETSI EN 319 403], supplementing the [ISO/IEC 17065] accreditation  framework as a suitable scheme for the accreditation of CABs assessing QTSP/QTSs against  the eIDAS Regulation as normative document. It is a preferred option, not a compulsory one.  Each NAB may adopt it for use or use another scheme, provided the framework they use is  equivalent to [ETSI EN 319 403] (at least, if they are EA members). E.g. UKAS uses two  schemes, namely [ETSI EN 319 403] and tScheme7.  The EA may not impose its recommended ISO/IEC17065+EN319403+eIDAS scheme; it may  simply try to convince competent authorities of the merits when using it. The eIDAS Regulation  does not give any mandate to the EA for doing so and is not specific for what regards  accreditation8. The EA believes it would be up to the EC, or the legislative body, to make a  decision on the (mandatory) use of [ETSI 319 403].  Note 1: Ideally, [ETSI TS 119 403-3] should better be used as the basis for the EA  recommended eIDAS scheme, supplementing [ETSI EN 319 403], or even better  supplementing the next updated version of that EN to be published as ETSI EN 319  403-1.  Note 2: The adoption of an implementing Act pursuant to Art.20.4 of eIDAS would  allow referring to [ETSI 319 403] or better [ETSI TS 119 403-3] further supplementing  its updated version EN 319 403-1. However, it is unlikely that these standards will be  made mandatory via this legal instrument to NAB for the accreditation of CABs under  eIDAS (and for CABs to carry out their conformity assessment of the qualified trust  7 https://www.tscheme.org/  8 Basically, it is the same issue as the one that applies for TSP’s audit criteria but at the level of the CAB’s accreditation  framework.  SB / EU MS  Agreeing on benefits from harmonised CAS   EA has no mandate/authority to define CAS or to amend standards to refine scheme   Cureent EA recommended scheme may be exended to CAR specification (e.g. TS 119  403-3)   Current EA recommeneded scheme might be promoted at IAF level  https://www.tscheme.org/  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  18  service providers). The current revision process of the eIDAS Regulation would also be  an option for the amended Regulation to be more prescriptive on the standards for  accrediting CABs, for the conformity assessment report and for the rules on conducting  QTSP assessments. Another option would be the certification scheme adoption  process foreseen in the EU Cybersecurity Act [CyberAct, 2019]. Section 3 in this report  sets outfurther discussions on appropriate legal instruments.  The EA recognises that having one single accreditation/certification scheme would be beneficial  and that this scheme should go as deep as to address the scoping against the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. At such a deeper level, EA noted that there is however  no guidance at the EA level on scoping [ETSI EN 319 403] against the Regulation being the  normative document. In other words, there is no EA guidance on detailing how to design an  appropriate eIDAS certification scheme, i.e. on detailing which criteria to be used by CABs to  evaluate and demonstrate QTSP/QTS conformance to eIDAS.  It should be stressed that EA and NABs do not have the authority to amend standards to further  refine the accreditation scheme down to the level of CAB certification scheme. Another  “authority” should take this under its responsibility (e.g. ESO, ENISA, EU MS, EU MS SBs,  eIDAS EU MS Experts Group). There is a need for cooperation between the relevant  “authorities” to define such schemes and probably as many schemes as there are types of  QTSP/QTS defined in eIDAS. Such definitions may or should leverage on existing and  potentially amended versions of relevant ETSI standards for QTSP/QTSs.  In collaboration with the study team, EA will conduct a survey amongst its members in  preparation of one of the next EA Certification Committee meetings. After three years of  implementation of the EA recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme, it would indeed be the  time for identifying and analysing some return on experience and lessons learned. Based on the  EA Certification Committee’s decision on this topic, the EA Working Group - ICT and Data  Security (WG ICTDS) could be solicited to propose ideas and/or concrete actions. At the date of  finalising this report, the survey was not completed. However, preliminary feedback provided by  the EA confirms the diversity of approaches used by EA members with regards to guidance or  requirements on conformity assessment schemes (CASs), within a common generic framework  based on ISO/IEC 17065 and ETSI EN 319 403. It also indicates that EA members that did not  benefit from a nationally defined CAS experienced issues with CAR suitability to support  sufficiently a SB’s informed decision to grant a qualified status. Most of the responsive member  urge for the establishment of an EU harmonised CAS. The difference in approach and in  assessment effort for accreditation of CABs is reported by a member as hindering the mutual  recognition of accredited certification of electronic trust services.  Concerning the extension of the accreditation scope (e.g. ISO/IEC 17065 + EN 319 403) to  [ETSI TS 119 403-3], existing EA defined procedures can be used by NABs at the request of  CABs. CABs may apply and ask their NAB to include TS 119 403-3 in the scope of their  accreditation. National authorities (e.g. SBs) might also require the CABs to do so, e.g. to  facilitate SBs’ decision process for granting or confirming a qualified status to (Q)TSP/(Q)TSs.  Regarding the international aspects, i.e. the promotion of [ETSI EN 319 403]-based  accreditation scheme at IAF level, EA may approach the IAF Technical Committee to enquire  about the applicable and relevant process to promote [ETSI EN 319 403] (or [ETSI TS 119 403-  3]) based accreditation scheme at the IAF level. However, such a process is likely to take quite  a long time to reach concrete results. EA believes that an ideal option would be for [ETSI EN  319 403] (or [ETSI TS 119 403-3]) to become an ISO standard or to create a bridge standard  between relevant ISO and ETSI standards.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  19  2.4 THE VIEWPOINT OF CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT BODIES  2.4.1 Foreword  All 30 CABs informally reported by the EC9 as accredited against the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation have been accredited under the [ISO/IEC 17065] framework. For two of them, the  “scope of accreditation” provided by the corresponding NAB does not (clearly) indicate this  framework being supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403], however both CAB certification schemes  claim to abide by this standard.  Amongst the currently 30 eIDAS accredited CABs, very few are publishing or providing upon  request a copy of their accredited eIDAS conformity assessment (or certification) scheme.  Making this information available on request is, however, an obligation for ISO/IEC 17065  accredited CABs, as per clause 4.6 of [ISO/IEC 17065].  Amongst the identified CASs used by the eIDAS accredited CABs, four main categories can be  identified:   CASs that are fully specified by national authorities (e.g. SBs in CZ, SK) and are  mandatory for use by CABs nationally accredited under eIDAS;   CASs that are fully established by national authorities (e.g. SB from FR), which are not  mandatory for use by CABs accredited under eIDAS but may be used by them, providing  a presumption of compliance to assessed QTSP/QTS when successfully audited against  these CAS;   CASs that are partially guided by specific requirements driven by national authorities  (e.g. SBs and/or NABs like in BE, ES, IT, LU, MT, NL);   CASs that are fully driven and defined by CABs without specific guidance from national  authorities.  The next subsections summarise the input provided by the CABs to the study team.  2.4.2 Being accredited as a CAB for eIDAS conformity assessments  Being accredited as a CAB may represent both a significant investment and risk for newcomer  bodies. For a market to be open and efficient, new players usually ask for certainty and clear rules  9 See https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity-assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements- eidas-regulation  CABS  Agreeing on benefits from harmonised CAS   Providing for guidance in evaluating compliance with eIDAS   Clarifying certification decision versus SB’s decision to grant or not a qualified status   Supporting set-up of cooperation working group betewwn CABs   Handling composite and multipurpose audits   Handling national specificities   Innovation supportive   Harmonising efforts and surveillance programms  https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity-assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/list-conformity-assessment-bodies-cabs-accredited-against-requirements-eidas-regulation  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  20  on how to be compliant, making sure in advance that their investment will result in their successful  accreditation. The absence of clear rules, or at least of sufficient guidance, may represent an  entry barrier and favour existing players, hampering the diversity of CABs.  In the absence of an EU-wide harmonised conformity assessment scheme or of guidance from  national authorities (e.g. SBs), each CAB has to define its own scheme. New CABs are in  search of guidance that they typically find in ETSI standards, ENISA guidelines, or nationally-  defined schemes (e.g. [ANSSI, 2017], [NSA-CS], [DKPv2]). This significant upfront investment  for a definition of a scheme may be thought unnecessary, as the resulting situation is that most  of the certification schemes defined by CABs are in whole or in part based on the same ETSI  standards. As the CAR needs to demonstrate meeting each applicable eIDAS requirement, the  schemes are structured typically as a mapping for each of the eIDAS requirements for  QTSP/QTS. These requirements are guided from controls (criteria) and control (criteria)  objectives taken from these ETSI standards, supplemented for identified gaps by more generic  standards such as ISO 27001, or other legal frameworks such as GDPR for data protection.  Would a CAB aim to target a wider market than its homeland market, the variances between  applicable nationally-defined schemes10 may create additional burden to align the scheme of  the CAB. Coordination / harmonization / centralization among CABs, NABs and SBs would  greatly improve the process, and additionally lower the above-mentioned entry barrier.  It is worth noting that the ETSI standards aimed to support the implementation of the eIDAS  Regulation were drafted first as standardized requirements for specific PKI-based  implementations of QTSP/QTS. They provide less guidance or no guidance at all for the audit of  “alternative”, “innovative” or “creative” implementations of the eIDAS requirements. In these  specific cases, the CAB may have to transpose its regular practices, checklists and controls.  This ad hoc transposition usually occurs “on the spot” during the preparation phase between  stage 1 and stage 2 of that audit. In addition, as the demonstration of skills and competence of  the CAB during its accreditation by the NAB was performed most probably on an “ETSI-based  standard case” and not against the Regulation, the quality of this particular conformity  assessment might be at risk.  2.4.3 eIDAS CABs are certification bodies  As CABs accredited under [ISO/IEC 17065] are certification bodies, they issue a certificate in  addition to the CAR resulting from their audit of a QTSP/QTS. The situation may be misleading  as this certificate testifies that the assessed QTSP/QTS conforms to the applicable eIDAS  requirements from the viewpoint of the CAB. Such a certificate of conformity is (as required by  EN 319 403) published on the CAB’s website as soon as the audit is successful, which will likely  occur before the decision of the SB to grant a qualified status to the assessed QTSP/QTS. As  the decision to grant such a qualified status is ultimately the responsibility of the competent SB,  it may happen that the decision of the SB differs from the CAB’s certification decision. This may  create confusion for relying parties and should be addressed as much as possible in the  harmonised certification scheme.  2.4.4 Cooperation - competition  The eIDAS Regulation does not regulate or address the cooperation between CABs. Most  CABs are private companies, and in competition with each other in an open market. This may  make a CAB cooperation working group difficult to setup as existing players may typically  protect their long-invested expertise, as opposed to newcomers who will likely be in favour of  sharing experiences.  10 The variances pointed to here do not only address areas where the EU Member States are entitled to adopt national  provisions (e.g. certificate suspension, Art.24(1).d alternative identification methods) but address those variances in  interpreting the way common provisions from the eIDAS Regulation should be implemented by QTSP/QTS.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  21  Nevertheless, the establishment of such a CAB cooperation-working group could facilitate  harmonization of the application of conformity assessment approaches and criteria, particularly  in a situation where each CAB designed its own scheme. Even in the case of a harmonised EU-  wide certification scheme, equally accredited CABs may differently interpret and apply the  conformity assessment criteria, resulting in hard to compare certifications of QTSP/QTSs. Some  related ETSI standards help to partially mitigate these discrepancies, but not to an acceptable  extent. Additionally, there is currently no 'legally resilient' link between eIDAS and the ETSI  standards.  The set-up and functioning of such a CAB cooperation working group would only be efficient if  every eIDAS accredited CAB, as well as CABs interested in becoming eIDAS accredited, could  participate free of charge and on a voluntary basis11, all having equal voice and vote.12 It would  be key as well that such a group shall tightly cooperate with SBs (e.g. FESA, EU MS eIDAS  expert group members), ENISA and the European Standardisation Organisations.  2.4.5 Composite audits  With the growing number of specialised component service providers (e.g. CA factory,  identification service provider under Article 24.1(d) of eIDAS, QTSP hosting a remote QSCD,  service provider for eRDS), the harmonised certification scheme should take into account the  handling of composite audits, where components of a QTS are audited separately by different  CABs.  National frameworks exist for the recognition of such component audits by CABs in charge of  the QTS audit, such as in Germany13 or in The Netherlands under former Directive  1999/93/EC14. The recognition of such component audits at the European level should be  included in the harmonised scheme, including the handling of possibly different validity periods  for each of the resulting audit reports.  2.4.6 Multipurpose audits  The most common situations where multipurpose audits are required by (Q)TSPs to address  their need or wish to be assessed as conformant to CA/Browser Forum requirements, and/or to  specific ETSI standards.  2.4.7 National specificities  In practice, a CAB has to take into account the national specificities of the country of  establishment of the QTSP (e.g. certificate suspension is forbidden in several EU countries, the  existence of nationally-defined eIDAS certification schemes, or SB-specific requirements). This  leads to the definition of a mainly common scheme with national variations. An EU-wide  harmonised certification scheme should address this issue and resolve it.  2.4.8 Other aspects  The fact that most of the certification schemes defined by CABs are in whole or in part based on  the same ETSI standards could be seen as hampering the technological neutrality of eIDAS.  QTSPs may favour the lower risk “ETSI path” for implementing their QTS instead of a “creative”  one where the demonstration of conformity to eIDAS would be more complex and the outcome  of the eIDAS audit uncertain.  11 Alternatively, membership could be automatic.  12 Different initiatives have popped up recently like www.acab-c.com or the German working group of (German) recognized  certification bodies (AGAB). Unfortunately, none of these initiatives managed to group a significant number of eIDAS  accredited CABs and so far may not be considered as representative of the eIDAS CABs.  13 Composite certification approach exists in Germany since 2007 for QTSP/QTS (or CSP at that time). It was part of the  German assessment scheme for German eSignature Act (called Module-Confirmation).  14 Composite assessment was covered by the TTP.nl scheme maintained by the iTrust foundation as a scheme operator,  and actively used by all CABs operating in NL at that time.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  22  In the absence of recognition of composite audit, a QTSP is forced (or at least highly  constrained in its choice) to select the same CAB as the one having audited the component  they use, for purely organisational and economic reasons. The risk that another CAB would  challenge the outcome of the audit of the component is avoided, and the CAB may propose  shorter audit time and lower budget because of the existing “partial audit”. (Note: This is  particularly the case if the component is located in another country and its audit would involve  travels and associated costs).  Regarding the recurrence of audits, the carrying out of surveillance audits is typically at the  discretion of the CAB, where the eIDAS Regulation only enforces 2-yearly audit of QTSP/QTSs.  When imposed by the CAB or by a nationally-defined scheme or SB, the surveillance audit is  typically performed on a yearly basis between two full audits. This may also be a topic for  harmonisation.  The treatment of non-conformities is not harmonised and some CABs / SBs considered that  QTS could be listed with pending (minor) non-conformities. This is also mainly due to a wrong  approach in the current version of [ETSI EN 319 403], which should be corrected in the  upcoming updated version, to be published as EN 319 403-1.  2.5 THE VIEWPOINT OF OTHER STAKEHOLDERS  2.5.1 Browser Vendors  Discussions have been initiated between the European Commission and browsers and  applications industry stakeholders for the recognition of eIDAS QTS in their widely deployed  products and services.  Despite the highly visible and notorious integration of EU trusted lists-based validation of eIDAS  qualified electronic signatures and seals in the Adobe Acrobat™ suites15, those discussions  have not led to significant progress in integrating QTS, qualified website authentication  certificates (QWACs) in particular, in the widely deployed browsers. From the viewpoint of  browser vendors (BVs), this is less a question of distrust (even if there are areas for  15 https://acrobat.adobe.com/be/en/sign/capabilities/eidas.html  BROWSER VENDORS  Supporting CAS harmonisation with more   Transparency, consistency, accountability and enforcement mechanisms   Clear aim and scope of audit reports   Monitoring  However mutual recognition is not part of the BVs’ trust framework  They do not envisage surrending their ability to enforce policies or  requirements to CAs and their ability to exlude or distrust any non-  conformant CA.  They plead for unkeyed QWACs attesting link between domanin name and  its owner.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  23  improvements) than a question of not delegating any trust decision regarding their trust  frameworks or programs.  As a general approach, browser vendors claim to operate their own mature trust framework for  entrusting (CA) certificates in their products and applications. In a similar way as EU MS SBs  are acting towards QTSP/QTS, BVs act towards CA (TSP issuing certificates) verifying and  deciding themselves on whether they are meeting   CAs own policies as defined in their applicable CP/CPS,   policies and requirements defined by the CA/Browser Forum, and   additional requirements defined in their CA trust store program.  BVs ultimately own the trust decision for which CAs are included in their trust framework.  As part of this BV-driven verification and decision process, BVs require 3rd party audits to attest  that the CA have complied with the above two first set of policies and requirements. All BVs  recognise and “trust” both the WebTrust and ETSI audit schemes (the latter being commonly  used to support the eIDAS framework as well). It is commonly stated by BVs that both audit  tracks have areas of concern and potential improvement. However, as these audits are “only”  one element amongst others supporting each decision on trusting a CA, trusting the audit  scheme is not an absolute necessity. On top of these audits, BVs are conducting their own  regular (risk) assessments to inform their trust decisions. They also support such decisions by  active and transparent technical (PKI) monitoring.  When comparing the two types of trust frameworks, namely the one(s) established by BVs on  one hand and the eIDAS framework on the other hand, it is important to stress that, contrary to  the eIDAS framework, the BVs do not have and do not aim to implement mutual recognition. In  the BVs’ trust framework, there is no room for accepting trust decisions made by 3rd parties to  lead (automatically) to trust decisions within the BV framework. In case of an Art.14 based  mutual recognition between the EU and a 3rd country, the EU MS will not have to verify whether  new or existing 3rd country trust services meet the eIDAS requirements. Verifications by the 3rd  country, under the terms of the Art.14-based agreement will be automatically trusted by all the  EU MS and the corresponding 3rd country verified trust services will be recognised as  equivalent to QTS in the EU. This does not and is not likely to occur with BVs, who will base  their CA trust decisions on the basis of their own verification of the conformance of each and  every CA with their own requirements, irrespective whether they are otherwise qualified under  eIDAS (or even already trusted by another BV). BVs do not rely on another entity’s trust  decision or delegate trust decision to any entity. They use other entities’ decisions as input to  better informed decisions, such as external audits which are part of BV’s requirements. BVs  may trust differently WebTrust and ETSI certification schemes, as well as auditors performing  them. The overall BV’s own decision process adjusts and corrects these differences, as the  overarching goal is to evaluate all the available information against BV specific trust framework  policies and requirements to ensure their users are secure.  It is worth noting that most of the BVs do not have a contractual relationship with CAs (TSPs).  This means that those BVs have no legal recourse if a CA fails to meet their requirements. The  relationship is based on whether or not the CA’s root certificate is and remains to be included in  BV’s root store, based on the CA’s continued compliance with BV’s requirements. BVs authority  rests in the ability to choose which CAs are members of their program. Taking that away greatly  diminishes BVs’ ability to influence good CA behaviour.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  24  Regarding the ETSI audit track (which is also typically the basis for eIDAS conformity  assessments), BVs identify opportunities for improvement falling into the categories of  consistency, transparency, and enforcement.  The aim and scope of the audit reports must be very clear. Since no standards may be imposed  to QTSPs issuing QWACs for being assessed compliant to eIDAS, being certified against  eIDAS does not mean being certified compliant with any standard, even if used as benchmark  criteria by auditors, unless the scope of certification makes it clear that, in addition to being  eIDAS compliant, the QTSP/QTS are compliant to specific standard(s).  The eIDAS  requirements are intrinsically non-technical but functional and legal; the BVs’ requirements are  essentially technically oriented. When several audit tracks are supported by the same standards  or a single audit is aimed to demonstrate compliance with eIDAS and BV requirements  respectively, the attestation letter and/or conformity assessment certificate must ideally be  separate. At the least such letters/certificates should express clearly, against which framework  the assessed CA is conformant. Furthermore, the attestation report or certification (audit) report  should also ideally be separate or at least include clear and consistent demonstration of the  conformance with each of the targeted frameworks. It is worth noting that BVs refer to the “ETSI  audit track”, a technical track, as being accepted to support their decision of trust in the context  of their trust framework, not the legal technology-neutral “eIDAS audit track” per se.  However, the bigger concern is about the consistency of audit criteria across SBs. An audit  conducted by two different CABs accredited by two different SBs should produce the same  results. BVs strongly support works towards harmonising the accreditation and certification  schemes at the EU level, for CABs assessing (Q)TSP/(Q)TS  Transparency is a characteristic in which BV trust frameworks have invested. The more  transparency the more a BV and other interested parties can be confident that a TSP is  behaving according to the rules, is trusted and that BV users are protected. Certificate  transparency, CA certificate disclosure requirements, publicly available CA data, publicly  available non-conformities and publicly available incident and even CA audit reports are  examples of tools and information required to be available to the public for use to monitor and  improve the health of the CA ecosystem. Under eIDAS, none of this information is required to  be public.  There is also a legitimately perceived lack of transparency in the current de facto adopted  eIDAS accreditation (and certification) scheme in particular with respect to the following: the  scope of the eIDAS certification scheme used by the eIDAS accredited CAB, the effective  targeted criteria, the targeted audience, the corresponding assessments, including the tests  performed of evaluated, their results, and the auditor’s judgement or opinion on whether those  results meet the stated objectives.  The lack of strong enforcement mechanisms in the eIDAS framework is also perceived by the  BVs as an issue. CAs are required to notify their eIDAS accredited CAB whenever a non-  conformity is identified but BVs reported having rarely, if ever, observed CABs and SBs taking  apparent action/sanction against them. This may lead CAs to be comforted in making decisions  favouring their own interests. Similarly, CABs issuing CAR reported to be of insufficient quality  have not been (publicly) observed to be sanctioned by their competent NAB. Individual NABs  are perceived by BVs to apply different level of rigor when overseeing CABs, which they  accredited. On the contrary, WebTrust licensed practitioners are under a centralized  governance model, believed by BVs to be a more consistent level of oversight than the eIDAS  one, where CABs oversight is delegated to separate NABs from each EU MS.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  25  BVs also believe the monitoring regime undertaken by CABs and by SBs is another area for  improvement. Except for the initial and 2-yearly assessment of the risk management approach  implied by eIDAS, the level of active monitoring exercised by CABs and SBs is unclear, not  transparent and potentially inconsistent. On the opposite side, BVs’ trust frameworks are almost  exclusively focused on managing risk and protecting their users, for example by proactive  actions, fast responses following active monitoring, or CA notified security issues (as BVs  require). The lack of transparency regarding active monitoring of QTSP issuing qualified  certificates as a QTS (and of other QTSP/QTS) may lead to the wrong perception by BVs that  the eIDAS trust framework relies exclusively on audits. It is unclear to BVs (and probably not  only to them) how factors such as CA’s (QTSP’s) competence, responsiveness and  transparency when responding to an incident or CA’s (QTSP’s) fame or reputation or, credibility,  or prior incidents are taken into account in the process of granting a qualified status.  In short, implementing mutual recognition is not part of the BVs’ trust framework because they  do not envisage surrendering their ability to enforce policies or requirements to CAs and their  ability to exclude or distrust any non-conformant CA. The relationship between BVs and CAs is  a direct one-to-one relationship-based BV-driven requirements imposed by each BV on each  CA and is likely to remain so.  Better convergence and quicker alignment between the ETSI standards and the CA/Browser  requirements driving all BV trust frameworks may be an additional area of improvement to foster  convergence with the eIDAS framework, when supported by ETSI standards.  Furthermore, from a technical point of view, BV believe using TLS is not the only technical  solution for implementing QWACs in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation. BVs reported that,  in informal discussions with the EC, they suggested alternative technical solutions, other than  using TLS, that could facilitate the recognition of QWACs. These technical solutions are based  on the fact that Annex IV of the eIDAS Regulation does not require QWACs to include any  “private key”. QWACS could be implemented as “simple” signed or sealed attestations that a  legal or natural person is linked to a domain name; such attestations could then be consumed,  verified and/or displayed alongside the TLS connection. The technical feasibility, relevance,  market adoption and standardisation of one or more of those alternative solutions still need to  be progressed.  2.5.2 Adobe  Adobe has not provided any direct input to the context of the study. However, Adobe’s AATL  principles to the recognition of trustworthiness in certificate-based digital IDs and timestamp  services are highlighted and assessed here by the study team for the interesting approach in a  clean separation between a “legal” and “standard” processing of the EU Member States trusted  lists and regarding them as trustworthy. In other words, on the one hand, considering the EU  legal constitutive value of EU MS trusted lists16 to validate qualified electronic signatures or  seals and display the validation results in consequence. On the other hand, trusting those  QTSPs issuing qualified certificates having been listed in the EUMS TL for being recognised as  trustworthy as those CAs and TSPs having actively applied for and accepted in the Adobe  Approved Trust List (AATL) program17.  The AATL is a CA certificate trust store program that onboards certificate authorities (CAs) and  trust service providers (TSPs) that demonstrated compliance with the AATL program  requirements. The applicant CA must pass an audit from one of the audit schemes that are  16 Called “EUTL” by Adobe, to clearly separate them from the “AATL”.  17 https://helpx.adobe.com/be_fr/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html  https://helpx.adobe.com/be_fr/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  26  accepted by Adobe to support the vetting by Adobe that the applicant conforms to AATL  requirements, namely:   A compliance audit against [ETSI EN 319 411-1] NCP, [ETSI EN 319 411-2] QCP-n or  QCP-l, conducted by an auditor that is accredited under the [ISO/IEC 17065]  framework supplemented by [ETSI EN 319 403].   A WebTrustTM for CA v2.0 or later conducted by a WebTrustTM licensed Practitioner for  WebTrustTM audits.   A compliance audit against [ISO 21188] conducted by an auditor that is accredited  against [ISO/IEC 17065] for [ISO 21188] audits.  As an alternative18 to the presentation of a conformity assessment report confirming the  conformity against one or more of the above listed audit schemes specifications, demonstrating  compliance with the AATL requirement can be achieved when the submitted CA “is listed and  granted a CA/QC qualified status in one of the European Member State national Trusted Lists  (EUTL) as a qualified trust service for the issuance of qualified certificates for electronic  signatures or electronic seals and the trusted list indicates directly, or indirectly through the  certificate, that the certificate is stored on a Qualified Signature Creation Device”.  Independently of an active application by a TSP/CA to the AATL program, Adobe digital  signature solutions also work with every QTSP offering qualified trust services listed in the  European Union Trust List (EUTL). Without the need for the corresponding QTSPs to apply for  the AATL program, Adobe solutions validate all EU qualified electronic signatures and qualified  electronic seals by processing the EU Member States trusted lists. The validation results are  displayed in conformance with the eIDAS Regulation requirements for the validation of such  signatures or seals (cf. Art.(32) of the Regulation), identifying if the signature/seal is supported  by a qualified certificate, if the private key resides in a qualified signature/Seal creation device  and hence if the signature is qualified under eIDAS.  In the study team’s opinion, this illustrates in practice an interesting approach in a clean  separation between processing the EU MS TLs and recognising them, or the underlying line of  assessment, as trustworthy for joining the AATL program.  18 Another alternative is for the applicant CA to meet the Medium Hardware Assurance Requirements of the US Federal  Bridge, the SAFE-BioPharma bridge, or the CertiPath commercial bridge, by privilege of having the Supplied Certificate  cross-certified to the bridge.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  27  3. ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE  LEGAL FRAMEWORKS  3.1 INTRODUCTION  The eIDAS Regulation does not specify any particular accreditation scheme or any conformity  assessment (or certification) scheme against which a CAB must be accredited and QTSP/QTSs  be assessed. It limits itself to requiring the CAB to be accredited within the framework of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 [Reg.765, 2008], and specifies the need for the execution of a  conformity assessment scheme that is eIDAS specific - i.e. a scheme which confirms that, for a  specific type of QTSP/QTS, a QTSP/QTS satisfies the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. However, the Regulation does not mandate EA to establish either a complete  accreditation framework or certification schemes for each type of QTSP/QTS.  When looking at potential future actions aiming to establish a more comprehensive framework in  relation to the auditing of QTSP/QTSs and working towards harmonising related EU certification  schemes, three main approaches can be envisaged.  The first approach, within the current scope of the eIDAS Regulation, relates to the adoption of  secondary legislation. Pursuant to Article 20(4) of eIDAS Regulation the European Commission  may, by means of implementing acts, establish a reference number of standards on the  accreditation of CABs, on CARs, and on auditing rules under which CABs will carry out their  conformity assessment of QTSP/QTSs. The EC could by means of implementing Acts, establish  reference number of standards allowing for presumption of compliance of QTSP/QTS with the  applicable requirements of the eIDAS Regulation.  The 2020 revision of the eIDAS Regulation is the second approach that may be used to address  the problem, by explicitly including references to relevant schemes and certification frameworks.  A third promising approach that has recently become viable consists of the adoption of a  certification scheme under the Cybersecurity Act [CyberAct, 2019]. The latter two options could  be combined, by revising the eIDAS Regulation to clarify that the Cybersecurity Act may be  used as an instrument to designate schemes that address the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  The next section explores these three different legal options available at the EU level to support  a more harmonised approach to the certification of QTS/QTS.  3.2 eIDAS SECONDARY LEGISLATION  A proposal towards a more harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS can be  legally formalised through Article 20(4) of the eIDAS Regulation, which gives to the European  Commission the competence, by means of implementing acts, to “establish reference number of  the following standards:  (a) accreditation of the conformity assessment bodies and for the conformity assessment  report referred to in paragraph 1;  (b) auditing rules under which conformity assessment bodies will carry out their conformity  assessment of the qualified trust service providers as referred to in paragraph 1”.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  28  While the eIDAS Regulation thus permits the Commission to reference a scheme through an  implementing Act, this path has not been used so far. The currently available candidate  standards are [ETSI EN 319 403] and [ETSI TS 119 403-3], the latter building upon the first. It is  worth noting the current version of [ETSI EN 319 403] suffers from some substantive issues19  and is currently under revision. Those standards, after completing the revisions, would likely be  good candidates for referencing under point (a) of Art.20(4).  However, none of those standards fully addresses the list of criteria, controls and control  objectives an accredited CAB would use to conduct an assessment of the conformity of a  QTSP/QTS with the eIDAS Regulation (cf. point (b) of Art.20(4)). So far, (European)  standardisation bodies have developed no standard addressing such a list, which would allow  CABs to assess the conformance of QTSP/QTS against the applicable eIDAS requirements,  irrespective of the conformance of those QTSP/QTS with best practice technical standards.  CEN/CENELEC and ETSI have however developed standards for such best practices, for each  type of QTSP/QTS, with annexed tables mapping the requirements of the Regulation to the  relevant clauses of the standards. However:   No formal assessment of their suitability has been completed, particularly with the  perspective of being referenced in an eIDAS implementing act.   These are standards that QTSPs remain free to abide by or not; the standards are binding  on the activities of CABs, not of the QTSPs.  The current wording of Art.20(4) (i.e. “establish reference number of […] standards”) does not  allow the EC to profile the standards in order to amend standardised specifications in any way.  In other words, the provision does not allow the EC to define itself the relevant specifications of  an eIDAS QTSP/QTS conformity assessment (certification) scheme. At most, some of the  requirements defined in a standard may be excluded from the reference in an implementing Act.  So, when failures of candidate standards are identified during their eligibility assessments for  being referenced by eIDAS implementing acts, those failures cannot be rectified through  legislation. Rather, the problems would need to be notified to the competent standardisation  organisations with a view of updating the standards accordingly and republishing them, and  then referencing them as the legislation requires.  As a result, the adoption of an implementing Act pursuant to Article 20(4) would not, in the  absence of standard(s) fully specifying a CAS, preferably created for each of the QTSP/QTS  types, be an option to fully harmonise the auditing of eIDAS QTSP/QTS. However, referring to  ETSI TS 119 403-3 (with revisions) in an implementing Act adopted pursuant to Article 20(4)  would be a constructive step towards such harmonisation.  The EC could, by means of implementing Acts20, establish reference numbers of standards  allowing for presumption of compliance of QTSP/QTS with the applicable requirements of the  eIDAS Regulation. This would contribute to reducing the diversity in the existing certification  schemes, which have been defined by each individual CAB, by providing common roots for  such schemes. However, the implementing Acts as foreseen by the eIDAS Regulation do not  allow full coverage of the requirements applicable to QTSP/QTS for such presumption of  19 When the decision to certify a QTSP/QTS is the confirmation that the assessed QTSP/QTS meet the applicable  requirements of the eIDAS Regulation (i.e. the normative document, identified as the “product (read service) requirements”  in ISO/IEC 17065), it shall not be possible to take such decision with pending non-conformities to these requirements, i.e.  when the assessed QTSP/QTS actually fail to meet all the normative (eIDAS) requirements.  When a certification has been issued to a conformant QTSP/QTS (i.e. confirming that the assessed QTSP/QTS meets the  requirements of eIDAS), and that a non-conformity with eIDAS requirements is substantiated, either as a result of  surveillance or otherwise, it shall not be considered “an appropriate action” to maintain valid the certification (confirmation)  that the certified QTSP/QTS is conformant, while there is still any unresolved non-conformity to the normative (eIDAS)  requirements (i.e. when the assessed QTSP/QTS actually fail to meet all the eIDAS requirements).  20 Namely, pursuant to Art.24(5), Art.27(4), Art.28(6), Art.32(3), Art.33(2), Art.34(2), Art.37(4), Art.38(6), Art.40, Art.42(2),  Art.44(2), and Art.45(2).  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  29  compliance. This may moreover be a politically complex path. Despite prior initiatives from  some EU MS, discussions on adopting such implementing Acts have not been initiated thus far.  The 2020 revision of the eIDAS Regulation is an opportunity that could be used to take account  of the drawbacks of this first approach. For example, the EA, or another body, could be  mandated to establish a complete accreditation framework and certification schemes for each  type of QTSP/QTS, and to extend the coverage of other implementing Acts to all QTSP/QTS  requirements as described above.  That revision may also be used to facilitate a third promising approach that has recently become  viable to formalise an accreditation framework. This would consist in the adoption of a  certification scheme under the Cybersecurity Act [CyberAct, 2019].  Figure 4: eIDAS secondary legislation as legal instrument toward harmonised CAS  Implementing acts (IAs) pursuant to eIDAS  Negative   Not possible to achieve CAS harmonisation due to dependence  on the existence and completeness of standards:  o No existing standard on CAS  o No mandate to EC to amend existing standards  o No mandate to EC to define its own specifications   Unclear legal effect to referencing standard under Art.20(4)   Potentially politically complex path.  Positive   Art.20.4 IA would allow to legally support EA recommended  accreditation scheme based on EN 39 403 and extend it to CAS  specifications (ST 119 403-3)   Various other provisions permit adoption of IAs for each type of  QTSP/QTS   Reducing diversity in CABs’ assessment schemes  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  30  3.3 THE CYBERSECURITY ACT  A key challenge – apart from agreeing on the definition of the requirements for a harmonised  conformity assessment scheme for QTSs – is its formalisation as an official scheme with legal  recognition across the EU. While the eIDAS Regulation could permit it to do so by referencing a  scheme through an implementing act, this path has not been used so far. The Cybersecurity Act  [CyberAct, 2019], which entered into effect on 27 June 2019, provides an alternative avenue.  The Cybersecurity Act, providing for a stronger and permanent legal mandate for ENISA,  introduces a framework for the adoption of European cybersecurity certification schemes. The  Cybersecurity Act allows the European Commission (or exceptionally the European  Cybersecurity Certification Group established under the Act) to request ENISA to prepare a  candidate certification scheme, which would apply to ICT products, services and processes.  The definition of these concepts is broad: notably, an ‘ICT process’ is defined as “a set of  activities performed to design, develop, deliver or maintain an ICT product or ICT service”. This  could plausibly apply to a QTSP/QTS conformity assessment scheme, so that a harmonised  scheme would be eligible for formalisation under the Cybersecurity Act.  The process of adoption involves several entities. If a request to ENISA to prepare a candidate  scheme is issued, article 49 of the Act requires ENISA to consult relevant stakeholders through  a formal, open, transparent and inclusive consultation process. In addition, ENISA must  establish an ad hoc working group to finalise a candidate scheme; the results of the present  report could act as a basis for this work. After consultation with the aforementioned European  Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG), which is composed of representatives of national  cybersecurity certification authorities or representatives of other relevant national authorities,  ENISA can submit its finalised candidate scheme to the European Commission, who may adopt  it via an implementing Act under the Cybersecurity Act.  Once adopted, ENISA will publish the information on the certification scheme via ENISA’s  website. Furthermore, article 56 of the Act stipulates that any ICT products, ICT services and  ICT processes that have been certified under an adopted scheme shall be presumed to comply  with the requirements of such a scheme – which in the present case would relate to the security  requirements for QTSPs/QTSs, mainly as dictated by the eIDAS Regulation.  The legal presumption of compliance, created by cybersecurity certification, with the targeted  security requirements would nevertheless be subordinated to verification by the competent SB  that the certified QTSP/QTS meets the eIDAS requirements, and to the SB’s decision to grant a  qualified status (or not) to the certified QTSP/QTS. In other words, certification is an element  attesting to compliance with explicitly defined security requirements, but it does not  automatically result in a qualified status being granted under the eIDAS Regulation.  Under the Cybersecurity Act, cybersecurity certification against a specific scheme approved  under the Act is voluntary, since compliance with the certification scheme is not currently made  mandatory by any existing legislation. Although this can of course change, depending on future  developments of the eIDAS Regulation. QTSPs would therefore retain the possibility of  demonstrating compliance with the law using any other method until legislation is introduced  that changes this picture.  Crucially though, article 57 of the Act addresses the impact of adoption of schemes on any  national cybersecurity certification schemes, stating that these “shall cease to produce effects  from the date established in the implementing act”, and that Member States are barred from  adopting new national cybersecurity certification schemes with a scope covered by an EU level  certification scheme. In other words, Member States would not be able to lend any legal value  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  31  to any national schemes that they may have defined in the application of the eIDAS Regulation.  The notion of a “national cybersecurity certification scheme” is defined as “a comprehensive set  of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures developed and adopted by a  national public authority and that apply to the certification or conformity assessment of ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes falling under the scope of the specific scheme” – i.e.  it covers only requirements emanating from a public authority. Article 57 of the Cybersecurity  Act thus has no impact on purely private sector schemes, or on schemes, which have not been  formally adopted but are simply influential in practice.  The Act allows schemes to rely both on self-assessments and on formal certification. Support  for self-assessments in a scheme is however not mandatory under the Act, and given current  practices for QTSP/QTS, self-assessment does not seem to be in line with market expectations,  or with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. A candidate scheme under the Act targeting  conformity assessment for QTSPs/QTSs in all likelihood would therefore rely solely on  certification. The process of certification must be elaborated in the scheme itself, but can be  drafted to function in largely the same way as is done currently under the eIDAS Regulation.  The Act permits a scheme to contain several levels of assurance, ranging from ‘basic’ to  ‘substantial’ and ‘high’, linked to the level of the risk associated with the intended use of the  product, service or process, in terms of the probability and impact of an incident. Assuming that  certification of QTSPs/QTSs would require a high level of assurance, Article 56.6 of the Act  requires certificates to be issued by national cybersecurity certification authorities, which must  be designated by the Members States. However, the national cybersecurity certification  authorities may delegate this task to their CABs who are accredited by NABs under Regulation  (EC) No 765/2008 to issue the required certificates. Therefore, the certification process would  be highly comparable to current practice under the eIDAS Regulation.  As noted above, if QTSPs/QTSs are indeed expected to be certified under assurance level  ‘high’ – which seems plausible – then Member States have the option of allowing certificates to  be issued by their national cybersecurity certification authorities, who may not be accredited as  CABs under Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. This would not be in line with the requirements of  the eIDAS Regulation, which defines a CAB as “a body defined in point 13 of Article 2 of  Regulation (EC) No 765/2008, which is accredited in accordance with that Regulation as  competent to carry out conformity assessment of a qualified trust service provider and the  qualified trust services it provides”. In other words, while Member States would have the option  under the Cybersecurity Act to allow certificates to be issued by a national cybersecurity  certification authority who is not itself a CAB, this would not be able to satisfy the requirements  of the eIDAS Regulation. Therefore, the scheme should make it clear that any certificate issued  under an adopted scheme must be issued by a CAB.  As a relevant nuance, it might be argued that the Cybersecurity Act focuses on cybersecurity,  i.e. the activities necessary to protect network and information systems, the users of such  systems, and other persons affected by cyber threats (as defined in the Act); and not on legal  compliance in general. Since CABs under article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation must confirm that  the QTSPs and QTSs fulfil the requirements of the Regulation in general (and not only in  relation to cybersecurity)21, a scheme under the Cybersecurity Act risks not comprehensively  covering the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation if it only focuses on the security elements.  The Act nevertheless stresses the need to adopt a broad and general notion of cybersecurity for  the purpose of certification. While it imposes minimal contents for a scheme (notably mandatory  21 In addition to security requirements specified in its Art.19, the eIDAS Regulation also comprises requirements on the  scope and functionality of QTS, for QTSP operational continuity, staffing, liability, contractual transparency towards  customers, and other QTS related elements, which have only an indirect link to cybersecurity.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  32  security objectives and minimal elements to be included), the Act does not forbid explicitly the  inclusion of other (non-security related) requirements. Therefore, it could be argued that the  inclusion of non-security related elements in a scheme could be justified in case of qualified  trust services, given that the objective of the eIDAS Regulation is to ensure that such services  meet a high threshold of security and trustworthiness.  This would in practice imply that all requirements of the eIDAS Regulation could be integrated in  a scheme. As such, an adopted security scheme under the Cybersecurity Act to streamline  conformity assessment for QTSPs/QTSs would be very beneficial to reduce market  fragmentation in relation to information security. It would then be recommended that this broad  position would also be taken by the Commission when requesting schemes, or by ENISA (or its  expert groups) when preparing a candidate scheme for harmonising QTSP/QTS certification of  conformance with the requirements.  Figure 5: Cybersecurity Act as legal instrument toward harmonised CAS  3.4 eIDAS revision or amendment  Conceptually, an alternative process could also be to take the opportunity of the currently  ongoing revision of the eIDAS Regulation to address specifically the establishment process, the  specifications and maintenance of eIDAS QTSP/QTSs certification scheme(s).  Under this option, article 20 of the eIDAS Regulation could be rewritten in a manner that makes  it clear that the scheme creation process envisaged under the Cybersecurity Act should not be  limited to information security aspects but could also be used to establish comprehensive  QTSPs/QTSs certification scheme(s). It could clarify that the contents of such schemes should  consider the entirety of the eIDAS Regulation requirements as being relevant to supporting the  security of QTSPs/QTSs. In that way, it would be unambiguously clear that, in the context of the  eIDAS Regulation, the Act is a suitable and viable avenue for establishing the required  schemes. It is worth noting that, from a legal point of view, whether this would be at all possible  would depend on the scope of the Cybersecurity Act. Indeed, the eIDAS Regulation cannot  amend this Act.  Alternatively, if the Cybersecurity Act would not be considered a valid option, the 2020 revision  of the eIDAS Regulation may be used to compensate the drawbacks of the first approach, by  mandating EA. A standardisation body, or another body entitled to play the role of scheme  owner, to establish a complete accreditation framework and certification schemes for each type  of QTSP/QTS. It may also present the opportunity to extend the coverage of other implementing  acts to all QTSP/QTS requirements.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  33  4. GAP ANALYSIS – TOWARD A  HARMONISED SCHEME  4.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES  4.1.1 eIDAS Regulation driven  A CAR needs to demonstrate the fulfilment of each applicable eIDAS requirement. Therefore,  an EU-wide harmonised conformity assessment scheme would start from the eIDAS  requirements for QTSP/QTS, with a common part for all types of QTS together with specificities  for each, then detailing controls and control objectives about them.  4.1.2 In-depth list of controls and control objectives  Because the eIDAS requirements are legal high-level requirements, the scheme shall identify as  detailed as possible technical/operational criteria and criteria objectives concerning each of  these applicable eIDAS requirements that can serve as a basis for audits. Information and  guidance for this identification may be taken from:   ETSI / CEN standards relevant to support the implementation of the eIDAS Regulation.   ENISA guidelines, in particular guidelines mapping the above standards to the eIDAS  requirements and identifying remaining gaps.   Nationally-defined schemes (e.g. from Slovakia, Czech Republic, or France) and  private sector schemes (e.g. UK tScheme). It should be noted that these schemes  have shown to be conflicting in some aspects, and the definition of an EU-wide  scheme should take these issues into consideration.   Being supplemented for identified gaps by more “generic” standards such as ISO/IEC  27001, ISO/IEC 27701 or other legal frameworks such as GDPR for data protection.  4.1.3 Technological neutrality – QTSP freedom of implementation  The outcome of the definition of criteria and criteria objectives described above could lead to  checklists aiming to support efficiently the CAB in assessing the conformity of a QTSP/QTS  against the eIDAS Regulation. Setting up these checklists will be a challenge, as they will have  to meet conflicting objectives:   Being specific and detailed enough to enable a clear and precise assessment of the  conformity of a QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation, and its demonstration.   Being generic enough to be technology-neutral, as eIDAS aims to be. It is worth noting  that the above-mentioned standards were drafted first as standardized requirements  for specific PKI-based implementations of QTSP/QTS, providing less guidance or no  guidance at all for the audit of “alternative” or “creative” implementations of the eIDAS  requirements. The same applies to the above-mentioned ENISA guidelines and  nationally-defined or private schemes, that all rely, with some variances, on those  standards. These standards should remain “one possible path” of implementing the  eIDAS requirements.  For ease of use, one checklist would be identified for each QTS, and potentially for each  relevant “component” service.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  34  4.1.4 Specific Member State requirements  Because some requirements are left open22 by the eIDAS Regulation and specific to each  country (e.g. suspension of certificates, video onboarding), the resulting checklists should take  into account these specificities depending on which country of Europe the QTSP is established  in, and allow the possibility to refer to “conditional controls” for each.  It is worth noting that it is key to limit national specificities to aspects explicitly identified by the  eIDAS Regulation as nationally specific, in order to limit the possibilities of divergence.  4.1.5 Scheme owner & maintenance  Once established, this EU-wide eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification scheme shall be maintained  appropriately to ensure it remains fit for purpose in the long run.  A continuous improvement process shall be defined for such scheme, and shall include the  definition of a scheme management authority (i.e. scheme owner), an EU-wide representative  working group and a review process.  4.2 MULTIPURPOSE AUDITS  The process towards the definition of harmonised QTSP/QTS certification schemes should take  into consideration that some QTSPs might operate in an international environment and in this  regard, they may need to be audited for other purposes than eIDAS compliance. The usual  example cited by stakeholders relates to the CA/Browser Forum23 requirements. However,  another case for multipurpose audits deals with the potential certification of information security  management systems (ISMS) and privacy information management systems (PIMS) used by  QTSP to provide QTS. QTSPs may benefit from prior audit focussing on these aspects (e.g.  against ISO/IEC 27001 and/or ISO/IEC 27701) or be keen to obtain related certifications. It  must be stressed however that to be relevant to eIDAS, the respective statements of  applicability (scope) of these ISMS and PIMS must address the provision of QTS by QTSP. In  this context, it would be key to make sure the EA recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme  would allow eIDAS accredited CABs to conduct those side audits and certifications.  An acceptable certification scheme should support multi-purpose audits wherever possible to  avoid QTSPs undergo multiple audits. To that extent, it should be noted that such multi-purpose  audits shall need to result in as many different CARs / audit reports and certification decisions  as there would be “Normative Documents” against which the conformity of QTSP/QTS should  be confirmed.  It is of paramount importance to consider that CARs in the context of Articles 21.1, 20.1 and  20.2 of the eIDAS Regulation shall confirm the conformity of QTSP/QTSs to the requirements of  the eIDAS Regulation and not to any standard. Yet, in practice, standards may be of great help  for TSPs to ensure best practices, and of great help for CABs in their activities of assessing  these TSPs claiming compliance to the standard or the normative document, in particular when  the CAB they select is building its eIDAS certification scheme upon identified standards.  22 These requirements are not “open” in the sense that they are voluntary. But in order to achieve a certain objective,  Member States enjoy the freedom to choose different means. The use of video for onboarding when issuing qualified  certificates for instance (cf. point (d) of Art.24(1)), if confirmed by an eIDAS accredited CAB as being equivalent in terms of  reliability to physical presence of the person to whom the certificate is issued.  23 https://cabforum.org/  https://cabforum.org/  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  35  4.3 COMPOSITE AUDITS IN THE CONTEXT OF eIDAS REGULATION  As has been explained in the feedback from CABs and SBs, composite audit is a key concept to  take into account in the definition of harmonised eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification scheme(s).  When appropriately applied, it may save significant effort (by QTSPs and by CABs) and,  simultaneously, retain the assurance level of conformity assessment. It is key to design the  composite certification approach in a way which ensures no decrease in the assurance level of  the assessment result and no distortion of the competition between CABs.  4.4 INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS  In addition to the international aspect resulting from the need for QTSP/QTS to meet other  (international) compliance schemes, the international promotion and recognition of the eIDAS  auditing model (accreditation of CABs under eIDAS and QTSP/QTS certification scheme(s)  used by eIDAS accredited CABs) are key elements for:   Facilitating international mutual recognition foreseen in Article 14 of the eIDAS Regulation.   Expanding eIDAS accredited CABs’ market from EU to international.  The IAF MLA driven accreditation scheme based on ISO/IEC 17065 (ideally to be  supplemented by ETSI EN 319 403-1) is a very natural and interesting candidate for 3rd  countries to base their national QTSP/QTS certification scheme on, particularly for QTS other  than issuing qualified certificates. Promoting ETSI EN 319 403-1 at ISO level would also be an  alternative to envisage.  4.5 ISO/IEC 17067  With [ISO/IEC 17065] being the cornerstone for the EA recommended scheme, a good policy  choice would be to develop EU-wide harmonised eIDAS certification schemes based on the  recommendations of [ISO/IEC 17067].  4.6 LEGAL INSTRUMENTS  It is unclear at this stage which legal instrument(s) would actually be selected to reference or  establish future EU harmonised eIDAS certification scheme(s) for QTSPs/QTSs. As argued  above, the Cybersecurity Act could be an appropriate avenue, if its provisions are given a broad  interpretation so that all requirements of the eIDAS Regulation could be covered as being  relevant to security (rather than only those that are explicitly and exclusively targeting security  requirements in the strictest sense).  Whatever option is chosen, it would be key that the design process of such schemes would be  conducted in such a way to federate, consult and involve as many relevant types of  stakeholders (or representatives) through a formal, open, transparent and inclusive consultation  process.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  36  5. RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1 OVERVIEW  Based on the stakeholders’ collected input, on the current eIDAS regime and the analysis of the  present report, action should be taken as proposed hereafter. The goal is to meet stakeholders’  concerns and legitimate needs to move towards a more harmonised approach with regards to  the assessment by CABs of the conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation.  5.2 ACTIONS REGARDING LEGAL INSTRUMENTS TOWARDS AN EU  HARMONISED eIDAS CAS  Note: The entity responsible for taking LEG-x recommendations forward is the European  Commission (either autonomously under the eIDAS Regulation, or by granting a mandate to  ENISA and then formalising the outcome under the Cybersecurity Act).  LEG-1. The track offered by the Cybersecurity Act is suggested to be the favoured option  concerning the creation of a harmonised certification scheme for each of the (nine)  types of QTSP/QTS specified in the eIDAS Regulation.  Additional certification schemes could also be created to cover the need to  assess/audit QTSP service components or processes in the context of Annex II.3 & 4  and in the context of implementation of Art.24.1(d) of the eIDAS Regulation.  As this might be a lengthy process, the currently available mechanism of adopting implementing  Acts under the eIDAS Regulation could be used to:  LEG-2. Reference the ETSI TS 119 403-3 standard pursuant to Art.20.4 of the Regulation to  address both points (a) and (b) of Art.20.4. The eligibility of that standard for such a  referencing should be formally assessed. It is currently conditioned to the  replacement of its normative reference towards EN 319 403 by a normative reference  to EN 319 403-1 where this standard updates of the current version of EN 319 403 to  prevent CABs to issue (or maintain valid) certificates of conformity with non-  conformities to the eIDAS Regulation.  This adoption would not fulfil the need for a harmonised CAS but at least would  formalise the recognition of the current recommended EA eIDAS accreditation  scheme. It would also clarify the requirement for CABs accredited under this scheme  to have a suitable and appropriate CAS leading to the production of a CAR fulfilling a  minimum set of requirements largely demanded by EU MS SBs.  LEG-3. Reference formally assessed appropriate standards regarding (Q)TSP and the QTS  they provide, in particular pursuant to Art.19.4, Art.24.5, Art.28.6, Art.32.2, Art.33.2,  Art.34.2, Art.38.6, Art.40, Art.42.2, Art.44.2, and Art.45.2.  It is a fact that such referencing may not confer to these standards a presumption of  compliance to the entire set of the eIDAS requirements applicable to each type of  QTSP/QTS. However, this may lower significantly the level of uncertainty on the side  of QTSPs, and remove barriers to QTS market development and adoption.  In the absence of harmonised CAS(s), such adoptions may also facilitate the work of  the CABs and contribute to increasing the number of CABs accredited to assess  more types of QTS.  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  37  Adopting such implementing Acts has however revealed to be a quite lengthy and  uncertain process as so far, none of the above-mentioned Acts has been adopted  despite numerous attempts from EU MSs to have such adoption process started. It is  also subject to the eligibility of the current standards to be referenced and to the  impossibility to amend those standards by means of the implementing Act when parts  would need to be changed. The current shape of the Regulation does not give the  mandate to the Commission to do so or to create the specifications itself. So, when  failures of candidate standards are identified during the eligibility assessments, those  would need to be notified to the competent standardisation organisations for updating  the standards accordingly and republishing them.  LEG-4. In the context of Art.49 review of the application of the eIDAS Regulation, and as the  deadline for the related review report is approaching (01.07.2020), for potential  proposals for improvement, it is advisable to consider modifying the scope or the  specific provisions of the Regulation:  a. If the Cybersecurity Act track is an option, rewrite Article 20 of the eIDAS  Regulation, e.g. in a manner that makes it clear that the scheme creation  process envisaged under the Cybersecurity Act should not be limited to  information security aspects but could also be used to establish QTSP/QTS  certification scheme(s). It could clarify that the contents of such schemes  should consider the entirety of the eIDAS Regulation requirements as being  relevant to supporting the security of QTSP/QTS. In that way, it would be  more unambiguously clear that the Act is a suitable and viable path for  establishing the required schemes.  b. In the absence of such an option:  i. Consider clarifying the mandatory aspect of standards referenced under  Art.20.4 of the eIDAS Regulation.  ii. Require the adoption of an implementing Act specifying a harmonised  CAS for each of the types of QTSP/QTS specified by the Regulation,  covering the confirmation that certified QTSP/QTSs meet all applicable  requirements of the Regulation. CAS should be added for  assessing/auditing QTSP processes in the context of Annex II.3 & 4 and  in the context of implementation of Art.24.1(d).  iii. Extend current implementing Act coverage to all applicable requirements  of the Regulation for each of the types of QTSP/QTS specified in the  Regulation.  Figure 7: Flow of legal actions toward EU Harmonised eIDAS CAS(s)  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  38  5.3 ACTIONS REGARDING THE DESIGN OF EU HARMONISED QTSP/QTS  CAS  Note: The entity responsible for taking all of the CAS-x recommendations forward is/are the  body(ies) that will be assigned the task to develop EU harmonised CAS within the selected legal  approach.  Irrespective of the chosen legal instrument, EU harmonised CASs should be established for  each of the (nine) types of QTSP/QTS and for assessing/auditing QTSP component service or  processes in the context of Annex II.3 & 4 and of Art.24.1(d). These CASs should be designed  in accordance with the following recommendations:  CAS-1. Include the harmonised CAS(s) in an accreditation framework based on ISO/IEC  17065, supplemented by EN 319 403-1 and by TS 119 403-3;  CAS-2. Design the harmonised CAS(s) in accordance with ISO/IEC 17067;  CAS-3. Design the harmonised CAS(s) to be suitable and efficient in confirming that the  assessed QTSP/QTS is meeting the applicable requirements of the eIDAS  Regulation. For example, specifying sufficient concrete requirements, criteria,  criteria objectives, checks and tests, to be used by the CAB to conduct the  assessment of QTSP/QTS against the eIDAS Regulation;  CAS-4. Structure the assessment and assessment reporting in accordance with the list of  requirements (following the numbering of the articles) of the Regulation while  mapping them with the list of criteria and criteria objectives, the checks, tests and  evaluations the CAB shall conduct to demonstrate the assessed QTSP/QTS meet  the corresponding requirements;  CAS-5. Identify as detailed as possible technical/operational criteria and criteria objectives  about each of these applicable eIDAS requirements that can serve as a basis for  audits. Information and guidance for this identification may be taken from relevant  ESO standards, ENISA guidelines, nationally defined and/or private sector  schemes;  CAS-6. Leverage on the existing relevant standards whose technical compliance is aimed  to facilitate the demonstration of QTSP/QTS compliance with the eIDAS Regulation  requirements (e.g. CEN/CENELEC & ETSI EN/TS x19 xxx standards, ISO/IEC  27001, ISO/IEC 27701);  CAS-7. Leverage on the existing conformance testing facilities provided by ESOs and/or,  by the EC (e.g. CEF building blocks reference implementations or testing facilities),  that are suitable to support the conformance of implementation of QTSP/QTS with  the eIDAS Regulation requirements;  CAS-8. Design the harmonised CAS(s) in a way not hindering the technology neutral  approach of the eIDAS Regulation and leaving QTSP free to select the technical  standards of their choice. Allow for alternative controls/measures exhibiting  equivalent assurance and security;  CAS-9. Provide guidance (or requirements) on the minimum audit time and effort for  completion of full assessments and surveillance assessments. This guidance (or  the requirements) would aim to ensure a sufficient level of quality and bring  credibility to the assessment outcome. Factors include the audit time for completion  of full assessment, the level of expert-knowledge of the auditor/audit team, efficient  audit procedures and used tools for automation of audits;  CAS-10. Allow the harmonised CAS to be combined with other-purpose assessments (e.g.  ISMS, PIMS, CA/Browser Forum) and ensure that for multi-purpose certification  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  39  schemes, it is requested to make use of as many distinct declarations (attestations)  of conformity as there are identified purposes;  CAS-11. Allow for the inclusion of requirements defined at national level, when and only  when such national specificities are foreseen or allowed by the eIDAS Regulation.  For example, suspension rules for qualified certificates for electronic signatures  and/or for electronic seals, and identification of persons in the context of Article  24.1(d) of the Regulation.  CAS-12. Allow for composite certification, and handling of composite audits, where  components (and/or processes) of a QTS are audited separately by different CABs,  in a way that  a. Service component certification schemes are designed separately or clearly  identified in the corresponding QTS certification scheme allowing distinct QTS  components to be assessed independently with the aim of an appropriate  aggregation to support the assessment of the overall QTS, without having to  repeat a full assessment of all components again.  b. CABs can take into considerations earlier audit reports/certification decisions  when performing the assessment of a QTSP/QTS.  c. Rules for accepting existing and underlying certification are clearly  established24.  d. The certification of “Remote QSCD operation and management”, of “(Q)TS  factory services”, of “registration authorities” and in particular the certification  of \"remote identification procedures\" foreseen in Art.24.1(d) of eIDAS are  amongst the first composite certification schemes needed.  CAS-13. Consider harmonising surveillance activities and their periodicity.  5.4 CAS OWNER(S)  Once established, the EU-wide eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification schemes should be maintained  appropriately (including in a transparent, consistent, and agile way) to ensure they remain fit for  purpose in the long run.  A continuous improvement process shall be defined for such scheme. This implies the  designation of a scheme management authority (i.e. scheme owner), of an EU-wide  representative working group and the design of a review process. The working group should  include relevant stakeholders, including NABs (potentially represented by EA), EA, EU MS  representatives (e.g. members of the eIDAS experts group), EU MS SBs, FESA, each and  every eIDAS accredited CAB and candidate CABs, independent experts and/or academics,  ESOs, QTSPs and ENISA. In particular, rules must be defined for:   Maintaining the scheme(s)   Providing documented guidance on how to apply it(them)   Dealing with new situations encountered by CABs and/or SBs and consequently  providing/updating guidance on how to apply the scheme in consequence.  5.5 “QUICK WINS”  Note: The responsible entity for taking each QW-x recommendation forward is the individual  entity mentioned in each of the respective sections (ETSI, EA or CABs).  The following quick wins should be implemented as of now:  QW-1. ETSI to be advised  a. to provide the appropriate corrections to ETSI EN 319 403 when updating it  under EN 319 403-1 (see section 3.3)  24 See section 2.3.4  Recommendations for technical implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  DECEMBER 2019  40  b. to update TS 119 403-3 to normatively refer to EN 319 403-1 instead of  referring to EN 319 403.  QW-2. EA to be advised  a. to update its recommended eIDAS accreditation scheme to ISO/IEC 17065,  supplemented by ETSI EN 319 403-1 and by ETSI TS 119 403-3 in an  updated version to refer to EN 319 403-1.  b. to clarify towards its members (i.e. the NABs):  i. the wording to be used in order to indicate the scope of the  accreditation of CABs in the context of eIDAS. Clear guidance  should be provided for each of the nine types of QTS specified by  the eIDAS Regulation.  ii. the need to include in the eIDAS accreditation attestation or  certificate issued to a CAB, the location where the corresponding  accredited conformity assessment scheme (or certification scheme)  is available for each type of QTS the CAB is accredited for  conducting audits against the eIDAS Regulation.  iii. the need to ensure the provision of historical information regarding  the grant of the accreditation on a per QTSP/QST type basis.  iv. the need to provide an indication, when the EA recommended eIDAS  accreditation scheme is not used or not entirely used, that the  alternative scheme used has been determined equivalent and under  which basis.  c. To promote the eIDAS recommended accreditation scheme to the IAF level  (see section 4.4).  QW-3. Currently accredited eIDAS CABs to be advised  a. to request extending the scope of their eIDAS accreditation to ETSI TS 119  403-3, as they may already do so towards their competent NAB.  b. not issuing eIDAS QTSP/QTS certification of conformity with the eIDAS  Regulation as long as there exist non-conformities to this Regulation25.  c. for multi-purpose certification schemes, to make use of as many distinct  declarations (attestations) of conformity as there are identified purposes.  QW-4. All eIDAS accredited CABs to be advised to create a CAB cooperation working  group gathering each and every eIDAS accredited CAB, as well as candidates,  on a free of charge and automatic (or voluntary) basis, all having equal voice and  vote. This group would aim to facilitate harmonization of the application of eIDAS  QTSP/QTS conformity assessment schemes, approaches and criteria.  It would  be key as well for this group to cooperate tightly with SBs (e.g. FESA, EU MS  eIDAS expert group members), ENISA and the European Standardisation  Organisations.  25 This would actually be illegal under the eIDAS Regulation.

    "abstract": "The present report aims to propose ways in which the eIDAS assessment regime can be strengthened based on the current regime of the eIDAS Regulation, the stakeholders’ concerns and the legitimate need to move towards a more harmonised approach with regards to the assessment by CABs of the conformity of QTSP/QTSs with the requirements of that Regulation. It focuses in particular on actions towards a harmonised conformity assessment scheme for QTSP/QTS."

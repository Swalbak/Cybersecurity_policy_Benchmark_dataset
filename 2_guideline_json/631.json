It is clear however, that the EU will not be able to achieve ‘digital growth’ in the absence  of an approach to cybersecurity that engenders trust in the wider community. It is therefore logical that  the roles and responsibilities of ENISA have been evolving to support this move towards a more digital  society. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that Network and information security (NIS) plays a  central role in the activities of designing, developing and maintaining information systems, networks and  services.  The rate at which the area of NIS is currently growing presents a major challenge to the Agency, which  seeks to optimise its performance by prioritising those areas where it can make the biggest impact. ENISA  sets these priorities through its annual programme, which is developed in close cooperation with the  ENISA Management Board (MB) and the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG). This document is the result  of several rounds of consultations carried out since September 2015 and during 2016.  The operating model of the Agency is based on the delivery of three main types of services to and in  collaboration with the NIS community.   Recommendations mainly in the form of reports addressed to its stakeholders.   Support for policy development and implementation.   ‘Hands on’ work involving and developing operational communities.  Through these activities, which have been formalised in terms of a number of strategic objectives, ENISA  supports the EU and the Member States in enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness  to prevent, detect and respond to network and information security issues and incidents.  Document Structure  In this Programming Document the planned activities for 2017 to 2019 are presented alongside the  detailed planning for 2017. The document follows the structure laid down by the new EC guidelines for  programming documents provided in the context of Framework Financial Regulation.  The budget and resources allocations within the summary tables and Annexes are in line with the COM  Multiannual Financial Framework (MAFF) 2014-2020.

http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/2009-12-19  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  11  Mission Statement  ENISA is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe. ENISA supports the EU and the Member States  in enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to  network and information security problems and incidents. This is reflected in ENISA’s mission statement:  Securing Europe’s information society  In terms of the vision statement, by 2020 ENISA should:   be ‘the hub’ for exchange of information on cybersecurity between the EU public sector and Member  States;   have developed its operational model, based on recommendations, policy support and ‘hands on’  work so as to provide seamless support to its stakeholders in all areas covered by the mandate;   have an established presence in all key industry sectors and be a recognised name among security  professionals;   be able to demonstrate a positive contribution to EU economic growth through its initiatives.  Adding Value through Complementarity  ENISA is a ‘Centre of Expertise’ in Network and Information Security and, as such, supports all phases of  the security lifecycle including policy definition, policy implementation and maintenance and improvement  of live operational solutions.  The Agency is complementary to other EU institutions in that it concentrates on identifying and  disseminating pragmatic solutions to current problems in live operational environments. This enables EU  industry to learn from each other and to implement strong security solutions at optimal cost, thereby  contributing to their competitiveness in international markets.  The lessons learned from these environments are also communicated to EU and national policymakers so  as to ensure that future policy initiatives are based on sound experience and solutions that are known to  work. This ‘bottom-up’ approach to defining EU policy is well illustrated by the pan-European  Cybersecurity Exercise in which all EU Member States participate.  Achieving Results by Leveraging the Stakeholder Community  ENISA believes strongly that the people best positioned to solve the security issues facing its stakeholder  communities are the communities themselves. For this reason, every ENISA project is carried out in close  collaboration with representatives of the appropriate stakeholder community. ENISA’s results are  therefore produced ‘by the community, for the community’. Such an approach is inherently scalable and  ensures a high degree of buy-in by those concerned.  Creating European Solutions to Enable EU Industry  The role of ENISA is to guide experts towards security solutions that are adapted to the needs of the  internal market. By encouraging strong cooperation across national borders and across communities, the  Agency promotes the development of approaches to security that are not hampered by national  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  12  restrictions or the ideas of particular communities. This results in solutions that are interoperable across  the EU, thereby decreasing costs and enabling EU industry to benefit from a wider market.  Using Security to Strengthen Privacy  In addition to supporting EU industry, ENISA plays a unique role in supporting fundamental human rights  through appropriate implementation of security techniques.  In recent years the Agency has been active in the area of privacy and Data Protection and we are well  positioned to offer guidance on suitable implementation measures for implementing the General Data  Protection Legislation. By concentrating on implementation measures, the Agency will complement the  significant work that has gone into defining the legal framework.  Bridging Public and Private Sectors  One of the key roles of ENISA is to stimulate an active dialogue on cybersecurity between the public and  private sectors and to ensure that this dialogue results in concrete action plans and ultimately impact in  the form of improved cybersecurity practices.  ENISA achieves this through a variety of mechanisms, including support for public private partnerships,  collaboration with standardisation and certification bodies, liaison with research communities and  consultation of specialist groups (consumer protection, human rights, etc.).  Acting as a neutral third party with a mandate to improve EU cybersecurity, we are uniquely positioned to  bring groups with differing interests together in order to define mutually beneficial solutions.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  13  1. Section I — General Context  The ENISA Threat Landscape for 2015 drew a number of interesting conclusions regarding the evolution of  the threat environment.  Cyber-threats have undergone significant evolution and breaches have increasingly covered front pages of  media. Cyber-threat agents have had the time and resources to implement a series of advancements in  malicious practices. In particular:   performing persistent attacks based on hardware, far below the ‘radar’ of available defence tools and  methods;   achieving enhancements in the provision of ‘cyber-crime-as-a-service’, tool developments for non- experts and affiliate programmes;   highly efficient development of malware weaponisation and automated tools to detect and exploit  vulnerabilities;   campaigning with highly profitable malicious infrastructures and malware to breach data and hold end- user devices to ransom;   broadening of the attack surface to include routers, firmware and internet of things.  Where mitigation efforts are concerned, improvements have been achieved in coordinated campaigns to  disturb operations of malicious infrastructures, strengthen the legal/governmental cyber-defence  framework and develop more efficient products. In particular:   performing orchestrated actions to take down malicious infrastructure but also to analyse incidents  and improve attribution;   strengthening governmental awareness, cyber-defence expenses, capabilities and level of cooperation  among states;   performing exercises, development of threat intelligence, proliferation of information sharing, tools  and products to enhance awareness, preparedness and efficiency of defence;   focusing on research and development to accommodate developments of the cyber-threat landscape  to existing protection measures and methods and tools.  These are qualities that have been consistently developed throughout 2015 and have reached a  momentum that allows for a persistent course of action.  The report notes that threat intelligence collection, management and sharing should become an inherent  part of the national cybersecurity capabilities. In order to achieve this, policymakers should encourage  voluntary reporting and perform analysis of reported incidents, recycling results for better planning.  Finally, cyber-threat knowledge should be disseminated to all players in cyber-space, including end-users.  Businesses need to continuously adapt protection and detection tools to the threats. They should also  strive to simplify the content of threat intelligence to achieve wider uptake in the stakeholder community.  Threat agent models need to be improved and become an inherent part of threat intelligence.  Looking further ahead, research projects should develop applied statistic models to increase comparability  of cyber-threat and incident information. Similarly, we need new models for security controls to be  included in complex, smart end-user environments. The fact that the Internet of Things (IoT) is actively  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  14  being rolled out means that developing trust models for the ad hoc interoperability of devices within smart  environments now becomes a priority.  Finally, regarding the overall highlights for the future cyber-threat landscapes, two overarching trends for  defenders and adversaries respectively have been identified.  — The need for ‘Streamlining and consolidation’ of existing policies, defences and cooperation to  accommodate changes in threat landscape and  — Ongoing activities towards ‘Consumerisation of cyber-crime’, that is, making malicious tools available  to everybody.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  15  2. Section II — Multi-annual programming 2017-2019  Multi-annual objectives  The multiannual objectives of the Agencies are derived from the ENISA regulation and are part of ENISA  strategy. The objectives of the Agency are structured around five activities, presented in more detail in  section 2.2., and referred throughout the document with the following suggestive names: expertise, policy,  capacity, community and enabling.  The following sections provide a high-level, multi-annual planning for each of these objectives thereby  providing a basis for the definition of future work programmes of the Agency.  In section 2.3. a summary of indicators and targets is presented, providing the mechanisms to quantify the  progress and the achievements of the Agency.  Multi-annual programme  This section reflects the long term core priority objectives for the Agency and presents them in a  structured and concise manner following the structure of the ENISA strategy.  The ENISA strategy was built with the aim to support ENISA’s Executive Director and Management Board in  the elaboration and adoption of consistent multiannual and annual work programmes (1). This strategy  defines five strategic objectives that will form the basis of future multi-annual plans (2).  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA regulation, inputs from the Member States and  relevant communities, including the private sector. These objectives state that ENISA, in cooperation and  in support to the Member States and the Union institutions, will:  #Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the evolutions of the digital environment.  #Policy. Promote network and information security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the European  Union institutions and Member States in developing and implementing EU policies and law related to  NIS.  #Capacity. Support Europe maintaining state-of-the-art network and information security capacities,  by assisting the Member States and European bodies in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community. Foster the emerging European network and information security community, by  reinforcing cooperation at EU level among Member States, European Union bodies and relevant NIS  stakeholders, including the private sector.  #Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving the management of its resources and engaging more  efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member States and Union Institutions, as well as at  international level.  (1) Annual and multiannual work programmes (Article 5 §2 of ENISA regulation).  (2) In order to achieve the 5 year strategic objectives laid out in this document, the multiannual work programme will provide prioritised mid-term  operational objectives to be achieved by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Annual concrete activities (outputs) will be ident ified in the annual work  programmes, according to a recursive approach in order to achieve the mid-term operational objectives and in the long term the strategic objectives.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  16  2.2.1 Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and  information security challenges  In order to achieve this objective, ENISA will collate, analyse and make available information on global  cyber issues with a view to developing insights on issues of high added-value for the EU. In this analysis,  ENISA will cover both existing as well as new technologies and their integration, such as smart  infrastructures, Internet of Things, Cloud and Big Data and evaluate their impact on NIS and related  challenges such as NIS aspects of data protection.  To that end, ENISA will bring together Member States relevant stakeholders, such as industry, providers of  electronic communications networks or services available to the public, consumer groups, academic  experts in network and information security, and representatives of national regulatory authorities related  to NIS in order to discuss and explore NIS problems and challenges that they have encountered.  By compiling, comparing and evaluating these experiences alongside publicly available data, ENISA will  help to anticipate future risks and threats and identify those technologies and services that pose specific  security challenges in particular with regard to critical infrastructures, businesses at large and citizen’s  private data.  In response to this, the agency will develop and disseminate best practices which can be used to inform  across a number of different horizontal fields including research and development, innovation,  standardisation, IT Security certification and other relevant industrial practices.  This activity has four main objectives:   Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to Critical Information Infrastructures   Under this objective, the Agency carries out work designed to improve the expertise related to CII.   Objective 1.2. NIS Threats Landscape and Analysis   The objective here is to support NIS community by providing NIS threat analysis as well as to  provide analysis reports linked to the activities carried out by the Agency in collection of incidents.   Objective 1.3. Research and Development, Innovation   The objective of this work is to assist in bridging the gap between research, innovation and  deployment in the area of NIS as well as to provide ideas for future research that could contribute  to better NIS.   Objective 1.4. Response to Article 14 requests under Expertise activity   Under this Objective, the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests.  2.2.2 Activity 2 — Policy. Promote network and information security an EU policy priority  In order to achieve this objective, ENISA will assist and advise the Union institutions and the Member States  in developing and implementing EU policies, guidance and law on all matters relating to NIS.  Building upon its expertise gathered while achieving objective 1, ENISA will assist and advise the Union  institutions and the Member States in:   developing European NIS related policies and laws. To this end, ENISA will proactively engage with  Union institutions, and in particular all relevant directorate-generals of the European Commission,  in order to advise, including by providing preparatory work, advice and analyses relating to the  development and update of Union NIS policy and law.  In cooperation with the Member States, in particular as part of the work of the Cooperation group  established under the NIS directive, as well as with other relevant public and private stakeholders,  ENISA will promote a vision on how to significantly strengthen NIS across the EU, using adequate  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  17  EU policy levers. ENISA will, in particular, promote the inclusion of NIS aspects within policies  including — directly or indirectly — a digital dimension. ENISA will also actively contribute to the  reinforcement of NIS as a driver of the DSM and more generally of economic growth in Europe,  including the development of NIS and related ICT industries in Europe;   implementing, at EU level, NIS related policies and law, following their adoption. While ENISA,  focusing in particular on the implementation of the NIS directive, will support cooperation among  Member States regarding EU policies and law including a NIS dimension in order to foster  consistent EU-wide approach to their implementation. ENISA will bring together Member States  and other relevant public and private stakeholders, and will seek to produce recommendations  taking into account their needs and constraints (national, sectorial) (3).  Activities carried out under this objective are grouped in three main areas/sub-objectives.   Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy development.   This objective covers developing European NIS related policies and laws.   Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy implementation   This objective covers all the activities linked to implementing, at EU level, NIS related policies and  law, following their adoption.   Objective 2.3. Response to Article 14 requests under Policy activity   Under this Objective, the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests.  2.2.3 Activity 3 — Capacity. Support Europe in maintaining state-of-the-art network and information  security capacities  In order to achieve this objective, ENISA will assist the Member States and the Union institutions in  reinforcing their NIS capacities.  ENISA will support capacity building across the Union to make national public and private sectors and the  Union institutions’ networks more resilient and secure. This will involve working closely with Member States  and liaising, in cooperation with them, with various different stakeholders across the Union to develop skills  and competencies in the field of NIS.  ENISA will focus its effort on the following actors.   Member States: ENISA will support the development of Member States’ national NIS capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions of NIS capacity building and will focus in priority on  those highlighted in the NIS directive, including on the development and efficient functioning of  National/Governmental CSIRTs and policy level collaboration between national competent authorities  in the framework of the Cooperation Group, the development of national strategies, the establishment  of necessary national frameworks to aid implementation of national incident reporting schemes and  on training to improve skills. ENISA will as well offer, upon their request, direct to support to single  Member States (4). To that end, the Agency will develop proactive relationships with Governments  across the EU.   Private sector: ENISA will support Member States to engage with private sector on their NIS,  encouraging companies to take a whole-business approach to cyber threats from the top of the board  (3) This objective should not be confused with ENISA’s support provided to single Member States requesting assistance pursuant to Article 14 of ENISA  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 in implementing EU regulations’ specific provisions at national level, as part of objective 3 regarding ENISA’s support to  capacity building.  (4) Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  18  down. ENISA will also work with private sector stakeholders to help improve cyber security of  networks within companies.   Union institutions: in close coordination with the Union institutions, ENISA will support them in  reinforcing and coordinating their NIS capabilities and to that end, will establish a close and sustainable  partnership with CERT-EU. As part of this mission, ENISA will advise on key orientations and, upon  request, on actions to be implemented in order to achieve a high level of NIS across all Union  institutions. ENISA will, also, produce with CERT-EU information notes on threats and risks with a view  to making the EUIs and agencies more secure. ENISA will, whenever this is adequate, build on  experience gained by CERT-EU and the Union institutions to contribute to the broader EU NIS  community.   Citizens: alongside Member States, ENISA will help EU citizens to gain essential cyber security  knowledge and skills to help protect their digital lives. This will include promoting an annual European  Cyber Security month and working with the Member States delivering projects like the Cyber Security  Challenge as well as national initiatives, upon request from a Member State.  While aiming at supporting different types of actors, ENISA will take into account the transversal aspects of  NIS capacity building such as activities supporting the increase of the number of NIS experts in Europe (e.g.  academic training) and the spread of basic cyber hygiene in public and private organisations as well as in the  general public.  To achieve this, the activities covering capacity building are structured in five objectives, targeting the above  mentioned four main actors.   Objective 3.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building   Under this objective, ENISA will support the development of Member States’ national NIS  capabilities.   Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building   This objective covers all activities that ENISA will carry in close cooperation with the Union  institutions to support them in reinforcing their NIS capabilities.   Objective 3.3. Assist private sector capacity building   ENISA will work with private sector stakeholders, supporting Member States to help improve cyber  security of networks and information.   Objective 3.4. Assist in improving general awareness   This objective covers the activities addressed to EU citizens built together with EU institutions and  MS, such as promoting an annual European Cyber Security month and working with the Member  States delivering projects like the Cyber Security Challenge.   Objective 3.5. Response to Article 14 requests under Capacity activity   Under this Objective the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests. ENISA will offer,  upon request, direct support to single Member States and to EU institutions.  2.2.4 Activity 4 — Community. Foster the emerging European Network and Information Security  Community  Beyond its support to the development and the implementation of EU NIS related policies (Activity 2) and  to Member States and Union institutions towards the development of their NIS capabilities (Activity 3),  ENISA will actively support cooperation at EU level on NIS.  ENISA will in particular seek to support in priority:  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  19   CSIRT cooperation among the Member States, by supporting voluntary cooperation among Member  States CSIRTs, within the CSIRT network established by the NIS directive. As part of this activity, ENISA  will provide the secretariat of this network and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to  improve cooperation among CSIRTs and supporting this cooperation, including by developing and  providing guidance on best practices in the area of operational community efforts, such as on  information exchange.   Cyber crisis cooperation among Member States, by continuing to support the organisation of the Cyber  Europe exercises which shall remain one of ENISA’s key priority activities, while ensuring adequate  synergies with the CSIRT network.   Dialogue among NIS related communities, including between CSIRTs and law enforcement and data  privacy communities, in order to support consistent EU-wide approach to NIS. To that end, ENISA will  continue to interact with Europol (EC3).   Dialogue among public and private sectors on relevant NIS issues of European general interest, in  particular with a view to contribute to the objectives of the Digital Single Market, such as stimulating  the development and the competitiveness of NIS and ICT related industries and services in Europe.  In order to achieve this, ENISA will enhance cooperation at EU level among Member States, Union  institutions and related NIS stakeholders, including the private sector and will focus on three objectives.   Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation.   ENISA will rely upon its expertise developed within the framework of the organisation of the Cyber  Europe exercises that it will continue to develop and which shall remain one of ENISA’s key priority  activities.   Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building.   In line with the proposed NIS directive, ENISA will support the cooperation among CSIRTs, within  an EU Member States CSIRTs network, subject to its establishment. As part of this activity, ENISA  will provide the secretariat of this network and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways  to improve cooperation among CSIRTs and supporting this cooperation, including by developing  and providing guidance on best practices in the area of operational community efforts, such as on  information exchange.   Furthermore, the agency will contribute to the dialogue among NIS related communities, including  between CSIRTs and law enforcement and data privacy communities, in order to support  consistent EU-wide approach to NIS.   Objective 4.3. Response to Article 14 requests under Community activity   Under this Objective, the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests linked to the  previous two objectives.  2.2.5 Activity 5 — Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact  This activity aims to improve coordination of the Agency’s activities and to improve the cooperation with  Agency’s relevant stakeholders.  In order to achieve this horizontal objective, ENISA will improve the management of its resources and  engage more efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member States and Union institutions, as well at  international level.   Objective 5.1. Management   The Agency will act according to the following key general principles and rules:  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  20   ENISA will ensure a responsible financial management of its resources. In the next 5 years,  ENISA will continue to improve processes for monitoring financial flows and expects to  maintain high commitment and payment rates.   ENISA will guarantee a high level of transparency regarding its internal processes and way of  working.   ENISA will increase and maintain internal IT-security expertise within the Core Operations  Department, with a view to lowering the need to rely upon external experts, in particular in  developing and maintaining a high level of expertise (objective 1 of the ENISA Regulation).   Objective 5.2. Engagement with stakeholders   ENISA will continue to improve the quality and effectiveness of its relations with Member States’  NIS competent authorities. ENISA will, in particular, make it easier for the national competent  authorities to engage with the Agency, while offering better visibility on its activities. To this end,  ENISA will define Standard Procedures regarding the principles and modalities of the participation  and consultation of national competent authorities and other NIS related communities as part of  its activities. It will also engage with the national competent authorities actively participating in the  work of Cooperation Group established by the NIS directive. ENISA will also establish an updated  list of its ongoing and future activities, including relevant contact and calendar information for  Member States and NIS communities to facilitate their engagement with ENISA.   ENISA will reinforce and structure its cooperation with all Union institutions, entities and bodies on  NIS related issues, in particular the European Commission, as well as CERT-EU on the NIS of the  Union institutions, and Europol (EC3) with regard to community building between national NIS and  law enforcement communities.   ENISA will continue to improve the quality and effectiveness of its relations with other relevant  stakeholders, such as NIS and ICT related industries and services, essential operators, providers of  electronic communications networks or services available to the public, consumer groups,  academic experts in network and information security.   While developing its expertise, ENISA will avoid duplicating existing work at National level and will  focus on issues of real-added value for Europe.   Objective 5.3. International activities   ENISA will act at international level according to EU and Member States’ external policies and  guiding principles to be defined and adopted by the MB. ENISA’s international relations should  primarily aim at supporting EU’s external policy initiatives including a cyber dimension and  promoting the EU and its NIS expertise outside its borders.   Objective 5.4. Compliance and support   The Agency will seek to comply with legal and financial requirements and provide Human  resources, Budget, IT infrastructure, etc. in line with the operational objectives.  Monitoring the Progress and the Achievements of the Agency. Summarising the  Key Indicators for the multi-annual activities  The Agency has started a process for improving the standing of its key indicators for the purpose of  measuring and reporting better and more accurately against its annual work programme, in line with the  prescribed Commission approach.  The purpose of key indicators for ENISA is to provide the metrics to measure against performance, results  and impact of the Agency’s outcome, output and impact. Key indicators seek to better support policy  dynamics on network and information security, an area of policy that largely still remains under  development at the EU level, as technology and business models evolve.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  21  The chosen approach initially sets the designated levels of key indicators; each type of indicator is grouped  alongside other similar ones at the appropriate level. This approach has been developed taking into  account the capability of the Agency to report, and the need to avoid any unnecessary burden on the  Agency. The Agency capability to report reflects, effort, organisational measures as well as tools available  or that can be obtained relatively easily. Measuring operational performance that concerns the policy  raison d’être of the Agency remains the focal point for the key indicators introduced. The key notions and  main vectors of annual and multi-annual measurements are presented hereunder:  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:   Performance that is a concern at the output level when deliverables are produced. Metrics used, are  project management-based and they include:  (a) adherence to the scope of the deliverable or project;  (b) budget (or financial resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin;  (c) people (or human resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed levels  with a ± 5 % margin;  (d) time available to carry out the output or project remaining within prescribed levels with a ± 5 %  margin;  (e) quality of performance depending on the type of output, according to the classification of output  in the work programme (being, publication, event, support).   Results that are a concern at the annual and at multi-annual activities’ level. The indicators used are as  follows:  (a) delivery indicator aiming at delivery of at least 95 % against work programme planning. This is  equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma) organisation (reaching between 93.3 % and 99.3 %); clearly the  Agency has historically proven its operational ability to deliver at much higher level, meeting 6σ (6  Sigma) specification requirements (at 99.99 %). However, allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  22  above-mentioned deviation rate of ± 5 % (5). The criteria used, being scope, budget, people, time  and quality, they all refer to the proper execution of the project leading up to the production of  output. This evaluation is done at the end of the project within ENISA;  (b) following the production process that leads up to an output, feedback from stakeholders is  collected on each output. Results are further aggregated on a multi-annual basis by the Agency.   Impact is measured at the Agency level only; it is based on feedback received from the evaluation of  the Agency’s performance (own initiatives and commissioned consulting at the Agency’s initiative)  and/or institutional third party evaluations such as those commissioned by the European Commission,  the European Court of Auditors etc.  The key indicators broken down at the output level, the activities level and the agency level, are presented  hereunder.  Key indicators in ENISA  Output level Activities level Agency level  Scope (e.g. Scope drift  as compared to  approved WP plan)  S Variable: TLR Deliverables  (number of  deliverables realised  against the WP plan)  D Numerical:  quantitative  target  Evaluation (results’  aggregates) Periodic  Agency evaluation e.g.  COM(2018), Ramboll etc.)  E Variable: TLR  Budget (e.g.  appropriations utilised  and staff engaged in a  project plus or minus  5 %)  B Variable: TLR Feedback (number  of positive and not  so positive  feedback) (*)  F Numerical:  quantitative  target  People (e.g. staff  engaged in a project  plus or minus 5 %)  P Variable: TLR Feedback aggregates  for multi-annual  performance (**)  Fa Numerical:  quantitative  target  Time (e.g. duration of  project plus or minus  5 %)  T Variable: TLR  (*) Feedback via e.g.  survey associated  with deliverables on  website  Quality (e.g. citations,  downloads, MS  participation etc.)  Q Integer:  quantitative  target  (**) Aggregations of  deliverables or  categories thereof  All rating indicators follow a variable Traffic Light Rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows.   Green, that reflects 5 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance are appropriate and within  prescribed levels.   Yellow, that reflects 20 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance need to be revisited.   Red, which reflects deviation above 20 % meaning that the planning/performance need thorough  review.  (5) In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance between the mean value and the inflexion point. Shortening this distance is an indicator of  enhanced quality of performance. While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of the current version of the QMS of the Agency portions  thereof, are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the reference Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) hereto is the SOP PDCA (Plan-Do- Check-Act) that is a simplified version of the DMAIC (define-measure-analyse-improve-control) approach typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice  for simplicity is obviously desirable while the implementation of a quality system is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses o n process control for the  purpose of reducing or eliminating waste. Six Sigma utilises historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and improve a company’s operational  performance e.g. processes, practices, and support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard  deviations from the mean.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  23  Feedback is collected by means of surveys. It is envisaged that the deliverables part of the website will be  leveraged to channel targeted feedback against each deliverable downloaded. This is a task, however, that  will be made available as from 2018, at the earliest.

Furthermore, the Work Programme is structured following the objectives and the priorities  of the Agency as described in the new ENISA strategy.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  24  The human and financial resources of past and current situation are presented in the Annexes of this  document.  2.4.2 Resource programming for the years 2017-2019  The distribution of budget and resources for 2017 for the activities A1 to A5 is presented in the chart  hereunder. The budget and resources for each activity are presented in section 3.7.2. in the summary  table. The budget and posts distribution is based on the Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) methodology of  the Agency detailed in 3.6.2. of this document.  Following the publication of the NIS directive (NISD), the Agency is re-allocating budget and resources to  the new tasks/activities provisioned for the Agency in the directive. Another area which will probably  require more budget/resources is the Cybersecurity Public Private partnership (cPPP). However, the impact  on the ENISA work programme has not yet been identified. This will be updated in future versions.  In addition, this version of the work programme takes account of the prioritisation exercise carried out  during the March meeting of the Ad Hoc group, although it is recognised that this prioritisation will need to  be fine-tuned by the full Management Board.  For years 2017-2019, the Agency will gradually increase the share of the activity 3, Capacity Building. The  aim is to achieve a better balance of the resource distribution between capacity building and policy  activities in the future, as policy is currently consuming more resources than capacity building.  The budget and resources allocations within the summary table and Annexes are in line with the COM  Multiannual Financial Framework (MAFF) 2014-2020.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  25  3. Section III — Work Programme Year 2017  The ENISA Work Programme for the year 2017 follows the structure presented in the multi-annual  programming Section II. In this section clear objectives, results and indicators are identified for each  activity.  The Activities presented in this section follow the structure of the ENISA strategy document. After a short  description of the activity the Objectives are presented. A short narrative is included, consisting of a  description and added value of the activity, the main challenges for 2017 and link to the multi-annual  objectives.  The main outputs/actions in the specific year, for this case for 2017, are listed within each Objective. For  each Objective, there are several Outputs defined.  For each Output, the following are included in this document:   A description of the specific actions and outcome which are expected to contribute to the achievement  of the objective,   The type of output (in summary table at the end of each Activity):   P: publication i.e. report, study, paper   E: event i.e. conference, workshop, seminar   S: support activity, involving assistance to or close collaboration with e.g. EU Institutions or Bodies  or Member States as appropriate, with reference to a specific activity that features defined and  shared objectives.   Key performance indicators tailored for the type of Output (in summary table at the end of each  Activity).   Resources and budget, in a summary table at the end of the section in aggregated form at activity  level.  For each Activity there is an Objective defined that covers the actions that the Agency is carrying to  respond to Article 14 requests. Article 14 requests, named after the Article 14 of the ENISA regulation,  allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or advice on specific  activities.  Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network  and information security challenges  This activity aims at developing and maintaining a high level of expertise of EU actors taking into account  evolutions in NIS.  It covers the baseline security requirements, the threat landscape and activities related to research,  development and innovation.  3.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to Critical Information Infrastructures  The objective of the studies under this objective is to provide public and private stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CII) baseline security recommendations.  This objective will look at common requirements as well as focusing on sector specific areas of NIS  directive such as energy, health, transport, etc. as well as on baseline security recommendations for IoT in  the context of Critical Information Infrastructures.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  26  The baseline security recommendations will be based on existing national requirements, industry good  practices and widely used relevant standards (e.g. ISO, ETSI). The proposed outputs will be validated by the  relevant stakeholders  3.1.1.1 Output O.1.1.1 — Baseline Security Recommendations for the OES Sectors  ENISA will work closely with representatives from the Member States to identify a set of baseline security  requirements that are applicable to all Operators of Essential Services (OES) as defined in the NIS directive.  The Agency will identify and analyse existing security practices (e.g. BSI’s requirements) and standards (e.g.  ISO 27001, NIST’s CIIP Framework (6)) and compare them so as to identify the baseline security  recommendations.  In deriving such a set of ‘common’ baseline requirements, no account will be taken of sector-specific needs  as these are likely to introduce conflicting priorities (for example, the relative importance of availability  and integrity is likely to be different in the energy sector to the banking sector, where different risks  prevail).  However, the Agency will take note of such specific requirements as and when they are identified during  the analysis phase and will then map them to the needs and requirements of Operators of Essential  Services. This information can then be used a starting point for creating sector-specific baselines at a later  date.  The Agency will also compare and validate the results with other relevant approaches in the area of  Operators of Essential Services (e.g. EE-ISAC and ENTSO-E cyber security subgroup) and interact with all  important stakeholders from public as well as the private sector.  The proper validation of the proposed baseline security requirements by the private and public sector  would pave the way for a wide, de facto, tacit adoption of it, which could constitute the basis for EU  harmonisation.  3.1.1.2 Output O.1.1.2 — Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context of Critical  Information Infrastructures  This study will develop baseline cyber security recommendations for Critical Information Infrastructure  asset owners who use the concept of IoT to provide their services.  The Agency will identify and analyse existing security practices and standards in the area of IoT security for  CII (e.g. Industry 4.0, M2M communications, SDN and 5G networks). ENISA will compare these practices  and standards and develop baseline security measures to be adopted by all relevant stakeholders.  The Agency will focus, among others, on IoT resilience and communication, interoperability with  proprietary systems, trustability of IoTs, and other. Special emphasis will be given to the privacy issues of  such smart infrastructure and services.  (6) https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  27  In this endeavour, the Agency will take into account and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives (the NIS directive, the Internet of Things — An action plan for Europe, The Alliance for the  Internet of Things (AIOTI) (7), the 5G Infrastructure Pubic Private Partnership (5G PPP) (8)).  The Agency will also validate the results of the study (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and  EU initiatives (e.g. AIOTI) and interact with all important IoT stakeholders from public sector such as  Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, JRC, and from the private  sector including CII providers, integrators and manufacturers.  The proper validation of the proposed baseline security requirements by the private and public sector  would pave the way for a wide, de facto, tacit adoption of it which could constitute the basis for EU  harmonisation.  This work item builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of IoTs, intelligent Cars, Smart Cities, Smart  Hospitals and Smart Airports (WP 2015-2016).  3.1.2 Objective 1.2. NIS Threat Landscape and Analysis  The Objective NIS Threat landscape and Analysis has two parts.   The ENISA Threat Landscape focuses on a general analysis of the threat landscape   The NIS annual analysis reports, covers the analysis carried out by the Agency on the reported data  collected according to the legal requirements/mandate of the Agency.  NIS Threat Landscape  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) report enjoys major attention both within Member States, Commission,  as well as expert and lay communities. This objective follows up on past achievements, to deliver an  overview of the cyber-threat landscape, along with a series of related information. This material is free of  technical details and seeks to be very comprehensive.  In 2017, ETL will be further developed to include more interactive elements both in the presentation as  well as the dissemination of related information. Hence, besides the availability of collected information  over the entire year, produced threat information will be presented more intuitively by using more  graphics.  The impact of ETL is varied: it is used as a consolidated summary of existing material in the area of cyber- threats; it provides strategic and tactical information that can be used within security management tasks;  it can be imported to risk management methods; it can be used as basis for building up threat intelligence;  and it can be used for training purposes; finally the ENISA collection and analysis process can be used by  other organisations to create their own threat landscapes.  3.1.2.1 Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA Threat Landscape  This report will provide an overview of current threats and their consequences for emerging technology  areas. This report contains tactical and strategic information about cyber-threats. It also refers to threat  agents and attack vectors used. The produced report is based on an intensive information collection  (7) The Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI), more info available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things- innovation-aioti  (8) The 5G Infrastructure Pubic Private Partnership (5G PPP), more info available at: https://5g-ppp.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://5g-ppp.eu/  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  28  exercise, including annual incident reports, followed by analysis and consolidation of publicly available  information on cyber threats.  The ENISA ETL, provides information regarding reduction of threat exposure. This information will consist  of available controls that are appropriate in order to reduce the exposure and consequently mitigate the  resulting risks. In addition to the report, we will make available to the public all relevant material as this  has been collected during the year.  In carrying out this work, synergies with related experts (i.e. ENISA ETL Stakeholder Group) and vendors  will be implemented. We will invest in visualisation and quick availability of the resulting material.  In 2017, the ENISA Threat Landscape will be accompanied by an End-User application (web) that will  provide available information online. In this manner, ETL users will be in the position to access ENISA  threat information on a permanent basis. This platform may be used for integration of additional relevant  information.  In 2017, ENISA will continue the cooperation with CERT-EU in the area of Threat Landscaping. This effort  will be carried out by means of information exchanges, use of CERT-EU services and organisation of  common meetings/events.  Annual Incident Analysis Reports  ENISA is mandated by Article 13a of the Telecom Framework directive and Article 19 of the eIDAS  Regulation to collect reports from competent authorities in the area of telecom operators and trust service  providers respectively. The Agency analyses the reports and produces useful insights.  Reports on annual incidents are useful tools for providing stakeholders with insights on security incidents  that have had significant impact. Based on the analysis the Agency draws lessons learned, identifies  security trends and good practices and assesses root causes. Furthermore, the reports provide a consistent  and factual aggregate analysis of incidents for policymakers, the public and the industry, describing overall  frequency and impact of ICT security incidents across the EU.  3.1.2.2 Output O.1.2.2 — Annual Incident Analysis Report for the Telecom sector (article 13a)  This report provides an aggregated analysis of the major cyber security and network integrity incidents  affecting the European electronic communications’ sector in 2016.  According to Article 13a of the Telecom Framework directive ENISA shall collect from National Regulatory  Authorities (NRAs) incidents of significant impact. The Agency has developed over the years, together with  NRAs, the process to follow and the reporting modalities (e.g. parameters, thresholds, etc.).  The Agency analyses the reported incidents and then identifies trends, lessons learned and good practices.  All these are part of an Annual Incident Analysis Report.  3.1.2.3 Output O.1.2.3 — Annual Incident Analysis Report for Trust Service Providers (article 19)  This report provides an aggregated analysis of the major cyber security incidents affected Trust Service  Providers in 2016.  According to Article 19 of the Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS) Regulation, once per year  the National Supervisory Bodies (SBs) should notify ENISA about the security breaches or loss of integrity  of the trusted services and on the personal data contained therein.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  29  ENISA collects from SBs the annual reports about the reported incidents. The Agency analyses the reported  incidents and then identifies trends, lessons learned and good practices for protecting trust service  providers from such incidents.  3.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and Development, Innovation  The actions presented in this Objective are structured in two dimensions. The first dimension covers the  ICT standardisation in the EU and aims to assess the existing needs and gaps in the field. The second  dimension has as goals to identify research priorities from NIS perspective and from the EU perspective  and to use such priorities in collaboration with EU Commission in funding programmes.  3.1.3.1 Output O.1.3.1 — Guidelines for the European standardisation in the field of ICT security  This activity will provide an assessment of the situation of European standardisation in the area of ICT  security, taking into account the new requirements and priorities associated with the NIS directive (and  potentially the Commission’s communication on cPPP). It will analyse the gaps and provide guidelines for,  in particular, the development of standards, facilitation of the adoption of standards and governance of EU  standardisation in the area of ICT security.  In carrying out this work, ENISA will consult with industry and standards organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN,  CENELEC) as appropriate.  3.1.3.2 Output O.1.3.2 — Priorities for EU Research and Development  This study will provide an analysis of areas covered by the NIS directive, the General Data Protection  Regulation and the COM decision on cPPP and will aim to show where R & D activities funded in the  context of H2020, CEF (Connecting Europe Facility), TRANSITS and GEANT would achieve the greatest  impact.  ENISA will work closely with ECSO (European Cyber Security Organisation) and cPPP on cybersecurity in  order to align the work being carried with the ENISA Work Programme. In addition, the agency will offer  support to NAPARC (National Public Authority Representatives Committee) by offering a secretariat  function.  ENISA will look into adapting the current best practices and guidelines for protecting EU systems and  networks according to the evolving threats. As well as building specific used cases that can be adopted by  the IT Security community.  3.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response to Article 14 Requests under Expertise Activity  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities. Under this Objective, the Agency will address all the requests related to the  area of Expertise.  3.1.4.1 Output O.1.4.1 — Response to Requests under Expertise Activity  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately estimate the exact number or the output and  outcome of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are indicated in the Summary Section at the  end.

Promote network and information security as an EU policy  priority  In this activity ENISA supports the EU policy development and EU policy implementation in a number of  important areas.  3.2.1 Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy development.  ENISA will continue to provide the Commission and the MS with high quality information, data and advice  to support policymaking having an EU dimension.  In the policy development area the Agency will cooperate with public and private stakeholders to develop  insights, consolidate views and provide recommendations in areas where the EU take action to further  develop its policy. Examples include Certification and DSM.  ENISA, using its knowledge and expertise in this area, will liaise with the Commission and all relevant EU  Member States to identify and analyse current eHealth cyber security challenges. Through discussion with  the competent experts from public and private sector the Agency will identify the key elements of  comprehensive national approach to eHealth cyber security in order to meet the requirements of Article 7  of the NIS directive, whilst still allowing the sector to make appropriate use of new technologies. ENISA will  validate its findings via a workshop with all competent authorities.  3.2.1.1 Output O.2.1.1 — Support the policy discussions in the area of IT security certification  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy developments, such as the adoption of the NIS directive  and the publication of the Commission position on the cPPP, the Agency will continue to support the  Commission and the Member States in identifying a certification framework for ICT security products and  services which on one hand will boost competition and on the other promote mutual recognition or  harmonisation of certification practices up to a certain level. Any planned activity in the area of IT security  certification will respect existing national efforts and interests.  ENISA will bring together standardisation organisations (ETSI, IEC, etc.), ICT certification stakeholders (test  labs, certification and accreditation bodies, SOG-IS, CCRA, etc.) as well as ICT security product users  (ESMIG, Eurosmart, etc.) as a means to enhance the dialogue around security certification and build upon  existing results these initiatives have developed in the past.  Issues to be considered mapping the existing European situation in certification, possible steps to take at  EU level, how to speed up the development of secure European ICT infrastructures and services and the  policy impact of certification.  3.2.1.2 Output O.2.1.2 — Restricted. Towards a Digital Single Market for high quality NIS products  and services  ENISA will continue supporting the Commission in the development of the Digital Single Market (DSM) in  Europe from the NIS perspective.  The Agency, building upon its previous work on DSM (WP 2016) and on Commission’s studies on the  matter, will identify two market segments where the EU could potentially develop a significant  cybersecurity commercial approach. This will be supported by an analysis of why the EU is well positioned  to develop these areas and recommendations for further development.  To achieve this the Agency will liaise with the Commission, EU MS, and relevant public and private sector  organisations in order to collect critical input and insights on the matter. The analysis will reveal lessons  learned, success stories and good practices to be used for other sectors in the context of DSM.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  32  The report will include strategic recommendations to the stakeholders and it is envisaged to be used for  inspiration by other sectors. In this endeavour, ENISA will engage appropriate public and private  stakeholders in the analysis and validation of the results.  3.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy implementation  Objective 2.2 covering policy implementation is structured around four main topics:   contribute to EU policy in the area of e Communications;   support for the implementation of the eIDAS regulation;   support addressing the area of privacy and data protection linked to upcoming data protection  regulation;   support the implementation guidelines for the Implementation of Mandatory Incident Reporting in the  context of the NIS directive.  In the policy implementation area the Agency will cooperate with competent authorities and private  stakeholders to implement existing policies of the EU. Emphasis is given on harmonisation and soft-law  outcomes that would allow public and private sector to efficiently implement the EU policies. Examples  include NIS directive, Telecom Package, eIDAS, Privacy and Data Protection.  3.2.2.1 Output O.2.2.1 — Contribute to EU policy in the area of electronic communications sector  The Agency will continue its cooperation with the eCommunication sector developed over the years (WP  2010-2016).  The Agency will liaise with NRAs for the harmonised implementation of Article 13a (incident reporting,  baseline security requirements, root causes, trusted information sharing). It will also collaborate with  BEREC and Commission on the new NIS provisions to be considered in the update of the new Telecom  Package directive as well as the Universal Services directive (9). eCom providers and internet infrastructure  providers will be consulted on lessons learnt from incidents, sharing of experiences and good practices and  on policy implementation matters.  ENISA will liaise with the 5G PPP Working Group on Network Management and Security and will jointly  organise a workshop to identify common areas of interest and further develop the area of 5G and  SDN/NFV security matters. Cooperation will also be sought with the NFV Industry Specification of ETSI  which is also active in network virtualisation security and it has recently established a relevant Working  Group (NFV ISG Security Working Group).  Following the relevant ENISA’s work in 2016, the Agency will continue supporting the European  Commission (Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology) in the revision  and implementation of the Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy directive). In particular, ENISA will act as  technical advisor of the EC regarding security of personal data and confidentiality of communications in  the electronic communications sector. To this end, ENISA will produce where necessary relevant working  papers and technical reports, as well as support the EC in relevant ad hoc initiatives, upon request.  3.2.2.2 Output O.2.2.2 — Develop guidelines for the implementation of mandatory incident reporting  ENISA, building on its experience on mandatory incident reporting schemes and the work done by the  Cooperation Group and the CSIRT network being established by the NIS directive, will assist MS and  (9) Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to  electronic communications networks and services as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC (Citizen rights’ Directive) and Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, in  consolidated version available at: ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/22/2016-04-30  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/22/2016-04-30  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  33  industry in developing guidelines on implementing mandatory incident reporting mechanisms. This activity  will be driven by the context of the NIS directive.  The Agency will assist EU Member States, relevant private sector and EU Commission to properly  implement the incident reporting obligation defined in the NIS directive. This work builds on ENISA’s work  on the matters in the area of eCommunication providers (WP 2012-WP 2016), in the area of Trust Service  Providers (WP 2015-WP2016) and in the area of NIS directive (WP 2016).  ENISA will identify experts from all relevant public and private sectors and engage them in the process in  order to develop and validate the appropriate guidelines. Using its experience and knowledge in incident  reporting in different contexts ENISA will develop a simple and practical framework for reporting incidents  in these sectors (e.g. who reports, what is reported, how it is reported, when it is reported, etc.).  The proposed approach will extensively be validated with numerous relevant stakeholders. ENISA will do  its utmost to achieve consistency and harmonisation among the different implementation approaches  across sectors. Emphasis will be given on applying similar approaches, concepts, frameworks, good  practices, recommendations, parameters and/or thresholds per sector. By doing this ENISA will develop an  easy, consistent and affordable implementation scheme to be deployed by different sectors. Such schemes  would allow the proper analysis of reported incidents and pave the way for a consistent analysis across  sectors.  3.2.2.3 Output O.2.2.3 — Recommendations supporting implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public and private bodies in implementing the eIDAS Regulation  by addressing technological aspects and building blocks for trust services. The aspects to be covered will be  agreed with the EC and MS through the eIDAS experts group. Based on 2016 report on appropriate  technological protection measures to preserve privacy and trust, the implementation guidelines will address  specific technological measures and approaches and will be validated through coordinating eIDAS technical  subgroups.  Upon request by EU MS and/or the Commission and within a given context, ENISA will update previously  published reports in this area of work depending on the progress of the state-of-the-art.  Furthermore, ENISA will develop a set of recommendations for the trust service providers and their  customers. The choice of specific areas to be covered will be agreed with the relevant stakeholders, such  as the TSPs, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory authorities according to eIDAS regulation.  These recommendations will complement the existing knowledge base that ENISA created for the trust  service providers.  3.2.2.4 Output O.2.2.4 — Recommendations for technical implementations of the General Data  Protection Regulation  This study will provide best practises and specific recommendations for the technical implementation of  aspects related to the protection of personal data in the context of the provisions of the General Data  Protection Regulation. It will provide a set of recommendations that will provide data controllers and data  processors support on selecting and implementing applicable methodological procedures for  implementing aspects such as consent, right to erasure, data portability, data breaches, accountability,  anonymisation vs pseudonymisation, etc.  Upon request by EU MS and/or the Commission and within a given context, ENISA will perform studies  relevant to the implementation of the GDPR at EU MS level.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  34  3.2.2.5 Output O.2.2.5 — Privacy enhancing technologies  This activity aims to continue the Agency’s work in the field of privacy. More specifically, ENISA will  continue on practical guidelines to implement privacy and data protection by design and default. In 2014,  the work focused on a definition of the terms and in 2015 and 2016 the focus was in providing the  methodology to access the maturity of the current available techniques. Together with the Agency’s  partners in 2017 the Agency will continue this work by a community building effort that aims to create and  maintain a repository of best available techniques for Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). In 2016, the  Agency developed a community tool that allows to evaluate new techniques and keep lists of best  available techniques up to date. In 2017, this tool will undergo a field test. This field test will be used to  test the techniques practically and to extend their functionalities. The Agency will contribute to tools and  techniques that allow to evaluate new techniques and keep lists of best available techniques up to date.  The Annual Privacy Forum (APF) will be used to gather the key communities and to disseminate the work in  this area to the respective communities in industry and policymaking.  3.2.2.6 Output O.2.2.6 — Supporting the Implementation of the NIS directive  ENISA will support the Commission, Member States and the private sector in the implementation of the  NIS directive. This output mainly covers ENISA’s contribution to the cooperation group and especially the  development of good practices for identification of OES (criteria). Also, in this output ENISA will also  further develop its cooperation with operators of essential services in order to better understand their  sectorial needs and requirements.  More specifically ENISA will contribute to the establishment of the Cooperation Group and provide  suggestions on its functioning. The Agency, upon request, can analyse specific issues identified by the  cooperation group and develop recommendations and suggestions that would allow Commission and  Member States to take informed decision on NIS matters.  The Agency will leverage its expertise and good practices, among others, on Critical Information  Infrastructures, National Cyber Security Strategies, CSIRTs, baseline security requirements in numerous  sectors (energy, transport, finance etc.), standardisation, ICT certification and others to contribute to the  work of the cooperation group. That would be by reusing or customising existing results or by developing  new, specific results meeting the needs and requirements of the Cooperation group.  Also, ENISA will take stock of Member States current efforts to define criteria for the identification of OES.  Through this stock taking and analysis ENISA will identify common approaches, schemes and good  practices. The Agency will then validate them with relevant public and private sector to makes sure that  they meet the needs and requirements of both MS and private sector. Such good practices can be used, as  much as possible, by MS when defining, at national scheme, their criteria for the identification of OES.  Finally ENISA, using its knowledge and expertise in the area of OES, will liaise with the Commission and all  relevant EU Member States to identify and analyse current cyber security challenges, and then develop  good practices at sectorial level that could enhance the security of OES. ENISA will focus its efforts mostly  on energy, health, finance and transportation. The Agency will validate its findings via a workshop with all  competent authorities.  3.2.3 Objective 2.3.

Support Europe maintaining state-of-the-art network and  information security capacities  ENISA will provide assistance to MS and EU institutions and bodies, as well as the private sector by  supporting enhancement of NIS capacity building through the EU. In practice, this will involve promoting  capacity building activities and supporting the implementation of key legislative and policy developments  such as the NIS directive and the eIDAS Regulation. In particular, the Agency will work together with all  relevant stakeholders to ensure that approaches undertaken are coherent across the EU.  3.3.1 Objective 3.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building  One of the main goals of this objective is to develop and improve activities related to the operational  security capacity-support programme. In 2017, ENISA will build upon its work in the operational security  area, and will update and continue providing technical training material for CSIRTs to concisely support  improvement of technical skills across Europe and support MS through a dialogue with relevant  stakeholders in order to adjust our focus to technical challenges for the coming years. Another main goal  of this objective is to help the EU Member States and other ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU  institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop and extend the necessary capabilities in order to meet the  ever growing challenges to secure their networks.  3.3.1.1 Output O.3.1.1 — Support national and governmental CSIRTs capabilities  In 2017, ENISA will concentrate its efforts on assisting CSIRTs by leveraging its role as secretariat of the  CSIRT network as defined in the NIS directive. In close cooperation with this network, the agency will  support the development of Member States’ national incident response capabilities by providing  recommendations on key dimensions of NIS capacity building with a focus on the development and  efficient functioning of national and governmental CSIRTs. ENISA will as well offer, upon their request,  direct support to single Member States to assess and improve their CSIRT capabilities.  The main objectives of this output in 2017 is to help MS and another ENISA stakeholders, such as the EU  institutions, bodies and agencies, to develop and extend their incident response capabilities and services in  order to meet the ever growing challenges to secure their networks. Another objective of this output is to  further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for national and governmental CSIRT Baseline  Capabilities. As a continuous effort ENISA will maintain and regularly update its online European CSIRT  Inventory.  3.3.1.2 Output O.3.1.2 — Update and provide technical trainings for MS and EU bodies  In 2017, most of the activities in this area target at maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and trainings for CSIRT and other operational personnel. The Agency will support the  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  37  development of Member States’ national incident response preparedness by providing good practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building with a focus on CSIRT trainings and services in order to  improve skills of CSIRT teams and their personnel. ENISA will further build upon successful work in the area  of ‘training methodologies and impact assessment’.  In detail, the Agency will provide an update of the training material, which is in high demand and provide a  new set of a training material based on emerging technologies in order to reinforce MS CSIRTs skills and  capacities to efficiently manage cyber security events. A special emphasis in this output is laid on  supporting MS CISRTs and EU bodies with concrete advice (like good practice material) and concrete action  (like CSIRT training). ENISA will as well offer, upon their request, direct support to single Member States to  provide technical trainings and advisories.  In 2017, ENISA will further enhance its methodology, seminars and trainings on: (a) cyber crisis  management and (b) the organisation and management of exercises. This activity will include the  development of material and infrastructure for onsite and online trainings on these subjects. In addition,  this activity will cover the delivery of these trainings upon request.  3.3.1.3 Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU MS in the development and assessment of NCSS  ENISA will continue assisting EU MS to develop their capabilities in the area of National Cyber Security  Strategies (NCSS). The Agency, building on previous years’ work in this area, will assist MS to deploy its  existing good practices in this area and offer targeted and focused assistance of specific aspects of NCSS  (e.g. on the evaluation of NCSS). A priority in this area will be to ensure that NCSS adequately reflect the  priorities and requirements of the NIS directive.  ENISA will also act as a facilitator in this process by bringing together MS and private sector with varying  degrees of experience to discuss and exchange good practices, share lessons learnt and identify challenges  and possible solutions. Through this interaction with MS ENISA will validate and update its existing NCSS  good practice guide and evaluation/assessment framework of NCSS.  Finally ENISA will continue updating ENISA’s EU map of NCSS as well as with enhancing this map with  information in other ENISA’s reports with relevant scope such as CIIP governance and ICS-SCADA security  maturity models.  3.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building  ENISA will advise on key orientations and, upon request, on actions to be implemented in order to achieve  a high level of NIS across all European Union. ENISA will, as well, produce information notes on threats,  risks and incidents with a view of making European’s networks more secured.  3.3.2.1 Output O.3.2.1 — Restricted and public Info notes on NIS  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events and developments through Info Notes. Relevant NIS  events might cover incidents, significant developments and announcements in the field of cyber security.  Info notes are explanatory notes, regarding — for example — events that reach a certain level of public  and media attention.  ENISA will provide balanced and neutral information regarding such events, covering issues, points of  action, mitigation measures, summaries, related practices, etc.  ENISA’s intention is to continue providing Info Notes as a reliable and continuous service to its  stakeholders in a timely manner.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  38  ENISA will further assess the distribution methodology in relation to emerging technologies and assess the  impact of Info Notes among key stakeholders as well as the delivery method. In addition, to the ENISA  website, in 2017 Info Notes will be disseminated via the ENISA ETL platform.  3.3.2.2 Output O.3.2.2 — Restricted. Upon request, support the assessment of existing  policies/procedures/practices on NIS within EU institutions  At the request and/or in agreement with the Commission, ENISA will assess the impact of specific policies,  procedures and practices on NIS within EU institutions and compare those against national and/or other  international experiences. ENISA will then engage the key players in a dialog to discuss its findings and  propose recommendations and good practices in a form of a small position paper.  3.3.2.3 Output O.3.2.3 — Representation of ENISA on the Management Board of CERT EU and  representation of the EU Agencies using the CERT EU services  In 2017, the operations of CERT EU were put on a formal Legal basis by way of a draft Arrangement  between a number of EU Institutions. A MB has been created to supervise the activities of CERT EU. A  number of EU Bodies and Institutions are represented on the MB. A place for ENISA was also created on  the MB with the function of representing ENISA and the EU Agencies that use the services of CERT EU.  In this context ENISA will participate in the MB of CERT EU and will also liaise with the EU Agencies on  operational issues related to CERT EU’s activities in order to ensure that the viewpoints of the Agencies are  adequately represented. ENISA will also report in to the CERT EU MB on the evolution of Services required  by the Agencies.  3.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist private sector capacity building  The private sector is a highly relevant sector where the Agency supports capacity building. During 2017,  the aim is to extend the work on cybersecurity culture, cyber hygiene and to start an action related to  liability and insurance.  3.3.3.1 Output O.3.3.1 — Cybersecurity culture: from identifying the issues to providing working  scenarios for management level  The management level is an essential environment for most decisions with impact in NIS — Network and  Information Security. The understanding of the issues at stake by senior managers impact the mitigation  actions to be approved, or allocations of budgets, or development of new business sectors etc. With this  output we propose to give practical advice in terms of identifying the most common issues to what the real  life scenario may look like for the management level.  3.3.3.2 Output O.3.3.2 — Recommendations on Cyber Insurance  Cyber insurance might prove a good incentive for businesses to invest in information security. To  investigate its potential, ENISA will take stock of existing public and private approaches to cyber insurance  and identify the lessons learned and good practices in use from the deployment of cyber insurances (e.g.  liability issues, proper policy calculation, asset cost, cost of breaches) mostly in the area of pre-policy stage.  In this task, the deliverables produced by other, well appreciated institutions (e.g. OECD, European FI-ISAC)  should be taken into account.  ENISA will analyse the findings and issue recommendations for targeted stakeholders. In this context, the  Agency will create and maintain a small expert group that would provide guideline and validate the results  of the study together with other relevant stakeholders from the public and private sector.  This work will build upon ENISA’s previous work on cyber insurance (WP 2012).  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  39  3.3.4 Objective 3.4. Assist in improving general awareness  In close collaboration with Member States, ENISA will help EU citizens to gain essential cyber security  knowledge and skills to help protect their digital lives. This will include promoting the annual European  Cyber Security month and working with the Member States delivering projects like the Cyber Security  Challenges as well as national initiatives, upon request from Member States.  3.3.4.1 Output O.3.4.1 — Cyber Security Challenges  In order to promote capacity building and awareness in NIS among emerging young generation of cyber  security experts in EU MS, in 2017 ENISA will continue to promote and advise EU MS on running national  ‘Cyber Security Challenge’ competitions. The agency will also continue its European Cyber Security  Challenge 2017 annual activity. Its support to the national and European activities will aim at university  students from technical schools and young talents and also at security practitioners from the industry. The  goal will be to increase the interest and future opportunities in NIS for these communities by promoting  excellence in the form of competitions, as well as to gather feedback on the areas of interest from these  stakeholders. In order to do so, ENISA will try to achieve large participation among individuals from EU MS  for the final European competition.  3.3.4.2 Output O.3.4.2 — European Cyber Security Month deployment  The metrics built into the ECSM- European Cyber Security Month have shown an increased number of  participants, and a better engagement level from year to year. This is an achievement that was possible  with the support of an active community. In 2017, we intend to explore ways of making more use of sector  briefs for cybersecurity professionals. The previously proposed pillars remain: support a multi-stakeholder  governance approach; encourage common public-private activities; assess the impact of activities,  optimising and adapting to new challenges as appropriate.  3.3.5 Objective 3.5. Response to Article 14 Requests under Capacity Activity  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities.

Foster the emerging European network and information  security community  In order to achieve this scope, ENISA will enhance cooperation at EU level among Member States, Union  institutions and related NIS stakeholders, including private sector and will focus on two main objectives:  Cyber Crisis cooperation and CSIRT and other NIS community building.  3.4.1 Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation  ENISA will continue to support the operational communities and CSIRTs in their cyber crisis cooperation  development activities. The organisation and evaluation of pan European cyber exercises will continue to  have a central role in this support. In addition, ENISA will monitor closely the implementation of action  points from previous exercises. In this context, the Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) will be maintained and  enhanced with more content to help the exercising of operational security communities. CEP will be  offered by the Agency upon request to interested stakeholders as a cyber exercise cloud service. The  training portfolio of the Agency in cyber crisis management will be expanded and made available online in  CEP.  Furthermore, ENISA will continue to support the development of standard cooperation procedures for the  EU-level operational security networks and take on any responsibilities assigned to it in relation to the core  service platform (CSP) developed in the context of the Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF) programme.  3.4.1.1 Output O.4.1.1 — Evaluation of Cyber Europe 2016 and Report on Exercise after Action  Activities from 2014-2016  In 2016, ENISA organised the fourth pan European cyber crisis exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016)  The pan European exercises organised by ENISA are producing a number of significant recommendations  and actions for all involved stakeholders. It is extremely important to ensure the follow up and monitor the  progress of all these actions. Otherwise, the value of the exercise lessons learned is deteriorated.  In early 2017, ENISA will perform an in depth analysis of the evaluation data gathered from the exercise.  This will result in a detailed After Action Report (AAR) that will be shared only with the participating  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  42  countries. The report will include a dedicated section for any explicit comments received from the  participating countries in order to increase transparency. ENISA will also prepare a public evaluation report  according to the public affairs strategy of the exercise.  3.4.1.2 Output O.4.1.2 — Planning of Cyber Europe 2018  In 2018, ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2018 (CE2018). This  exercise will closely follow up and build upon the lessons learned and actions from previous exercises, such  as CE2014 and CE2016.  CE2018 will be a programme of trainings and exercises focusing on testing and training on large-scale  incident management cooperation procedures at EU and national-levels. The efforts will not focus only on  organising a one-time off event but rather to be a continuous effort throughout the year, offering  preparatory training and cooperation opportunities such as small exercises to Member States and the EU  Institutions (EuroSOPEx). The exercise escalation and built-up will be realistic and focused in order to  capture better how incidents are managed and cooperation happens in real-life. The exercise will include  explicit scenarios for the CSIRT Network set up under the NIS directive.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include the strategic dimensions of the exercise will be  prepared based on the lessons learned from CE2016, to drive the whole planning process. The exercise  brief will be given for comments and approval to the MS Cooperation Group set up under the NIS directive.  Following this, ENISA will assemble group of planners from the participating countries to work closely  towards developing a detailed exercise plan (ExPlan) by the end of 2017. ENISA will involve the group of  planners in all relevant planning steps and take into account their input towards a consented plan. The  exercise planning will set in early enough to avoid overlaps with other major related activities.  ENISA will consult MS and seek agreement of the Cooperation Group set up under the NIS directive on a  possible joint EU-NATO cyber exercise within the framework of Cyber Europe.  3.4.1.3 Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for Cyber Exercise Planning and Cyber Crisis Management  Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) Development and Content Management  Since 2014, ENISA started the development of the Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP). CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States and EU Institutions, such as: exercise organisation and  management, exercise playground with technical incidents, map of exercises and hosting the exercise  development community. With this activity ENISA would like to maintain and enhance the experience  offered by CEP, including user support.  In addition, new content and exercise incident challenges and material will be developed in order to keep  up the interest of the stakeholders and make CEP a central tool in cyber security exercising for all  stakeholders.  EU-level Cyber Crisis and Incident Management Procedures and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)  Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)  Since 2015, ENISA offers the secretariat to the MS developing EU-level standard cooperation procedures at  operational and technical levels. The upcoming policy framework, NIS directive, is expected to strengthen  this by making this supporting role more formal as the secretariat for the cooperation of the EU  operational cyber security network (CSIRTs). In this context, ENISA will offer support for the network,  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  43  helping further the development of EU-level cooperation with standard operation procedures at both  levels, including the point of contact management.  In this context also alert exercises and communication checks will be organised based on the defined  procedures.  In 2017, ENISA will have to prepare to manage and operate the centralised components of the Common  Service Platform (CSP) of the Cybersecurity DSI to be implemented during 2016-2019 under CEF WP2015,  subject to the agreement of the Government Board of the Cybersecurity DSI. As of 2017, ENISA will have to  follow the CSP development very closely and build the capability to gradually take over the parts of the  infrastructure as implemented. By 2019, ENISA must be ready to fully assume the responsibility for the  management, maintenance and further development of the CSP.  As a result of this, the Agency will engage with the contractor developing and deploying the CSP in order to  coordinate all activities that are in relation with the above tasks. ENISA will also investigate how we can  extend our already excellent collaboration with GEANT.  3.4.2 Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building  ENISA will continue to support the cooperation among CSIRTs, within an EU Member States CSIRTs  network. As part of this activity, ENISA will provide the secretariat of the network of CSIRTs foreseen by  the proposed NIS directive and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to improve cooperation  among CSIRTs and supporting this cooperation, including by developing and providing guidance on best  practices and trainings in the area of operational community efforts, such as on information exchange.  Furthermore, the Agency will contribute to the dialogue among NIS related communities, including  between CSIRTs and law enforcement and data privacy communities, in order to support consistent EU- wide approach to NIS.  3.4.2.1 Output O.4.2.1 — Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and  LEA  In 2017, the key goal is to build upon the progress ENISA has made in supporting different operational  communities (e.g. CSIRT, law enforcement, European FI-ISAC) to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to  collaborate and support good practices among different stakeholders in operational communities in  Europe. In detail, ENISA will continue its effort to support our common EU wide objective on fight against  cybercrime with different stakeholders.  3.4.2.2 Output O.4.2.2 — EU CSIRT network secretariat and support for EU CSIRT network community  building  ENISA will support the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the NIS directive, in  particular in the area of CSIRTs. As part of this activity, ENISA will provide the secretariat of the network of  CSIRTs and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to improve cooperation among CSIRTs and  supporting this cooperation, including by developing and providing guidance and good practices in the  area of operational community efforts, such as on information exchange. In particular, the Agency will be  proactive in stimulating discussions within the network and will aim to provide content to support  discussions on policy and technical initiatives.  In addition, ENISA will take an active role to support the EU CSIRT network in activities relevant to the CEF  work programme. ENISA will also manage EU CSIRT network infrastructure assigned to ENISA (if applicable  — CEF annual work programme to support CSIRTs in the area of community building and information  sharing (Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF) programme for CSIRTs).

Reinforce ENISA’s impact  Activity 5 covers four main objectives.   Management   Engagement with stakeholders   International activities   Compliance and support  3.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall management of the Agency. The Executive Director  has a personal assistant.  To support the Executive Director, an Executive Directors Office (EDO) has been set up. The tasks covered  by EDO include: Policy advice, Legal advice, Management Board Secretariat, Coordination of the Work  Programme and Press Communications.  The policy and legal advice shall extend to all aspects of the work of the agency and includes both advice in  relation to the operational and administration Department of the Agency.  The EDO also supports the administration of the Management Board meetings and the administrative  correspondence that takes place between meetings.  The EDO manages and supports the relations with the press in order to promote the outreach of the  Agency.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  46  In 2017, EDO will continue to support the Management Board (MB) and the Executive Board in their  functions by providing secretariat assistance.  In relation to the MB, one ordinary meeting will be organised during 2017 and informal meetings will be  held as necessary. The existing electronic MB newsletter will be changed to an ENISA newsletter in 2017.  The MB Portal will also be supported. For the Executive Board, a formal meeting will be organised once per  quarter and informal meetings when necessary.  3.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement with stakeholders  Under this objective are grouped some of the tasks and activities of the agencies carried out in  collaboration with stakeholders.   National Liaison Officer Network   Permanent Stakeholders Group   Stakeholders Communication and Dissemination Activities   Outreach and Image building activities  National Liaison Officer Network  ENISA has kicked off various activities aiming at strengthening the cooperation with its National Liaison  Officers’ (NLO) Network. NLOs are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and they warrant the interaction  with select public sector entities in the MS while they provide assurance in terms of outreach effective  liaison with the MS and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  In 2017, ENISA will build upon these efforts and improve its cooperation with the NLO Network, as the First  Point of Contact for ENISA in the MS, with emphasis on:   a NLO meeting to discuss possible improvements in the collaboration with ENISA. Improvements aim  at leveraging on the NLO network for the dissemination of ENISA deliverables,   information to be sent to the members of the NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where the Agency  contributes to (for example co-organiser, etc.);   the Agency maintaining and sharing with the NLO network information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant tender results, etc.) while maintaining and  expanding as appropriate online resources available.  PSGermanent Stakeholders Group  In 2017, ENISA will continue and reinforce the contribution of the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG) to  the ENISA Work Programme.  The PSG is composed of ‘nominated members’ and members appointed ‘ad personam’. The total number  of members is 23 and they come from all over Europe. These members constitute a multidisciplinary group  deriving from industry, academia, and consumer organisations and are selected upon the basis of their  own specific expertise and personal merits. Three (3) ‘nominated members’ represent national regulatory  authorities, data protection and law enforcement authorities.  The PSG is established by the ENISA regulation (EU) No 526/2013. The Management Board, acting on a  proposal by the Executive Director, sets up a PSG for a term of office of 2.5 years.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  47  The Role of the PSG group is to advise the Executive Director on the development of the Agency’s work  programme, and on ensuring the communication with the relevant stakeholders on all related issues.  Stakeholders Communication and Dissemination Activities  In 2017, ENISA will seek to improve its focus on key activities and engage the higher possible number of  stakeholders. This includes the various groups of stakeholders that count with institutional, academia,  industry, citizens, etc.  The Agency will continue developing various tools and channels including the website and with strong  emphases in social media.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the Stakeholders Communication team that will seek the  appropriate level of outreach activities to take ENISA’s work to all interested and to provide added value to  Europe.  Outreach and Image building activities  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for all stakeholders. It’s indubitable the importance that  the European Citizens in all areas of our society to trust in ENISA’s work. The cyber security challenges are  increasing in the world and Europe is not an exception. With this objective ENISA’s image needs to be  continuously reinforced. The outreach of the Agency work is essential to create the NIS culture across the  several actors in Europe. ENISA is consistent of this fact and will work with all interested to reach the  Citizens that require information about the work that is developed by the Agency.  Several activities are planned in several Member States that will engender the cyber security awareness  across Europe, fulfilling ENISA’s mandate, mission and strategy until 2020.  3.5.3 Objective 5.3. International relations  Under the Executive Director’s guidance and initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level.  3.5.4 Objective 5.4. Compliance and support  The Stakeholder Relations and Administration Department (SRAD) strives to operate a cost-efficient,  customer-oriented service department.  The SRAD has contributed to the ENISA strategy both internally and externally seeking the optimal  solutions for delivering on the mandate of ENISA.  The SRAD seeks to enhance the functionality of the administrative procedures of the Agency, to provide  administration related services and strategical support and orientation for the Agency recourses strategy.  The SRAD oversees a variety of programmes, projects and services relating to personnel, finance,  purchasing, technology, facilities management, health, safety, security, and much more.  The aim of the SRAD is to provide this assurance and at the same time provide the best level of efficiency  and use of the resources that are made available for the Agency. Coordination with the European  Commission Internal Audit Service, European Court of Auditors, European Ombudsman, European  Commission European Anti-Fraud Office, etc. is one main task of this area. All internal policies related to  transparency, anti-fraud policy, whistle-blowers protection, declarations of interests, etc. are addressed  within this activity.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  48  Quality Management System and Internal Control Coordination  ENISA is developing the Quality Management System (hereinafter, QMS) of the Agency to support its  regulatory and strategic goals by means of a quality management approach. ENISA will follow the  ISO 9001:2015 standards as they are designed to help organisations ensure that they meet the needs of  customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements. The methodology  is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle that has been duly documented in a dedicated SOP and  applied accordingly.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk management, governance and internal control processes of the  Agency, in order to provide, to the Senior Management, Executive Director and the Management Board,  independent and objective assurance.  3.5.4.1 IT  In 2015, ENISA set out to define its ICT strategy for the years 2015-2018. The main thrust of this strategy is  to consolidate systems and applications on a maximum of two platforms, maximise data sharing, make  applications available in a secure way on the most widely used mobile devices, and, to progressively move  the Agency’s IT infrastructure to the Cloud. Due to the size of the agency and effective resources  management, the IT tasks will be outsourced as far as possible to concentrate the available resources in  the operational area of the Agency.  By mid-2017, it is expected that most business applications will be securely available on the most widely  used mobile devices. By this timeframe, the platform consolidation should be close to complete, making  data (information) more readily available for reporting and monitoring purposes.  3.5.4.2 Finance, Accounting and Procurement  The key objective here is to ensure the compliance of the financial resources management with the  applicable rules, and in particular with the sound financial management, efficiency and economy principles  as set down in the Financial Regulation. As the Agency resources are derived from the Union Budget,  management is required to comply with a set of regulations, rules and standards set down by the Union  competent institutions. The Unit is responsible for high quality reporting (annual accounts) and  contribution to the audit and discharge procedures.  In 2017, the Agency expects to benefit from the deployment of tools used to simplify and automate its  work, automated applications (Budget Management, Budget Reporting, Procurement planning), e-Prior  (EU Commission platform for the management of the procurement lifecycle, from pre-award to post- award of a contract), as well as the integration of systems (staff missions, project management and budget  management).  Task Objective Level of  completion  2016  Level of  completion  2017  Level of  completion  2019  Consolidate systems and applications on a maximum of two  platforms  Efficiency 20 %  60 % 90 %  Maximise data sharing Efficiency 30 %  60 % 90 %  Move the Agency’s IT infrastructure progressively to the Cloud Efficiency 30 %  50 % 90 %  Business applications will be securely available on the most  widely used mobile devices  Availability 10 % 70 % 90 %  Continuous operations Availability 98 % 98.5 % 99 %  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  49  The deployment of tools coupled by outsourcing of certain activities of low value, is expected to improve  the overall resources management and reporting capacity of the Agency.  The aim is to contribute to the Agency annual and multi annual programming from inception to execution.  The financial resources are allocated according to the expressed needs of the organisational Units  according to the priorities set by the Agency management.  Key objectives for the year 2017 include high budget commitment and payment rates, low number of  budget transfers during the year, planned and justified carry overs, and reduced average payment delay.  3.5.4.3 Human Resources  In 2017, ENISA will recruit additional personnel in line with the Agency’s Establishment Plan. Some of these  recruitments relate to staff turnover at the Agency.  In 2017, the annual performance appraisal exercise will be carried out taking into account the new staff  regulations and applicable rules. HR is also responsible for training and arranges for both mandatory and  professional development training. These training exercises are conducted to ensure that staff members  retain and improve their skills and competencies.  Task Objective Level of  completion  2016  Level of  completion  2017  Level of  completion  2018  Posts on the Agency establishment  plan filled  Minimum 95 % of the  recruitment target reached  90 % 95 % 97 %  Respect the recruitment procedure  time framework.

This should contribute to a common corporate culture, improve staff engagement and  ultimately also improve the operations implementation of the work programme. It is proposed that the  implementation of the internal communications strategy will be completed and revised in 2017.  Thereafter, it is envisaged to do an annual review of this Strategy to ensure that it is kept up to date and  appropriate for the Agency.  Task Objective Level of  completion  2016  Level of  completion  2017  Level of  completion  2018  Increase the level of awareness of  ENISA’s work and recent  developments related to the Agency  Develop Internal Communication  Strategy  50 % 80 % 90 %  Increase the staff motivation Bring all staff members and  offices closer for a better and  fruitful cooperation  60 % 80 % 90 %  Legal Affairs  In 2017, Legal Affairs will continue supporting the legal aspects associated with the operation of the  Agency. This includes dealing with matters such as contracts, procurement, employment related matters,  data protection and corporate governance matters. The Legal Affairs function also includes dealing with  complaints submitted pursuant to Article 90 of the Staff Regulations and complaints to the European  Ombudsman and representing the Agency before the European Court of Justice, General Court or Civil  Service Tribunal.  Data Protection Compliance tasks and Data protection Office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) include:   inform and advise ENISA of its obligations pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC and document this  activity and the responses received;   monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data;   monitor the implementation and application of Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the  requirements for data security, information of data subjects and their requests in exercising their  rights under the Regulation, as well as the requirements for prior check or prior consultation with  EDPS;   monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of ENISA’s  operations;   act as ENISA’s contact point for EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data; cooperate  and consult with EPDS whenever needed.  Information Security coordination  The Information Security Officer (ISO) coordinates the Information Security Management System on behalf  of the Authorising Officer. In particular, the ISO advises the ICT Unit alongside the Quality and Data  Management Unit to develop and implement information security policies, standards, guidelines and  baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality, integrity and authentication of the information systems of  the Agency. The ISO is instrumental in incident handling and incident response and security event  monitoring. The ISO also leads the security training for the Agency’s staff and he provides security  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  51  guidance on all IT projects, including the evaluation and recommendation of technical controls. In 2017,  the ISO will contribute to such goals as:   improving the security posture of ENISA by planning penetration tests and vulnerability assessments;   advising on security policies and updating existing ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks;   improving the internal security training for ENISA staff;   implementing new systems and tools that can support improvements on IT Security.

ABB focuses on integrated  budgeting and financial management, based on activities linked to the Agency’s priorities and objectives.  To improve better estimation of resources needed for each ENISA activity, we need to split the budget  forecast in Direct and Indirect budget. The following assumptions are used in the simplified ABB  methodology.   Direct Budget is the cost estimate of each Operational activity (listed in Activities A1 to A5) in terms of  goods and services procured.   Indirect Budget is the cost estimate of salaries, mission costs and overhead costs, attributable to each  Operational or Compliance activity. The indirect budget is re-distributed against direct budget in all  Activities.   Compliance posts from Activity A5 Enabling are redistributed to Core Activities — A1 to A4, and  operational posts of the Activity A5.   Total ABB posts (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts from all activities (A1 to A5) after the re- distribution.  The table below presents the allocation of financial and human resources to Activities of the Agency based on the above ABB  methodology.

The high commitment rate shows the already proven capacity of the Agency to fully  implement its annual appropriations. The same commitment rate achieved in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and  2014, is maintained for a sixth year in a row. The payment rate reached 92.89 % (85.61 % in 2014) and the  amount carried forward to 2015 was EUR 671 393.26 (EUR 1  308 475.80 in 2014) representing 7.11 % of  total C1 appropriations 2015 (from 14.39 % in 2014).  Cancellation of appropriations   Commitment Appropriations  No commitment appropriations were cancelled.  The appropriations of 2015 were fully utilised, i.e. the commitment rate reached 100.00 %.   Payment Appropriations  No payment appropriations were cancelled.  The appropriations of 2014 carried over to 2015 were utilised at a rate of 93.95 % (automatic and non- automatic carry-overs) which indicates a satisfactory capability of estimation of needs. From the amount of  EUR 1  332 420.80 carried forward, only the amount of EUR 80 675.08 was cancelled, due to the fact that  the estimated expenditure deviated from the actual.

Annex VII: Evaluations  Internal monitoring system MATRIX has been put in place at ENISA and is used for project management by  ENISA staff. Regular progress reports are presented at the meetings of the ENISA management team and  reviewed at the midterm review meetings.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  63  Also, external consultant has been contracted to carry annual ex post evaluation of core operational  activities. The scope of the evaluation focusses on ENISA’s core operational activities, with an estimated  expenditure above EUR 30 000.00. The overall objective of the annual evaluations is to evaluate the  effectiveness, efficiency, added value, utility, coordination and coherence.  The following table summarises the findings per evaluation criteria and outlines actions ENISA’s  management considered as important. The evaluation of 2014 core operational activities is largely positive  and the actions mainly relate to a continuation of the work carried out.  Criteria  Summary findings  Possible Actions  Relevance  Based on the findings, it can be concluded that ENISA clearly  responds to a need in the European NIS landscape. The scope and  objectives of ENISA’s work are seen as relevant to respond to the  needs, but at the same time stakeholders see limits to ENISA’s  mandate and outreach, which affects the ability of the Agency to  effectively meet the needs  Continue to explore ways to ensure  ENISA’s work is addressing real needs  in NIS in the EU  Map/assess gaps in current NIS  landscape, to feed into discussions on  future mandate  It may be important in the future to  focus on activities where there is a  strong demand from the NIS  communities to ensure that ENISA’s  deliverables achieve a real impact  Impact  It appears that, despite ENISA’s limited mandate and also fairly  small resources, the Agency manages to make a real contribution  towards increased NIS in Europe, as perceived by key stakeholders  N/A  Effectiveness  — KIIs and  downloads  All KIIs were achieved. The evaluation can conclude that some of  ENISA’s deliverables have generated a high number of downloads  in a short period of time (most reports were made available in Q1  2015 and thus downloads had only been available for a few  months at the time of writing)  Introduce more ambitious KIIS which  enable a tracking of performance  Effectiveness  — EU Policy  The evaluation findings show that the work conducted under work  stream 1 has been successful in achieving most objectives. In  particular, the work undertaken to identify evolving threats, risks  and challenges, and the contribution to EU policy initiatives appear  to have achieved the intended results. For the work done in  supporting the EU in education, research and standardisation,  results were more mixed, in particular regarding the link to actual  operational issues such as data protection and secure services.  These aspects are evidently not under the direct control of ENISA  but of national regulators and operators, hence the need for  further efforts in coordination and cooperation  Continue efforts to build relations with  senior decision-makers at Member  State and EU level (public and private)  Effectiveness  — Capacity  building  ENISA’s work to develop capacity in Member States (to coordinate  and cooperate during crises, and the support to develop capacities  and strategies at Member State level) as part of work stream 2 has  been successful in achieving the objectives set out. The  contribution to private sector capacities looks more uncertain,  based on the responses from the stakeholder survey  Continue to engage with the private  sector to improve and increase  outreach  Effectiveness  — Support  cooperation  Findings show that the work stream 3 has largely achieved the  objectives set, with stakeholders assessing a clear contribution of  ENISA to putting in place effective measures to cope with cyber  crises and incidents. In particular, ENISA’s support was considered  valuable to improve workflow and cooperation among involved  stakeholders. That said, as the CE2014 case study concludes, there  Continue trust building and  cooperation activities as a means to  overcome barriers to cooperation  during crisis  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  64  is still a long road ahead before an EU-level crisis management  process is put in place in the cyber security area, with a lack of  trust among stakeholders, weaknesses and differences in national  capabilities, weak communication structures, insufficient  exchanges of information in ‘real life’ etc., representing hurdles  that need to be surmounted over the medium to long term  Efficiency  The operational budget of ENISA is limited, and the main  expenditure relates to staff costs. In the light of the resources  available (staff and expenditures), ENISA manages to produce  quite a high number of deliverables which also have generated  considerable outreach in terms of downloads. No indication of low  efficiency was identified in the evaluation period, though specific  cost saving measures could not be established  N/A  Coordination  and  coherence  Overall, it can be concluded that ENISA effectively cooperates and  engages with its main stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate.  The support provided by ENISA is seen as a complement to that of  other public interventions, and no adverse effects were identified  N/A  Overall, the evaluation of activities foreseen in the Work Programme 2014 conclude that ENISA effectively  cooperates and engages with its main stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate. The support provided by  ENISA is seen as a complement to that of other public interventions, and no adverse effects were  identified. There is a clear pattern in terms of progress, where targets under ENISA’s control (such a high  quality, community building, good practice dissemination) are largely achieved. The scope and objectives  of ENISA’s work is seen as relevant to respond to the needs, but at the same time stakeholders see limits in  ENISA’s mandate and outreach. In particular, private stakeholders and industry appear to strive towards a  more operational role for ENISA, going beyond the advisory and facilitating mandate of the Agency, in  order to effectively achieve the overall objectives of Network Information Security (NIS) and cyber security.  Also, the findings and conclusions from the external evaluation of ENISA’s core operational activities in  2015 confirm that ENISA generally functions efficiently; it is characterised by a clear delineation of  responsibilities and has cost-saving measures in place, but one case of low efficiency was identified,  namely the insufficient dissemination of publications. It was concluded that ENISA significantly enhanced  cooperation both between Member States of the EU and between related NIS stakeholders in 2015 by  bringing people from different operational communities around the table to share information, ideas and  common areas of interest at an operational level. ENISA thereby contributed to a great extent to  enhancing community building in Europe and beyond and improved services, workflow and  communication among stakeholders to respond to crises. Moreover, the ex post evaluation concluded that  ENISA’s support to cooperation between stakeholders complemented other public interventions, clearly  pointing to a role for ENISA in this regard.

It is clear however, that the EU will not be able to achieve ‘digital growth’ in the absence  of an approach to cybersecurity that engenders trust in the wider community. It is therefore logical that  the roles and responsibilities of ENISA have been evolving to support this move towards a more digital  society. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that Network and information security (NIS) plays a  central role in the activities of designing, developing and maintaining information systems, networks and  services.  The rate at which the area of NIS is currently growing presents a major challenge to the Agency, which  seeks to optimise its performance by prioritising those areas where it can make the biggest impact. ENISA  sets these priorities through its annual programme, which is developed in close cooperation with the  ENISA Management Board (MB) and the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG). This document is the result  of several rounds of consultations carried out since September 2015 and during 2016.  The operating model of the Agency is based on the delivery of three main types of services to and in  collaboration with the NIS community.   Recommendations mainly in the form of reports addressed to its stakeholders.   Support for policy development and implementation.   ‘Hands on’ work involving and developing operational communities.  Through these activities, which have been formalised in terms of a number of strategic objectives, ENISA  supports the EU and the Member States in enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness  to prevent, detect and respond to network and information security issues and incidents.  Document Structure  In this Programming Document the planned activities for 2017 to 2019 are presented alongside the  detailed planning for 2017. The document follows the structure laid down by the new EC guidelines for  programming documents provided in the context of Framework Financial Regulation.  The budget and resources allocations within the summary tables and Annexes are in line with the COM  Multiannual Financial Framework (MAFF) 2014-2020.

http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/58/2009-12-19  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  11  Mission Statement  ENISA is a centre of expertise for cyber security in Europe. ENISA supports the EU and the Member States  in enhancing and strengthening their capability and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond to  network and information security problems and incidents. This is reflected in ENISA’s mission statement:  Securing Europe’s information society  In terms of the vision statement, by 2020 ENISA should:   be ‘the hub’ for exchange of information on cybersecurity between the EU public sector and Member  States;   have developed its operational model, based on recommendations, policy support and ‘hands on’  work so as to provide seamless support to its stakeholders in all areas covered by the mandate;   have an established presence in all key industry sectors and be a recognised name among security  professionals;   be able to demonstrate a positive contribution to EU economic growth through its initiatives.  Adding Value through Complementarity  ENISA is a ‘Centre of Expertise’ in Network and Information Security and, as such, supports all phases of  the security lifecycle including policy definition, policy implementation and maintenance and improvement  of live operational solutions.  The Agency is complementary to other EU institutions in that it concentrates on identifying and  disseminating pragmatic solutions to current problems in live operational environments. This enables EU  industry to learn from each other and to implement strong security solutions at optimal cost, thereby  contributing to their competitiveness in international markets.  The lessons learned from these environments are also communicated to EU and national policymakers so  as to ensure that future policy initiatives are based on sound experience and solutions that are known to  work. This ‘bottom-up’ approach to defining EU policy is well illustrated by the pan-European  Cybersecurity Exercise in which all EU Member States participate.  Achieving Results by Leveraging the Stakeholder Community  ENISA believes strongly that the people best positioned to solve the security issues facing its stakeholder  communities are the communities themselves. For this reason, every ENISA project is carried out in close  collaboration with representatives of the appropriate stakeholder community. ENISA’s results are  therefore produced ‘by the community, for the community’. Such an approach is inherently scalable and  ensures a high degree of buy-in by those concerned.  Creating European Solutions to Enable EU Industry  The role of ENISA is to guide experts towards security solutions that are adapted to the needs of the  internal market. By encouraging strong cooperation across national borders and across communities, the  Agency promotes the development of approaches to security that are not hampered by national  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  12  restrictions or the ideas of particular communities. This results in solutions that are interoperable across  the EU, thereby decreasing costs and enabling EU industry to benefit from a wider market.  Using Security to Strengthen Privacy  In addition to supporting EU industry, ENISA plays a unique role in supporting fundamental human rights  through appropriate implementation of security techniques.  In recent years the Agency has been active in the area of privacy and Data Protection and we are well  positioned to offer guidance on suitable implementation measures for implementing the General Data  Protection Legislation. By concentrating on implementation measures, the Agency will complement the  significant work that has gone into defining the legal framework.  Bridging Public and Private Sectors  One of the key roles of ENISA is to stimulate an active dialogue on cybersecurity between the public and  private sectors and to ensure that this dialogue results in concrete action plans and ultimately impact in  the form of improved cybersecurity practices.  ENISA achieves this through a variety of mechanisms, including support for public private partnerships,  collaboration with standardisation and certification bodies, liaison with research communities and  consultation of specialist groups (consumer protection, human rights, etc.).  Acting as a neutral third party with a mandate to improve EU cybersecurity, we are uniquely positioned to  bring groups with differing interests together in order to define mutually beneficial solutions.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  13  1. Section I — General Context  The ENISA Threat Landscape for 2015 drew a number of interesting conclusions regarding the evolution of  the threat environment.  Cyber-threats have undergone significant evolution and breaches have increasingly covered front pages of  media. Cyber-threat agents have had the time and resources to implement a series of advancements in  malicious practices. In particular:   performing persistent attacks based on hardware, far below the ‘radar’ of available defence tools and  methods;   achieving enhancements in the provision of ‘cyber-crime-as-a-service’, tool developments for non- experts and affiliate programmes;   highly efficient development of malware weaponisation and automated tools to detect and exploit  vulnerabilities;   campaigning with highly profitable malicious infrastructures and malware to breach data and hold end- user devices to ransom;   broadening of the attack surface to include routers, firmware and internet of things.  Where mitigation efforts are concerned, improvements have been achieved in coordinated campaigns to  disturb operations of malicious infrastructures, strengthen the legal/governmental cyber-defence  framework and develop more efficient products. In particular:   performing orchestrated actions to take down malicious infrastructure but also to analyse incidents  and improve attribution;   strengthening governmental awareness, cyber-defence expenses, capabilities and level of cooperation  among states;   performing exercises, development of threat intelligence, proliferation of information sharing, tools  and products to enhance awareness, preparedness and efficiency of defence;   focusing on research and development to accommodate developments of the cyber-threat landscape  to existing protection measures and methods and tools.  These are qualities that have been consistently developed throughout 2015 and have reached a  momentum that allows for a persistent course of action.  The report notes that threat intelligence collection, management and sharing should become an inherent  part of the national cybersecurity capabilities. In order to achieve this, policymakers should encourage  voluntary reporting and perform analysis of reported incidents, recycling results for better planning.  Finally, cyber-threat knowledge should be disseminated to all players in cyber-space, including end-users.  Businesses need to continuously adapt protection and detection tools to the threats. They should also  strive to simplify the content of threat intelligence to achieve wider uptake in the stakeholder community.  Threat agent models need to be improved and become an inherent part of threat intelligence.  Looking further ahead, research projects should develop applied statistic models to increase comparability  of cyber-threat and incident information. Similarly, we need new models for security controls to be  included in complex, smart end-user environments. The fact that the Internet of Things (IoT) is actively  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  14  being rolled out means that developing trust models for the ad hoc interoperability of devices within smart  environments now becomes a priority.  Finally, regarding the overall highlights for the future cyber-threat landscapes, two overarching trends for  defenders and adversaries respectively have been identified.  — The need for ‘Streamlining and consolidation’ of existing policies, defences and cooperation to  accommodate changes in threat landscape and  — Ongoing activities towards ‘Consumerisation of cyber-crime’, that is, making malicious tools available  to everybody.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  15  2. Section II — Multi-annual programming 2017-2019  Multi-annual objectives  The multiannual objectives of the Agencies are derived from the ENISA regulation and are part of ENISA  strategy. The objectives of the Agency are structured around five activities, presented in more detail in  section 2.2., and referred throughout the document with the following suggestive names: expertise, policy,  capacity, community and enabling.  The following sections provide a high-level, multi-annual planning for each of these objectives thereby  providing a basis for the definition of future work programmes of the Agency.  In section 2.3. a summary of indicators and targets is presented, providing the mechanisms to quantify the  progress and the achievements of the Agency.  Multi-annual programme  This section reflects the long term core priority objectives for the Agency and presents them in a  structured and concise manner following the structure of the ENISA strategy.  The ENISA strategy was built with the aim to support ENISA’s Executive Director and Management Board in  the elaboration and adoption of consistent multiannual and annual work programmes (1). This strategy  defines five strategic objectives that will form the basis of future multi-annual plans (2).  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA regulation, inputs from the Member States and  relevant communities, including the private sector. These objectives state that ENISA, in cooperation and  in support to the Member States and the Union institutions, will:  #Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the evolutions of the digital environment.  #Policy. Promote network and information security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the European  Union institutions and Member States in developing and implementing EU policies and law related to  NIS.  #Capacity. Support Europe maintaining state-of-the-art network and information security capacities,  by assisting the Member States and European bodies in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community. Foster the emerging European network and information security community, by  reinforcing cooperation at EU level among Member States, European Union bodies and relevant NIS  stakeholders, including the private sector.  #Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving the management of its resources and engaging more  efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member States and Union Institutions, as well as at  international level.  (1) Annual and multiannual work programmes (Article 5 §2 of ENISA regulation).  (2) In order to achieve the 5 year strategic objectives laid out in this document, the multiannual work programme will provide prioritised mid-term  operational objectives to be achieved by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Annual concrete activities (outputs) will be ident ified in the annual work  programmes, according to a recursive approach in order to achieve the mid-term operational objectives and in the long term the strategic objectives.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  16  2.2.1 Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network and  information security challenges  In order to achieve this objective, ENISA will collate, analyse and make available information on global  cyber issues with a view to developing insights on issues of high added-value for the EU. In this analysis,  ENISA will cover both existing as well as new technologies and their integration, such as smart  infrastructures, Internet of Things, Cloud and Big Data and evaluate their impact on NIS and related  challenges such as NIS aspects of data protection.  To that end, ENISA will bring together Member States relevant stakeholders, such as industry, providers of  electronic communications networks or services available to the public, consumer groups, academic  experts in network and information security, and representatives of national regulatory authorities related  to NIS in order to discuss and explore NIS problems and challenges that they have encountered.  By compiling, comparing and evaluating these experiences alongside publicly available data, ENISA will  help to anticipate future risks and threats and identify those technologies and services that pose specific  security challenges in particular with regard to critical infrastructures, businesses at large and citizen’s  private data.  In response to this, the agency will develop and disseminate best practices which can be used to inform  across a number of different horizontal fields including research and development, innovation,  standardisation, IT Security certification and other relevant industrial practices.  This activity has four main objectives:   Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to Critical Information Infrastructures   Under this objective, the Agency carries out work designed to improve the expertise related to CII.   Objective 1.2. NIS Threats Landscape and Analysis   The objective here is to support NIS community by providing NIS threat analysis as well as to  provide analysis reports linked to the activities carried out by the Agency in collection of incidents.   Objective 1.3. Research and Development, Innovation   The objective of this work is to assist in bridging the gap between research, innovation and  deployment in the area of NIS as well as to provide ideas for future research that could contribute  to better NIS.   Objective 1.4. Response to Article 14 requests under Expertise activity   Under this Objective, the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests.  2.2.2 Activity 2 — Policy. Promote network and information security an EU policy priority  In order to achieve this objective, ENISA will assist and advise the Union institutions and the Member States  in developing and implementing EU policies, guidance and law on all matters relating to NIS.  Building upon its expertise gathered while achieving objective 1, ENISA will assist and advise the Union  institutions and the Member States in:   developing European NIS related policies and laws. To this end, ENISA will proactively engage with  Union institutions, and in particular all relevant directorate-generals of the European Commission,  in order to advise, including by providing preparatory work, advice and analyses relating to the  development and update of Union NIS policy and law.  In cooperation with the Member States, in particular as part of the work of the Cooperation group  established under the NIS directive, as well as with other relevant public and private stakeholders,  ENISA will promote a vision on how to significantly strengthen NIS across the EU, using adequate  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  17  EU policy levers. ENISA will, in particular, promote the inclusion of NIS aspects within policies  including — directly or indirectly — a digital dimension. ENISA will also actively contribute to the  reinforcement of NIS as a driver of the DSM and more generally of economic growth in Europe,  including the development of NIS and related ICT industries in Europe;   implementing, at EU level, NIS related policies and law, following their adoption. While ENISA,  focusing in particular on the implementation of the NIS directive, will support cooperation among  Member States regarding EU policies and law including a NIS dimension in order to foster  consistent EU-wide approach to their implementation. ENISA will bring together Member States  and other relevant public and private stakeholders, and will seek to produce recommendations  taking into account their needs and constraints (national, sectorial) (3).  Activities carried out under this objective are grouped in three main areas/sub-objectives.   Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy development.   This objective covers developing European NIS related policies and laws.   Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy implementation   This objective covers all the activities linked to implementing, at EU level, NIS related policies and  law, following their adoption.   Objective 2.3. Response to Article 14 requests under Policy activity   Under this Objective, the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests.  2.2.3 Activity 3 — Capacity. Support Europe in maintaining state-of-the-art network and information  security capacities  In order to achieve this objective, ENISA will assist the Member States and the Union institutions in  reinforcing their NIS capacities.  ENISA will support capacity building across the Union to make national public and private sectors and the  Union institutions’ networks more resilient and secure. This will involve working closely with Member States  and liaising, in cooperation with them, with various different stakeholders across the Union to develop skills  and competencies in the field of NIS.  ENISA will focus its effort on the following actors.   Member States: ENISA will support the development of Member States’ national NIS capabilities by  providing recommendations on key dimensions of NIS capacity building and will focus in priority on  those highlighted in the NIS directive, including on the development and efficient functioning of  National/Governmental CSIRTs and policy level collaboration between national competent authorities  in the framework of the Cooperation Group, the development of national strategies, the establishment  of necessary national frameworks to aid implementation of national incident reporting schemes and  on training to improve skills. ENISA will as well offer, upon their request, direct to support to single  Member States (4). To that end, the Agency will develop proactive relationships with Governments  across the EU.   Private sector: ENISA will support Member States to engage with private sector on their NIS,  encouraging companies to take a whole-business approach to cyber threats from the top of the board  (3) This objective should not be confused with ENISA’s support provided to single Member States requesting assistance pursuant to Article 14 of ENISA  Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 in implementing EU regulations’ specific provisions at national level, as part of objective 3 regarding ENISA’s support to  capacity building.  (4) Article 14 of ENISA Regulation (EU) No 526/2013.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  18  down. ENISA will also work with private sector stakeholders to help improve cyber security of  networks within companies.   Union institutions: in close coordination with the Union institutions, ENISA will support them in  reinforcing and coordinating their NIS capabilities and to that end, will establish a close and sustainable  partnership with CERT-EU. As part of this mission, ENISA will advise on key orientations and, upon  request, on actions to be implemented in order to achieve a high level of NIS across all Union  institutions. ENISA will, also, produce with CERT-EU information notes on threats and risks with a view  to making the EUIs and agencies more secure. ENISA will, whenever this is adequate, build on  experience gained by CERT-EU and the Union institutions to contribute to the broader EU NIS  community.   Citizens: alongside Member States, ENISA will help EU citizens to gain essential cyber security  knowledge and skills to help protect their digital lives. This will include promoting an annual European  Cyber Security month and working with the Member States delivering projects like the Cyber Security  Challenge as well as national initiatives, upon request from a Member State.  While aiming at supporting different types of actors, ENISA will take into account the transversal aspects of  NIS capacity building such as activities supporting the increase of the number of NIS experts in Europe (e.g.  academic training) and the spread of basic cyber hygiene in public and private organisations as well as in the  general public.  To achieve this, the activities covering capacity building are structured in five objectives, targeting the above  mentioned four main actors.   Objective 3.1. Assist Member States’ capacity building   Under this objective, ENISA will support the development of Member States’ national NIS  capabilities.   Objective 3.2. Support EU institutions’ capacity building   This objective covers all activities that ENISA will carry in close cooperation with the Union  institutions to support them in reinforcing their NIS capabilities.   Objective 3.3. Assist private sector capacity building   ENISA will work with private sector stakeholders, supporting Member States to help improve cyber  security of networks and information.   Objective 3.4. Assist in improving general awareness   This objective covers the activities addressed to EU citizens built together with EU institutions and  MS, such as promoting an annual European Cyber Security month and working with the Member  States delivering projects like the Cyber Security Challenge.   Objective 3.5. Response to Article 14 requests under Capacity activity   Under this Objective the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests. ENISA will offer,  upon request, direct support to single Member States and to EU institutions.  2.2.4 Activity 4 — Community. Foster the emerging European Network and Information Security  Community  Beyond its support to the development and the implementation of EU NIS related policies (Activity 2) and  to Member States and Union institutions towards the development of their NIS capabilities (Activity 3),  ENISA will actively support cooperation at EU level on NIS.  ENISA will in particular seek to support in priority:  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  19   CSIRT cooperation among the Member States, by supporting voluntary cooperation among Member  States CSIRTs, within the CSIRT network established by the NIS directive. As part of this activity, ENISA  will provide the secretariat of this network and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to  improve cooperation among CSIRTs and supporting this cooperation, including by developing and  providing guidance on best practices in the area of operational community efforts, such as on  information exchange.   Cyber crisis cooperation among Member States, by continuing to support the organisation of the Cyber  Europe exercises which shall remain one of ENISA’s key priority activities, while ensuring adequate  synergies with the CSIRT network.   Dialogue among NIS related communities, including between CSIRTs and law enforcement and data  privacy communities, in order to support consistent EU-wide approach to NIS. To that end, ENISA will  continue to interact with Europol (EC3).   Dialogue among public and private sectors on relevant NIS issues of European general interest, in  particular with a view to contribute to the objectives of the Digital Single Market, such as stimulating  the development and the competitiveness of NIS and ICT related industries and services in Europe.  In order to achieve this, ENISA will enhance cooperation at EU level among Member States, Union  institutions and related NIS stakeholders, including the private sector and will focus on three objectives.   Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation.   ENISA will rely upon its expertise developed within the framework of the organisation of the Cyber  Europe exercises that it will continue to develop and which shall remain one of ENISA’s key priority  activities.   Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building.   In line with the proposed NIS directive, ENISA will support the cooperation among CSIRTs, within  an EU Member States CSIRTs network, subject to its establishment. As part of this activity, ENISA  will provide the secretariat of this network and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways  to improve cooperation among CSIRTs and supporting this cooperation, including by developing  and providing guidance on best practices in the area of operational community efforts, such as on  information exchange.   Furthermore, the agency will contribute to the dialogue among NIS related communities, including  between CSIRTs and law enforcement and data privacy communities, in order to support  consistent EU-wide approach to NIS.   Objective 4.3. Response to Article 14 requests under Community activity   Under this Objective, the Agency will perform tasks following Article 14 Requests linked to the  previous two objectives.  2.2.5 Activity 5 — Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact  This activity aims to improve coordination of the Agency’s activities and to improve the cooperation with  Agency’s relevant stakeholders.  In order to achieve this horizontal objective, ENISA will improve the management of its resources and  engage more efficiently with its stakeholders, including Member States and Union institutions, as well at  international level.   Objective 5.1. Management   The Agency will act according to the following key general principles and rules:  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  20   ENISA will ensure a responsible financial management of its resources. In the next 5 years,  ENISA will continue to improve processes for monitoring financial flows and expects to  maintain high commitment and payment rates.   ENISA will guarantee a high level of transparency regarding its internal processes and way of  working.   ENISA will increase and maintain internal IT-security expertise within the Core Operations  Department, with a view to lowering the need to rely upon external experts, in particular in  developing and maintaining a high level of expertise (objective 1 of the ENISA Regulation).   Objective 5.2. Engagement with stakeholders   ENISA will continue to improve the quality and effectiveness of its relations with Member States’  NIS competent authorities. ENISA will, in particular, make it easier for the national competent  authorities to engage with the Agency, while offering better visibility on its activities. To this end,  ENISA will define Standard Procedures regarding the principles and modalities of the participation  and consultation of national competent authorities and other NIS related communities as part of  its activities. It will also engage with the national competent authorities actively participating in the  work of Cooperation Group established by the NIS directive. ENISA will also establish an updated  list of its ongoing and future activities, including relevant contact and calendar information for  Member States and NIS communities to facilitate their engagement with ENISA.   ENISA will reinforce and structure its cooperation with all Union institutions, entities and bodies on  NIS related issues, in particular the European Commission, as well as CERT-EU on the NIS of the  Union institutions, and Europol (EC3) with regard to community building between national NIS and  law enforcement communities.   ENISA will continue to improve the quality and effectiveness of its relations with other relevant  stakeholders, such as NIS and ICT related industries and services, essential operators, providers of  electronic communications networks or services available to the public, consumer groups,  academic experts in network and information security.   While developing its expertise, ENISA will avoid duplicating existing work at National level and will  focus on issues of real-added value for Europe.   Objective 5.3. International activities   ENISA will act at international level according to EU and Member States’ external policies and  guiding principles to be defined and adopted by the MB. ENISA’s international relations should  primarily aim at supporting EU’s external policy initiatives including a cyber dimension and  promoting the EU and its NIS expertise outside its borders.   Objective 5.4. Compliance and support   The Agency will seek to comply with legal and financial requirements and provide Human  resources, Budget, IT infrastructure, etc. in line with the operational objectives.  Monitoring the Progress and the Achievements of the Agency. Summarising the  Key Indicators for the multi-annual activities  The Agency has started a process for improving the standing of its key indicators for the purpose of  measuring and reporting better and more accurately against its annual work programme, in line with the  prescribed Commission approach.  The purpose of key indicators for ENISA is to provide the metrics to measure against performance, results  and impact of the Agency’s outcome, output and impact. Key indicators seek to better support policy  dynamics on network and information security, an area of policy that largely still remains under  development at the EU level, as technology and business models evolve.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  21  The chosen approach initially sets the designated levels of key indicators; each type of indicator is grouped  alongside other similar ones at the appropriate level. This approach has been developed taking into  account the capability of the Agency to report, and the need to avoid any unnecessary burden on the  Agency. The Agency capability to report reflects, effort, organisational measures as well as tools available  or that can be obtained relatively easily. Measuring operational performance that concerns the policy  raison d’être of the Agency remains the focal point for the key indicators introduced. The key notions and  main vectors of annual and multi-annual measurements are presented hereunder:  Key indicators at ENISA seek to measure:   Performance that is a concern at the output level when deliverables are produced. Metrics used, are  project management-based and they include:  (a) adherence to the scope of the deliverable or project;  (b) budget (or financial resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed  levels with a ± 5 % margin;  (c) people (or human resources) available to the output or project, remaining within prescribed levels  with a ± 5 % margin;  (d) time available to carry out the output or project remaining within prescribed levels with a ± 5 %  margin;  (e) quality of performance depending on the type of output, according to the classification of output  in the work programme (being, publication, event, support).   Results that are a concern at the annual and at multi-annual activities’ level. The indicators used are as  follows:  (a) delivery indicator aiming at delivery of at least 95 % against work programme planning. This is  equivalent to a 3σ (3 Sigma) organisation (reaching between 93.3 % and 99.3 %); clearly the  Agency has historically proven its operational ability to deliver at much higher level, meeting 6σ (6  Sigma) specification requirements (at 99.99 %). However, allowing for a 3 Sigma level meets the  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  22  above-mentioned deviation rate of ± 5 % (5). The criteria used, being scope, budget, people, time  and quality, they all refer to the proper execution of the project leading up to the production of  output. This evaluation is done at the end of the project within ENISA;  (b) following the production process that leads up to an output, feedback from stakeholders is  collected on each output. Results are further aggregated on a multi-annual basis by the Agency.   Impact is measured at the Agency level only; it is based on feedback received from the evaluation of  the Agency’s performance (own initiatives and commissioned consulting at the Agency’s initiative)  and/or institutional third party evaluations such as those commissioned by the European Commission,  the European Court of Auditors etc.  The key indicators broken down at the output level, the activities level and the agency level, are presented  hereunder.  Key indicators in ENISA  Output level Activities level Agency level  Scope (e.g. Scope drift  as compared to  approved WP plan)  S Variable: TLR Deliverables  (number of  deliverables realised  against the WP plan)  D Numerical:  quantitative  target  Evaluation (results’  aggregates) Periodic  Agency evaluation e.g.  COM(2018), Ramboll etc.)  E Variable: TLR  Budget (e.g.  appropriations utilised  and staff engaged in a  project plus or minus  5 %)  B Variable: TLR Feedback (number  of positive and not  so positive  feedback) (*)  F Numerical:  quantitative  target  People (e.g. staff  engaged in a project  plus or minus 5 %)  P Variable: TLR Feedback aggregates  for multi-annual  performance (**)  Fa Numerical:  quantitative  target  Time (e.g. duration of  project plus or minus  5 %)  T Variable: TLR  (*) Feedback via e.g.  survey associated  with deliverables on  website  Quality (e.g. citations,  downloads, MS  participation etc.)  Q Integer:  quantitative  target  (**) Aggregations of  deliverables or  categories thereof  All rating indicators follow a variable Traffic Light Rating (TLR) system that is laid out as follows.   Green, that reflects 5 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance are appropriate and within  prescribed levels.   Yellow, that reflects 20 % deviation meaning that the planning/performance need to be revisited.   Red, which reflects deviation above 20 % meaning that the planning/performance need thorough  review.  (5) In a normal distribution σ (or sigma) denotes the distance between the mean value and the inflexion point. Shortening this distance is an indicator of  enhanced quality of performance. While a Six Sigma (or, 6σ) methodology is beyond the scope of the current version of the QMS of the Agency portions  thereof, are used in select areas, such as key indicators. In ENISA, the reference Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) hereto is the SOP PDCA (Plan-Do- Check-Act) that is a simplified version of the DMAIC (define-measure-analyse-improve-control) approach typically associated with Six Sigma. The choice  for simplicity is obviously desirable while the implementation of a quality system is an ongoing concern. Six Sigma focuses o n process control for the  purpose of reducing or eliminating waste. Six Sigma utilises historical data along with statistical analysis to measure and improve a company’s operational  performance e.g. processes, practices, and support systems. Six Sigma is a measure of process quality the variation of which is measured in six standard  deviations from the mean.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  23  Feedback is collected by means of surveys. It is envisaged that the deliverables part of the website will be  leveraged to channel targeted feedback against each deliverable downloaded. This is a task, however, that  will be made available as from 2018, at the earliest.  Below follows an example of output related indicators to be collected concerning the key types of Agency  output, being Publication, Event, Support types of output.  #  KPI Description Output type (P) * Output type (E) ** Output type (S) ***  1 S Defined in the planning phase and  confirmed throughout delivery  Scope in start remains identical to scope in the end  2 B Budget remains within ± 5 % of  designated budget level to cover  requirements defined  Working group, external  supplier, experts etc.  Logistics, reimbursements  for speakers, catering,  communication etc.  Technical equipment,  services, communication,  market research etc.  3 P Staff allocated to remain within  ± 5 % of designated FTEs  REF: Matrix data  4 T Project duration to remain within  ± 5 % of planned time  REF: Matrix data  5 Q Any of the following quality  indicators as appropriate  Number of MS involved,  experts from MS  authorities, industry  representatives, R & D  etc., % population  (survey) etc.  Number of participants,  aggregation of feedback in  event survey etc.  Number of subscribers,  aggregation of feedback  of participants; feedback  of the policy principal (e.g.  COM/MS etc.)  * Publication e.g. methods for security and privacy cost analysis  ** Event e.g. WS on privacy and security  *** Support e.g. NIS portal  Below follows an example of outcome related indicators to be collected concerning the key types of  Agency activities, at the annual and at the multi-annual level.

Furthermore, the Work Programme is structured following the objectives and the priorities  of the Agency as described in the new ENISA strategy.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  24  The human and financial resources of past and current situation are presented in the Annexes of this  document.  2.4.2 Resource programming for the years 2017-2019  The distribution of budget and resources for 2017 for the activities A1 to A5 is presented in the chart  hereunder. The budget and resources for each activity are presented in section 3.7.2. in the summary  table. The budget and posts distribution is based on the Activity Based Budgeting (ABB) methodology of  the Agency detailed in 3.6.2. of this document.  Following the publication of the NIS directive (NISD), the Agency is re-allocating budget and resources to  the new tasks/activities provisioned for the Agency in the directive. Another area which will probably  require more budget/resources is the Cybersecurity Public Private partnership (cPPP). However, the impact  on the ENISA work programme has not yet been identified. This will be updated in future versions.  In addition, this version of the work programme takes account of the prioritisation exercise carried out  during the March meeting of the Ad Hoc group, although it is recognised that this prioritisation will need to  be fine-tuned by the full Management Board.  For years 2017-2019, the Agency will gradually increase the share of the activity 3, Capacity Building. The  aim is to achieve a better balance of the resource distribution between capacity building and policy  activities in the future, as policy is currently consuming more resources than capacity building.  The budget and resources allocations within the summary table and Annexes are in line with the COM  Multiannual Financial Framework (MAFF) 2014-2020.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  25  3. Section III — Work Programme Year 2017  The ENISA Work Programme for the year 2017 follows the structure presented in the multi-annual  programming Section II. In this section clear objectives, results and indicators are identified for each  activity.  The Activities presented in this section follow the structure of the ENISA strategy document. After a short  description of the activity the Objectives are presented. A short narrative is included, consisting of a  description and added value of the activity, the main challenges for 2017 and link to the multi-annual  objectives.  The main outputs/actions in the specific year, for this case for 2017, are listed within each Objective. For  each Objective, there are several Outputs defined.  For each Output, the following are included in this document:   A description of the specific actions and outcome which are expected to contribute to the achievement  of the objective,   The type of output (in summary table at the end of each Activity):   P: publication i.e. report, study, paper   E: event i.e. conference, workshop, seminar   S: support activity, involving assistance to or close collaboration with e.g. EU Institutions or Bodies  or Member States as appropriate, with reference to a specific activity that features defined and  shared objectives.   Key performance indicators tailored for the type of Output (in summary table at the end of each  Activity).   Resources and budget, in a summary table at the end of the section in aggregated form at activity  level.  For each Activity there is an Objective defined that covers the actions that the Agency is carrying to  respond to Article 14 requests. Article 14 requests, named after the Article 14 of the ENISA regulation,  allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or advice on specific  activities.  Activity 1 — Expertise. Anticipate and support Europe in facing emerging network  and information security challenges  This activity aims at developing and maintaining a high level of expertise of EU actors taking into account  evolutions in NIS.  It covers the baseline security requirements, the threat landscape and activities related to research,  development and innovation.  3.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the expertise related to Critical Information Infrastructures  The objective of the studies under this objective is to provide public and private stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CII) baseline security recommendations.  This objective will look at common requirements as well as focusing on sector specific areas of NIS  directive such as energy, health, transport, etc. as well as on baseline security recommendations for IoT in  the context of Critical Information Infrastructures.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  26  The baseline security recommendations will be based on existing national requirements, industry good  practices and widely used relevant standards (e.g. ISO, ETSI). The proposed outputs will be validated by the  relevant stakeholders  3.1.1.1 Output O.1.1.1 — Baseline Security Recommendations for the OES Sectors  ENISA will work closely with representatives from the Member States to identify a set of baseline security  requirements that are applicable to all Operators of Essential Services (OES) as defined in the NIS directive.  The Agency will identify and analyse existing security practices (e.g. BSI’s requirements) and standards (e.g.  ISO 27001, NIST’s CIIP Framework (6)) and compare them so as to identify the baseline security  recommendations.  In deriving such a set of ‘common’ baseline requirements, no account will be taken of sector-specific needs  as these are likely to introduce conflicting priorities (for example, the relative importance of availability  and integrity is likely to be different in the energy sector to the banking sector, where different risks  prevail).  However, the Agency will take note of such specific requirements as and when they are identified during  the analysis phase and will then map them to the needs and requirements of Operators of Essential  Services. This information can then be used a starting point for creating sector-specific baselines at a later  date.  The Agency will also compare and validate the results with other relevant approaches in the area of  Operators of Essential Services (e.g. EE-ISAC and ENTSO-E cyber security subgroup) and interact with all  important stakeholders from public as well as the private sector.  The proper validation of the proposed baseline security requirements by the private and public sector  would pave the way for a wide, de facto, tacit adoption of it, which could constitute the basis for EU  harmonisation.  3.1.1.2 Output O.1.1.2 — Baseline Security Recommendations for IoT in the context of Critical  Information Infrastructures  This study will develop baseline cyber security recommendations for Critical Information Infrastructure  asset owners who use the concept of IoT to provide their services.  The Agency will identify and analyse existing security practices and standards in the area of IoT security for  CII (e.g. Industry 4.0, M2M communications, SDN and 5G networks). ENISA will compare these practices  and standards and develop baseline security measures to be adopted by all relevant stakeholders.  The Agency will focus, among others, on IoT resilience and communication, interoperability with  proprietary systems, trustability of IoTs, and other. Special emphasis will be given to the privacy issues of  such smart infrastructure and services.  (6) https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  27  In this endeavour, the Agency will take into account and contribute to existing EU policy and regulatory  initiatives (the NIS directive, the Internet of Things — An action plan for Europe, The Alliance for the  Internet of Things (AIOTI) (7), the 5G Infrastructure Pubic Private Partnership (5G PPP) (8)).  The Agency will also validate the results of the study (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and  EU initiatives (e.g. AIOTI) and interact with all important IoT stakeholders from public sector such as  Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology, JRC, and from the private  sector including CII providers, integrators and manufacturers.  The proper validation of the proposed baseline security requirements by the private and public sector  would pave the way for a wide, de facto, tacit adoption of it which could constitute the basis for EU  harmonisation.  This work item builds on previous work of ENISA in the area of IoTs, intelligent Cars, Smart Cities, Smart  Hospitals and Smart Airports (WP 2015-2016).  3.1.2 Objective 1.2. NIS Threat Landscape and Analysis  The Objective NIS Threat landscape and Analysis has two parts.   The ENISA Threat Landscape focuses on a general analysis of the threat landscape   The NIS annual analysis reports, covers the analysis carried out by the Agency on the reported data  collected according to the legal requirements/mandate of the Agency.  NIS Threat Landscape  The ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL) report enjoys major attention both within Member States, Commission,  as well as expert and lay communities. This objective follows up on past achievements, to deliver an  overview of the cyber-threat landscape, along with a series of related information. This material is free of  technical details and seeks to be very comprehensive.  In 2017, ETL will be further developed to include more interactive elements both in the presentation as  well as the dissemination of related information. Hence, besides the availability of collected information  over the entire year, produced threat information will be presented more intuitively by using more  graphics.  The impact of ETL is varied: it is used as a consolidated summary of existing material in the area of cyber- threats; it provides strategic and tactical information that can be used within security management tasks;  it can be imported to risk management methods; it can be used as basis for building up threat intelligence;  and it can be used for training purposes; finally the ENISA collection and analysis process can be used by  other organisations to create their own threat landscapes.  3.1.2.1 Output O.1.2.1 — Annual ENISA Threat Landscape  This report will provide an overview of current threats and their consequences for emerging technology  areas. This report contains tactical and strategic information about cyber-threats. It also refers to threat  agents and attack vectors used. The produced report is based on an intensive information collection  (7) The Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation (AIOTI), more info available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things- innovation-aioti  (8) The 5G Infrastructure Pubic Private Partnership (5G PPP), more info available at: https://5g-ppp.eu/  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://5g-ppp.eu/  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  28  exercise, including annual incident reports, followed by analysis and consolidation of publicly available  information on cyber threats.  The ENISA ETL, provides information regarding reduction of threat exposure. This information will consist  of available controls that are appropriate in order to reduce the exposure and consequently mitigate the  resulting risks. In addition to the report, we will make available to the public all relevant material as this  has been collected during the year.  In carrying out this work, synergies with related experts (i.e. ENISA ETL Stakeholder Group) and vendors  will be implemented. We will invest in visualisation and quick availability of the resulting material.  In 2017, the ENISA Threat Landscape will be accompanied by an End-User application (web) that will  provide available information online. In this manner, ETL users will be in the position to access ENISA  threat information on a permanent basis. This platform may be used for integration of additional relevant  information.  In 2017, ENISA will continue the cooperation with CERT-EU in the area of Threat Landscaping. This effort  will be carried out by means of information exchanges, use of CERT-EU services and organisation of  common meetings/events.  Annual Incident Analysis Reports  ENISA is mandated by Article 13a of the Telecom Framework directive and Article 19 of the eIDAS  Regulation to collect reports from competent authorities in the area of telecom operators and trust service  providers respectively. The Agency analyses the reports and produces useful insights.  Reports on annual incidents are useful tools for providing stakeholders with insights on security incidents  that have had significant impact. Based on the analysis the Agency draws lessons learned, identifies  security trends and good practices and assesses root causes. Furthermore, the reports provide a consistent  and factual aggregate analysis of incidents for policymakers, the public and the industry, describing overall  frequency and impact of ICT security incidents across the EU.  3.1.2.2 Output O.1.2.2 — Annual Incident Analysis Report for the Telecom sector (article 13a)  This report provides an aggregated analysis of the major cyber security and network integrity incidents  affecting the European electronic communications’ sector in 2016.  According to Article 13a of the Telecom Framework directive ENISA shall collect from National Regulatory  Authorities (NRAs) incidents of significant impact. The Agency has developed over the years, together with  NRAs, the process to follow and the reporting modalities (e.g. parameters, thresholds, etc.).  The Agency analyses the reported incidents and then identifies trends, lessons learned and good practices.  All these are part of an Annual Incident Analysis Report.  3.1.2.3 Output O.1.2.3 — Annual Incident Analysis Report for Trust Service Providers (article 19)  This report provides an aggregated analysis of the major cyber security incidents affected Trust Service  Providers in 2016.  According to Article 19 of the Electronic Identification and Trust Services (eIDAS) Regulation, once per year  the National Supervisory Bodies (SBs) should notify ENISA about the security breaches or loss of integrity  of the trusted services and on the personal data contained therein.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  29  ENISA collects from SBs the annual reports about the reported incidents. The Agency analyses the reported  incidents and then identifies trends, lessons learned and good practices for protecting trust service  providers from such incidents.  3.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and Development, Innovation  The actions presented in this Objective are structured in two dimensions. The first dimension covers the  ICT standardisation in the EU and aims to assess the existing needs and gaps in the field. The second  dimension has as goals to identify research priorities from NIS perspective and from the EU perspective  and to use such priorities in collaboration with EU Commission in funding programmes.  3.1.3.1 Output O.1.3.1 — Guidelines for the European standardisation in the field of ICT security  This activity will provide an assessment of the situation of European standardisation in the area of ICT  security, taking into account the new requirements and priorities associated with the NIS directive (and  potentially the Commission’s communication on cPPP). It will analyse the gaps and provide guidelines for,  in particular, the development of standards, facilitation of the adoption of standards and governance of EU  standardisation in the area of ICT security.  In carrying out this work, ENISA will consult with industry and standards organisations (e.g. ETSI, CEN,  CENELEC) as appropriate.  3.1.3.2 Output O.1.3.2 — Priorities for EU Research and Development  This study will provide an analysis of areas covered by the NIS directive, the General Data Protection  Regulation and the COM decision on cPPP and will aim to show where R & D activities funded in the  context of H2020, CEF (Connecting Europe Facility), TRANSITS and GEANT would achieve the greatest  impact.  ENISA will work closely with ECSO (European Cyber Security Organisation) and cPPP on cybersecurity in  order to align the work being carried with the ENISA Work Programme. In addition, the agency will offer  support to NAPARC (National Public Authority Representatives Committee) by offering a secretariat  function.  ENISA will look into adapting the current best practices and guidelines for protecting EU systems and  networks according to the evolving threats. As well as building specific used cases that can be adopted by  the IT Security community.  3.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response to Article 14 Requests under Expertise Activity  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities. Under this Objective, the Agency will address all the requests related to the  area of Expertise.  3.1.4.1 Output O.1.4.1 — Response to Requests under Expertise Activity  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.  Although, by definition, it is not possible to accurately estimate the exact number or the output and  outcome of these requests for 2017, the allocated resources are indicated in the Summary Section at the  end.

Promote network and information security as an EU policy  priority  In this activity ENISA supports the EU policy development and EU policy implementation in a number of  important areas.  3.2.1 Objective 2.1. Supporting EU policy development.  ENISA will continue to provide the Commission and the MS with high quality information, data and advice  to support policymaking having an EU dimension.  In the policy development area the Agency will cooperate with public and private stakeholders to develop  insights, consolidate views and provide recommendations in areas where the EU take action to further  develop its policy. Examples include Certification and DSM.  ENISA, using its knowledge and expertise in this area, will liaise with the Commission and all relevant EU  Member States to identify and analyse current eHealth cyber security challenges. Through discussion with  the competent experts from public and private sector the Agency will identify the key elements of  comprehensive national approach to eHealth cyber security in order to meet the requirements of Article 7  of the NIS directive, whilst still allowing the sector to make appropriate use of new technologies. ENISA will  validate its findings via a workshop with all competent authorities.  3.2.1.1 Output O.2.1.1 — Support the policy discussions in the area of IT security certification  Taking due account of recent legislative and policy developments, such as the adoption of the NIS directive  and the publication of the Commission position on the cPPP, the Agency will continue to support the  Commission and the Member States in identifying a certification framework for ICT security products and  services which on one hand will boost competition and on the other promote mutual recognition or  harmonisation of certification practices up to a certain level. Any planned activity in the area of IT security  certification will respect existing national efforts and interests.  ENISA will bring together standardisation organisations (ETSI, IEC, etc.), ICT certification stakeholders (test  labs, certification and accreditation bodies, SOG-IS, CCRA, etc.) as well as ICT security product users  (ESMIG, Eurosmart, etc.) as a means to enhance the dialogue around security certification and build upon  existing results these initiatives have developed in the past.  Issues to be considered mapping the existing European situation in certification, possible steps to take at  EU level, how to speed up the development of secure European ICT infrastructures and services and the  policy impact of certification.  3.2.1.2 Output O.2.1.2 — Restricted. Towards a Digital Single Market for high quality NIS products  and services  ENISA will continue supporting the Commission in the development of the Digital Single Market (DSM) in  Europe from the NIS perspective.  The Agency, building upon its previous work on DSM (WP 2016) and on Commission’s studies on the  matter, will identify two market segments where the EU could potentially develop a significant  cybersecurity commercial approach. This will be supported by an analysis of why the EU is well positioned  to develop these areas and recommendations for further development.  To achieve this the Agency will liaise with the Commission, EU MS, and relevant public and private sector  organisations in order to collect critical input and insights on the matter. The analysis will reveal lessons  learned, success stories and good practices to be used for other sectors in the context of DSM.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  32  The report will include strategic recommendations to the stakeholders and it is envisaged to be used for  inspiration by other sectors. In this endeavour, ENISA will engage appropriate public and private  stakeholders in the analysis and validation of the results.  3.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting EU policy implementation  Objective 2.2 covering policy implementation is structured around four main topics:   contribute to EU policy in the area of e Communications;   support for the implementation of the eIDAS regulation;   support addressing the area of privacy and data protection linked to upcoming data protection  regulation;   support the implementation guidelines for the Implementation of Mandatory Incident Reporting in the  context of the NIS directive.  In the policy implementation area the Agency will cooperate with competent authorities and private  stakeholders to implement existing policies of the EU. Emphasis is given on harmonisation and soft-law  outcomes that would allow public and private sector to efficiently implement the EU policies. Examples  include NIS directive, Telecom Package, eIDAS, Privacy and Data Protection.  3.2.2.1 Output O.2.2.1 — Contribute to EU policy in the area of electronic communications sector  The Agency will continue its cooperation with the eCommunication sector developed over the years (WP  2010-2016).  The Agency will liaise with NRAs for the harmonised implementation of Article 13a (incident reporting,  baseline security requirements, root causes, trusted information sharing). It will also collaborate with  BEREC and Commission on the new NIS provisions to be considered in the update of the new Telecom  Package directive as well as the Universal Services directive (9). eCom providers and internet infrastructure  providers will be consulted on lessons learnt from incidents, sharing of experiences and good practices and  on policy implementation matters.  ENISA will liaise with the 5G PPP Working Group on Network Management and Security and will jointly  organise a workshop to identify common areas of interest and further develop the area of 5G and  SDN/NFV security matters. Cooperation will also be sought with the NFV Industry Specification of ETSI  which is also active in network virtualisation security and it has recently established a relevant Working  Group (NFV ISG Security Working Group).  Following the relevant ENISA’s work in 2016, the Agency will continue supporting the European  Commission (Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology) in the revision  and implementation of the Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy directive). In particular, ENISA will act as  technical advisor of the EC regarding security of personal data and confidentiality of communications in  the electronic communications sector. To this end, ENISA will produce where necessary relevant working  papers and technical reports, as well as support the EC in relevant ad hoc initiatives, upon request.  3.2.2.2 Output O.2.2.2 — Develop guidelines for the implementation of mandatory incident reporting  ENISA, building on its experience on mandatory incident reporting schemes and the work done by the  Cooperation Group and the CSIRT network being established by the NIS directive, will assist MS and  (9) Universal Service Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users’ rights relating to  electronic communications networks and services as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC (Citizen rights’ Directive) and Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, in  consolidated version available at: ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/22/2016-04-30  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2002/22/2016-04-30  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  33  industry in developing guidelines on implementing mandatory incident reporting mechanisms. This activity  will be driven by the context of the NIS directive.  The Agency will assist EU Member States, relevant private sector and EU Commission to properly  implement the incident reporting obligation defined in the NIS directive. This work builds on ENISA’s work  on the matters in the area of eCommunication providers (WP 2012-WP 2016), in the area of Trust Service  Providers (WP 2015-WP2016) and in the area of NIS directive (WP 2016).  ENISA will identify experts from all relevant public and private sectors and engage them in the process in  order to develop and validate the appropriate guidelines. Using its experience and knowledge in incident  reporting in different contexts ENISA will develop a simple and practical framework for reporting incidents  in these sectors (e.g. who reports, what is reported, how it is reported, when it is reported, etc.).  The proposed approach will extensively be validated with numerous relevant stakeholders. ENISA will do  its utmost to achieve consistency and harmonisation among the different implementation approaches  across sectors. Emphasis will be given on applying similar approaches, concepts, frameworks, good  practices, recommendations, parameters and/or thresholds per sector. By doing this ENISA will develop an  easy, consistent and affordable implementation scheme to be deployed by different sectors. Such schemes  would allow the proper analysis of reported incidents and pave the way for a consistent analysis across  sectors.  3.2.2.3 Output O.2.2.3 — Recommendations supporting implementation of the eIDAS Regulation  ENISA will continue its work on supporting public and private bodies in implementing the eIDAS Regulation  by addressing technological aspects and building blocks for trust services. The aspects to be covered will be  agreed with the EC and MS through the eIDAS experts group. Based on 2016 report on appropriate  technological protection measures to preserve privacy and trust, the implementation guidelines will address  specific technological measures and approaches and will be validated through coordinating eIDAS technical  subgroups.  Upon request by EU MS and/or the Commission and within a given context, ENISA will update previously  published reports in this area of work depending on the progress of the state-of-the-art.  Furthermore, ENISA will develop a set of recommendations for the trust service providers and their  customers. The choice of specific areas to be covered will be agreed with the relevant stakeholders, such  as the TSPs, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory authorities according to eIDAS regulation.  These recommendations will complement the existing knowledge base that ENISA created for the trust  service providers.  3.2.2.4 Output O.2.2.4 — Recommendations for technical implementations of the General Data  Protection Regulation  This study will provide best practises and specific recommendations for the technical implementation of  aspects related to the protection of personal data in the context of the provisions of the General Data  Protection Regulation. It will provide a set of recommendations that will provide data controllers and data  processors support on selecting and implementing applicable methodological procedures for  implementing aspects such as consent, right to erasure, data portability, data breaches, accountability,  anonymisation vs pseudonymisation, etc.  Upon request by EU MS and/or the Commission and within a given context, ENISA will perform studies  relevant to the implementation of the GDPR at EU MS level.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  34  3.2.2.5 Output O.2.2.5 — Privacy enhancing technologies  This activity aims to continue the Agency’s work in the field of privacy. More specifically, ENISA will  continue on practical guidelines to implement privacy and data protection by design and default. In 2014,  the work focused on a definition of the terms and in 2015 and 2016 the focus was in providing the  methodology to access the maturity of the current available techniques. Together with the Agency’s  partners in 2017 the Agency will continue this work by a community building effort that aims to create and  maintain a repository of best available techniques for Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). In 2016, the  Agency developed a community tool that allows to evaluate new techniques and keep lists of best  available techniques up to date. In 2017, this tool will undergo a field test. This field test will be used to  test the techniques practically and to extend their functionalities. The Agency will contribute to tools and  techniques that allow to evaluate new techniques and keep lists of best available techniques up to date.  The Annual Privacy Forum (APF) will be used to gather the key communities and to disseminate the work in  this area to the respective communities in industry and policymaking.  3.2.2.6 Output O.2.2.6 — Supporting the Implementation of the NIS directive  ENISA will support the Commission, Member States and the private sector in the implementation of the  NIS directive. This output mainly covers ENISA’s contribution to the cooperation group and especially the  development of good practices for identification of OES (criteria). Also, in this output ENISA will also  further develop its cooperation with operators of essential services in order to better understand their  sectorial needs and requirements.  More specifically ENISA will contribute to the establishment of the Cooperation Group and provide  suggestions on its functioning. The Agency, upon request, can analyse specific issues identified by the  cooperation group and develop recommendations and suggestions that would allow Commission and  Member States to take informed decision on NIS matters.  The Agency will leverage its expertise and good practices, among others, on Critical Information  Infrastructures, National Cyber Security Strategies, CSIRTs, baseline security requirements in numerous  sectors (energy, transport, finance etc.), standardisation, ICT certification and others to contribute to the  work of the cooperation group. That would be by reusing or customising existing results or by developing  new, specific results meeting the needs and requirements of the Cooperation group.  Also, ENISA will take stock of Member States current efforts to define criteria for the identification of OES.  Through this stock taking and analysis ENISA will identify common approaches, schemes and good  practices. The Agency will then validate them with relevant public and private sector to makes sure that  they meet the needs and requirements of both MS and private sector. Such good practices can be used, as  much as possible, by MS when defining, at national scheme, their criteria for the identification of OES.  Finally ENISA, using its knowledge and expertise in the area of OES, will liaise with the Commission and all  relevant EU Member States to identify and analyse current cyber security challenges, and then develop  good practices at sectorial level that could enhance the security of OES. ENISA will focus its efforts mostly  on energy, health, finance and transportation. The Agency will validate its findings via a workshop with all  competent authorities.  3.2.3 Objective 2.3.

Upon request, support the assessment of existing  policies/procedures/practices on NIS within EU institutions  At the request and/or in agreement with the Commission, ENISA will assess the impact of specific policies,  procedures and practices on NIS within EU institutions and compare those against national and/or other  international experiences. ENISA will then engage the key players in a dialog to discuss its findings and  propose recommendations and good practices in a form of a small position paper.  3.3.2.3 Output O.3.2.3 — Representation of ENISA on the Management Board of CERT EU and  representation of the EU Agencies using the CERT EU services  In 2017, the operations of CERT EU were put on a formal Legal basis by way of a draft Arrangement  between a number of EU Institutions. A MB has been created to supervise the activities of CERT EU. A  number of EU Bodies and Institutions are represented on the MB. A place for ENISA was also created on  the MB with the function of representing ENISA and the EU Agencies that use the services of CERT EU.  In this context ENISA will participate in the MB of CERT EU and will also liaise with the EU Agencies on  operational issues related to CERT EU’s activities in order to ensure that the viewpoints of the Agencies are  adequately represented. ENISA will also report in to the CERT EU MB on the evolution of Services required  by the Agencies.  3.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist private sector capacity building  The private sector is a highly relevant sector where the Agency supports capacity building. During 2017,  the aim is to extend the work on cybersecurity culture, cyber hygiene and to start an action related to  liability and insurance.  3.3.3.1 Output O.3.3.1 — Cybersecurity culture: from identifying the issues to providing working  scenarios for management level  The management level is an essential environment for most decisions with impact in NIS — Network and  Information Security. The understanding of the issues at stake by senior managers impact the mitigation  actions to be approved, or allocations of budgets, or development of new business sectors etc. With this  output we propose to give practical advice in terms of identifying the most common issues to what the real  life scenario may look like for the management level.  3.3.3.2 Output O.3.3.2 — Recommendations on Cyber Insurance  Cyber insurance might prove a good incentive for businesses to invest in information security. To  investigate its potential, ENISA will take stock of existing public and private approaches to cyber insurance  and identify the lessons learned and good practices in use from the deployment of cyber insurances (e.g.  liability issues, proper policy calculation, asset cost, cost of breaches) mostly in the area of pre-policy stage.  In this task, the deliverables produced by other, well appreciated institutions (e.g. OECD, European FI-ISAC)  should be taken into account.  ENISA will analyse the findings and issue recommendations for targeted stakeholders. In this context, the  Agency will create and maintain a small expert group that would provide guideline and validate the results  of the study together with other relevant stakeholders from the public and private sector.  This work will build upon ENISA’s previous work on cyber insurance (WP 2012).  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  39  3.3.4 Objective 3.4.

Response to Article 14 Requests under Capacity Activity  Output O.3.5.1. — Response to  Requests under Capacity  Activity  S: Answers to requests  Activity 4 — Community. Foster the emerging European network and information  security community  In order to achieve this scope, ENISA will enhance cooperation at EU level among Member States, Union  institutions and related NIS stakeholders, including private sector and will focus on two main objectives:  Cyber Crisis cooperation and CSIRT and other NIS community building.  3.4.1 Objective 4.1. Cyber crisis cooperation  ENISA will continue to support the operational communities and CSIRTs in their cyber crisis cooperation  development activities. The organisation and evaluation of pan European cyber exercises will continue to  have a central role in this support. In addition, ENISA will monitor closely the implementation of action  points from previous exercises. In this context, the Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) will be maintained and  enhanced with more content to help the exercising of operational security communities. CEP will be  offered by the Agency upon request to interested stakeholders as a cyber exercise cloud service. The  training portfolio of the Agency in cyber crisis management will be expanded and made available online in  CEP.  Furthermore, ENISA will continue to support the development of standard cooperation procedures for the  EU-level operational security networks and take on any responsibilities assigned to it in relation to the core  service platform (CSP) developed in the context of the Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF) programme.  3.4.1.1 Output O.4.1.1 — Evaluation of Cyber Europe 2016 and Report on Exercise after Action  Activities from 2014-2016  In 2016, ENISA organised the fourth pan European cyber crisis exercise, Cyber Europe 2016 (CE2016)  The pan European exercises organised by ENISA are producing a number of significant recommendations  and actions for all involved stakeholders. It is extremely important to ensure the follow up and monitor the  progress of all these actions. Otherwise, the value of the exercise lessons learned is deteriorated.  In early 2017, ENISA will perform an in depth analysis of the evaluation data gathered from the exercise.  This will result in a detailed After Action Report (AAR) that will be shared only with the participating  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  42  countries. The report will include a dedicated section for any explicit comments received from the  participating countries in order to increase transparency. ENISA will also prepare a public evaluation report  according to the public affairs strategy of the exercise.  3.4.1.2 Output O.4.1.2 — Planning of Cyber Europe 2018  In 2018, ENISA will organise the fifth pan-European cyber exercise, Cyber Europe 2018 (CE2018). This  exercise will closely follow up and build upon the lessons learned and actions from previous exercises, such  as CE2014 and CE2016.  CE2018 will be a programme of trainings and exercises focusing on testing and training on large-scale  incident management cooperation procedures at EU and national-levels. The efforts will not focus only on  organising a one-time off event but rather to be a continuous effort throughout the year, offering  preparatory training and cooperation opportunities such as small exercises to Member States and the EU  Institutions (EuroSOPEx). The exercise escalation and built-up will be realistic and focused in order to  capture better how incidents are managed and cooperation happens in real-life. The exercise will include  explicit scenarios for the CSIRT Network set up under the NIS directive.  The high-level exercise programme brief will include the strategic dimensions of the exercise will be  prepared based on the lessons learned from CE2016, to drive the whole planning process. The exercise  brief will be given for comments and approval to the MS Cooperation Group set up under the NIS directive.  Following this, ENISA will assemble group of planners from the participating countries to work closely  towards developing a detailed exercise plan (ExPlan) by the end of 2017. ENISA will involve the group of  planners in all relevant planning steps and take into account their input towards a consented plan. The  exercise planning will set in early enough to avoid overlaps with other major related activities.  ENISA will consult MS and seek agreement of the Cooperation Group set up under the NIS directive on a  possible joint EU-NATO cyber exercise within the framework of Cyber Europe.  3.4.1.3 Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities for Cyber Exercise Planning and Cyber Crisis Management  Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) Development and Content Management  Since 2014, ENISA started the development of the Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP). CEP hosts a number of  services that ENISA offers to the Member States and EU Institutions, such as: exercise organisation and  management, exercise playground with technical incidents, map of exercises and hosting the exercise  development community. With this activity ENISA would like to maintain and enhance the experience  offered by CEP, including user support.  In addition, new content and exercise incident challenges and material will be developed in order to keep  up the interest of the stakeholders and make CEP a central tool in cyber security exercising for all  stakeholders.  EU-level Cyber Crisis and Incident Management Procedures and Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)  Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)  Since 2015, ENISA offers the secretariat to the MS developing EU-level standard cooperation procedures at  operational and technical levels. The upcoming policy framework, NIS directive, is expected to strengthen  this by making this supporting role more formal as the secretariat for the cooperation of the EU  operational cyber security network (CSIRTs). In this context, ENISA will offer support for the network,  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  43  helping further the development of EU-level cooperation with standard operation procedures at both  levels, including the point of contact management.  In this context also alert exercises and communication checks will be organised based on the defined  procedures.  In 2017, ENISA will have to prepare to manage and operate the centralised components of the Common  Service Platform (CSP) of the Cybersecurity DSI to be implemented during 2016-2019 under CEF WP2015,  subject to the agreement of the Government Board of the Cybersecurity DSI. As of 2017, ENISA will have to  follow the CSP development very closely and build the capability to gradually take over the parts of the  infrastructure as implemented. By 2019, ENISA must be ready to fully assume the responsibility for the  management, maintenance and further development of the CSP.  As a result of this, the Agency will engage with the contractor developing and deploying the CSP in order to  coordinate all activities that are in relation with the above tasks. ENISA will also investigate how we can  extend our already excellent collaboration with GEANT.  3.4.2 Objective 4.2. CSIRT and other NIS community building  ENISA will continue to support the cooperation among CSIRTs, within an EU Member States CSIRTs  network. As part of this activity, ENISA will provide the secretariat of the network of CSIRTs foreseen by  the proposed NIS directive and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to improve cooperation  among CSIRTs and supporting this cooperation, including by developing and providing guidance on best  practices and trainings in the area of operational community efforts, such as on information exchange.  Furthermore, the Agency will contribute to the dialogue among NIS related communities, including  between CSIRTs and law enforcement and data privacy communities, in order to support consistent EU- wide approach to NIS.  3.4.2.1 Output O.4.2.1 — Support the fight against cybercrime and collaboration between CSIRTs and  LEA  In 2017, the key goal is to build upon the progress ENISA has made in supporting different operational  communities (e.g. CSIRT, law enforcement, European FI-ISAC) to enhance mutually satisfactory ways to  collaborate and support good practices among different stakeholders in operational communities in  Europe. In detail, ENISA will continue its effort to support our common EU wide objective on fight against  cybercrime with different stakeholders.  3.4.2.2 Output O.4.2.2 — EU CSIRT network secretariat and support for EU CSIRT network community  building  ENISA will support the Commission and Member States in the implementation of the NIS directive, in  particular in the area of CSIRTs. As part of this activity, ENISA will provide the secretariat of the network of  CSIRTs and actively support its functioning by suggesting ways to improve cooperation among CSIRTs and  supporting this cooperation, including by developing and providing guidance and good practices in the  area of operational community efforts, such as on information exchange. In particular, the Agency will be  proactive in stimulating discussions within the network and will aim to provide content to support  discussions on policy and technical initiatives.  In addition, ENISA will take an active role to support the EU CSIRT network in activities relevant to the CEF  work programme. ENISA will also manage EU CSIRT network infrastructure assigned to ENISA (if applicable  — CEF annual work programme to support CSIRTs in the area of community building and information  sharing (Connecting Europe Facilities (CEF) programme for CSIRTs).  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  44  3.4.3 Objective 4.3. Response to Article 14 Requests under Community Activity  Article 14 requests allow the MS and EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA seeking assistance or  advice on specific activities. Under this Objective, the Agency will address all the requests related to the  area of Community building, exercises and CSIRTs cooperation.  3.4.3.1 Output O.4.3.1 — Response to Requests under Community Building Activity  The type of outcome and the performance indicators will be defined during the execution year of the work  programme together with the requester.

Response to Article 14 Requests under Community Activity  Output O.4.3.1. — Response  to Requests under  Community Building Activity  S: Answers to requests  Activity 5 — Enabling. Reinforce ENISA’s impact  Activity 5 covers four main objectives.   Management   Engagement with stakeholders   International activities   Compliance and support  3.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall management of the Agency. The Executive Director  has a personal assistant.  To support the Executive Director, an Executive Directors Office (EDO) has been set up. The tasks covered  by EDO include: Policy advice, Legal advice, Management Board Secretariat, Coordination of the Work  Programme and Press Communications.  The policy and legal advice shall extend to all aspects of the work of the agency and includes both advice in  relation to the operational and administration Department of the Agency.  The EDO also supports the administration of the Management Board meetings and the administrative  correspondence that takes place between meetings.  The EDO manages and supports the relations with the press in order to promote the outreach of the  Agency.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  46  In 2017, EDO will continue to support the Management Board (MB) and the Executive Board in their  functions by providing secretariat assistance.  In relation to the MB, one ordinary meeting will be organised during 2017 and informal meetings will be  held as necessary. The existing electronic MB newsletter will be changed to an ENISA newsletter in 2017.  The MB Portal will also be supported. For the Executive Board, a formal meeting will be organised once per  quarter and informal meetings when necessary.  3.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement with stakeholders  Under this objective are grouped some of the tasks and activities of the agencies carried out in  collaboration with stakeholders.   National Liaison Officer Network   Permanent Stakeholders Group   Stakeholders Communication and Dissemination Activities   Outreach and Image building activities  National Liaison Officer Network  ENISA has kicked off various activities aiming at strengthening the cooperation with its National Liaison  Officers’ (NLO) Network. NLOs are key actors for the Agency’s daily work and they warrant the interaction  with select public sector entities in the MS while they provide assurance in terms of outreach effective  liaison with the MS and dissemination of ENISA deliverables.  In 2017, ENISA will build upon these efforts and improve its cooperation with the NLO Network, as the First  Point of Contact for ENISA in the MS, with emphasis on:   a NLO meeting to discuss possible improvements in the collaboration with ENISA. Improvements aim  at leveraging on the NLO network for the dissemination of ENISA deliverables,   information to be sent to the members of the NLO network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, and events organised by ENISA or where the Agency  contributes to (for example co-organiser, etc.);   the Agency maintaining and sharing with the NLO network information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant tender results, etc.) while maintaining and  expanding as appropriate online resources available.  PSGermanent Stakeholders Group  In 2017, ENISA will continue and reinforce the contribution of the Permanent Stakeholders Group (PSG) to  the ENISA Work Programme.  The PSG is composed of ‘nominated members’ and members appointed ‘ad personam’. The total number  of members is 23 and they come from all over Europe. These members constitute a multidisciplinary group  deriving from industry, academia, and consumer organisations and are selected upon the basis of their  own specific expertise and personal merits. Three (3) ‘nominated members’ represent national regulatory  authorities, data protection and law enforcement authorities.  The PSG is established by the ENISA regulation (EU) No 526/2013. The Management Board, acting on a  proposal by the Executive Director, sets up a PSG for a term of office of 2.5 years.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  47  The Role of the PSG group is to advise the Executive Director on the development of the Agency’s work  programme, and on ensuring the communication with the relevant stakeholders on all related issues.  Stakeholders Communication and Dissemination Activities  In 2017, ENISA will seek to improve its focus on key activities and engage the higher possible number of  stakeholders. This includes the various groups of stakeholders that count with institutional, academia,  industry, citizens, etc.  The Agency will continue developing various tools and channels including the website and with strong  emphases in social media.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the Stakeholders Communication team that will seek the  appropriate level of outreach activities to take ENISA’s work to all interested and to provide added value to  Europe.  Outreach and Image building activities  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for all stakeholders. It’s indubitable the importance that  the European Citizens in all areas of our society to trust in ENISA’s work. The cyber security challenges are  increasing in the world and Europe is not an exception. With this objective ENISA’s image needs to be  continuously reinforced. The outreach of the Agency work is essential to create the NIS culture across the  several actors in Europe. ENISA is consistent of this fact and will work with all interested to reach the  Citizens that require information about the work that is developed by the Agency.  Several activities are planned in several Member States that will engender the cyber security awareness  across Europe, fulfilling ENISA’s mandate, mission and strategy until 2020.  3.5.3 Objective 5.3. International relations  Under the Executive Director’s guidance and initiative, ENISA will seek to strengthen contacts at an  international level.  3.5.4 Objective 5.4. Compliance and support  The Stakeholder Relations and Administration Department (SRAD) strives to operate a cost-efficient,  customer-oriented service department.  The SRAD has contributed to the ENISA strategy both internally and externally seeking the optimal  solutions for delivering on the mandate of ENISA.  The SRAD seeks to enhance the functionality of the administrative procedures of the Agency, to provide  administration related services and strategical support and orientation for the Agency recourses strategy.  The SRAD oversees a variety of programmes, projects and services relating to personnel, finance,  purchasing, technology, facilities management, health, safety, security, and much more.  The aim of the SRAD is to provide this assurance and at the same time provide the best level of efficiency  and use of the resources that are made available for the Agency. Coordination with the European  Commission Internal Audit Service, European Court of Auditors, European Ombudsman, European  Commission European Anti-Fraud Office, etc. is one main task of this area. All internal policies related to  transparency, anti-fraud policy, whistle-blowers protection, declarations of interests, etc. are addressed  within this activity.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  48  Quality Management System and Internal Control Coordination  ENISA is developing the Quality Management System (hereinafter, QMS) of the Agency to support its  regulatory and strategic goals by means of a quality management approach. ENISA will follow the  ISO 9001:2015 standards as they are designed to help organisations ensure that they meet the needs of  customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements. The methodology  is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle that has been duly documented in a dedicated SOP and  applied accordingly.  Internal Control reviews and evaluates risk management, governance and internal control processes of the  Agency, in order to provide, to the Senior Management, Executive Director and the Management Board,  independent and objective assurance.  3.5.4.1 IT  In 2015, ENISA set out to define its ICT strategy for the years 2015-2018. The main thrust of this strategy is  to consolidate systems and applications on a maximum of two platforms, maximise data sharing, make  applications available in a secure way on the most widely used mobile devices, and, to progressively move  the Agency’s IT infrastructure to the Cloud. Due to the size of the agency and effective resources  management, the IT tasks will be outsourced as far as possible to concentrate the available resources in  the operational area of the Agency.  By mid-2017, it is expected that most business applications will be securely available on the most widely  used mobile devices. By this timeframe, the platform consolidation should be close to complete, making  data (information) more readily available for reporting and monitoring purposes.  3.5.4.2 Finance, Accounting and Procurement  The key objective here is to ensure the compliance of the financial resources management with the  applicable rules, and in particular with the sound financial management, efficiency and economy principles  as set down in the Financial Regulation. As the Agency resources are derived from the Union Budget,  management is required to comply with a set of regulations, rules and standards set down by the Union  competent institutions. The Unit is responsible for high quality reporting (annual accounts) and  contribution to the audit and discharge procedures.  In 2017, the Agency expects to benefit from the deployment of tools used to simplify and automate its  work, automated applications (Budget Management, Budget Reporting, Procurement planning), e-Prior  (EU Commission platform for the management of the procurement lifecycle, from pre-award to post- award of a contract), as well as the integration of systems (staff missions, project management and budget  management).  Task Objective Level of  completion  2016  Level of  completion  2017  Level of  completion  2019  Consolidate systems and applications on a maximum of two  platforms  Efficiency 20 %  60 % 90 %  Maximise data sharing Efficiency 30 %  60 % 90 %  Move the Agency’s IT infrastructure progressively to the Cloud Efficiency 30 %  50 % 90 %  Business applications will be securely available on the most  widely used mobile devices  Availability 10 % 70 % 90 %  Continuous operations Availability 98 % 98.5 % 99 %  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  49  The deployment of tools coupled by outsourcing of certain activities of low value, is expected to improve  the overall resources management and reporting capacity of the Agency.  The aim is to contribute to the Agency annual and multi annual programming from inception to execution.  The financial resources are allocated according to the expressed needs of the organisational Units  according to the priorities set by the Agency management.  Key objectives for the year 2017 include high budget commitment and payment rates, low number of  budget transfers during the year, planned and justified carry overs, and reduced average payment delay.  3.5.4.3 Human Resources  In 2017, ENISA will recruit additional personnel in line with the Agency’s Establishment Plan. Some of these  recruitments relate to staff turnover at the Agency.  In 2017, the annual performance appraisal exercise will be carried out taking into account the new staff  regulations and applicable rules. HR is also responsible for training and arranges for both mandatory and  professional development training. These training exercises are conducted to ensure that staff members  retain and improve their skills and competencies.  Task Objective Level of  completion  2016  Level of  completion  2017  Level of  completion  2018  Posts on the Agency establishment  plan filled  Minimum 95 % of the  recruitment target reached  90 % 95 % 97 %  Respect the recruitment procedure  time framework.

This should contribute to a common corporate culture, improve staff engagement and  ultimately also improve the operations implementation of the work programme. It is proposed that the  implementation of the internal communications strategy will be completed and revised in 2017.  Thereafter, it is envisaged to do an annual review of this Strategy to ensure that it is kept up to date and  appropriate for the Agency.

This includes dealing with matters such as contracts, procurement, employment related matters,  data protection and corporate governance matters. The Legal Affairs function also includes dealing with  complaints submitted pursuant to Article 90 of the Staff Regulations and complaints to the European  Ombudsman and representing the Agency before the European Court of Justice, General Court or Civil  Service Tribunal.  Data Protection Compliance tasks and Data protection Office  The main tasks of the Data Protection Officer (DPO) include:   inform and advise ENISA of its obligations pursuant to Regulation 45/2001/EC and document this  activity and the responses received;   monitor the implementation and application of ENISA’s policies in relation to the protection of  personal data;   monitor the implementation and application of Regulation 45/2001/EC at ENISA, including the  requirements for data security, information of data subjects and their requests in exercising their  rights under the Regulation, as well as the requirements for prior check or prior consultation with  EDPS;   monitor the documentation, notification and communication of personal data in the context of ENISA’s  operations;   act as ENISA’s contact point for EDPS on issues related to the processing of personal data; cooperate  and consult with EPDS whenever needed.  Information Security coordination  The Information Security Officer (ISO) coordinates the Information Security Management System on behalf  of the Authorising Officer. In particular, the ISO advises the ICT Unit alongside the Quality and Data  Management Unit to develop and implement information security policies, standards, guidelines and  baselines that seek to secure the confidentiality, integrity and authentication of the information systems of  the Agency. The ISO is instrumental in incident handling and incident response and security event  monitoring. The ISO also leads the security training for the Agency’s staff and he provides security  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  51  guidance on all IT projects, including the evaluation and recommendation of technical controls. In 2017,  the ISO will contribute to such goals as:   improving the security posture of ENISA by planning penetration tests and vulnerability assessments;   advising on security policies and updating existing ones in line with the evolution of threats and risks;   improving the internal security training for ENISA staff;   implementing new systems and tools that can support improvements on IT Security.

ABB focuses on integrated  budgeting and financial management, based on activities linked to the Agency’s priorities and objectives.  To improve better estimation of resources needed for each ENISA activity, we need to split the budget  forecast in Direct and Indirect budget. The following assumptions are used in the simplified ABB  methodology.   Direct Budget is the cost estimate of each Operational activity (listed in Activities A1 to A5) in terms of  goods and services procured.   Indirect Budget is the cost estimate of salaries, mission costs and overhead costs, attributable to each  Operational or Compliance activity. The indirect budget is re-distributed against direct budget in all  Activities.   Compliance posts from Activity A5 Enabling are redistributed to Core Activities — A1 to A4, and  operational posts of the Activity A5.   Total ABB posts (FTEs) are the sum of all the posts from all activities (A1 to A5) after the re- distribution.  The table below presents the allocation of financial and human resources to Activities of the Agency based on the above ABB  methodology.

The high commitment rate shows the already proven capacity of the Agency to fully  implement its annual appropriations. The same commitment rate achieved in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and  2014, is maintained for a sixth year in a row. The payment rate reached 92.89 % (85.61 % in 2014) and the  amount carried forward to 2015 was EUR 671 393.26 (EUR 1  308 475.80 in 2014) representing 7.11 % of  total C1 appropriations 2015 (from 14.39 % in 2014).  Cancellation of appropriations   Commitment Appropriations  No commitment appropriations were cancelled.  The appropriations of 2015 were fully utilised, i.e. the commitment rate reached 100.00 %.   Payment Appropriations  No payment appropriations were cancelled.  The appropriations of 2014 carried over to 2015 were utilised at a rate of 93.95 % (automatic and non- automatic carry-overs) which indicates a satisfactory capability of estimation of needs. From the amount of  EUR 1  332 420.80 carried forward, only the amount of EUR 80 675.08 was cancelled, due to the fact that  the estimated expenditure deviated from the actual.

Annex VII: Evaluations  Internal monitoring system MATRIX has been put in place at ENISA and is used for project management by  ENISA staff. Regular progress reports are presented at the meetings of the ENISA management team and  reviewed at the midterm review meetings.  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  63  Also, external consultant has been contracted to carry annual ex post evaluation of core operational  activities. The scope of the evaluation focusses on ENISA’s core operational activities, with an estimated  expenditure above EUR 30 000.00. The overall objective of the annual evaluations is to evaluate the  effectiveness, efficiency, added value, utility, coordination and coherence.  The following table summarises the findings per evaluation criteria and outlines actions ENISA’s  management considered as important. The evaluation of 2014 core operational activities is largely positive  and the actions mainly relate to a continuation of the work carried out.  Criteria  Summary findings  Possible Actions  Relevance  Based on the findings, it can be concluded that ENISA clearly  responds to a need in the European NIS landscape. The scope and  objectives of ENISA’s work are seen as relevant to respond to the  needs, but at the same time stakeholders see limits to ENISA’s  mandate and outreach, which affects the ability of the Agency to  effectively meet the needs  Continue to explore ways to ensure  ENISA’s work is addressing real needs  in NIS in the EU  Map/assess gaps in current NIS  landscape, to feed into discussions on  future mandate  It may be important in the future to  focus on activities where there is a  strong demand from the NIS  communities to ensure that ENISA’s  deliverables achieve a real impact  Impact  It appears that, despite ENISA’s limited mandate and also fairly  small resources, the Agency manages to make a real contribution  towards increased NIS in Europe, as perceived by key stakeholders  N/A  Effectiveness  — KIIs and  downloads  All KIIs were achieved. The evaluation can conclude that some of  ENISA’s deliverables have generated a high number of downloads  in a short period of time (most reports were made available in Q1  2015 and thus downloads had only been available for a few  months at the time of writing)  Introduce more ambitious KIIS which  enable a tracking of performance  Effectiveness  — EU Policy  The evaluation findings show that the work conducted under work  stream 1 has been successful in achieving most objectives. In  particular, the work undertaken to identify evolving threats, risks  and challenges, and the contribution to EU policy initiatives appear  to have achieved the intended results. For the work done in  supporting the EU in education, research and standardisation,  results were more mixed, in particular regarding the link to actual  operational issues such as data protection and secure services.  These aspects are evidently not under the direct control of ENISA  but of national regulators and operators, hence the need for  further efforts in coordination and cooperation  Continue efforts to build relations with  senior decision-makers at Member  State and EU level (public and private)  Effectiveness  — Capacity  building  ENISA’s work to develop capacity in Member States (to coordinate  and cooperate during crises, and the support to develop capacities  and strategies at Member State level) as part of work stream 2 has  been successful in achieving the objectives set out. The  contribution to private sector capacities looks more uncertain,  based on the responses from the stakeholder survey  Continue to engage with the private  sector to improve and increase  outreach  Effectiveness  — Support  cooperation  Findings show that the work stream 3 has largely achieved the  objectives set, with stakeholders assessing a clear contribution of  ENISA to putting in place effective measures to cope with cyber  crises and incidents. In particular, ENISA’s support was considered  valuable to improve workflow and cooperation among involved  stakeholders. That said, as the CE2014 case study concludes, there  Continue trust building and  cooperation activities as a means to  overcome barriers to cooperation  during crisis  ENISA Programming Document 2017-2019 with amendments  64  is still a long road ahead before an EU-level crisis management  process is put in place in the cyber security area, with a lack of  trust among stakeholders, weaknesses and differences in national  capabilities, weak communication structures, insufficient  exchanges of information in ‘real life’ etc., representing hurdles  that need to be surmounted over the medium to long term  Efficiency  The operational budget of ENISA is limited, and the main  expenditure relates to staff costs. In the light of the resources  available (staff and expenditures), ENISA manages to produce  quite a high number of deliverables which also have generated  considerable outreach in terms of downloads. No indication of low  efficiency was identified in the evaluation period, though specific  cost saving measures could not be established  N/A  Coordination  and  coherence  Overall, it can be concluded that ENISA effectively cooperates and  engages with its main stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate.  The support provided by ENISA is seen as a complement to that of  other public interventions, and no adverse effects were identified  N/A  Overall, the evaluation of activities foreseen in the Work Programme 2014 conclude that ENISA effectively  cooperates and engages with its main stakeholders, as stipulated in its mandate. The support provided by  ENISA is seen as a complement to that of other public interventions, and no adverse effects were  identified. There is a clear pattern in terms of progress, where targets under ENISA’s control (such a high  quality, community building, good practice dissemination) are largely achieved. The scope and objectives  of ENISA’s work is seen as relevant to respond to the needs, but at the same time stakeholders see limits in  ENISA’s mandate and outreach. In particular, private stakeholders and industry appear to strive towards a  more operational role for ENISA, going beyond the advisory and facilitating mandate of the Agency, in  order to effectively achieve the overall objectives of Network Information Security (NIS) and cyber security.  Also, the findings and conclusions from the external evaluation of ENISA’s core operational activities in  2015 confirm that ENISA generally functions efficiently; it is characterised by a clear delineation of  responsibilities and has cost-saving measures in place, but one case of low efficiency was identified,  namely the insufficient dissemination of publications. It was concluded that ENISA significantly enhanced  cooperation both between Member States of the EU and between related NIS stakeholders in 2015 by  bringing people from different operational communities around the table to share information, ideas and  common areas of interest at an operational level. ENISA thereby contributed to a great extent to  enhancing community building in Europe and beyond and improved services, workflow and  communication among stakeholders to respond to crises. Moreover, the ex post evaluation concluded that  ENISA’s support to cooperation between stakeholders complemented other public interventions, clearly  pointing to a role for ENISA in this regard.

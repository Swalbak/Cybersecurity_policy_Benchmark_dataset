To meet increased demand, practitioners and  recruiters alike require a framework to understand the skills that are  necessary to perform the roles and duties of the cyber mission.  ASD Cyber Skills Framework  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework defines the roles, capabilities and skills  proficiencies that are essential to cyber missions, and that can be used  in both the security and offensive contexts.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework enables targeted recruitment of cyber  specialists, provides a development pathway for current and future  cyber staff and aligns skills, knowledge and attributes with national  and international industry standards.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework is relevant to wider government, industry  and academia which can be implemented and used as a tool for  understanding and profiling cyber skills in any organisation.  H I S T O R Y  O F  T H E  A S D  C Y B E R  S K I L L S  F R A M E W O R K  The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) released the ASD Cyber Skills Framework v.1.0 in July 2019 as an iterative framework designed to be used  as a tool to assess, maintain and monitor the skills, knowledge and attributes of the ASD cyber workforce.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework v.2.0 captures updates from the frameworks that support it: Skills Framework for the Information Age 7 (SFIA 7)  and the Chartered Institute for Information Security (CIISec) Framework v.2.4 (formerly the Institute for Information Security Professionals).  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework v.2.0 introduces additional elements, as follows:  • Role definitions and expectations  • Digital Career Pathways  • Learning and Development pathways  • National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) work roles  • Australian Defence Force (ADF) professional framework.  8  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  The foundation of the ASD Cyber Skills  Framework  The foundation of the ASD Cyber Skills Framework is built on the  following core elements:  9 Cyber role definitions  9 Capability and skill definitions  6 Proficiency levels  4 Career pathways  1 Learning and development pathway (example)  The guiding document The ASD Cyber Skills Framework is designed to be used as a guiding  document and its different elements can be implemented as required  to meet organisational and workforce goals and objectives.

The ASD Streams defined the specialist professional  capabilities in a broad occupational group that related to a skill area.  In 2018, a review of the ASD Stream for Cyber and Information Security  was undertaken in order to assess the relevance of the defined roles,  capabilities, skills and proficiency levels, and the way in which these  related to current industry and government frameworks and standards.  As a result of this review, the ASD Cyber Skills Framework was formed:  nine roles were defined using a set of underlying core capabilities and  related skills and proficiency levels. These concepts were developed  from three core frameworks: Chartered Institute of Information Security  (CIISec) Skills Framework; Skills Framework for the Information Age  (SFIA); and Integrated Leadership System (ILS).  CIISec is the leading information security professional industry body  in the United Kingdom. ASD uses the CIISec Skills Framework to define  the majority of cyber capabilities and skills within the ASD Cyber  Skills Framework. The CIISec Skills Framework was also essential in  establishing the skill proficiency levels adopted in the ASD Cyber  Skills Framework.  ASD, along with many other government departments and ICT  industry stakeholders, implements SFIA as a tool to assess technical  ICT proficiencies. SFIA is considered a leading framework to describe  capabilities and skill proficiencies for information technology  professionals. SFIA is used to define a number of core ICT capabilities  and skills within the ASD Cyber Skills Framework.  The ILS is the Australian government-approved standard for personnel  capability development. The ILS is adopted for all skills relating to the  Management, Leadership, Business, and Communication capability  within the ASD Cyber Skills Framework.  What terminology is used in the  framework?  Capability: Broad grouping of occupational skills  Example: Incident management, investigation and  digital forensics  Skills: Expertise or aptitude in a capability  Example: Intrusion Detection and Analysis  Role: A job, position or function  Example: Incident Responder  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  10  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  LEVEL  6  Expert Practitioner (Initiate, enable,  and ensure)  LEVEL  5  Principal Practitioner (Advise)  LEVEL  4  Senior Practitioner (Enable)  LEVEL  3  Practitioner (Apply)  LEVEL  2  Novice (Understand)  LEVEL  1  Learner (Knowledge)  01  02  03  04  05  06 PANTONE 3278 60%  PANTONE 1225 100%  PANTONE 3125 60%  PANTONE 272 60%  PANTONE 200 80%  PANTONE 7686 60%  Proficiency levels  The table below displays the way in which the ASD Cyber Skills Framework maps the proficiency levels  defined in ASD Streams, CIISec Skills Framework, and SFIA.

The ASD Cyber Skills Framework was  a guiding document for role and skill definitions, as well as proficiency levels within the Digital Career Pathways, and helped define the four  underlying career pathways: Analysis, Architecture, Operations and Testing.  The Digital Career Pathways initiative aims to make career options within government flexible by providing employees with a clear view of  where they are in their career and how to navigate their potential future. It provides guidance on how existing ICT skills can be utilised in other  roles, and what new skills an employee might need in order to excel in those roles.  The Digital Career Pathways are designed to help answer two main questions for users:  1 What skills and capabilities do you have?  2 What skills and capabilities do you need?  Exploring the Digital Career Pathways helps create a career pathway by identifying the roles available in cyber and what skills need to be  developed in order to perform a role at a particular proficiency level.  55ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  DIGITAL CAREER PATHWAYS  Cyber Security Advice and Assessment  9.17.27.15.14.13.23.12.31.51.3 9.17.27.15.14.13.23.12.31.51.3 9.17.27.15.14.13.22.31.51.3 9.17.27.14.13.22.31.51.3 9.17.27.14.12.31.51.3  Vulnerability  Research  9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.14.33.43.3  1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5  1.21.1 1.21.1 1.21.1 1.21.1 1.21.1  EL1 EL2  ASD6  ASD4 ASD5  EL1 EL2  ASD6  ASD4 ASD5  H O W  T O  R E A D  A  D I G I T A L  C A R E E R  P A T H W AY  M A P  Skill blocks These are the skills regularly used  in the role.

The NICE Framework is used as a reference document that describes seven  key categories of work roles which define speciality areas, and details the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of cyber security work roles.  The NICE Framework is recommended for use as a source to further develop and complement custom skills frameworks, where the cyber security  workforce is extensive and has a requirement for comprehensive KSAs at defined proficiency levels.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework and the NICE Framework are complementary and can be used to address cyber skills development, especially at the  entry level. While the ASD Cyber Skills Framework defines the core capabilities and skills of nine cyber security roles, the NICE Framework defines entry  level KSAs for 52 work roles relevant to the US cyber eco-system.  To enable Australian academic institutions, which are implementing the NICE Framework, to understand how NICE KSAs translate to entry level cyber  security roles in Australian government, the following graphic demonstrates the best fit translation of ASD cyber roles to work roles identified in the  NICE Framework, based on definition, duties, role expectations and KSAs.

To meet increased demand, practitioners and  recruiters alike require a framework to understand the skills that are  necessary to perform the roles and duties of the cyber mission.  ASD Cyber Skills Framework  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework defines the roles, capabilities and skills  proficiencies that are essential to cyber missions, and that can be used  in both the security and offensive contexts.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework enables targeted recruitment of cyber  specialists, provides a development pathway for current and future  cyber staff and aligns skills, knowledge and attributes with national  and international industry standards.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework is relevant to wider government, industry  and academia which can be implemented and used as a tool for  understanding and profiling cyber skills in any organisation.  H I S T O R Y  O F  T H E  A S D  C Y B E R  S K I L L S  F R A M E W O R K  The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) released the ASD Cyber Skills Framework v.1.0 in July 2019 as an iterative framework designed to be used  as a tool to assess, maintain and monitor the skills, knowledge and attributes of the ASD cyber workforce.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework v.2.0 captures updates from the frameworks that support it: Skills Framework for the Information Age 7 (SFIA 7)  and the Chartered Institute for Information Security (CIISec) Framework v.2.4 (formerly the Institute for Information Security Professionals).  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework v.2.0 introduces additional elements, as follows:  • Role definitions and expectations  • Digital Career Pathways  • Learning and Development pathways  • National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) work roles  • Australian Defence Force (ADF) professional framework.  8  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  The foundation of the ASD Cyber Skills  Framework  The foundation of the ASD Cyber Skills Framework is built on the  following core elements:  9 Cyber role definitions  9 Capability and skill definitions  6 Proficiency levels  4 Career pathways  1 Learning and development pathway (example)  The guiding document The ASD Cyber Skills Framework is designed to be used as a guiding  document and its different elements can be implemented as required  to meet organisational and workforce goals and objectives.

The ASD Streams defined the specialist professional  capabilities in a broad occupational group that related to a skill area.  In 2018, a review of the ASD Stream for Cyber and Information Security  was undertaken in order to assess the relevance of the defined roles,  capabilities, skills and proficiency levels, and the way in which these  related to current industry and government frameworks and standards.  As a result of this review, the ASD Cyber Skills Framework was formed:  nine roles were defined using a set of underlying core capabilities and  related skills and proficiency levels. These concepts were developed  from three core frameworks: Chartered Institute of Information Security  (CIISec) Skills Framework; Skills Framework for the Information Age  (SFIA); and Integrated Leadership System (ILS).  CIISec is the leading information security professional industry body  in the United Kingdom. ASD uses the CIISec Skills Framework to define  the majority of cyber capabilities and skills within the ASD Cyber  Skills Framework. The CIISec Skills Framework was also essential in  establishing the skill proficiency levels adopted in the ASD Cyber  Skills Framework.  ASD, along with many other government departments and ICT  industry stakeholders, implements SFIA as a tool to assess technical  ICT proficiencies. SFIA is considered a leading framework to describe  capabilities and skill proficiencies for information technology  professionals. SFIA is used to define a number of core ICT capabilities  and skills within the ASD Cyber Skills Framework.  The ILS is the Australian government-approved standard for personnel  capability development. The ILS is adopted for all skills relating to the  Management, Leadership, Business, and Communication capability  within the ASD Cyber Skills Framework.  What terminology is used in the  framework?  Capability: Broad grouping of occupational skills  Example: Incident management, investigation and  digital forensics  Skills: Expertise or aptitude in a capability  Example: Intrusion Detection and Analysis  Role: A job, position or function  Example: Incident Responder  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  10  ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  LEVEL  6  Expert Practitioner (Initiate, enable,  and ensure)  LEVEL  5  Principal Practitioner (Advise)  LEVEL  4  Senior Practitioner (Enable)  LEVEL  3  Practitioner (Apply)  LEVEL  2  Novice (Understand)  LEVEL  1  Learner (Knowledge)  01  02  03  04  05  06 PANTONE 3278 60%  PANTONE 1225 100%  PANTONE 3125 60%  PANTONE 272 60%  PANTONE 200 80%  PANTONE 7686 60%  Proficiency levels  The table below displays the way in which the ASD Cyber Skills Framework maps the proficiency levels  defined in ASD Streams, CIISec Skills Framework, and SFIA.

The ASD Cyber Skills Framework was  a guiding document for role and skill definitions, as well as proficiency levels within the Digital Career Pathways, and helped define the four  underlying career pathways: Analysis, Architecture, Operations and Testing.  The Digital Career Pathways initiative aims to make career options within government flexible by providing employees with a clear view of  where they are in their career and how to navigate their potential future. It provides guidance on how existing ICT skills can be utilised in other  roles, and what new skills an employee might need in order to excel in those roles.  The Digital Career Pathways are designed to help answer two main questions for users:  1 What skills and capabilities do you have?  2 What skills and capabilities do you need?  Exploring the Digital Career Pathways helps create a career pathway by identifying the roles available in cyber and what skills need to be  developed in order to perform a role at a particular proficiency level.  55ASD CYBER SKILLS FRAMEWORK  DIGITAL CAREER PATHWAYS  Cyber Security Advice and Assessment  9.17.27.15.14.13.23.12.31.51.3 9.17.27.15.14.13.23.12.31.51.3 9.17.27.15.14.13.22.31.51.3 9.17.27.14.13.22.31.51.3 9.17.27.14.12.31.51.3  Vulnerability  Research  9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.16.15.24.44.33.43.33.2 9.17.27.14.33.43.3  1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.5  1.21.1 1.21.1 1.21.1 1.21.1 1.21.1  EL1 EL2  ASD6  ASD4 ASD5  EL1 EL2  ASD6  ASD4 ASD5  H O W  T O  R E A D  A  D I G I T A L  C A R E E R  P A T H W AY  M A P  Skill blocks These are the skills regularly used  in the role.

The NICE Framework is used as a reference document that describes seven  key categories of work roles which define speciality areas, and details the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of cyber security work roles.  The NICE Framework is recommended for use as a source to further develop and complement custom skills frameworks, where the cyber security  workforce is extensive and has a requirement for comprehensive KSAs at defined proficiency levels.  The ASD Cyber Skills Framework and the NICE Framework are complementary and can be used to address cyber skills development, especially at the  entry level. While the ASD Cyber Skills Framework defines the core capabilities and skills of nine cyber security roles, the NICE Framework defines entry  level KSAs for 52 work roles relevant to the US cyber eco-system.  To enable Australian academic institutions, which are implementing the NICE Framework, to understand how NICE KSAs translate to entry level cyber  security roles in Australian government, the following graphic demonstrates the best fit translation of ASD cyber roles to work roles identified in the  NICE Framework, based on definition, duties, role expectations and KSAs.

The ADF Cyberspace  Professional Framework and the ASD Cyber Skills Framework have been developed using the same guiding principles: create a common taxonomy,  support professional development, describe the cyber workforce and be fit for purpose for the intended audience.  ASD and the ADF are committed to working in partnership in support of Defence missions, including cyber operations. ASD and ADF Information  Warfare Division share a strong partnership and are working together to address cyber skills now and in the future.

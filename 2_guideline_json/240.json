CONCLUSIONS 28  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In the EU, telecom operators notify significant security incidents to their national authorities. At  the start of every calendar year, the national authorities send a summary of these reports to  ENISA. This report, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2021, provides anonymised  and aggregated information about major telecom security incidents in 2021.  The reporting of security incidents has been part of the EU’s regulatory framework for telecoms  since the 2009 reform of the telecoms package. Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The European Electronic Communications Code  (EECC) (2018/1972) repeals and replaces the Framework Directive. It reinforces the provisions  for reporting incidents, clarifying what incidents fall within its scope and the notification criteria.  STATISTICS EXTRACTED FROM THE ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORTING  PROCESS 2021  The 2021 annual summary contains reports of 168 incidents submitted by national authorities  from 26 EU Member States (MS) and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost, derived by  multiplying for each incident the number of users by the number of hours, was 5,106 million user  hours, a huge increase compared to 841 million user hours lost in 2020. These numbers are  clearly much higher compared to those of previous years, as can be seen in the following  graphic.The reason for this is the impact of a notable EU-wide incident that was reported  separately by three MS. ENISA has published technical guidelines on incident reporting under  the EECC1, including on thresholds and calculating hours lost.  Figure 1: Number of incidents submitted by countries and user hours lost each year (2012- 2021)  THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM INCIDENTS IN 2021  • Reporting of incidents related to OTT services requires further attention. Four per  cent of reported incidents in 2021 refer to OTT communication services (4,16%). The  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc, March 2021  In 2021, 7% of the  total user hours  lost were due to  system failures  and an excessive  amount was lost  due to human  errors (90%).  The downwards  trend concerning  impact on mobile  telephony that  commenced in  2019 continued in  2021.  The total user  hours lost in 2021  was 5,106 million  user hours.  Over the course of  11 years, EU  Member States  reported a total of  1,431 telecom  security incidents.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  4  same EU-wide OTT incident was reported three times by three different MS in three  different ways, so there is a need for clarity as to who reports such incidents, which  authority is in charge and what information is reported. The results of incident reporting  in 2021 are skewed because of the huge impact caused by this incident being reported  three times.  • For the first time, incidents concerning confidentiality and authenticity were  reported. The reporting of such incidents was a new provision of EECC and in this  respect no such incidents were reported in previous years. Three relevant incidents  were reported in 2021 and this number is expected to grow in coming years.  • Malicious actions doubled in 2021. In 2020, incidents marked as malicious actions  represented 4% of the total, a number which rose to 8% in 2021. Moreover, it is  interesting to highlight the significant increase in DDoS attacks compared to 2020  when only four such incidents had been reported resulting in 1 million user hours lost.  By comparison, in 2021 ten DDoS related incidents were reported, leading to a loss of  55 million user hours. These results are consistent with the findings of the ENISA  Threat Landscape that point to an increase in DDoS attacks and a general increase in  attacks against availability of services.  • System failures continue to dominate in terms of impact but the downward trend  continues. System failures accounted for 363 million user hours lost compared to 419  million user hours in 2020. Despite the skewed nature of the 2021 results, it is  noteworthy that there was a 14% decrease in user hours lost, whereas in terms of the  number of incidents in 2021 they represent 59% of the total compared to 61% in 2020.  This highlights the growing maturity of electronic communication providers in handling  and containing the impact of system failures.  • Incidents caused by human errors remain at the same level as in 2020. Around a  quarter (23%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause (a slight decrease  compared to 26% in 2020), however 91% of the total user hours lost have been lost  due to this kind of incident. These results however are skewed due to the OTT  communication services incident reporting issues mentioned above.  • In 2021, there was a noteworthy decrease in incidents flagged as failures by third  parties. Only 22% of incidents were reported as being related to third-party failures  compared to 29% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. No third-party failures related to malicious  actions were reported. Overall, the finding suggests that electronic communication  providers have started introducing targeted security controls to better protect their  supply chains, echoing the relevant ENISA calls for attention2.  2 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  5  Figure 2: Share of users’ hours lost for each root cause category  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing incidents, which can be used to generate  custom graphs. See: https:/ciras.enisa.europa.eu.  MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS OVER THE LAST DECADE  For more than a decade now, ENISA and the national authorities in EU Member States have  been collecting and analysing telecom security incident reports. Over the course of 11 years,  EU Member States reported 1,431 telecom security incidents. ENISA stores these in a tool  called CIRAS (Cybersecurity Incident Reporting and Analysis System) and the statistics are  accessible online.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  6  Figure 3: Root cause categories for telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012- 2021 period  Over the last couple of years, the following trends have been noted:  • Number of incidents is stabilising: the total number of incidents reported is  stabilising at around 160 annually. Over the period 2014-2021, a consistent over the  years number of incidents have been reported and this is stabilising at around 160  incidents per year.  • Malicious actions continue to constitute a minority of incidents: over the reporting  period, the frequency of malicious actions was stable (accounting for approximately 5%  of incidents each year, although in 2021 there was a spike at 8%). Their impact in  terms of user hours was stable also.  Currently the focus of the national authorities for telecom security is on the transposition and  implementation of the EECC, which brings several changes. The incident reporting  requirements in Article 40 of the EECC have a broader scope including explicitly, for example,  breaches of confidentiality. In addition, the arrival of the Network and Information Security (NIS)  Directive 2 in 2022 is expected to be a game changer in incident reporting, since it consolidates  the reporting of security breaches across a variety of legislations including but not limited to the  EECC.  Moreover, in the context of the new EECC, targeted attacks involving for instance those using  SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping frauds, attacks using the Flubot malware or even  more extended attacks that cause no outages, such as wiretapping or a BGP hijack, would be  reportable under Article 40 of the EECC.  ENISA will continue to work with national authorities as well as the NIS Cooperation group to  find and exploit synergies between different pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes  to incident reporting and cross-border supervision.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents that have a  significant impact on the continuity of electronic communication services to the national telecom  regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary  to ENISA, covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most significant incidents, based on a  set of agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2021,  aggregates the incident reports received in 2021 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 11th year ENISA is publishing an annual incidents report for the telecom sector.  ENISA started publishing these annual reports in 2012. Mandatory incident reporting has been  part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package:  Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  The mandatory reporting of incidents under Article 13a had a specific focus on security  incidents with a significant impact on the functioning of each category of telecommunication  services. Over the years, the regulatory authorities have agreed to focus mostly on  network/service outages (type A incidents). This would exclude from the scope of these reports  targeted attacks, e.g. those involving the use of SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping  frauds, or even more extended attacks that nevertheless do not cause outages.  The relevant update of the EU telecom rules, namely the European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC), that was expected to be harmonised in Member States by the end of 2020,  includes a broader scope on the requirements for incident reporting in Article 40. These  requirements explicitly include, for example, breaches of confidentiality. 2021 is the second time  ENISA has also received three type B reports of incidents (breaches of confidentiality).  This document is structured as follows: in section 2, the policy context and background is  provided. The reporting procedure is briefly summarised. In addition, the types of incidents that  get reported are described. Some specific but anonymised examples of incidents that occurred  in 2021 are also discussed. In Section 3, key facts and statistics about incidents in 2021 are  provided. In Section 4, there is a closer look at faulty software changes, and in section 5 a look  at multi-annual trends over the years 2012-2021.  It is important to note that the telecom security incidents that are reported to national authorities  are only the major incidents, i.e. those with significant impacts. Smaller incidents, affecting small  percentages of population such as SIM Swapping attacks are not reported.  Note that conclusions about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with  a degree of caution as national reporting thresholds change over the years. Indeed reporting  thresholds have been lowered in most countries in recent years and, as mentioned, reporting  only covers the most significant incidents (and not smaller incidents that may well be more  frequent).  This is the 11th  ENISA annual  incident report for  the telecom sector.  Mandatory incident  reporting has been  part of the EU’s  telecom regulatory  framework since  2009.  Reform of the  telecom package:  Article 13a of the  Framework  directive  (2009/140/EC) has  been further  expanded in the  European  Electronic  Communications  Code.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  8  2. BACKGROUND AND POLICY  CONTEXT  In this chapter the policy context is explained as well as the main features of the incident  reporting process, as described in Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting3, which  was developed in collaboration with national authorities.  2.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Security incident reporting is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and it is an important  enabler for the supervision of cybersecurity and for policymaking at national and EU level. Since  2016 security incident reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU under  Article 19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS Directive (NISD), security incident  reporting became mandatory for Operators of Essential Services in the EU and for Digital  Service Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS directive.  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into effect  across the EU, but was only implemented into national legislation in some EU countries. The  year 2021 saw progress in the implementation of EECC by MS; however the process has not  yet been completed.  Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a broader scope,  including not only outages but also, for instance, breaches of confidentiality. In addition, there  are more services within the scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom operators  but also, for example, over-the-top providers of communications services4 (such as messaging  services like Viber and WhatsApp, etc.).  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline was updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA. These combine quantitative and qualitative parameters as well as  the notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet  and telephony, but also number-based interpersonal communications services and/or number  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services)5.  It is, nevertheless, important to note that the main characteristic of 2020 and 2021 was the  COVID-19 pandemic, which radically transformed the way people around the globe live and  work, turning everything digital. As such, there was extensive supervision from the European  Commission on the reporting by all Member States of incidents of network congestion.  Comparing incident reporting results from 2019 and before, it is fair to conclude that the  European telecommunication networks have shown robustness and resilience.  2.2 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a of the Framework Directive and Article 40 of the EECC provides for three types of  incident reporting:  1) National incident reporting from providers to NRAs,  2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and  3 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  4 See Security supervision changes in the new EU telecoms legislation — ENISA (europa.eu)  5 See When & How to Report Security Incidents — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-supervision-changes-in-the-new-eu-telecoms-legislation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/when-how-to-report-security-incidents  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  9  3) Annual summary reporting from national authorities to the EC and ENISA.  The different types of reporting are shown in Figure 4.  Figure 4: Incident reporting under EECC article 40  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymising, aggregating and  analysing the incident reports. In the current setup, NRAs can search incidents in the reporting  tool (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making  the overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.3 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  ENISA maintains an incident reporting tool, CIRAS, for the authorities where they can upload  reports and search for and study specific incidents.  For the public, ENISA also offers an online visual tool, which is publicly accessible and can be  used for custom analysis of the data: https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/. This tool anonymises the  country or operator involved.  The reporting template starts with a selector for the type of incident and contains three parts:  1. Impact of the incident  ̶  communication services impacted and by how much;  2. Nature of the incident  ̶ the cause of the incident;  3. Details of the incident  ̶  detailed information about the incident, including a short  description, the types of network, the types of assets, the severity level etc.  CIRAS  is a free online tool where ENISA stores  reported incidents and provides annual  and multi-annual statistics.  https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  10  The type selector distinguishes six types of cybersecurity incidents (see Figure 5). The different  types are explained below.  Figure 5: Types of cybersecurity incidents  Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability). For example, an outage caused by a cable  cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for building a new road  would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity). For  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the  endpoints participating in the shared session. This leads to the interception of the  media (voice, pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This  incident would be categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact on  the service). For example, a malware has been detected on several workstations and  servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be categorised  as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw). For instance, the  discovery of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system). For example, when  one of two redundant submarine cables breaks would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures). For instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would be  categorised as a type F incident.  For more information about the incident reporting process, please refer to ‘Technical Guideline  on Incident Reporting under the EECC’6  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  11  3. ANALYSIS OF INCIDENTS  For the year 2021, 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in the annual  reporting process, describing 168 significant incidents (compared to 170 in 2020). In this  section, the 168 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact on each root  cause category is analysed in section 3.1. In section 3.2 the focus is on the user hours that  were lost in each root cause category. Detailed causes are then examined in Section 3.3, and in  Section 3.4 the impact on each service is analysed.  One of the highlights of incident reporting under the EECC in 2021 is the fact that for the first  time three out of the 168 incidents were marked as Type B, namely as impacting confidentiality  and authenticity of services. All the other incidents impacted availability and were thus marked  as Type A. Incidents of the other 4 types were not reported in 2021.  3.1 CATEGORIES OF ROOT CAUSES  In 2021, there was a slight drop in incidents related to both system failures and human errors,  the two categories which consistently rank the highest (see Figure 6). About 23% of security  incidents were caused by human errors (compared to 26% in 2020) and 59% of telecom  incidents were marked as system failures, a slight decrease compared to 2020 (61%). Notably,  malicious actions almost doubled in the course of 2021 (8%) compared to 2020 (4%) and  natural phenomena remained consistent with 2020 (10% in 2021 up slightly from 9% in 2020).  Figure 6: Root cause categories – Telecom security Incidents in 2021  In 2021, there was a noteworthy decrease in incidents that were flagged as third-party failures.  Only 22% of the incidents were reported as being related to third-party failures compared to  29% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. No third-party failures related to malicious actions were  reported, while the majority of them was related to system failures (see Figure 7).  168  telecom  security  incidents  reported in  2021 by EU  Member  States.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  12  Figure 7: Root cause categories – Telecom security incidents in 2021 (third-party failures)  3.2 USER HOURS LOST IN EACH CATEGORY OF ROOT CAUSES  Adding up total user hours lost for each root cause category (see Figure 8) shows that more  than 90% of the total user hours lost were due to human errors (91%; 4,632 million user hours),  up from 40% and 351 million user hours in 2020. This is due to the fact that a particular incident  affecting an OTT (Over-The-Top) communication service provider was reported three times by  three different MS and in three different ways (i.e. incident data differences) since it impacted  services across the EU.  This raises the issue of cross-border and EU-wide incidents and how they should be reported  under the EECC, in particular for OTT communication service providers who by nature are not  generally restricted to a single MS. 4442 user hours were lost due to human errors in the case  of OTT communication service providers and 7M due to system failures.  System failures accounted for 7% of the cases (363 million user hours lost) compared to 50%  and 419 million lost user hours in 2020. Despite the skewed nature of the results in 2021, it is  noteworthy that there was a 14% decrease in user hours lost relared to system failures, a trend  observed since 2019. This highlights the growing maturity of electronic communication providers  in handling and containing the impact of system failures.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  13  Figure 8: Share of user hours lost for each root cause category  It is interesting to note the impact of incidents related to malicious actions on lost user hours.  Interestingly, in 2021 lost user hours increased five times (from 13 million lost user hours in  2019 and 2020 to 70 million lost user hours in 2021). While the number of incidents doubled in  2021 compared to 2020, the significant increase in their related impact highlights the need to  take further action in containing the adverse effect of such incidents.  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES AND USER HOURS LOST  Detailed causes for all incidents are tracked, in addition to root cause categories (Figure 9). An  incident is often a chain of events. For instance, an incident may be triggered by a storm, which  tears down power supply infrastructure, cutting cables and thus power, which in turn results in a  telecom outage. In this example, the root cause of the incident would be natural phenomena  and the detailed causes would be: Heavy wind, Cable cut, Power cut, Battery depletion.  The most frequent detailed cause appearing in incident reports for 2021 is hardware failures  followed by faulty software changes/updates and software bugs. In addition, many incident  reports mention policy/procedural flaws, faulty hardware changes/updates and overloads.  Figure 10 shows the frequency of detailed causes across incident reports for 2021 and the  corresponding lost user hours.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  14  Figure 9: Detailed root causes – Telecom security incidents in 2021  3.3.1.1 Breakdown of root causes  The graphs below break down the main root causes of system failures in terms of detailed causes  and show the total number of incidents and user hours lost for each detailed cause.  It is noteworthy to mention that the thrice reported EU-wide OTT communication services  incident concerning a faulty hardware update has significantly skewed the results concerning  lost user hours. This is to be expected given the EU-wide user base affected and the fact that  the same incident was reported three times by three distinct MS. Accordingly, more clarification  of the incident reporting process concerning OTT communication services and cross-border,  EU-wide incidents is required.  What follows is an overview of detailed causes and user hours lost for each category of incident  in an effort to provide clarity and transparency for specific root causes, which differ significantly  between categories of incidents.

Conversely, in 2021 ten DDoS related incidents  were reported, leading to a loss of 55 million user hours.  Figure 15: Services affected – Telecom security incidents in 2021  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  18  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section the services affected by incidents are examined. For the sixth year in a row, most  of the reported incidents affected mobile services. In 2021, around 45% of reported incidents  had an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift observed over  the last few years from fixed telephony, which was most affected service only in the early years  of reporting.  It is also important to note that in comparison to 2020 reported incidents affecting OTT services  rose to 4% of all reported incidents in 2021. This highlights the growing maturity in the reporting  of such incidents, albeit needing more clarifications in terms of procedures and processes given  the particular thrice reported incident mentioned above.  Note that for most reported incidents there was an impact on more than one service, which  explains why the percentages in Figure 15 add up to more than 100%.  3.5 TECHNICAL ASSETS AFFECTED  Each incident report also describes the (secondary) assets affected during the incident. Figure  16 shows the assets most affected.  Figure 16: Assets affected – Telecom security incidents 2021  It is also noticeable, taking into account incidents over the last 5 years as seen in Figure 17, that  switches and routers as well as mobile base stations and controllers are the two assets that  have been affected the most in recent years.

DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS OF THE  TECHNICAL CAUSES OF  INCIDENTS  This section contains an in-depth review of the most high-profile technical causes behind  reported incidents, focussing not only on 2021 but also on previous years.  4.1 HARDWARE FAILURES  In 2021, 31 incidents (18% of total) were marked as hardware failures and they resulted in 53  million user hours lost (1% of the total) as seen in Figure 18. All of them were reported as  system failures.  Figure 18: Incidents with hardware failures as root cause – Telecom security incidents in the  EU in 2021  4.2 SOFTWARE BUGS  In 2021, 26 incidents (15% of total) were marked as being due to software bugs and they  resulted in 216 million user hours lost (4% of the total) as can be seen in Figure 19. All but one  of them were reported as system failures, with one incident being reported as due to human  error.  53 M user hours  lost due to  hardware failures  in 2021, 1% of the  total  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  21  Figure 19: Incidents having software bugs as root cause – Telecom security incidents in the EU  in 2021  4.3 FAULTY SOFTWARE CHANGES/UPDATES  In 2021, 15% of total incidents (26 incidents) were marked as due to faulty software changes or  updates resulting in 225 million user hours lost (4% of the total) as can be seen in Figure 20.

MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section multi- annual trends over the last 11 years, from 2012 to 2021, are presented. This dataset contains  1,431 reported incidents in total (see Figure 21). Over the course of the last 5 years, the number  of incidents has been stabilising at around the 160 mark per annum.  Figure 21: Number of incidents reported per year (2012-2021)  5.1 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS – CATEGORIES OF ROOT CAUSES  Every year from 2012 to 2021, system failures were the most common root cause. In 2021,  however, system failures showed stabilisation and a slight decrease, continuing the trend first  observed in 2020 as seen in Figure 22.  In total, system failures accounted for 925 incident reports (64% of the total). For this root cause  category, over the last 11 years, the most common causes were hardware failures (34%) and  software bugs (27%). The second most common root cause over the 11 years of reporting is  human errors with nearly a fifth of total incidents (19%, 286 incidents in total). Natural  phenomena come third at almost a tenth of total incidents (9%, 139 incidents in total).  Only 5% of incidents have been categorised as malicious actions (73 incidents over the course  of 11 years). In the period 2012-2021 nearly two thirds of malicious actions consisted of Denial  of Service attacks (64%), while the remainder were mainly comprised of lasting damage to  physical infrastructure, e.g. arson, cable cuts, etc. Only 4% was attributed to malware and  viruses (see Figure 23).  Interestingly, the assets affected by malicious actions differ significantly from the overall  categorisation of affected assets. Addressing servers came first with 23%, followed by switches  and routers at 18% (see Figure 24). Moreover, 63% referred to fixed Internet services and 41%  to mobile Internet services, whereas 2% referred to OTT services.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  23  Figure 22: Root cause categories - Telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012- 2021  Figure 23: Technical causes for incidents due to malicious actions – Telecom security incidents  in the EU reported over 2012-2021  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  24  Figure 24: Assets affected by incidents due to malicious actions – Telecom security incidents in  the EU reported over 2012-2021  5.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - IMPACT FOR EACH SERVICE  In 2021, mobile networks and services were once more the most impacted by incidents.  However there was a decrease compared to 2019 and 2020 and, interestingly, the statistics in  terms of services affected are converging for both fixed and mobile. More importantly, in 2021  reporting of incidents related to OTT communication services took place (in contrast to 2020  where no such incidents were reported). In addition, the increase in broadcast related incidents  that was observed for two years in a row (2019 and 2020) persists also in 2021.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  25  Figure 25: Trends on impact for each service reported over 2012-2021  5.3 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - USER HOURS FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE  In terms of overall impact, as indicated in Figure 26, human errors have been steadily  increasing since 2016. In 2020, their share in terms of impact was almost the same as system  failures. In 2021, given the particularities of OTT incident reporting that were previously  analysed, the results are heavily skewed towards human errors.  The overall impact of natural phenomena has been trending down over the last three years after  peaking in 2018 (caused by extreme weather and wildfires). Notably, the impact of malicious  actions is steadily rising, reaching a 5-year high of 70 million lost user hours in 2021.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  26  Figure 26: User hours lost for each category of root causes - multi-annual 2012-2021 (user hours  lost)  5.4 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS FOR THE SEVERITY OF IMPACT OF  INCIDENTS  Over the last 5 years a noteworthy and constant decrease in reports of incidents with very large  severity has been observed. ENISA has published technical guidelines on incident reporting  under the EECC7, including on thresholds, severity estimation and calculating hours lost.  Conversely, there has been a steady increase in minor and large incidents. These findings point  on one hand to the growing maturity of electronic communication providers with respect to the  incident reporting process and on the other hand to the improvement of resilience and the  provision of security services (including incident reporting itself) that has led to a lower number  of very large severe incidents.  Relevant multi-annual trends may be found in Figure 27.  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc, March 2021  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  27  Figure 27: Severity of impact for each year - multi-annual trends 2012-2021 (number of  incidents)  5.5 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS FOR THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AND  USER HOURS LOST  Over the years, the number of incidents has increased steadily and is now stabilising at around  160-170 a year.

CONCLUSIONS  This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2021, covers the incidents  reported by the authorities for the calendar year 2021 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. It marks the 11th time ENISA has published an  annual report for the telecom sector. To conclude here are the main findings and some general  observations about this process and the broader policy context.  MAIN FINDINGS  • Reporting of incidents related to OTT services requires further attention. Four per  cent of reported incidents in 2021 refer to OTT services. The same EU-wide OTT  incident was reported three times by three different MS in three different ways, so there  is a need for clarification on who reports such incidents, which authority is in charge  and what information is to be reported. The results of 2021 incident reporting are  skewed because of the huge impact of this incident which was reported three times.  • For the first time, incidents concerning confidentiality and authenticity were  reported. The reporting of such incidents was a new provision of the EECC and in this  respect no such incidents were reported in the previous years. Three relevant incidents  were reported in 2021 and this number is expected to grow in the coming years.  • Malicious actions doubled in 2021. In 2020, incidents marked as malicious actions  represented 4% of the total, a number which rose to 8% in 2021. Moreover, it is  interesting to highlight the significant increase in DDoS attacks compared to 2020  when only four such incidents had been reported resulting in one million user hours  lost. By comparison, in 2021 ten DDoS related incidents were reported, leading to a  loss of 55 million user hours. These results are consistent with the findings of the  ENISA Threat Landscape that point to an increase in DDoS attacks and, in general, an  increase in attacks against the availability of services.  • System failures continued to dominate in terms of impact, but the downward  trend continued. System failures accounted for 363 million user hours lost compared  to 419 million user hours lost in 2020. Despite the skewed nature of the results for  2021, it is noteworthy that there was a 14% decrease in user hours lost, whereas in  terms of the number of incidents in 2021 they represent 59% of the total compared to  61% in 2020. This highlights the growing maturity of electronic communication  providers in handling and containing the impact of system failures.  • Incidents caused by human errors remained at the same level as in 2020. Around  a quarter (23%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause (slightly  decreased compared to the 26% of 2020). However 91% of the total user hours lost  were due to this kind of incident. These results however are skewed due to the OTT  incident reporting issues mentioned above.  • In 2021, a noteworthy decrease in incidents that were flagged as third-party  failures was observed. Only 22% of the incidents were reported as being related to  third-party failures compared to 29% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. No third-party failures  related to malicious actions were reported. Overall, this finding suggests that electronic  communication providers have started introducing targeted security controls to better  protect their supply chains, echoing the relevant ENISA calls for attention8.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS  • At the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into  effect across the EU. Some countries have already implemented the EECC but many  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  29  are still transposing. Transposing the EECC and implementing its provisions will be a  key focus for ENISA and the national authorities this year and in the coming years.  • In May 2022, there was a political agreement on the Network and Information Security  (NIS) Directive 2. The official text is expected in the course of 2022 with an expected  transposition deadline of 21 months for MS. The NIS 2 brings significant changes to  security incident reporting in the EU by consolidating all relevant streams under the  NIS 2 umbrella, namely consolidating incident reporting under EECC, NIS2 and eIDAS  regulations among others. ENISA will be working with national authorities and  regulators in the coming years on how to implement the consolidated reporting of  incidents under NIS2.  • Under Article 40 of the EECC, the incident reporting provisions have changed slightly9.  For instance, under the EECC, mandatory incident reporting also applies to  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).  To address these changes ENISA published a new incident reporting guideline at the  start of 2020. From 2021, these changes were beginning to be seen in the reporting  data. However, issues still persist as was evident from the EU-wide incident that was  reported by three MS and was done so in three different ways. Taking into account the  different reporting thresholds of Member States, there needs to be more clarity and  coordination on how cross-border incidents are reported, by whom and using what  thresholds. ENISA will work closely with national authorities and regulators to find an  optimal way to address this issue.  • One issue that was observed in 2020 and persists in 2021 is that many smaller-scale  incidents, however frequent, remain under the radar. Some of these incidents, such as  targeted DDoS attacks, SIM Swapping and SS7 attacks, can still have major impacts  on individual customers. In coming years, this area needs to be analysed better with  the possible introduction of a summary reporting format for these smaller scale  incidents. To begin with, in 2022, bulk incident reporting using machine-readable  formats was introduced to CIRAS in order to facilitate reporting and alleviate the  administrative burden.  • The 5G roll out will continue to require a lot of attention, both from authorities and from  the providers. At ENISA, the focus is on supporting the national authorities in the  ENISA ECASEC group and in the NIS Cooperation group, with technical guidance,  and also by organising dedicated seminars and panels.  ENISA looks forward to continuing its close collaboration with EU Member States, the  national telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe to  implement security incident reporting efficiently and effectively.  9 Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting under the EECC — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TP -0  7- 22  -7 11  -E N  -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

CONCLUSIONS 28  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In the EU, telecom operators notify significant security incidents to their national authorities. At  the start of every calendar year, the national authorities send a summary of these reports to  ENISA. This report, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2021, provides anonymised  and aggregated information about major telecom security incidents in 2021.  The reporting of security incidents has been part of the EU’s regulatory framework for telecoms  since the 2009 reform of the telecoms package. Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The European Electronic Communications Code  (EECC) (2018/1972) repeals and replaces the Framework Directive. It reinforces the provisions  for reporting incidents, clarifying what incidents fall within its scope and the notification criteria.  STATISTICS EXTRACTED FROM THE ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORTING  PROCESS 2021  The 2021 annual summary contains reports of 168 incidents submitted by national authorities  from 26 EU Member States (MS) and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost, derived by  multiplying for each incident the number of users by the number of hours, was 5,106 million user  hours, a huge increase compared to 841 million user hours lost in 2020. These numbers are  clearly much higher compared to those of previous years, as can be seen in the following  graphic.The reason for this is the impact of a notable EU-wide incident that was reported  separately by three MS. ENISA has published technical guidelines on incident reporting under  the EECC1, including on thresholds and calculating hours lost.  Figure 1: Number of incidents submitted by countries and user hours lost each year (2012- 2021)  THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM INCIDENTS IN 2021  • Reporting of incidents related to OTT services requires further attention. Four per  cent of reported incidents in 2021 refer to OTT communication services (4,16%). The  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc, March 2021  In 2021, 7% of the  total user hours  lost were due to  system failures  and an excessive  amount was lost  due to human  errors (90%).  The downwards  trend concerning  impact on mobile  telephony that  commenced in  2019 continued in  2021.  The total user  hours lost in 2021  was 5,106 million  user hours.  Over the course of  11 years, EU  Member States  reported a total of  1,431 telecom  security incidents.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  4  same EU-wide OTT incident was reported three times by three different MS in three  different ways, so there is a need for clarity as to who reports such incidents, which  authority is in charge and what information is reported. The results of incident reporting  in 2021 are skewed because of the huge impact caused by this incident being reported  three times.  • For the first time, incidents concerning confidentiality and authenticity were  reported. The reporting of such incidents was a new provision of EECC and in this  respect no such incidents were reported in previous years. Three relevant incidents  were reported in 2021 and this number is expected to grow in coming years.  • Malicious actions doubled in 2021. In 2020, incidents marked as malicious actions  represented 4% of the total, a number which rose to 8% in 2021. Moreover, it is  interesting to highlight the significant increase in DDoS attacks compared to 2020  when only four such incidents had been reported resulting in 1 million user hours lost.  By comparison, in 2021 ten DDoS related incidents were reported, leading to a loss of  55 million user hours. These results are consistent with the findings of the ENISA  Threat Landscape that point to an increase in DDoS attacks and a general increase in  attacks against availability of services.  • System failures continue to dominate in terms of impact but the downward trend  continues. System failures accounted for 363 million user hours lost compared to 419  million user hours in 2020. Despite the skewed nature of the 2021 results, it is  noteworthy that there was a 14% decrease in user hours lost, whereas in terms of the  number of incidents in 2021 they represent 59% of the total compared to 61% in 2020.  This highlights the growing maturity of electronic communication providers in handling  and containing the impact of system failures.  • Incidents caused by human errors remain at the same level as in 2020. Around a  quarter (23%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause (a slight decrease  compared to 26% in 2020), however 91% of the total user hours lost have been lost  due to this kind of incident. These results however are skewed due to the OTT  communication services incident reporting issues mentioned above.  • In 2021, there was a noteworthy decrease in incidents flagged as failures by third  parties. Only 22% of incidents were reported as being related to third-party failures  compared to 29% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. No third-party failures related to malicious  actions were reported. Overall, the finding suggests that electronic communication  providers have started introducing targeted security controls to better protect their  supply chains, echoing the relevant ENISA calls for attention2.  2 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  5  Figure 2: Share of users’ hours lost for each root cause category  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing incidents, which can be used to generate  custom graphs. See: https:/ciras.enisa.europa.eu.  MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS OVER THE LAST DECADE  For more than a decade now, ENISA and the national authorities in EU Member States have  been collecting and analysing telecom security incident reports. Over the course of 11 years,  EU Member States reported 1,431 telecom security incidents. ENISA stores these in a tool  called CIRAS (Cybersecurity Incident Reporting and Analysis System) and the statistics are  accessible online.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  6  Figure 3: Root cause categories for telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012- 2021 period  Over the last couple of years, the following trends have been noted:  • Number of incidents is stabilising: the total number of incidents reported is  stabilising at around 160 annually. Over the period 2014-2021, a consistent over the  years number of incidents have been reported and this is stabilising at around 160  incidents per year.  • Malicious actions continue to constitute a minority of incidents: over the reporting  period, the frequency of malicious actions was stable (accounting for approximately 5%  of incidents each year, although in 2021 there was a spike at 8%). Their impact in  terms of user hours was stable also.  Currently the focus of the national authorities for telecom security is on the transposition and  implementation of the EECC, which brings several changes. The incident reporting  requirements in Article 40 of the EECC have a broader scope including explicitly, for example,  breaches of confidentiality. In addition, the arrival of the Network and Information Security (NIS)  Directive 2 in 2022 is expected to be a game changer in incident reporting, since it consolidates  the reporting of security breaches across a variety of legislations including but not limited to the  EECC.  Moreover, in the context of the new EECC, targeted attacks involving for instance those using  SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping frauds, attacks using the Flubot malware or even  more extended attacks that cause no outages, such as wiretapping or a BGP hijack, would be  reportable under Article 40 of the EECC.  ENISA will continue to work with national authorities as well as the NIS Cooperation group to  find and exploit synergies between different pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes  to incident reporting and cross-border supervision.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents that have a  significant impact on the continuity of electronic communication services to the national telecom  regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary  to ENISA, covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most significant incidents, based on a  set of agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2021,  aggregates the incident reports received in 2021 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 11th year ENISA is publishing an annual incidents report for the telecom sector.  ENISA started publishing these annual reports in 2012. Mandatory incident reporting has been  part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package:  Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  The mandatory reporting of incidents under Article 13a had a specific focus on security  incidents with a significant impact on the functioning of each category of telecommunication  services. Over the years, the regulatory authorities have agreed to focus mostly on  network/service outages (type A incidents). This would exclude from the scope of these reports  targeted attacks, e.g. those involving the use of SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping  frauds, or even more extended attacks that nevertheless do not cause outages.  The relevant update of the EU telecom rules, namely the European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC), that was expected to be harmonised in Member States by the end of 2020,  includes a broader scope on the requirements for incident reporting in Article 40. These  requirements explicitly include, for example, breaches of confidentiality. 2021 is the second time  ENISA has also received three type B reports of incidents (breaches of confidentiality).  This document is structured as follows: in section 2, the policy context and background is  provided. The reporting procedure is briefly summarised. In addition, the types of incidents that  get reported are described. Some specific but anonymised examples of incidents that occurred  in 2021 are also discussed. In Section 3, key facts and statistics about incidents in 2021 are  provided. In Section 4, there is a closer look at faulty software changes, and in section 5 a look  at multi-annual trends over the years 2012-2021.  It is important to note that the telecom security incidents that are reported to national authorities  are only the major incidents, i.e. those with significant impacts. Smaller incidents, affecting small  percentages of population such as SIM Swapping attacks are not reported.  Note that conclusions about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with  a degree of caution as national reporting thresholds change over the years. Indeed reporting  thresholds have been lowered in most countries in recent years and, as mentioned, reporting  only covers the most significant incidents (and not smaller incidents that may well be more  frequent).  This is the 11th  ENISA annual  incident report for  the telecom sector.  Mandatory incident  reporting has been  part of the EU’s  telecom regulatory  framework since  2009.  Reform of the  telecom package:  Article 13a of the  Framework  directive  (2009/140/EC) has  been further  expanded in the  European  Electronic  Communications  Code.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  8  2. BACKGROUND AND POLICY  CONTEXT  In this chapter the policy context is explained as well as the main features of the incident  reporting process, as described in Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting3, which  was developed in collaboration with national authorities.  2.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Security incident reporting is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and it is an important  enabler for the supervision of cybersecurity and for policymaking at national and EU level. Since  2016 security incident reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU under  Article 19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS Directive (NISD), security incident  reporting became mandatory for Operators of Essential Services in the EU and for Digital  Service Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS directive.  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into effect  across the EU, but was only implemented into national legislation in some EU countries. The  year 2021 saw progress in the implementation of EECC by MS; however the process has not  yet been completed.  Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a broader scope,  including not only outages but also, for instance, breaches of confidentiality. In addition, there  are more services within the scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom operators  but also, for example, over-the-top providers of communications services4 (such as messaging  services like Viber and WhatsApp, etc.).  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline was updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA. These combine quantitative and qualitative parameters as well as  the notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet  and telephony, but also number-based interpersonal communications services and/or number  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services)5.  It is, nevertheless, important to note that the main characteristic of 2020 and 2021 was the  COVID-19 pandemic, which radically transformed the way people around the globe live and  work, turning everything digital. As such, there was extensive supervision from the European  Commission on the reporting by all Member States of incidents of network congestion.  Comparing incident reporting results from 2019 and before, it is fair to conclude that the  European telecommunication networks have shown robustness and resilience.  2.2 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a of the Framework Directive and Article 40 of the EECC provides for three types of  incident reporting:  1) National incident reporting from providers to NRAs,  2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and  3 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  4 See Security supervision changes in the new EU telecoms legislation — ENISA (europa.eu)  5 See When & How to Report Security Incidents — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-supervision-changes-in-the-new-eu-telecoms-legislation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/when-how-to-report-security-incidents  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  9  3) Annual summary reporting from national authorities to the EC and ENISA.  The different types of reporting are shown in Figure 4.  Figure 4: Incident reporting under EECC article 40  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymising, aggregating and  analysing the incident reports. In the current setup, NRAs can search incidents in the reporting  tool (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making  the overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.3 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  ENISA maintains an incident reporting tool, CIRAS, for the authorities where they can upload  reports and search for and study specific incidents.  For the public, ENISA also offers an online visual tool, which is publicly accessible and can be  used for custom analysis of the data: https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/. This tool anonymises the  country or operator involved.  The reporting template starts with a selector for the type of incident and contains three parts:  1. Impact of the incident  ̶  communication services impacted and by how much;  2. Nature of the incident  ̶ the cause of the incident;  3. Details of the incident  ̶  detailed information about the incident, including a short  description, the types of network, the types of assets, the severity level etc.  CIRAS  is a free online tool where ENISA stores  reported incidents and provides annual  and multi-annual statistics.  https://ciras.enisa.europa.eu/  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  10  The type selector distinguishes six types of cybersecurity incidents (see Figure 5). The different  types are explained below.  Figure 5: Types of cybersecurity incidents  Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability). For example, an outage caused by a cable  cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for building a new road  would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity). For  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the  endpoints participating in the shared session. This leads to the interception of the  media (voice, pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This  incident would be categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact on  the service). For example, a malware has been detected on several workstations and  servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be categorised  as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw). For instance, the  discovery of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system). For example, when  one of two redundant submarine cables breaks would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures). For instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would be  categorised as a type F incident.  For more information about the incident reporting process, please refer to ‘Technical Guideline  on Incident Reporting under the EECC’6  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  11  3. ANALYSIS OF INCIDENTS  For the year 2021, 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in the annual  reporting process, describing 168 significant incidents (compared to 170 in 2020). In this  section, the 168 reported incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact on each root  cause category is analysed in section 3.1. In section 3.2 the focus is on the user hours that  were lost in each root cause category. Detailed causes are then examined in Section 3.3, and in  Section 3.4 the impact on each service is analysed.  One of the highlights of incident reporting under the EECC in 2021 is the fact that for the first  time three out of the 168 incidents were marked as Type B, namely as impacting confidentiality  and authenticity of services. All the other incidents impacted availability and were thus marked  as Type A. Incidents of the other 4 types were not reported in 2021.  3.1 CATEGORIES OF ROOT CAUSES  In 2021, there was a slight drop in incidents related to both system failures and human errors,  the two categories which consistently rank the highest (see Figure 6). About 23% of security  incidents were caused by human errors (compared to 26% in 2020) and 59% of telecom  incidents were marked as system failures, a slight decrease compared to 2020 (61%). Notably,  malicious actions almost doubled in the course of 2021 (8%) compared to 2020 (4%) and  natural phenomena remained consistent with 2020 (10% in 2021 up slightly from 9% in 2020).  Figure 6: Root cause categories – Telecom security Incidents in 2021  In 2021, there was a noteworthy decrease in incidents that were flagged as third-party failures.  Only 22% of the incidents were reported as being related to third-party failures compared to  29% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. No third-party failures related to malicious actions were  reported, while the majority of them was related to system failures (see Figure 7).  168  telecom  security  incidents  reported in  2021 by EU  Member  States.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  12  Figure 7: Root cause categories – Telecom security incidents in 2021 (third-party failures)  3.2 USER HOURS LOST IN EACH CATEGORY OF ROOT CAUSES  Adding up total user hours lost for each root cause category (see Figure 8) shows that more  than 90% of the total user hours lost were due to human errors (91%; 4,632 million user hours),  up from 40% and 351 million user hours in 2020. This is due to the fact that a particular incident  affecting an OTT (Over-The-Top) communication service provider was reported three times by  three different MS and in three different ways (i.e. incident data differences) since it impacted  services across the EU.  This raises the issue of cross-border and EU-wide incidents and how they should be reported  under the EECC, in particular for OTT communication service providers who by nature are not  generally restricted to a single MS. 4442 user hours were lost due to human errors in the case  of OTT communication service providers and 7M due to system failures.  System failures accounted for 7% of the cases (363 million user hours lost) compared to 50%  and 419 million lost user hours in 2020. Despite the skewed nature of the results in 2021, it is  noteworthy that there was a 14% decrease in user hours lost relared to system failures, a trend  observed since 2019. This highlights the growing maturity of electronic communication providers  in handling and containing the impact of system failures.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  13  Figure 8: Share of user hours lost for each root cause category  It is interesting to note the impact of incidents related to malicious actions on lost user hours.  Interestingly, in 2021 lost user hours increased five times (from 13 million lost user hours in  2019 and 2020 to 70 million lost user hours in 2021). While the number of incidents doubled in  2021 compared to 2020, the significant increase in their related impact highlights the need to  take further action in containing the adverse effect of such incidents.  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES AND USER HOURS LOST  Detailed causes for all incidents are tracked, in addition to root cause categories (Figure 9). An  incident is often a chain of events. For instance, an incident may be triggered by a storm, which  tears down power supply infrastructure, cutting cables and thus power, which in turn results in a  telecom outage. In this example, the root cause of the incident would be natural phenomena  and the detailed causes would be: Heavy wind, Cable cut, Power cut, Battery depletion.  The most frequent detailed cause appearing in incident reports for 2021 is hardware failures  followed by faulty software changes/updates and software bugs. In addition, many incident  reports mention policy/procedural flaws, faulty hardware changes/updates and overloads.  Figure 10 shows the frequency of detailed causes across incident reports for 2021 and the  corresponding lost user hours.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  14  Figure 9: Detailed root causes – Telecom security incidents in 2021  3.3.1.1 Breakdown of root causes  The graphs below break down the main root causes of system failures in terms of detailed causes  and show the total number of incidents and user hours lost for each detailed cause.  It is noteworthy to mention that the thrice reported EU-wide OTT communication services  incident concerning a faulty hardware update has significantly skewed the results concerning  lost user hours. This is to be expected given the EU-wide user base affected and the fact that  the same incident was reported three times by three distinct MS. Accordingly, more clarification  of the incident reporting process concerning OTT communication services and cross-border,  EU-wide incidents is required.  What follows is an overview of detailed causes and user hours lost for each category of incident  in an effort to provide clarity and transparency for specific root causes, which differ significantly  between categories of incidents.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  15  Figure 10: Root causes of incidents vs user hours lost – Telecom security incidents in 2021  3.3.1.2 Breakdown of System failures  Figure 11: Root causes of system failure incidents vs user hours lost – Telecom security  incidents in 2021 (system failures)  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  16  3.3.1.3 Breakdown of Human errors  Figure 12: Root causes of human error incidents vs user hours lost – Telecom security  incidents in 2021 (human errors)  3.3.1.4 Breakdown of natural phenomena  Figure 13: Root causes of natural phenomena incidents vs user hours lost – Telecom security  incidents in 2021 (natural phenomena)  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  17  3.3.1.5 Breakdown of malicious actions  Figure 14: Root causes of malicious action incidents vs user hours lost – Telecom security  incidents in 2021 (malicious actions)  When it comes to malicious actions it is interesting to highlight the significant increase in DDoS  (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks compared to 2020 when only four such incidents were  reported resulting in one million user hours lost. Conversely, in 2021 ten DDoS related incidents  were reported, leading to a loss of 55 million user hours.  Figure 15: Services affected – Telecom security incidents in 2021  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  18  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section the services affected by incidents are examined. For the sixth year in a row, most  of the reported incidents affected mobile services. In 2021, around 45% of reported incidents  had an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift observed over  the last few years from fixed telephony, which was most affected service only in the early years  of reporting.  It is also important to note that in comparison to 2020 reported incidents affecting OTT services  rose to 4% of all reported incidents in 2021. This highlights the growing maturity in the reporting  of such incidents, albeit needing more clarifications in terms of procedures and processes given  the particular thrice reported incident mentioned above.  Note that for most reported incidents there was an impact on more than one service, which  explains why the percentages in Figure 15 add up to more than 100%.  3.5 TECHNICAL ASSETS AFFECTED  Each incident report also describes the (secondary) assets affected during the incident. Figure  16 shows the assets most affected.  Figure 16: Assets affected – Telecom security incidents 2021  It is also noticeable, taking into account incidents over the last 5 years as seen in Figure 17, that  switches and routers as well as mobile base stations and controllers are the two assets that  have been affected the most in recent years.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  19  Figure 17: Assets affected – Telecom security incidents 2017-2021  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  20  4. DEEP DIVE ANALYSIS OF THE  TECHNICAL CAUSES OF  INCIDENTS  This section contains an in-depth review of the most high-profile technical causes behind  reported incidents, focussing not only on 2021 but also on previous years.  4.1 HARDWARE FAILURES  In 2021, 31 incidents (18% of total) were marked as hardware failures and they resulted in 53  million user hours lost (1% of the total) as seen in Figure 18. All of them were reported as  system failures.  Figure 18: Incidents with hardware failures as root cause – Telecom security incidents in the  EU in 2021  4.2 SOFTWARE BUGS  In 2021, 26 incidents (15% of total) were marked as being due to software bugs and they  resulted in 216 million user hours lost (4% of the total) as can be seen in Figure 19. All but one  of them were reported as system failures, with one incident being reported as due to human  error.  53 M user hours  lost due to  hardware failures  in 2021, 1% of the  total  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  21  Figure 19: Incidents having software bugs as root cause – Telecom security incidents in the EU  in 2021  4.3 FAULTY SOFTWARE CHANGES/UPDATES  In 2021, 15% of total incidents (26 incidents) were marked as due to faulty software changes or  updates resulting in 225 million user hours lost (4% of the total) as can be seen in Figure 20.  Figure 20: Incidents having faulty software changes/updates as their root cause – Telecom  security incidents in the EU in 2021  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  22  5. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section multi- annual trends over the last 11 years, from 2012 to 2021, are presented. This dataset contains  1,431 reported incidents in total (see Figure 21). Over the course of the last 5 years, the number  of incidents has been stabilising at around the 160 mark per annum.  Figure 21: Number of incidents reported per year (2012-2021)  5.1 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS – CATEGORIES OF ROOT CAUSES  Every year from 2012 to 2021, system failures were the most common root cause. In 2021,  however, system failures showed stabilisation and a slight decrease, continuing the trend first  observed in 2020 as seen in Figure 22.  In total, system failures accounted for 925 incident reports (64% of the total). For this root cause  category, over the last 11 years, the most common causes were hardware failures (34%) and  software bugs (27%). The second most common root cause over the 11 years of reporting is  human errors with nearly a fifth of total incidents (19%, 286 incidents in total). Natural  phenomena come third at almost a tenth of total incidents (9%, 139 incidents in total).  Only 5% of incidents have been categorised as malicious actions (73 incidents over the course  of 11 years). In the period 2012-2021 nearly two thirds of malicious actions consisted of Denial  of Service attacks (64%), while the remainder were mainly comprised of lasting damage to  physical infrastructure, e.g. arson, cable cuts, etc. Only 4% was attributed to malware and  viruses (see Figure 23).  Interestingly, the assets affected by malicious actions differ significantly from the overall  categorisation of affected assets. Addressing servers came first with 23%, followed by switches  and routers at 18% (see Figure 24). Moreover, 63% referred to fixed Internet services and 41%  to mobile Internet services, whereas 2% referred to OTT services.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  23  Figure 22: Root cause categories - Telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012- 2021  Figure 23: Technical causes for incidents due to malicious actions – Telecom security incidents  in the EU reported over 2012-2021  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  24  Figure 24: Assets affected by incidents due to malicious actions – Telecom security incidents in  the EU reported over 2012-2021  5.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - IMPACT FOR EACH SERVICE  In 2021, mobile networks and services were once more the most impacted by incidents.  However there was a decrease compared to 2019 and 2020 and, interestingly, the statistics in  terms of services affected are converging for both fixed and mobile. More importantly, in 2021  reporting of incidents related to OTT communication services took place (in contrast to 2020  where no such incidents were reported). In addition, the increase in broadcast related incidents  that was observed for two years in a row (2019 and 2020) persists also in 2021.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  25  Figure 25: Trends on impact for each service reported over 2012-2021  5.3 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - USER HOURS FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE  In terms of overall impact, as indicated in Figure 26, human errors have been steadily  increasing since 2016. In 2020, their share in terms of impact was almost the same as system  failures. In 2021, given the particularities of OTT incident reporting that were previously  analysed, the results are heavily skewed towards human errors.  The overall impact of natural phenomena has been trending down over the last three years after  peaking in 2018 (caused by extreme weather and wildfires). Notably, the impact of malicious  actions is steadily rising, reaching a 5-year high of 70 million lost user hours in 2021.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  26  Figure 26: User hours lost for each category of root causes - multi-annual 2012-2021 (user hours  lost)  5.4 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS FOR THE SEVERITY OF IMPACT OF  INCIDENTS  Over the last 5 years a noteworthy and constant decrease in reports of incidents with very large  severity has been observed. ENISA has published technical guidelines on incident reporting  under the EECC7, including on thresholds, severity estimation and calculating hours lost.  Conversely, there has been a steady increase in minor and large incidents. These findings point  on one hand to the growing maturity of electronic communication providers with respect to the  incident reporting process and on the other hand to the improvement of resilience and the  provision of security services (including incident reporting itself) that has led to a lower number  of very large severe incidents.  Relevant multi-annual trends may be found in Figure 27.  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc, March 2021  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  27  Figure 27: Severity of impact for each year - multi-annual trends 2012-2021 (number of  incidents)  5.5 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS FOR THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AND  USER HOURS LOST  Over the years, the number of incidents has increased steadily and is now stabilising at around  160-170 a year.

CONCLUSIONS  This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2021, covers the incidents  reported by the authorities for the calendar year 2021 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. It marks the 11th time ENISA has published an  annual report for the telecom sector. To conclude here are the main findings and some general  observations about this process and the broader policy context.  MAIN FINDINGS  • Reporting of incidents related to OTT services requires further attention. Four per  cent of reported incidents in 2021 refer to OTT services. The same EU-wide OTT  incident was reported three times by three different MS in three different ways, so there  is a need for clarification on who reports such incidents, which authority is in charge  and what information is to be reported. The results of 2021 incident reporting are  skewed because of the huge impact of this incident which was reported three times.  • For the first time, incidents concerning confidentiality and authenticity were  reported. The reporting of such incidents was a new provision of the EECC and in this  respect no such incidents were reported in the previous years. Three relevant incidents  were reported in 2021 and this number is expected to grow in the coming years.  • Malicious actions doubled in 2021. In 2020, incidents marked as malicious actions  represented 4% of the total, a number which rose to 8% in 2021. Moreover, it is  interesting to highlight the significant increase in DDoS attacks compared to 2020  when only four such incidents had been reported resulting in one million user hours  lost. By comparison, in 2021 ten DDoS related incidents were reported, leading to a  loss of 55 million user hours. These results are consistent with the findings of the  ENISA Threat Landscape that point to an increase in DDoS attacks and, in general, an  increase in attacks against the availability of services.  • System failures continued to dominate in terms of impact, but the downward  trend continued. System failures accounted for 363 million user hours lost compared  to 419 million user hours lost in 2020. Despite the skewed nature of the results for  2021, it is noteworthy that there was a 14% decrease in user hours lost, whereas in  terms of the number of incidents in 2021 they represent 59% of the total compared to  61% in 2020. This highlights the growing maturity of electronic communication  providers in handling and containing the impact of system failures.  • Incidents caused by human errors remained at the same level as in 2020. Around  a quarter (23%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause (slightly  decreased compared to the 26% of 2020). However 91% of the total user hours lost  were due to this kind of incident. These results however are skewed due to the OTT  incident reporting issues mentioned above.  • In 2021, a noteworthy decrease in incidents that were flagged as third-party  failures was observed. Only 22% of the incidents were reported as being related to  third-party failures compared to 29% in 2020 and 32% in 2019. No third-party failures  related to malicious actions were reported. Overall, this finding suggests that electronic  communication providers have started introducing targeted security controls to better  protect their supply chains, echoing the relevant ENISA calls for attention8.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS  • At the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into  effect across the EU. Some countries have already implemented the EECC but many  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2021  July 2022  29  are still transposing. Transposing the EECC and implementing its provisions will be a  key focus for ENISA and the national authorities this year and in the coming years.  • In May 2022, there was a political agreement on the Network and Information Security  (NIS) Directive 2. The official text is expected in the course of 2022 with an expected  transposition deadline of 21 months for MS. The NIS 2 brings significant changes to  security incident reporting in the EU by consolidating all relevant streams under the  NIS 2 umbrella, namely consolidating incident reporting under EECC, NIS2 and eIDAS  regulations among others. ENISA will be working with national authorities and  regulators in the coming years on how to implement the consolidated reporting of  incidents under NIS2.  • Under Article 40 of the EECC, the incident reporting provisions have changed slightly9.  For instance, under the EECC, mandatory incident reporting also applies to  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).  To address these changes ENISA published a new incident reporting guideline at the  start of 2020. From 2021, these changes were beginning to be seen in the reporting  data. However, issues still persist as was evident from the EU-wide incident that was  reported by three MS and was done so in three different ways. Taking into account the  different reporting thresholds of Member States, there needs to be more clarity and  coordination on how cross-border incidents are reported, by whom and using what  thresholds. ENISA will work closely with national authorities and regulators to find an  optimal way to address this issue.  • One issue that was observed in 2020 and persists in 2021 is that many smaller-scale  incidents, however frequent, remain under the radar. Some of these incidents, such as  targeted DDoS attacks, SIM Swapping and SS7 attacks, can still have major impacts  on individual customers. In coming years, this area needs to be analysed better with  the possible introduction of a summary reporting format for these smaller scale  incidents. To begin with, in 2022, bulk incident reporting using machine-readable  formats was introduced to CIRAS in order to facilitate reporting and alleviate the  administrative burden.  • The 5G roll out will continue to require a lot of attention, both from authorities and from  the providers. At ENISA, the focus is on supporting the national authorities in the  ENISA ECASEC group and in the NIS Cooperation group, with technical guidance,  and also by organising dedicated seminars and panels.  ENISA looks forward to continuing its close collaboration with EU Member States, the  national telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe to  implement security incident reporting efficiently and effectively.  9 Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting under the EECC — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TP -0  7- 22  -7 11  -E N  -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

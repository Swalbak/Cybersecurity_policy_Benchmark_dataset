This will lead in persistent exposure to  vulnerabilities and lack of possibility to update peripherals or third party applications.  1 Introduction  Frequently, cyber-security incidents are caused by unpatched software systems which are vulnerable  to widely accessible exploits. This is the case even when the patches  are available in the moment of  the attack. There are cases when such attacks are perpetrated before the patches are distributed,  either as consequence of the exploitation of a zero day vulnerability or because the vulnerability was  known but the solution to the problem was still pending and a turn-around solution was lacking.  To prevent the spread of such incidents the European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security (ENISA) calls upon:  - CERTs to identify and classify vulnerabilities and attack patterns, and define counter- measures;  - Manufacturers to adhere to “security by design” principles during software development  and also to implement a predictable product patching life cycle;  - Users’ vigilance; one should be able to detect abnormal behavior of their system, allow the  quick detection of the threat, promptly install published patches and follow configuration  guidelines.  Installation of patches presumes their availability. They need to be developed by the manufacturer  of the system. Normally commercial manufacturers produce patches during the life cycle of the  product, and commit themselves to continue generating them for some years after the end of the  product’s distribution in the market. At the end of this extended life cycle, the manufacturer  discontinues its support for product maintenance, and stops any activity around it, once it is  considered that customers have had enough time to upgrade their platforms to newer products.  This risk scenario is particularly relevant in the case of legacy software in industrial control systems  (ICS) and SCADA, because those ICS are implemented using proprietary software with relatively  limited number of licenses distributed, and for this reason normally immune to the most widely  known attacks targeting standard software. The problem is that in the last years the trend in  cybercrime  is the targeted attacks, based on attack patterns and tools specially tailored for one  organisation or proprietary software. Energy, nuclear and financial Critical Infrastructures systems  have experienced well known incidents, and for this reason special care has to be taken of them.  2 Risks associated with the use of discontinued software  Using discontinued software implies exposure to the following risks:   End-users will be unable to check the integrity of the software, because Signing certificates  may be expired, i.e. not-valid. This will be the case only if the last original distribution was  signed by the manufacturer.  o Being unable to check the integrity of the software package could expose the user to  malware.  o Potentially infected systems may spread the infection over the whole network.  Risks of using discontinued software  Flash Note 01, 29th January 2014  Page  2  o Also, this could lead to non-compliance with security policies.   Loss of product support by the discontinued software manufacturer could potentially lead  to the following:  o Users of discontinued systems will not benefit from security updates or notices;  o New vulnerabilities will no longer be collected, reported and analysed, thus new  security patches will not be released; consequently the discontinued software may  stay exposed to each such vulnerability forever, as if it was a 0-day attack vector.   Lack of support from third party software and hardware manufacturers could lead to  unavailability to use the platform, e.g.:  o unknown bugs may stop discontinued software from running;  o Incompatibility of old Operating Systems with new devices1, unavailability of drivers  for new versions of peripherals may prevent users from upgrading or replacing used  or broken devices;  o Suspension of support of existing devices on the discontinued platform may result  on impossibility to continue using the device in case of failure;  o Suspension of support by third party manufacturers of installed software may  prevent customers from upgrading or patching also third party software with newer  versions. This also applies to new applications.  o This may be particularly critical in case of unavailability of updated versions of anti- virus and anti-malware solutions.  3 ENISA’s recommendations  1. IT Managers should always keep systems up to date with the latest security patches.  Discontinued software should be considered a high security risk for critical IT components and  should be mitigated by migrating to newer solutions or other platforms. In the case of Critical  Infrastructures Information systems, the risk of exposure may be extended to citizens, and thus  the responsibility of IT managers is larger.  2. Manufacturers should make sure that they provide enough time for migration. During this  phase, ENISA strongly recommends the use of advance notices and also an in-depth analysis of  the expected impact on users’ security after the product will be discontinued.  3. Users should make sure that they are aware and understand the security risk they are exposing  themselves to by continuing to use obsolete software.  1  Printers, scanners, webcams, drivers, etc.",

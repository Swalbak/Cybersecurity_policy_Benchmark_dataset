LIST OF POLICY DOCUMENTS 89  9  A MESSAGE FROM  THE EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR OVERVIEW  I would like to hereby let the readers of this report know that 2015 was yet another  successful year for the Agency, with ENISA maintaining its track record of delivering  according to plan and within its allocated budget. At the same time, we improved the  positioning of services towards our major stakeholders while ensuring compliance with the  regulatory framework.  EXTERNAL IMPACT Broadly speaking, ENISA’s activities can be divided across three main areas:  recommendations to its stakeholders;  support for policy development and implementation;  ‘hands on’ work with operational communities.  Throughout 2015, ENISA strengthened its contribution in each of these areas, supporting  Member States and private sector actors in responding to a rapidly developing threat  environment and helping to lay solid foundations for the information systems of the future.  ENISA activities are carried on in close collaboration with its stakeholders and during 2015  a number of high profile events have been organised or co-organised by ENISA such as: EU  Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign, Annual Privacy Forum (APF), High Level Event (HLE),  Industry Event, etc. At the same time the pan-European exercises scheduled for 2016 have  been prepared in 2015.  As far as the 2015 annual Work Programme is concerned, the Agency successfully produced  a total of 53 deliverables on a wide variety of subjects ranging from national issues such as  the protection of critical infrastructure to issues affecting individual citizens such as privacy  and Data Protection.  This year’s highlights include best practices and recommendations in sectors such as eHealth,  Finance and Smart Infrastructure and Services.  The work carried out in the area of Article 13a of the Telecommunications Framework Directive  of 2009 continues to be the best known example of where ENISA is working to support policy  initiatives, but it is important to mention that during 2015 the Agency has continued a number  of other well known activities such as CSIRT Training and preparations for Cyber Exercises.  Article 14 requests, which are essentially a mechanism that allow Member States and  EU institutions to request specific items of work from the Agency outside the work  programme execution process, continue to be popular. ENISA received 23 new requests in  2015, which represents an increase of 92 % over the previous year, and continued to work  on 19 ongoing requests.  All the activities carried out in 2015 resulted in various best practices and recommendations,  available on the ENISA website for the benefit of stakeholders and citizens.  INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS  Nowadays the need to optimise the available budget of the European Union as well as the  need to do more with fewer resources is a reality across all the European Union organisations  and bodies. ENISA is not an exception; the Agency continues to pursue efficiency and  effectiveness.  During 2015 the Agency has introduced a new system that supports a fully electronic  workflow. This new ‘Paperless’ system responds to the compliance requirements of our  regulations and has satisfied our internal and external stakeholders. ‘Paperless’ was a great  opportunity to start a full revision of work methods and risk assessment in our business. This  improvement also contributed to the objective of being a green organisation, where paper  use has been significantly reduced.  A formalisation of a Quality Management system is foreseen for 2016 with the objective to  consolidate the excellent compliance and good performance of the Agency. Our people are  considered to be the best asset of ENISA, and having this in mind the Agency will continue to  promote the value of the people that contribute to the success of our work.  CONCLUSIONS  The year 2015 has been another very successful year for the Agency. It has been a year in  which we have strengthened our relations with our stakeholders and assisted them in making  significant improvements to the state of cybersecurity throughout the EU. In parallel, we  continue to make internal improvements that keep staff morale high and make the Agency  a challenging and pleasant place to work.  I would like to end by thanking both our stakeholders and staff for their contributions  to this success.

Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 1 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security extends ENISA’s mandate until  19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and infor- mation security or cybersecurity in Europe. ENISA  supports the EU and the Member States in enhancing  and strengthening their capability and preparedness to  prevent, detect and respond to network and informa- tion security problems and incidents. ENISA’s vision is to  secure and enable Europe’s information society and to  use its unique competencies to help to drive the cyber- landscape in Europe.  The Agency works closely together with members of  both the public and private sector, to deliver advice and  solutions that are based on solid operational experi- ence. ENISA also supports the development of the Eu- ropean Union (EU) policy and law on matters relating to  network and information security (NIS), thereby contrib- uting to economic growth in Europe’s internal market.  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, inputs from the Member States and relevant  communities, including the private sector.  In cooperation with and in support of Member States  and EU institutions, ENISA prioritises contributions in  terms of:  Expertise: Anticipate and support Europe in facing  emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU, taking into account the  evolutions of the digital environment.  1 For the links and names of all relevant policy documents please  see Annex G.  Policy: Promote network and information security as  an EU policy priority, by assisting the European Union  institutions and Member States in developing and im- plementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  Capacity: Support Europe in maintaining state-of-the- art network and information security capacities by as- sisting the Member States and European Union bodies  in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  Community: Foster the emerging European network  and information security community, by reinforcing  cooperation at the EU level among Member States,  European Union bodies and relevant NIS stakeholders,  including the private sector.  Enabling: Reinforce ENISA’s impact by improving the  management of its resources and engaging more effi- ciently with its stakeholders, including Member States  and EU Institutions, as well as at the international level.  According to Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013,  the Agency comprises of the Management Board (MB);  the Executive Director and staff; and the Permanent  Stakeholders Group (PSG). In order to contribute to  enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the  operation of the Agency, the MB has established an  Executive Board.  The MB held its ordinary meeting to adopt decisions on  budgetary and administrative matters as well as rules  implementing provisions of ENISA Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 and Staff Regulations. The Board also adopted  planning documents such as an annual Work pro- gramme, a multi-annual staff policy plan, a Statement of  Estimates and others.  The PSG is a body that advises the Executive Director  on drawing up a proposal for the Agency’s work pro- gramme. In 2015, 2 formal PSG meetings were held.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 15  IMPLEMENTATION OF  ENISA ANNUAL WORK  PROGRAMME  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR  The European Union Agency for Network and Informa- tion Security (ENISA) contributes to the policy goal of  a high level of network and information security (NIS)  within the European Union. Ensuring adequate levels of  protection for contemporary IT systems in any context  requires recognising and adapting to changes in the  evolving threat environment by making appropriate pol- icy adjustments. As a centre of excellence and expertise  in the field of NIS, ENISA has used its expertise to:  advise its stakeholders on trends in the digital world  that affect security;  suggest good practices in various areas in relation to  information, services and systems security;  support the development and implementation of  policy requirements in the area of security and data  protection;  collaborate with stakeholders and contribute to the  NIS capacity and communities’ building.  The Work programme (WP) of 2015 contained a total  of 53 deliverables (which includes also workshops and  similar activities) that have been produced in full.  The highlights of 2015 include new best practices and  recommendations in sectors such as eHealth, finance, and  smart infrastructure and services. The Agency’s continued  brand activities such as Article 13a reporting, Computer  Security Incidents Response Teams (CSIRT) training and  preparations for Cyber Europe 2016. ENISA updated the  Threat Landscape and published guidelines and best  practice recommendations regarding Privacy Enhancing  Technologies. Requests under Article 14 of the ENISA Reg-  ulation (EU) No 526/2013 continued unabated as a meth- od for stakeholders to request assistance, culminating in 23  new requests, almost double compared to 2014.  The Agency also organised a number of high profile  events throughout the year, such as the High Level Event,  the first ENISA Industry event, the Annual Privacy Forum  and the EU Cyber Security Month campaign. ENISA also  hosted a number of important workshops, gathering  experts in the field to discuss cybersecurity topics.  MOST RELEVANT KEY  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  In 2015, the Agency delivered against its annual work  programme and all deliverables met or exceeded the key  performance indicators set (see Section I for more details).  Notable achievements are mentioned hereunder along  with examples on how the Agency reached its goals.  By 2016 10 private stakeholders use ENISA’s Threat  Analysis/Landscape process in their corporate risk  management processes. (Impact indicator in WPK1.1.  NIS Threat Analysis.)  Major organisations from Member states in both  governmental and sectoral areas have quoted  ENISA Threat Information. In performed impact  assessments, ENISA Threat Landscape has achieved  top results. And individual external stakeholders  continuously contact ENISA to obtain additional in- formation/details on threat information. Finally, the  SUMMARY  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 1716  achieved level of cooperation with competent EU  and Member State organisations is indicative of the  impact level achieved through this stream of work.  By 2017, 8 MS use ENISA’s recommendations and  good practices on National Cyber Security Strategies.  (Impact indicator in WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector  capacity building.)  2015: 2 workshops in 2015 together with the EU  Presidency (Riga: 30 participants, 15 from MSs;  Luxembourg: 28 participants, 18 from MSs), 4  MSs created their national cybersecurity strategy  based on ENISA recommendations (until Novem- ber 2015), ENISA NCSS map was the most popular  webpage (features update).  By 2017, continued CSIRT training will be provided to  a minimum of 20 participants of different organisa- tions in 5 MS. (Impact indicator in WPK 2.1: Assist in  public sector capacity building.)  2015: 11 CSIRT trainings were delivered across 7  MSs reaching over 200 participants representing  various private and public organisations. ENISA  CSIRT training is the most popular Article 14  request in many EU MSs.  Engage at least 5 key sector actors in launching and es- tablishing a forum that brings together 3 communities,  namely: trust service providers from the EU Trusted  List, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory  authorities. The degree of activity of the relevant key  sector actors in this forum is of importance to its suc- cess. (Impact indicator in WPK 3.1: Provide informa- tion and advice to support policy development.)  The 1st TSP Forum was organised in late 2015 and  it was attended by more than 100 participants,  including representatives of all key sectors, many  EU MS National Authorities, etc. A follow up with  the organisation’s 2nd TSP Forum is currently  underway for 2016.  By 2017, 12 MSs will make direct use of the out- comes of Article 13(a) work by explicitly referencing  it or by adopting it at the national level. (Impact  indicator in WPK 3.2: Assist EU MSs and Commission  in the implementation of EU NIS regulations.)  In 2015, a study on the impact assessment of Article  13a in the EU was published. In total 23 countries  responded that they have implemented the Article  13 requirements (although the actual figure is  greater), and on average 15 out of them (more  than 60 %) declared that they have used different  work items produced by the group in their national  implementation and work. More than this, 19 (82 %)  National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are currently  satisfied with the current work model of the Article  13a expert group, drafting and agreeing on common  technical guidelines and on sharing experiences.  (82 %) NRAs are currently satisfied with the current  work model of the Article 13a expert group.  More than 80 participants in APF’15 (researchers,  policy-makers and industry participants) (Impact  indicator in WPK 3.3: Assist EU MSs and Commission  in the implementation of NIS measures of EU data  protection regulation.)  The Annual Privacy Forum (APF) 2015 was attend- ed by more than 100 participants and the next  editions of this conference have been planned.  KEY CONCLUSIONS ON THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  that policy and operational objectives are achieved. As  regards financial management, compliance with these  standards is compulsory and the Agency meets its goals  in full.  The Agency has put in place an organisational structure  and a set of internal controls that are suited to the  achievement of policy and control objectives, in accord- ance with the standards and suitable to mitigate risks  associated with the environment in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the min- imum requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal procedures  were grouped together, prioritised and implemented in  the daily workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2015, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern during  the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the recom- mendations raised by the auditing bodies (European  Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service of the  European Commission). It has been reported that with  reference to 2014, the Agency achieved compliance with  the internal control standards; for more details please  refer to Sections 3 to 6 and to the Annexes of this report.  INFORMATION FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS  While during 2015 the Agency continued to deliver  against its annual work programme, it is worth stating  that the need for activities aimed at securing Eu- rope’s information security has been increasing.  It should be noted that the objectives of the Agency  address NIS, a fast-changing area. The use of IT, the de- velopment of new technologies but also new challenges  and new security risks are emerging at a relentless pace.  For instance, according to Eurostat, ‘ICT have become  widely available to the general public, both in terms of  accessibility as well as cost. A boundary was crossed  in 2007, when a majority (55 %) of households in the  EU-28 had internet access. This proportion continued to  increase and in 2014 reached 81 %’2.  In 2015, the worldwide cybersecurity market was esti- mated 3as ranging from USD 75 billion and forecasted  to grow to USD 170 billion by 2020. The cybersecu- rity market size in Europe, according to Gartner 4,  was estimated to grow from EUR 20.1 billion (out of  Gartner’s EUR 71.7 billion worldwide estimation for  2015) with 6 % Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  to EUR 24.4 billion in 2018, maintaining a share above  one quarter of the worldwide cybersecurity market.  At the same time, the estimated worldwide economic  impact of cyber-attacks has reached half a trillion USD5.  Global surveys 6 find that 15 % of businesses say they  have faced a cyber-attack in the past year. Businesses  in the EU (19 %) and North America (18 %) have been  most heavily targeted according to the same source.  ENISA carries out the analysis of cyberthreats and pub- lishes a yearly Threat Landscape report 7 that vouches  for the smooth advancement of maturity on both cyber- security defence and protection as well on cybersecurity  2 Eurostat, Information society statistics — households and  individuals, June 2015, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ statistics-explained/index.php/Information_society_statistics_-_ households_and_individuals  3 Cybersecurity market report, Cybersecurity Ventures, Q4 2015,  available at: http://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-mar- ket-report/  4 Cyber-security market size in Europe, Gartner 2014.  5 McAfee, Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime,  report summary, 2014, available at: http://www.mcafee.com/us/ resources/reports/rp-economic-impact-cybercrime2-summary.pdf  6 Grant Thornton, Cyber-attacks cost global business $300bn+,  available at: http://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/ cyber-attacks-cost-global-business-over-$300bn-a-year/  7 ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 (ETL 2015), January 2016, avail- able at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/ evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015  threats. Cyberspace stakeholders have gone through  varying degrees of further maturity. While friendly  agents have demonstrated increased cooperation and  orchestrated reaction to cyberthreats, hostile agents  have advanced their malicious tools with obfuscation,  stealth and strike capability.  On the defenders’ side, improvements have been  achieved in coordinated campaigns to disrupt and  dismantle malicious infrastructures, strengthen the legal  and governance cyberdefence framework and develop  more efficient products.  Adversaries have achieved considerable advances too.  Cyberthreats have undergone significant evolution and just  as in 2014, significant breaches have covered front pages  in the media. It is alarming, however, that seemingly cyber- threat agents had the margin and resources to implement  a series of advancements in malicious practices.  In 2015, changes observed referred to two areas men- tioned hereinafter. The attention of cybersecurity experts  has been drawn to incidents in the area of the Internet of  Things (IoT) and attacks against cyber-physical interfaces,  both being upcoming areas of concern for the cyberse- curity community. For instance, from incident statistics it  becomes evident that human error and insider threats,  if taken together, are sufficient to top the list of cyber- threats. Taking into account the relatively novel features  of IoT and the relatively large number of ‘insiders’ within  a smart environment (i.e. smart home) as well as the  interactions with health and safety, it is likely that IoT  becomes the next frontier for abuse. Policy work in  cybersecurity needs continuity and the ability to adjust to  frequent and often disruptive developments.  Positive developments can be reached by strengthen- ing the Agency. While the Agency features mandatory  tasks emanating from the regulatory framework (ENISA  regulation, eIDAS regulation, ePrivacy directive, etc.),  emerging policy and regulatory requirements (Telecom  pack review, Data protection regulation, NIS directive)  create new impetus. In view of these developments it is  expected that if the Agency’s resources are reinforced,  it can contribute to better policy outcomes and aug- ment its policy outreach to the benefit of many more  stakeholders across Europe. Especially in the area of  a digital single market, ENISA can further enhance the  capacity and preparedness of MSs to prevent, detect  and respond to NIS problems and incidents.

The WP 2015 was aligned with the strategic objectives  featured on the strategy and the multi annual planning  of the Agency. The strategic objectives of the WP 2015  were as follows:  SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of expertise  of EU actors taking into account evolutions in Network  & Information Security (NIS). SO2: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU. SO3: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in developing and implementing the policies necessary  to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of  Network and Information Security. SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the  Member States of the EU and between related  NIS communities.  In the following sections the results of WP 2015 imple- mentation are presented for each of the above men- tioned objective. After the description of the concrete  results for each strategic objective, the achievements  against indicators and the detailed results for each  deliverable are presented in tables.  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO1 — DEVELOP  AND MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF NIS  EXPERTISE OF EU ACTORS  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for contempo- rary IT systems in any context requires recognising and  adapting to changes in the evolving threat environment.  Whilst it is clearly not possible to foresee all future  threats (security practices have often been dramatically  changed as a result of so called ‘black swan’ events,  which are notoriously difficult to predict), it is possible  to predict the evolution of certain threats with a rea- sonable degree of accuracy based on past data.  The Agency supported the MSs and the Commission in  their efforts to improve Critical information Infrastruc- ture protection (CIIP) by fostering a common approach  across the MSs and by ensuring that good practice  and lessons learnt are shared and properly deployed  in an effective manner. The Agency worked with the  MSs, the Commission and the private sector in capacity  building across the EU. In particular, the Agency sup- ported the development of voluntary baseline security  requirements for CIIP sectors and harmonised efforts  in the area of mandatory incident reporting, taking  under consideration existing national and international  frameworks (e.g. NIST). The approach was not limited to  securing Internet related services, but took into consid- eration other networks and services as appropriate.  Where technology is concerned, information security  has traditionally been viewed as an approach to secure  SECTION I. KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF ENISA  WORK PROGRAMME 2015I.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 2120  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  people, processes and technology. Of these three  factors, it is mainly technological evolution that impacts  the way in which people’s behaviour and processes  change. A large part of modern information security  therefore boils down to adapting current methods to  emerging technologies, and business models.  As a centre of excellence and expertise in the field of  NIS, ENISA used the expertise of its staff to advise its  stakeholders about trends in the digital world that affect  security and suggested good practices to be taken in  order to successfully mitigate the associated risks at an  early stage of end-user adoption. In particular, ENISA  sought to identify the consequences of deploying new  technologies and approaches in order to enable the  opportunities that such developments bring.  ENISA assisted the Commission and MSs in defining and  implementing a framework for training professionals in  NIS to meet the requirements of industry at all levels.  The goal was to align training goals with career paths  for security professionals and to provide a more global  background in NIS for professionals in other areas.  The following work packages were part of this  Strategic Objective:  WPK 1.1 — NIS Threats Analysis The main goal of this WPK was to develop the current  cyberthreat landscape. This information is important  in the identification of NIS gaps and security needs for  a wide spectrum of stakeholders.  WPK 1.2 — Improving the Protection  of Critical Information Infrastructures In this WPK, ENISA’s aim was to provide advice and as- sistance on request to targeted stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  WPK 1.3 — Securing emerging  Technologies and Services This WPK aimed to develop good practices on emerg- ing smart infrastructures and services and work with  relevant stakeholders to deploy them at an early stage  of adoption.  WPK 1.4 — Short- and mid-term sharing  of information regarding issues in NIS This WPK aimed to define and implement a framework  that allowed the Agency to provide timely and high  quality responses to NIS developments.  1.1.1 WPK 1.1: NIS Threats Analysis  The main objective of this work package was to collect  and collate current data in order to develop the ENISA  threat landscape. It includes current threats, as well as  threat trends in NIS and emerging technologies. The  threat landscape is based on existing publicly available  material on threats, risks and trends.  The ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 was a continuation of  the work started in 2012. Compared to previous years,  there is noticeable improvement in the quality of threat  information collected within related organisations due  a wider spread and depth of information sources.  In addition, in this work package ENISA further iden- tified emerging technologies for risk assessment and  threat analysis. A report was published highlighting the  threats and potential compromises related to the secu- rity of SDN/5G networks. The report identified related  network assets and the security threats, challenges and  risks arising from these assets. Driven by the identified  threats and risks, existing security mechanism and good  practices for SDN/5G/NFV were identified. Finally based  in the collated information technical, policy and organ- isational recommendations for proactively enhancing  the security of SDN/5G were provided.  1.1.2 WPK 1.2: Improving the protection  of Critical Information Infrastructures  The objective of this work package was to provide ad- vice and assistance to targeted stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  More specifically ENISA took stock of MS policies,  regulations and strategies including international  frameworks (e.g. US NIST) and identified gaps related  to CIIs. The Agency cooperated with public and private  stakeholders to identify good practices, collected and  analysed requirements and issued recommendations for  improving the way MSs address the protection of CIIs.  In the area of Internet Interconnections, ENISA con- tinued in its development of methodologies for the  identification of critical communication networks, links,  and components. ENISA considered existing outputs  from projects and initiatives in the security and resil- ience of Internet interconnections. In cooperation with  ISPs and other public stakeholders ENISA validated the  methodology and developed a maturity assessment  mechanism. This mechanism allows MSs to assess the  situation within their borders. The Agency also assessed  whether this methodology could be extended to other  CIIs and targeted stakeholders so as to customise it to  their needs and requirements.  In the area of ICS-SCADA security, ENISA cooperated  with SCADA and Control Systems Information Exchange  (EuroSCSIE) as well as other related expert groups to take  stock and conduct an analysis of cybersecurity maturity  levels in critical sectors (e.g. transport, energy, water sup- ply, etc.). ENISA’s work will be utilised by policy-makers  in MSs and EU Institutions to create a secure framework  for the implementation and deployment of more efficient  ICS-SCADA systems. The study also made general rec- ommendations to EU Member States and the European  Commission on how to improve CIIP across the European  Union. The Agency will continue promoting its work on  the security of ICS-SCADA devices.  In the area of smart grids, ENISA continued its work on  appropriate security measures and national governance  security models of smart grids. The Agency promoted  its existing appropriate security measures and further  cooperated with public and private stakeholders to  improve their existing security governance models for  smart grids. A study was published on the evaluation of  the interdependencies and communications between  the assets that make up the new power grids, their  architectures and connections in order to determine  their importance, threats, risks, mitigation factors  and possible security measures to implement. ENISA  also conducted a study identifying the maturity level  of ICS-SCADA cybersecurity in Europe and identified  good practices used by European Member States to  improve. It should be noted that smart grid area covers  more than ICS; so for this activity more areas were  considered: smart cities, smart energy etc. ENISA also  continued its contribution to DG ENER’s Smart Grid Task  Force and all relevant EU initiatives (e.g. CEN/CENELEC/ ETSI, ERNCIP, DENSEK, etc.). Finally the Agency contrib- uted to national and EU efforts (e.g. SOGIS) related to  better alignment of certification policies and strategies  at the EU level.  In the area of cloud computing, ENISA actively contrib- uted to the EU Commission’s EU Cloud Computing Strat- egy by delivering targeted advice on cybersecurity mat- ters (e.g. certification, appropriate security measures,  procurements, SLAs and others). The Agency continued  its work in the area of governmental clouds, assisted  MSs to develop their national governmental strate- gy’s and deploy ENISA’s good practice guide. ENISA also  worked with the public and private sector to promote  its work on the certification of cloud computing compo- nents and services. The Agency worked to establish its  meta-certification framework as a model to be used by  users, SMEs and leading players in the market, so as to  allow cloud users to select the most appropriate existing  certification scheme for their needs.  In the area of finance, ENISA, through consultation with  public and private stakeholders, identified policy, tech- nical and regulatory barriers and challenges for using  cloud, either as infrastructure or as a service, in the  finance sector. Based on the analysis ENISA provided  recommendations to financial institutions, regulators  and cloud service providers about what ENISA believes  should be done to support the secure adoption of  cloud services in the finance sector. The Agency has  issued recommendations for policy-makers, EU MSs  and industry in mitigating barriers and challenges. By  removing known barriers ENISA has helped the EU  industry become more competitive and innovative.  Also the Agency in consultation with public and private  stakeholders has positioned itself to better understand  the security and privacy challenges related with third  party payments providers.  Finally in the area of eHealth, ENISA, with the consul- tation of public and private stakeholders, published  a study that took stock and assessed the security  and resilience of major eHealth infrastructures and  services. The Agency developed good practices and  recommendations for policy-makers, industry and EU  MSs on the resilience and security of eHealth infra- structures and services.  ENISA assisted the  Commission and MS in  defining and implementing  a framework for training  professionals in NIS to  meet the requirements  of industry at all levels.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 2322  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  1.1.3 WPK 1.3: Securing emerging  Technologies and Services  ENISA developed good practices on emerging smart  infrastructures and services in such areas as 8:  intelligent transportation systems used in the  context of smart cities;  Big Data and corresponding services used for  offering critical services;  Smart Home Environments.  In each of these areas ENISA identified relevant public and  private stakeholders, engaged them in working groups and  jointly took stock of and analysed the current situation in  terms of cybersecurity and resilience. The Agency iden- tified EU and nationally funded projects on these topics,  liaised with them, assessed their findings and deliverables,  and further engaged them in the corresponding expert  groups and with the organisation of workshops.  Based on consultation with stakeholders and desk-top  research and analysis, ENISA developed good practices  and issued recommendations addressing policy-makers,  manufacturers, developers, infrastructure owners, oper- ators and service providers. The following reports were  published with the aim to provide smart infrastruc- ture service providers, operators, manufacturers and  developers with good security and resilience practices  when designing and deploying such services in order to  minimise the exposure of such networks and services to  all relevant cyberthreat categories.  8 Infrastructure can be defined as ‘smart’ when investments in  human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern  (ICT) communication infrastructure support sustainable economic  development and a high quality of life, with wise management of  natural resources, through participatory action and engagement.  The Cyber security and resilience of intelligent public  transport report gives an overview of the existing secu- rity measures (good practices) that could be deployed  to protect these critical assets and ensure security of  the IPT system, based on a survey and interviews of  experts from the sector, municipalities, operators, man- ufacturers and policy-makers.  The Cyber security for smart cities — an architecture  model for public transport report describes how good  practices are put into a relationship with different city  maturity levels thus allowing representatives of oper- ators and municipalities to quickly assess whether or  not they lag behind other cities with the same maturity  level in terms of cybersecurity and, if so, to take appro- priate actions.  The Good practices and recommendations on the  security and resilience of Big Data services study aims at  identifying the key security challenges that companies  face when implementing Big Data solutions, from infra- structures to analytics applications, and how those are  mitigated. The analysis focuses on the use of Big Data  by private organisations in given sectors (e.g. Finance,  Energy, Telecom).  The Security and resilience of Smart Home environments  study aims at securing Smart Home environments from  cyberthreats by highlighting good practices that apply  to every step of a product lifecycle: its development, its  integration in Smart Home environments, and its usage  and maintenance until end-of-lifecycle.  It is expected that the early adoption of these recom- mendations and good practices will boost the trust and  confidence of potential users of such technologies and  pave the way for wider deployment.  1.1.4 WPK 1.4: Short- and mid-term  sharing of information regarding  issues in NIS  ENISA implemented a framework that allows the  Agency to provide timely and high quality responses  to NIS developments. ENISA acted on NIS issues and  occurrences that reached a certain level of public and  media attention by giving information and, where  appropriate, guidelines for dealing with the issue on  short notice. The guidelines did not address immediate  responses, but concentrated on medium- to long-term  preparatory measures. The overall goal for each Note  was to highlight fundamental facts and shortcomings  behind specific NIS issues and occurrences, and to give  independent advice to key stakeholders.

In particular the  Agency worked together with national bodies (NRAs,  CSIRTs, etc.) that had been mandated to carry out these  tasks within the MSs, with private sector representatives  and with the European Commission to ensure that the ap- proach was coherent across the EU. The Agency continued  to support the Commission and the MSs in the implemen- tation of methods and tools for ensuring adequate privacy  protection and adherence to EU Data Protection legisla- tion. By supporting initiatives such as the EU cybersecurity  month, the implementation of an NIS driving licence and  MSs’ efforts to introduce NIS topics into education at all  levels, ENISA contributed to increasing the level of partic- ipation of the EU citizens in activities aimed at improving  the level of NIS throughout the Union.  The following work packages constituted this  Strategic Objective:  WPK 2.1 — Assist in public sector capacity building This Work Package aimed at helping operational bodies  and communities (namely CSIRTs, but other communi- ties where appropriate) in developing and extending the  necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever growing  challenges to secure their networks.  WPK 2.2 — Assist in private sector capacity building This WPK aimed at helping the private sector develop  their capacities in the area of cybersecurity (e.g. in  the area of Network and Information Security driving  licence).  WPK 2.3 — Assist in improving  awareness of the general public This WPK aimed at further developing ENISA’s  multi-stakeholder facilitation approach and  public-private activities.  1.2.1 WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector  capacity building  ENISA made great strides to fulfil its aim in terms of  helping the EU MSs and other stakeholders, such as EU  Institutions and bodies, to develop and extend the nec- essary capabilities to meet the ever growing challenges  to network security. Emphasis was made on supporting  operational bodies and communities (namely CSIRTs)  by providing good practice material and advice and  concrete actions such as CSIRT trainings.  The Agency provided support and advice to MSs on the  development, implementation and evaluation of National  Cyber Security Strategies (3 specific requests received).  The information was diffused through the NCSS Experts  Group who shared lessons learnt and prior experience.  Taking utmost account of the knowledge shared, these  MSs are currently in the adoption phase of their NCSS.  The Agency also maintains an interactive NCSS map, with  information on the strategies of the MSs as well as of  countries around the globe. This map is one of the most  popular ENISA sites and on a regular basis the Agency  receives information to keep it up to date.  Another important aspect of this support to MS capability  building, was the rolling out of training for IT specialists  (CSIRTs, etc.) of which more than 200 trainees were trained  in 7 Member States and carrying out national exercises.  A number of handbooks where published in the area of  CSIRT good practices to further strength the knowledge  base of the trainers and maintain an up to date training  library. These included:  Mobile threat incident handling;  Introduction to advanced artefact analysis;  Advanced dynamic analysis;  Advanced static analysis.  An impact assessment of ENISA’s support to CSIRTs  in 2014 was conducted so as to serve as a basis for  a proposed roadmap to 2020. The impact of the ENISA  support to the CSIRT community was assessed from  a dual perspective — legislative and regulatory — as  well as operational, with the key objectives to: up- date the policy analysis; gather additional input from  practitioners, including specific input on the new duties;  and together with ENISA, propose concrete projects or  actions towards the roadmap implementation.  Finally, in line with ENISA’s responsibility to develop  capabilities in the area of national Public Private Part- nerships the Agency provided targeted and customised  assistance (e.g. in a form of a seminar, training) and con-  tinued to support the Commission in the management  of the NIS platform by targeted public and private stake- holders (especially experts from small industry players),  assisting in the formation of virtual groups of experts,  and contributing its expertise to position papers devel- oped within the working groups of the NIS platform.  1.2.2 WPK 2.2: Assist in private  sector capacity building  The background to ENISA’s work in this field includes  the EU’s Cyber Security Strategy suggestion to develop  a roadmap for a ‘Network and Information Security driving  licence’ as a voluntary certification programme to promote  and enhance skills and competences of IT professionals.  User education is key to cybersecurity and as such  a study was undertaken with the following objectives: to  identify gaps between available training courses, certifica- tions and NIS education needs with particular emphasis  on ePrivacy and to suggest further actions based on the  analysed needs of NIS communities in Europe. The report  concludes with a list of recommendation for both the EU  and educational organisations in Member States.  The 2015 network and information security quiz to  test users’ knowledge of ENISA recommendations  built upon the success of the previous year’s quiz  by using feedback received by the users and making  functional enhancements.  1.2.3 WPK 2.3: Assist in improving  awareness of the general public  The 2015 edition of the European Cyber Security Month  (ECSM) resulted in a successful advocacy campaign with  32 countries taking part, some 242 activities from public  and private stakeholders and an outreach in social  media topping the previous year’s statistics. Included  within these results are the 417 courses now registered  in the NIS Education map.  ENISA has produced a basic cyberhygiene report to help  web users (general public) recognise and use tools for  online privacy and security. The objectives of the report  were to define the current level of information and  guidance that is provided to the general public and to  provide a proposal for an assessment model for online  privacy tools that could bring more assurance in their  use, supporting their wider adoption by internet and  mobile users. The Agency has found out that a com- bined effort of all involved stakeholders is needed in the  promotion of online, privacy enhancing technologies.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 2928  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  1.2.4 General results. Achievement of Impact indicators for Objective 2 1.3 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO3 —  ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING  AND IMPLEMENTING THE  NIS-RELATED POLICIES  In 2015, ENISA continued to provide the Commission  and MSs with high quality information, data and advice  to support policy-making having an EU dimension.  The Agency also had taken into consideration policy and  legislative requirements that are not directly related to  cybersecurity, but which had a bearing on how cyberse- curity principles are integrated.  At the same time, the Agency continued to support  research and development by acting in an advisory role  to the Commission for future Framework Programme  initiatives in this area. Additionally, ENISA continued its  work on Privacy enhancing technologies.  ENISA worked together with the public sector, stand- ards organisations and industry representatives to  identify ways for improving the process for agreeing on  suitable NIS standards and for promoting their uptake in  a cross-border environment.  The following work packages constitute this Strategic  Objective:  WPK 3.1 — Provide information and advice to support  policy development This WPK aimed at supporting work on regulation espe- cially in the area of eID.  WPK 3.2 — Assist EU MSs and Commission in the  implementation of EU NIS regulations This WPK aimed at supporting EU MSs in implementing  regulation, especially in the area of reporting according  to Article 13a of the Telecoms Directive.  WPK 3.3 — Assist EU MSs and Commission in the im- plementation of NIS measures of EU data protection  regulation This WPK aimed at supporting developing and im- plementing regulation in the area of Data Protection  and Privacy.  WPK 3.4 — R & D, Innovation & Standardisation This WPK aimed at supporting work on Standardisation  (i.e. collaborating with standardisation bodies) and Re- search & Development (especially in the area of H2020)  1.3.1 WPK 3.1: Provide information and  advice to support policy development  In order to remove existing barriers for cross-border  e-ID based services, a new Regulation (914/2014)  on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market was  published in 2014.  Finally, ENISA collaborated with FESA in the area of  exchange of information on the supervision of TSPs.  1.3.2 WPK 3.2: Assist EU MSs and  Commission in the implementation of EU  NIS regulations  ENISA focussed its efforts on assisting regulatory au- thorities and the Commission in the implementation of  EU regulations related to incident reporting. This effort  built on successful work done in this area from previous  years namely in the area of Article 13a.  SO2 — To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU  WPKs, Impact Indicators Achieved results  WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector capacity building  By 2017, 8 MSs use ENISA’s recommendations and good  practices on National Cyber Security Strategies.  2 workshops were held in 2015 together with the EU  Presidency (Riga: 30 participants, 15 from MSs; Luxembourg:  28 participants, 18 from MSs), 4 MSs created their national  cybersecurity strategy based on ENISA recommendations  (until November 2015), ENISA NCSS map the most popular  webpage (features update). In 2016 ENISA will continue work  on this topic through updating the NCSS online map, creating  training material in a training platform and updating the  good practice guide.  By 2017, continued CSIRT training will be provided to  a minimum of 20 participants of different organisations in  5 MSs.  In 2015, 11 CSIRT trainings provided in 7 MSs for more  than 200 participants representing various private and  public organisations.  By 2017, improved operational practices of CSIRTs in  at least 15 MSs (ongoing support with best practices  development).  In 2015,  a Good practice guide on vulnerability disclosure  was added to the ENISA’s online library for CSIRT services  and operational practice improvement. The annual CSIRT  workshop for national and governmental CSIRTs held in  May in Latvia to discuss and address ‘the CSIRT role and  services during the EU Presidency’ topic (40 participants  from 17 MSs).  More streamlined CSIRT exercise and training material  with CSIRT and other operational communities’ services  and methodologies.  In 2015, ENISA’s start-up train the trainer program was  launched. First workshop for CSIRT trainers in Europe held  in September to streamline CSIRT training material and  training methodology development (24 educators from  18 MSs including GEANT/TRANSITS; FIRST).  WPK 2.2: Assist in private sector capacity building  10 public-private stakeholders from MSs follow up on  the recommendations from the Roadmap on the NIS  in Education.  A mapping of relevant stakeholders in the NIS Education  interactive map gathered more than 400 entries from  over 20 countries. ENISA further developed a model to  disseminate the existing information to interested parties  and a new model of engagement for education providers.  Further develop an effective work process to involve more  universities and certifications providers (NIS in Education).  ENISA introduced an interactive map to be used by all edu- cation providers in the EU to give visibility to their courses.  This established a one-stop-shop for NIS education provid- ers and offers them better interactions at EU level. The NIS  Education interactive map is available following this link:  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities.  WPK 2.3: Assist in improving awareness of the general public  D1: Provide guidance and support for European Cyber  Security Month (dissemination material, Q4 2015)  European Cyber Security Month 2015 — Deployment  Report, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stake- holder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-secu- rity-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deploy- ment-report  D2: Basic cyberhygiene: guidelines for recognizing and  using trustworthy security and privacy products for the  general public (Q4, 2015)  Online privacy tools for the general public, https://www. enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliv- erables/basic-cyber-hygiene  In 2015 ENISA continued to support activities  in this field with the following actions:  studied the technological aspects and  market for qualified website authentication  certificates (QWACs);  reviewed and evaluated the standards  related to TSPs and elDs (also developed  under mandate M-460 and in light of the  new Regulation), and made a mapping to  the requirements of eIDAS;  ENISA in collaboration with the Commission  launched the creation of a forum bringing  together three communities, namely: trust  service providers from the EU Trusted  List, conformity assessment bodies and  supervisory authorities. This action will be  followed up in 2016 and further.  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deployment-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deployment-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deployment-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/basic-cyber-hygiene https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/basic-cyber-hygiene https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/basic-cyber-hygiene  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  ENISA continued collecting and analysing annual, na- tional reports of security breaches from NRAs in accord- ance with Article 13a of the Framework Directive on  electronic communications. The Agency, in cooperation  with experts from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. NIS  Platform), analysed the reports, compared them with  previous years, identified good practices and lessons  learnt and made recommendations to NRAs and the pri- vate sector to mitigate these threats in the future. Also  the Agency assessed the impact of incident reporting  schemes (Article 13a) trying to identify the changes in  outcome that can be attributed to the regulations. The  results of the evaluation have served as input to the EC  public consultation for the new telecom package. Ac- cording to this assessment, 82 % of NRAs are currently  satisfied with the work model of the Article 13a expert  group and the role of ENISA. The Agency also identified  lessons learnt, evaluated the value for money of these  schemes and issued recommendations for stakeholders.  Additionally, ENISA continued its effort to bring NRAs,  DPAs and the Commission together for the harmonisa- tion and implementation of the security and data breach  articles (Article 13a and Article 4). The Agency also further  assessed the Article 4 incident reporting scheme by means  of a survey that was executed with the support of the  Commission, and the results presented in a workshop. In  that survey, all relevant stakeholders had the opportunity  to discuss the challenges and propose recommendations  towards a more harmonised and cost efficient way of  implementing the two articles so as to avoid overlaps.  ENISA also organised a workshop on incident prevention  and reporting in Bucharest (June 2015). The participants  were from Member States, National Regulatory Agencies,  solution providers and assets owners.  ENISA has already contributed to the area of electronic  identification and trusted services (eIDAS) by providing  recommendations on incident reporting by the trust  service providers to the supervisory bodies. In 2015,  ENISA continued its efforts to aggregate together all  relevant stakeholders (Article 19 expert group) from  MSs including the competent regulatory bodies of MSs  and deliberated with them on the development of  a consistent incident reporting framework for Article  19. With ENISA’s support the scope and the parameters  were defined as well as the thresholds for the summa- ry reporting by the supervisory bodies to ENISA and  the Commission. ENISA also considered conceptual  synergies with Article 13a and supported the Article 19  expert group in developing the functional requirements  by an automated tool for reporting incidents in the  context of Article 19.  1.3.3 WPK 3.3: Assist EU MSs and  Commission in the implementation of NIS  measures of EU data protection regulation  In 2015, ENISA intensified its efforts in the field of  privacy and trust in a number of areas.  Firstly, ENISA analysed the obstacles of the adoption  and evolution of privacy technologies and clarified why  in the current practice of web services PETs are rarely  used. The report also studied the technical possibilities  as well as the economic incentives that could be used to  further increase the market penetration of such tools.  Secondly, due to the recognition of privacy enhancing  technologies in several policy documents, e.g. the draft  data protection regulation proposal, that are based  on complex cryptographic building blocks, coupled  with security of these building blocks being constantly  challenged by new attacks, ENISA produced a report  pointing to already established EU policies and process- es to addresses these issues. The report was distributed  to members of the ENISA MB.  Emerging technologies in the areas of online informa- tion sharing, data merging and data mining create new  possibilities for the processing of personal data and,  thus, new privacy risks. ENISA produced a state-of-the  art analysis of the data protection threats, risks and  protection measures in the emerging big and open data  landscape. During the Annual Privacy Forum, ENISA  brought together both policy-makers and the research  30  community to address the lag between data protection  legislation and technological protection mechanisms  and the challenges of data protection and privacy.  The 2015 version of the ENISA report entitled ‘Indicative  list of appropriate cryptographic protection measures’  was distributed to the members of the MB. The report  will be used by the Commission as a main reference  document for the publication of a list of appropriate  technological protection measures pursuant to Arti- cle 4(3) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013.  Based on the latest scientific evidence at the moment  of publication, technological breakthroughs may occur  that compromise the recommended protection meas- ures, which is why the report was updated. As was the  case in previous years, in the context of this work ENISA  collaborated with well recognised experts in the field  (also ensuring high quality peer reviews). In addition,  ENISA involved experts in the field from National Au- thorities (BSI, ANSSI, etc.).  1.3.4 WPK 3.4: R & D, Innovation &  Standardisation  Since its creation ENISA has tracked the development of  standards in the area of Network and Information Secu- rity, maintaining close contacts and collaboration with  International Standardisation Organisations. In 2015,  the Agency monitored NIS standards across the EU and  globally. This enabled ENISA to keep its activities up-to-  date with the latest developments as well as inform its  stakeholders on new NIS standardisation activities and  flag opportunities and/or risks as they developed.  Since 2012 ENISA contributes actively to the creation  and work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security Co- ordination Group (CSCG). This collaboration with CSCG  continued and ENISA further strengthened its synergies  between CSCG and its work programme. In this context  of the CSCG activities work was performed to analyse  good practices within the governance framework of  the European Union and proposing recommendations  for stakeholders. A gaps and overlaps analysis of the  standardisation of cybersecurity was also performed in  separate report.  Finally a study was conducted to analyse the adoption  of information security and privacy standards by SMEs  in Europe. Despite rising concerns on information  security risks the results of the analysis indicate that  adoption is low due to a number of identified drivers  and barriers.  In the areas of interest to the ENISA Work Programme  the Agency continued to collaborate with and to  support EU-funded R & D projects (H2020). The main  aim of the activity was to align the objectives of policy  initiatives in the area of NIS with that of the relevant  EU-funded R & D projects (H2020). Collaboration was  formed by way of a workshop organised by ENISA and  representatives from MSs.  The Agency provided support to:  NRAs and EU MSs on the implementation  of Article 13a (disruptions in the telecom  sector) and Article 4 (personal data breach  notification) and the developed synergies  among the two;  NRAs and EU MSs on the implementation  of Article 19 of new Regulation on  electronic identification and trusted  services (eIDAS);  the Commission and MSs on the  implementation of the NIS Directive.

The degree of activity of the relevant key sector actors in  the forum is of importance to its success.  The 1st TSP Forum was organised at the end of June 2015.  The forum was attended by more than 100 participants  and by representatives from all key sector actors from  many EU MSs.  Validations by at least 5 representatives from different  MSs of the contribution to the implementation of the  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services for electronic transactions.  The participants of the eIDAS TF were involved throughout  this work and also contributed at all stages of the peer  review.  WPK 3.2: Assist EU MSs and Commission in the implementation of EU NIS regulations  By 2017, 12 MSs make direct use of the outcomes of  Article 13a work by explicitly referencing it or by adopting  it at nationally level.  By 2015, a study on the impact assessment of Article  13a in EU was published. 23 countries have responded  that they have implemented the Article 13 requirements  (although the real number is greater than this), and on  average 15 of them (more than 60 %) declared that they  have used different work produced by the group in their  national implementation and work. More than this, 19  (82 %) NRAs are currently satisfied with the current work  model of Article 13a expert group, drafting and agreeing  on common technical guidelines and sharing experiences.  By 2017, 10 MSs implement recommendations by ENISA  on implementing and enforcing Article 4.  12 MSs participated in ENISA’s survey on Article 4 data  breaches. Workshop organised by EC on data breaches of  Article 4 and more than 20 MSs participated.  By 2017, 10 MSs implement ENISA’s recommendations  on Article 19.  3 workshops of Article 19 expert group organised in 2015.  This working group of experts consists of national regu- latory authorities and ministries from across Europe: the  Article 19 Expert Group. On average, more than 15 MSs  participated in each one of them.  WPK 3.3: Assist EU MSs and Commission in the implementation of NIS measures of EU data protection regulation  At least 5 representatives from different MSs contributing  to ENISA guidelines and best practice recommendations  regarding Privacy Enhancing Technologies.  6 EU MSs representatives contributed to the report and  also supported ENISA in the peer review stages.

In some  cases (e.g. The NIS Platform, as referenced by the EU  Cyber Security Strategy), ENISA supported other institu- tions in creating such communities, whilst in other areas  sought to build such communities itself when requested  to do so by the Commission or the MSs.  ENISA built on the work it had carried out in the area of  the pan-European exercise and supported the TRANSITS  training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build communi- ties through a ‘learn by doing’ approach.  The following work packages constitute this Strategic  Objective:  WPK 4.1 — Support for EU cooperation initiatives  amongst NIS –related communities in the context of  the EU CSS This WPK is aimed at leveraging the positive experience  of ENISA in supporting CSIRTs, the CSIRT communities  and Law Enforcement communities to come up with  mutually satisfactorily ways to collaborate in NIS.  WPK 4.2 — European cybercrisis cooperation through  exercises This WPK sought to facilitate the planning of the next  pan-European Cyber Exercise in 2015-2016. ENISA  further enhanced its methodology, training outreach  and technical capability to organise large-scale  cybercrisis exercises.  1.4.1 WPK 4.1: Support for EU cooperation  initiatives amongst NIS-related  communities in the context of the EU CSS  ENISA leveraged its experience in supporting the CSIRTs,  the CSIRT communities and Law Enforcement communi- ties to enhance collaboration between these actors.  As such, ENISA developed and provided guidance  based on good practice for cooperation between key  stakeholder communities (CSIRTs, CIIP community,  Law Enforcement, Financial Services; Data Protection,  etc.). The Agency continued its work and support of the  TRANSITS training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning by doing’ approach.  ENISA also continued its support to the collaboration  between CSIRT and law enforcement communities,  which were based on the recent policy and technical  developments in this area in MSs. This work also includ- ed a close collaboration with other institutions active in  the field, namely the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the  collaboration agreement between ENISA and EC3 were  further developed, for example in the area of encourag- ing more operational and systematic flows of informa- tion between CSIRTs and law enforcement communities,  the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise,  the elaboration of general situational reports, reports  resulting from strategic analyses and good practice,  strengthening capacity building through training and  awareness raising in order to safeguard network and  information security at the EU level.  For better coordination and in order to avoid overlaps  ENISA was engaged in the EC3 programme board. The  well-established and jointly organised ENISA-EC3 work- shop continued during 2015.  1.4.2 WPK 4.2: European cybercrisis  cooperation through exercises  The activities of 2015 were focused on the following  areas:  pan-European cyber-exercises management;  enhance the capacity to support and organise  cyber-exercises;  promote maintain and improve EU cybercrisis  cooperation plans and procedures, e.g. the EU  Cyber Standard Operational Procedures (EU- CSOPs), and bring closer the cybercrisis cooperation  community.  Pan-European cyber-exercises management  In 2015 ENISA performed an in-depth analysis of the  evaluation data gathered from the Cyber Europe 2014  exercise. This resulted in a detailed evaluation report  with 33 discrete follow up actions that was shared with  the participating countries.  In addition, in 2015 ENISA kicked off the planning of the  next pan-European cyber-exercise, Cyber Europe 2016.  The lessons learned from Cyber Europe 2014 were  used to drive the plan for the new exercise in 2016; in  particular the upcoming exercises will include an en- hanced programme of different learning opportunities,  including training and small-scale focused exercises, in  addition to the main large-scale exercise event.  Enhance the capacity to support  and organise cyber-exercises  ENISA further improved its methodology as well as  seminar and trainings hand-outs, as well as its technical  capabilities for the organisation and management of  large-scale cybercrisis exercises.  The Agency built yet further its capability to organise  and manage complex, distributed exercises. New tools  and methods were introduced while the Agency also  facilitated strategic partnerships. The development of  an advanced tool for managing exercises, the Cyber  Exercise Platform (CEP), was one of the main achieve- ments in 2015.  International cybersecurity exercises  In 2015, ENISA analysed the options for a potential joint  cyber-exercises with non-EU countries and international  organisations. ENISA discussed with the EU and EFTA  countries the options for such joint initiatives in order  to plan the roadmap of future exercises. The strategic  decision for joint initiatives with non-EU or international  organisations will be taken by ENISA’s Management  Board. The report on the potential, future, joint  exercises was submitted to ENISA’s Management Board  as the one of the input documents in this strategic  decision-making process.  Promote, maintain and improve EU cybercrisis  cooperation plans and procedures, e.g. EU Cyber  SOPs, including bringing closer the cybercrisis  cooperation community.  ENISA continued to support EU countries in the mainte- nance and training of operational procedures for cyber- crisis cooperation. ENISA analysed the EU cross-border  cybercrisis cooperation procedures and plans, with  inputs from previous efforts, such as cyber-exercises,  and other related reports. Also ENISA continued to  work with all EU MSs on the actions, plans and tools  needed for improving the cross-border cooperation and  proposed mechanisms for a possible implementation,  closely involving MSs.  ENISA continued its efforts to bring the cybercrisis co- operation community closer in order increase the trust  building to increase synergies. To that end in 2015 ENISA  studied the EU-level structures on crisis management in  different sectors, such as aviation, health, etc., in order  to learn from their good practices. The report published  identifies recommendations with which the ICT sector  (cyber) can improve at an EU-level the response to major  cyber-incidents (also known as cybercrises).  ENISA leveraged its  experience in supporting  the CSIRTs, the CSIRT  communities and Law  Enforcement communities  to enhance collaboration  between these actors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/policy-industry-research https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/policy-industry-research https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-gaps-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-gaps-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-gaps-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-for-smes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-for-smes  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 37  SECTION I.

In addition, LEA and CSIRT communities  were involved in a project to address a common taxonomy  for those communities in order to advance the mutual way  of collaboration.  By 2016, at least 15 MSs are familiar with practices in  addressing different sector regulation challenges of  managing cybersecurity issues.  In 2015 the first step was taken — ENISA published a re- port on Cyber Security Information Sharing: An Overview  of Regulatory and Non-regulatory Approaches. The con- tribution to the report was done in cooperation with the  ENISA NLO network from all 28 MSs.  WPK 4.2: European cybercrisis cooperation through exercises  At least 25 EU MSs and EFTA countries confirm their  support for pan-European Cyber Exercises.  In total 29 EU and EFTA countries are participating in the  planning process of Cyber Europe 2016.  At least 25 MSs are familiar with and use the cross-border  cybercrisis EU Standard Operational Procedures by 2016.

For the MB, 1 ordinary meeting was organised in  2015. Also, 5 informal meetings were held with the  MB members who volunteered to contribute to the  drafting of the annual work programme. The existing  electronic newsletter continued throughout 2015 as  support for the MB Portal. For the PSG also, 2 formal  meetings were organised. To facilitate the exchange  of views, 3 PSG members were nominated by the  Group to be present at the informal meetings with  the MB members.  For the Executive Board, formal meetings  were organised during 2015, also by using the  teleconferencing facilities.  1.5.2 National Liaison Officer Network  Since 2014, ENISA initiated a number of activities with  the aim to strengthen cooperation within the National  Copyright ©Shutterstock  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/csirt-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/csirt-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/csirt-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/information-sharing/cybersecurity-information-sharing/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/information-sharing/cybersecurity-information-sharing/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/information-sharing/cybersecurity-information-sharing/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 3938  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  Liaison Officers’ (NLO) Network. NLOs are key actors  for the Agency’s daily work and interaction, assuring in  terms of outreach effective liaison to the MSs and dis- semination of ENISA activities. It expands the NLO-Net- work with contact points from governmental and public  agencies/organisations (e.g. CSIRTs and Regulatory  Bodies/Agencies, etc.).  In 2015, ENISA built upon these efforts and improved  its cooperation with the NLO Network, the first Point of  Contact for ENISA in the MSs. In particular, the Agency  continued working on the following actions:  an NLO meeting was organised on 4 March 2015,  in which improvements of the collaboration were  discussed;  the NLO terms of reference were published on the  ENISA website, clarifying the role of NLOs;  information was sent to the members of the NLO  network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, and  events organised by ENISA or where the Agency  contributes (e.g. co-organiser, etc.);  organisation of 1 ad hoc meeting on a specific topic  was identified in collaboration with the NLOs (visit  of Dutch Delegation from NCSC);  all relevant information on active ENISA projects  (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant  tender results, etc.) was sent to the network;  a new section on the ENISA website, called ‘Events  from the Member States’ was created in 2015.  This section provides information on NIS events  of international interest, taking place in EU and  EFTA Member States. This section is based on  information sent by NLOs.  1.5.3 Stakeholders’ engagement:  Key ENISA Events  Throughout 2015, ENISA restructured its engagement  with its stakeholders, focusing on two important lines  addressed to NIS Industry leaders and high level policy  and business representatives. Additionally, ENISA ex- plored the possibility of presenting compelling NIS-relat- ed themes in a different format by organising a thematic  conference. Activities in this area included:  1.5.3.1 Industry Event 2015  Among ENISA’s strategic goals is to enhance community  and capacity building in Europe (1). For this reason, ENI- SA organised a workshop with the European IT security  industry, on 8 July, in Brussels.  The primary goal of this event was to engage industry in  a dialogue on how to best serve their needs in a rapidly  changing threat environment, while focusing on policy  implementation issues.  This event brought together key industry decision-mak- ers in order to (a) explain the strategic vision of ENISA  and how the Agency works with the private sector to  achieve impact and (b) get industry feedback on their  expectation and on how to create impact and continu- ously improve the Agency’s output.  The workshop was structured around several informa- tion exchange sessions and a panel debate. In the infor- mation exchange sessions, ENISA informed EU industry  representatives of the work it is doing and solicited their  opinion on how well this meets their requirements. The  debate evolved around the topic of how the Agency  could help industry to be more secure in an economical- ly optimal fashion.  Due to the success of the event, a follow up event will  be organised in 2016 around two key themes of interest  for Industry.  1.5.3.2 ENISA High Level Event 2015  In 2015, the ENISA’s High Level Event (HLE) was the  main networking event of the Agency and it took place  in Brussels, on 9 November.  The ENISA HLE seeks to bring together key stakeholders of  the Network and Information Security field, policy-makers  and subject experts, including top-level representatives  from the Commission, Member States, Industry and Aca- demia. By interacting with the C-layer of its stakeholders,  ENISA seeks to collect input to improve and expand its  delivery and outreach. By bringing together representa- tives from all of ENISA’s stakeholder communities, HLE15  provided an appropriate platform for discussing the key  challenges that the Agency is likely to face in the next  5-year period and for defining the first set of priorities.  Panel discussions explored three themes which are  widely being discussed among policy and NIS circles:  ‘Cybersecurity at the Service of Industry’, ‘Aligning Cy- bersecurity Goals with Democratic Principles’, and ‘Iden- tifying Challenges and Priorities for NIS in Europe’. Key  participating figures included Commissioner Günther  H. Oettinger who gave the keynote speech on the EU  Perspective on key cybersecurity policy objectives,  representatives from the Luxemburgish Presidency, DG  Justice, European Cyber Crime Centre, eu-LISA, ANSSI  and Digital Rights Ireland, among others.  1.5.3.3 Cyber Security & Privacy Challenges  for Law Enforcement (CySPLE15)  On 18-19 May 2015, ENISA and the Heraklion Chamber  of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) jointly organised  a 2-day conference on the theme of Cyber Security and  Privacy Challenges for Law Enforcement. This confer- ence brought together experts from policy, industry and  academia on a unique opportunity to exchange views  on current EU policy issues and initiatives that intersect  cybersecurity, privacy and law enforcement. Current  and emerging technologies were analysed from an  application, organisational and legal view point in the  wake of new compliance requirements. Cross-border  cooperation, exercising rights, and exchanging informa- tion, in the EU and beyond, was emphasised throughout  this conference. In addition the Agency featured in the  HCCI publication providing its recommendations to  SMEs on cloud services. Beyond operational goals, CyS- PLE15 was a good example of the Agency collaborating  with a local authority in its Seat.  1.5.4 EU Relations  Part of the Agency’s horizontal activities include its  relations within the sphere of EU institutions and bodies  notably with the European Commission, the European  Parliament, as well as contacts within Member States to  promote NIS policy. ENISA’s Executive Director and Head  of Core Operations led the activities at the political  and industry level respectively, with the support of the  relevant departments. The press-media office also con- tributes actively by providing communication support,  input and the appropriate vehicles to disseminate the  Agency’s work in cybersecurity to the relevant stake- holders and citizens. This includes its work on:  supporting the Commission initiatives  n the Digital Single Market (DSM) for Europe;  supporting the first EU wide  cybersecurity Directive (NIS);  support for the European Commission Public  Consultation on ‘Contractual PPP’ launch of a public  consultation, around the Public-Private Partnership  as an important step towards securing the Digital  Single Market, by welcoming the initiative and  inviting its stakeholders to contribute.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 4140  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  Within this framework, activities in field included the  Executive Director participating in the following events:  the EPP Hearing on data driven security, on the 1st  July 2015, at the European Parliament in Brussels;  on 23 June 2015, at the IMCO Committee meeting  in Brussels, in an exchange of views on the public  interest information platform of the Universal  Service Directive;  the SEDE (Security and Defence) subcommittee  meeting in Brussels, on 16 March 2015 in an  exchange of views on cybersecurity and defence;  the 4th meeting of the Working Group on Digital  Union of the ITRE Committee on cybersecurity  at the European Parliament (EP) in Brussels.  Prof. Helmbrecht spoke to the Working Group  about ENISA’s role in ‘securing and enabling  Europe’s information society’, focusing on the  Agency’s work with Europe’s Computer Security  Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and the  facilitation of pan-European cyber-exercises;  the European Parliament high-level conference  in Brussels, jointly organised by the Civil Liberties  Committee (LIBE) and the Luxemburg Presidency of  the Council of the EU, co-chaired by the IMCO and  ITRE Committees, which debates the protection  of online privacy by enhancing IT security and  strengthening EU IT capabilities. ENISA welcomed  the separately discussed policy areas of stimulating  the adoption of privacy enhancing technologies  (PETs), addressing software and hardware  vulnerabilities and the internet infrastructure as  well as developing the EU potential for a strong and  vital IT industry. ENISA hopes for a stimulating effect  of the conference in the political debate on these  closely linked policies;  the Chatham House Cyber 2015 meeting on  ‘Security, Privacy and Competing interests’;  the 2nd High Level Conference on EU Cybersecurity,  organised by the European Commission, on 28  May 2015, in Brussels. The event focused on  making the EU an industrial leader in trustworthy  ICT; building capacity to fight cybercrime and  strengthen cybersecurity in the EU and beyond; and  achievements of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the  challenges and opportunities ahead;  the 10th Future Security Conference. The event  hosts high-level panellists mainly from ministries,  institutions and academia. ENISA’s Executive  Director Prof. Helmbrecht delivered the keynote  address on ‘Privacy and Data protection: an EU  Perspective’, where he mentioned the latest  developments in the area and spoke about how the  Agency has become a point of reference on eIDAS;  the 19th Security Conference on  Telecommunications and IT Security in Warsaw on  the 14-15 October 2015, at the Copernicus Science  Centre, Warsaw. ENISA was an honorary patron  of this year’s event. Prof Helmbrecht spoke about  cybersecurity standards giving an insight from the  EU perspective and ENISA’s role;  the Cyber Cooperation Summit in New York. Along  with representatives from the public and private  sectors, Prof. Helmbrecht spoke on the panel ‘Is  Cooperation Possible in Cyberspace?’ discussing the  challenges to protecting critical assets from cyber- attacks at a global level while minimising threats to  IT security;  the panel discussion on ‘Accelerating Digital  Innovation for Social Impact’ at ITU. Prof.  Helmbrecht spoke on the need for a close  collaboration between policy initiatives and  technology innovation, providing notable  examples of areas which offer such a potential,  and elaborated on how the EU needs an industry  policy approach to create a competitive EU based  ICT industry which can be based on a variety of  different tools;  talking to decision-makers at the Deutschland sicher  im Netz e.V event on 3 November 2015, referencing  ENISA’s multi-stakeholder approach. Helmbrecht  recommended cooperating with public authorities  at the state level in order to ‘create synergies  between existing programs and objectives’, for  example with national data protection authorities,  regulatory bodies and academia.  At the main forum at the Omnicard event in  Berlin on 21 January, 2015, on the panel on  ‘Secure identities — an effective tool to increase  information security?’. ENISA’s work ‘Framework on  how to evaluate National Cyber Security strategies’  also featured on the Omnicard website. The report,  addressed to policy experts and government  officials who design, implement and evaluate an  NCSS policy, is strongly aligned with the EU Cyber  Security Strategy (EU CSS) aiming to assist Member  States in developing capabilities in the area of NCSS.  the agency also hosted visits at its premises,  including a 2-day visit by an EP ITRE (Industry,  Research and Energy) delegation, Michal Boni MEP,  and Eva Kaili MEP, at its premises in Heraklion on  24-25 September 2015. The programme of their  visit included a: (i) brief presentation on ENISA and  the agency’s mission and scope of its activities; (ii)  presentation on flagship and major agency projects  including secure and smart infrastructures, cloud  computing, national cybersecurity strategies,  incident reporting, threat landscape, certification,  privacy and data protection, and supporting EC  policy processes. In each case, emphasis was placed  on the impact of the work; (iii) demonstration and  overview of ENISA’s training activities for the EU  CSIRT community and cyber-exercises; (iv) meeting  with ENISA staff for an exchange of views on the  upcoming challenges in the field of cybersecurity  within the European context and activities.  1.5.5 Corporate Communication  Year 2015 was a challenging one for the Agency in view  of the agreements on the NIS Directive, the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the announce- ment of the Digital Single Market (DSM) initiative by the  Commission, as these are areas in which the Agency is  particularly active. These landmark agreements make  the Agency’s work even more important within the EU  in cybersecurity, and its stimulus to the internal market  growth. The Agency also engaged itself this year more  at the EU level, communicating on cybersecurity chal- lenges and efforts — such as CSIRTS cooperation and  training, privacy-by-design (PbD), the need for stand- ards, for cybercooperation, awareness raising, incident  reporting, data protection and privacy issues, data  breach reporting, IoT security, support to private-public  partnerships (PPPs) and the trending developments  both at the industry and policy level. ENISA also got  engaged more by participating at targeted events for  the first time with its own booth at the Bitkom #hub15  event, thus establishing new platforms for dialogue and  networking, while providing support and recommenda- tions to the involved communities.  1.5.5.1 Dissemination activities  ENISA Press Office has sought to enhance its outreach  in the EU increasing its presence mainly in Belgium and  Germany, and also the United Kingdom and France. The  result was increased coverage, editorials, articles and  interviews published in top-tier online press and media  outlets with the major expert media in Europe. Special  emphasis was placed on messages tailored to the spe- cific audiences for ENISA’s events, projects, activities,  deliverables and press presence.  In the following subsections some of the activities,  events, and statistics associated with our communica- tion activities are presented.  Publications  ENISA is active in publishing the results of its work  through its reports, studies, info notes, papers and opin- ions, enhancing its communication and reach with vari- ous stakeholders. Additionally, ad hoc technical or policy  reports, papers, and studies were produced. In 2015 the  Agency published 53 deliverables as Work Programme  deliverables and produced various other reports, papers  and studies — including the Annual Activities Report  2014 and ENISA’s Work Programme 2016.  In 2015, ENISA’s main templates were redesigned and  relaunched improving significantly the look and feel and  functionality. In addition, ENISA’s publication process  was supported with professional graphic designs, imag- es and illustrations. In 2015 ENISA continued to identify  its deliverables using the EU Publication’s Office Identi- fication numbers (e.g. ISBN, DOI) so that all deliverables  are simultaneously published on the EU bookshop.  The Agency strives to make the Executive Director  and select staff members available to communicate  publically and provide their expertise externally to the  relevant communities and to the press and media, pro- moting best practices and developing synergies towards  a smooth cyber EU environment. Along these lines,  through the press office, a large number of interviews,  editorials, and articles have been made available to  leading publications, media outlets and other counter- parts, and the Agency is present at high level events,  promoting cybersecurity from an official, respected EU  ENISA is active in publishing  the results of its work  through its reports, studies,  info notes, papers and  opinions, enhancing its  communication and reach  with various stakeholders.  42  SECTION I.

A multilingual approach to  communication remains a priority for the Agency.  1.5.5.2 Media outreach  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme gives  the Agency the opportunity to extend its reach. The  Agency expanded its actions, further enhancing its me- dia distribution and outreach, and promoting a culture  of tailored targeting and cross-referencing aspects of its  work and multipliers.  Cross media impact  ENISA generated 3 383 mentions in EU media main- taining its reach and impact across the EU. Directly,  media releases on the ENISA website received 220 000  unique page views showing an increase, and individual  news stories received around 64 183 direct hits. Figures  continue to show a clear correlation between peaks  in web visitors and the distribution of media releases  in multiple channels, demonstrating the beneficial  effect of the communication and media activity. Total  readership includes an online reach of  2 378 448, 110  and 15 393,097 in print. In addition ENISA extended its  reach (2) to millions of citizens — to and through key EU  expert media — enhancing its reputation as experts and  dialogue partners in cybersecurity.  Social media  ENISA continues its prominent engagement with the  online community through its social media outlets. All  ENISA activities and deliverables are communicated  via social media channels, and generate increasing  traffic towards the Agency website, activities, events  and deliverables. In addition, they are incorporated  in the Agency’s communications (publications,  presentations, emails, brand material, etc.). In  particular, social media monitoring reports show  an increased reach through ENISA’s channels. Key  accomplishments for 2015, include:  The ENISA Twitter channel features 9 300 followers  (6 000 in 2014), generating over 4 000 tweets.  The ENISA LinkedIn page features 5 800 followers.  The ENISA YouTube channel contains 51 videos posted.  Digital media  The ENISA website continues to be the Agency’s main  communication channel, enhancing its presence. In  2015, the website received more than 3 000 000 unique  page views.  Technical improvements in 2015 include initiating the  development of a new online environment for ENI- SA’s website with the joint collaboration of staff mem- bers across all ENISA’s units.  The Agency is making continuous efforts for the im- provement of its website with usability studies and reg- ular updates in order to make it more user friendly and  reach citizens more effectively. Against this background  the Agency’s website layout and information architec- ture have been redesigned to further improve ease of  navigation, usability and end-user experience. The new  site is contemporary, responsive and has a dynamic fast- paced architecture providing access to ENISA’s Work  Programme, latest reports, events, projects, publi- cations and audiovisual material. The new website is  expected to go live early in 2016.  ENISA Portals — used by specialist expert communities  — have also been redesigned to improve end-user ex- perience, while a number of new web tools have been  introduced or updated to support ENISA’s activities.  Furthermore, the structure of the Agency’s three  mini-sites in French, German and Greek continue to  support and attract visitors. In addition, the dedicated  portal for the European Cyber Security Month was  redesigned and enhanced further with new content and  functionalities promoting the ECSM initiative and its  growing community.  Audio-visual material  In 2015, 3 videos were produced to communicate the  Agency’s activities.  ENISA’s Cyber-exercise team created  a video providing a peek into Europe’s  biggest cyber-exercise;  ENISA’s CSIRT team created a ‘train the trainers’  video introducing and demonstrating the teams’  work and training resources for the Member States.  Additionally, 3 videos were produced for internal com- munication purposes.  In addition the Agency’s departments produced info- graphics and posters on the topics of their work, aiming  to improve the visibility of the Agency’s work and key  facts and disseminate messages. These include:  ENISA PETs (privacy enhancing technologies) poster;  Posters and infographics on ENISA’s work on Critical  Information Infrastructure protection;  National Cyber Security Strategies Infographic;  ENISA Cyber Security Exercises and Training posters;  ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 Infographic;  4 new posters on cybersecurity education and  awareness.  1.5.5.3 Additional outreach activities  ENISA actively continued its participation in events,  increasing visibility, involvement, recognition and  awareness at a local, national or EU level through:  Europe Day activities with ENISA staff members  visiting schools in Athens and Heraklion  for a ‘Back to school’ session, giving the  opportunity to students to learn more about  the Agency’s work in cybersecurity for Europe.  The Agency also hosted an interactive seminar  session on trending cybersecurity topics for  representatives of embassies, the Hellenic  Authority for Communication Security and Privacy  (ADAE), local authorities, academia and educators.  The press office for the occasion collected  awareness-raising material on cybersecurity which  as available online on ENISA’s website including  posters, videos, recommendations, infographics  and games. Relevant branding material was also  produced and distributed.  The European Cyber Security Challenge initiative  with organisations from six countries. The  competition is an opportunity for participants, who  are not IT professionals, to test and put their digital  skills at work, and also acts as a platform for the  exchange of good practices among contestants, and  to motivate young people to enhance and further  develop their skills to tackle online threats. In 2016  the event is supported by ENISA.  Hosting visits from EU schools, providing the  opportunity to meet with staff and experts, bringing  educators and students closer to the EU activities  on cybersecurity and seeing the EU Agency from  within, meet staff and follow presentations on  ENISA’s work and awareness on cyberthreats.  An event for the presentation of the new — to be  — School of European Education (SEE) in Heraklion  hosted at its premises on 30 April a welcoming  party of around sixty participants including teachers  and parents from the SEE, and representatives from  Heraklion Municipality, of the School Buildings  Organisation and of the new Regional Director of  Education in Crete.  Supporting NIS experts in the production of the  successful series of ‘Info Notes’ activities where  short, expert reports provide a pragmatic analysis  on trending security issues and themes. The  activity has proven to be an important tool which  stakeholders turn to for reliable information on  security issues.  The News from the Member States activity,  a request of the NIS community, covering the latest  technical cybersecurity updates from EU Member  States aiming at increasing interaction within the  specific community.  The organisation of an information security  workshop (Infosec) in Athens in September 2015.  This invitation-only event welcomed participants  from EU Agencies such as Europol, CEPOL,  BEREC, ECHA, eu-LISA, Cedefop, EFCA, OHIM,  ERA, EEA, EMSA, FRONTEX, FRA, IMI, EIGE, the  Translation Centre of the European Bodies,  and FCH. The workshop aimed at providing  valuable insights on information security at the  highest operational level. ENISA experts gave an  overview on the cyberthreat landscape, risks and  considerations for cloud platforms, as well as an  inside look at ENISA’s technical trainings and the  Cyber Europe Exercises.  Hosting workshops and visits such as that of the:  (i) German Ministry of Interior on areas of shared  interest, such as critical information infrastructure  protection, threat landscape, data protection and  others. The discussion revealed opportunities for  further cooperation between the two organisations  especially in policy implementations where ENISA  has significant experience at an EU level;  In 2015, ENISA:  produced 40 press releases (doubling,  compared 23 media releases in 2014) and  75 news items on the ENISA website;  simultaneously published media  releases and news items on ENISA’s  social media channels on Facebook,  Twitter, and LinkedIn.

An array of varying activities was organised that  included the EU Agencies Network coordination,  ENISA Christmas activities for staff and families,  and various internal coordination activities in  such areas as strategy, organisational culture and  team building.  1.5.6 Quality Management System  and Project Office  The Quality Management System (QMS) of the Agency  aimed at responding to a mix of regulatory and stake- holder requirements for operations mostly, in an effort  to improve organisational performance and compliance.  Scheduled annual activities have aimed at the promulga- tion and maintenance of standard operating procedures  (SOPs) and a methodology that supports the opera- tional processes of the Agency. The primary goal of the  documented QMS in 2015 was to improve performance  across the Agency, while reducing operational costs and  enhancing stakeholder satisfaction. Implementing SOPs  has been a priority in order to increase operational effi- ciency. Good examples of SOPs that had a tangible impact  in improving efficiency and effectiveness include: the SOP  on the Review and Publication of Deliverables, the SOP  on handling Article 14 requests, etc.  The ENISA Project Office supported the smooth prom- ulgation of the annual work program of the Agency co- ordinating an array of contributors among Agency staff  and its MB, PSG and the Commission. Additionally the  Project Office’s work entailed responding to about 150  individual requests for ad hoc contributions to manage- ment work such as briefings on cross-cutting themes,  coordinating the coherence of recommendations across  the Department, etc. In 2015, the editing and produc- tion of the Annual Activity Report 2014 was coordinated  by the Project Office team.  1.5.7 Article 14 Requests  Article 14 requests are an instrument that allows the MSs  or EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA for car- rying out particular activities. This mechanism has become  increasingly valuable and it has grown in significance to the  extent that the Agency believes that it needs to be explicit- ly planned for in the annual work programme.  The following table provides an overview of the Article  14 requests in 2015 compared to those in 2014.  The table of requests outlines all current ongoing  requests.

On top of these tasks, in 2015 the DPO contributed  to the organisation and follow up of the EDPS visit  at ENISA, which supported the Agency’s compliance  with Regulation 45/2001/EC, as well as its cooperation  with EDPS on operational matters. Moreover, the  ENISA’s DPO organised the 38th meeting of the  EU agencies DPOs & EDPS network (approximately  70 participants), which was hosted by ENISA in Athens  in November 2015.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 49  2.1 MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL  RESOURCES  2.1.1 Budget Execution of EU  subsidy (C1 funds)  In terms of budget execution, the expenditure appropri- ations of ENISA Budget 2015 of EUR 10 064 274, were  committed at a rate of 100.00 % on 31 December 2015.  ENISA did not cancel any appropriations of the year (C1)  appropriations by the end of the year (cancellation  rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven capacity of the Agency to efficiently use the  entrusted funds, in order to implement its annual  Work Programme as well as manage its administrative  expenditure and investments.  SECTION II. MANAGEMENT  OF RESOURCES  The respective payment rate on expenditure appro- priations was 92.89 % in 2015 compared to 85.61 % in  2014. This payment rate is high and demonstrates that  the capacity of the Agency to finalise its annual activ- ities as well as execute the relevant payments within  the year of reference was maintained. The procure- ment planning which was moved forward to the end of  the preceding year (2014) and enabled the launch of  projects related to the Work Programme in early 2015,  contributed significantly to the improvement of the  payment rate of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.2 Amending Budgets/Budgetary Transfers  The following table summarises the effect of the Budget  transfers Nos 1 to 7, approved by the Executive Director  (ED) of ENISA, and the Amending Budget (AB) 1/2015,  approved by the Management Board, on the initial  Budget 2015:  II.

Management of Resources  The table below summarises the effect of the Budget  transfers Nos 8 and 9, approved by the ED after the adop- tion of the AB 1/2015 to the final budget execution:  service level agreements have been concluded with  each of the private schools being used by the children  of the staff.  In 2015, 4 implementing rules prepared by the Commis- sion (Appraisal of CA’s, Appraisal of TA’s, Working Time  and Teleworking) were considered by ENISA and were  sent to the Management Board for approval. These  approved implementing rules provide clarification and  detail on the application of the Staff Regulations which  provide the legal basis for the obligations and rights of  Staff members.  In 2015, ENISA engaged consultants to complete a re- port on cost of living and quality of life in Athens for  all the years from 2011 up to 2015. Also, a number of  team building activities with staff were held through- out the year to improve team spirit and the working  environment. These exercises proved to be very well  received by the staff and also helped to bridge the bar- rier created from the operation of two offices in a small  agency and improved the day-to-day work through new  projects which are running  The organisational chart, establishment plan and the  Statistics for ENISA staff is attached in Annex A.1.  2.2.2 Results of screening  The Agency performed the job screening benchmarking  exercise for the second time for 2015. The result of the  exercise, which is a snapshot of the staffing situation on  end December 2015, appears in Annex A.4. It is relevant  to mention that the ‘Overhead’, support functions, is  only 21.35 % of the total statutory staff count, which is  below the maximum value accepted for the Agencies  that is estimated at 25 %.  2.3 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2.3.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multi-annual  character of programmes as well as the nature of the  payments concerned. In order to achieve the best  control possible, the Agency has focused intensively  on the verification of results before transactions are  initiated (‘ex ante verification’).  In line with Internal Control Standard 8 (ICS 8  Processes and Procedures), the Agency has done the  ex post control report of the financial year 2014. The  recommendations issued on the report were addressed  during the year.  The ex post controls of the financial year 2014 were  quiet extensive. A total of 174 financial transactions  were sampled and controlled representing 9.22 % of all  financial transactions of the Agency and representing  70.99 % of the 2014 Agency’s budget.  As a result 1 recommendation was issued which regards  a delay of payments which did not generate any interest  to be paid.  Moreover, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is in  charge of the annual audit of the Agency which is con- cluded by the publication of an annual report according  to the provisions of Article 287(1) of TFEU. For several  consecutive years, the ECA reports have confirmed the  improvement in the Agency’s overall internal controls  environment and performance.  2.4 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  ENTRUSTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND  ENTITIES.  The Agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  2.5 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT RESULTS  AND FOLLOW UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS.  2.5.1 Internal Audit Services (IAS)  At the beginning of 2015, the Agency had 1 open  recommendation. During the end of January 2015, the  Agency closed it. In 2016, the IAS will perform the Risk  Assessment for the Agency.  2.5.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  The annual report of ECA on the accounts of ENISA for  2014 contained 1 important recommendation, which  was open in 2012, when the Court noted a delay in  performance of a physical inventory count.  The recommendation concerning the physical inventory  was completed in 2014.

Summary of transfers’ effect on final budget execution:  2.1.3 Carry forward of  commitment appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to the EU  subsidy (C1 appropriations), which were not consumed  by payments at the end of 2015, were carried forward  (automatic carry forward) to 2016 (C8 appropriations).  All commitment appropriations corresponding to the  subsidy from the Greek Government for the lease of  ENISA premises in Greece (external assigned revenue  — R0 appropriations) were paid by 31 December 2015,  therefore no commitment appropriations were automati- cally carried over to 2016 (R0 appropriations).  The funds carried forward to 2016 (C8 appropriations)  are detailed below:  The total cancelled appropriations carried forward from  2014 to 2015 (C8 appropriations of 2015) but finally not  paid in 2015, was EUR 80 675.08 (representing 6.05 %  of the total appropriations carried forward from 2014  to 2015).  2.1.4 Types of Procurement Procedures  In 2015, a total of 47 Procurement procedures were  launched, resulting in 50 contracts (19 framework  contracts, 11 service contracts and 20 specific con- tracts awarded under Re-Opening of Competition) and  301 Purchase Orders (143 of which were issued under  pre-existing framework contracts) were signed.  2.1.5 Interest charged by suppliers  During 2015, the Agency had to pay no interest to its  suppliers as result of keeping the payment terms agreed  with the suppliers.  2.2 MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN  RESOURCES  2.2.1 Human Resources  At the end of 2015, 69 statutory staff were employed in  the Agency.  During 2015, 4 staff left the Agency, 7 vacancy notices  were published and 17 staff were recruited or took up  new duties within the Agency. ENISA still experiences  significant challenges in attracting and holding suitably  qualified staff to support the activities of the Agency.  This is a challenge due to several factors, mainly the  types of post that are being offered (CA posts) and the  low coefficient factor which applies to salaries of ENISA  employees in Greece.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members in  Athens, where no European Schools are based, several  Title Total C1 appropriations  carried forward to 2016  Title 1 – Staff 335.988,15  Title 2 – Administration 181.037,92  Title 3 - Operations 157.494,47  Total 674.520,54  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5352  SECTION II.  Management of Resources  tion and disposal process, which was launched following  the physical inventory count, is still ongoing.  The ECA’s report on 2015 accounts is expected in the  third quarter of 2016. The Agency expects that the  Court’s opinion on the true and fair presentation of the  accounts as well as on the legality and regularity of the  transactions underlying the accounts will be unqualified  as it has been for the past 8 years.  2.5.3 Follow up of audits plans, audits and  recommendations  The Agency has only 1 open recommendation regarding  the workflows of financial transactions.  This recommendation was closed in the beginning of  2015 when the tool ‘Paperless’ was implemented (Jan- uary 2015).  2.5.4 Follow up of observations  from the Discharge authority  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 29 April  2015, the Executive Director of the Agency was granted  the discharge in respect of the implementation of the  Agency’s budget for the financial year 2013.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 29 April  2015, the closure of the accounts of the Agency for the  financial year 2013 was approved.  2.5.4.1 Follow up of the 2012 discharge  The Discharge authority notes from the Court’s report  that regarding one comment made in the Court’s 2011  report and marked as ‘Ongoing’ in the Court’s 2012  report, corrective actions were taken and the comment  is now marked in the Court’s report as ‘Completed’.  The Discharge authority notes furthermore that the  comment made in the Court’s 2012 report is now  marked in the Court’s report as ‘Ongoing’.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the infor- mation on the impact of its activities on Union citizens  is provided on the Agency’s website through the yearly  publication of strategic documents including the Annual  Report, as well as new communication channels such as  social media.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the Agency  performed a comprehensive physical inventory count  in 2013; notes that the results of the inventory count  were reported within the Annual Accounts of 2013 and  that the corresponding comment of the Court marked  the action as ‘Ongoing’ because the declassification  procedure for the items out of use was still pending at  the time of the Court’s audit.  2.5.4.2 Budget and financial management  The Discharge authority noted that budget monitor- ing efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in  a budget implementation rate of 94.41 % and that the  payment appropriations execution rate was 86.46 %;  points out that in November 2013, additional funds  were approved by the Commission for the financing  of the Agency’s new office in Athens; notes that in this  context, a total of EUR 500 000 was not committed at  year-end and was carried over, following a decision by  the Management Board.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that during  2013, the Agency’s operational staff were relocated to  Athens while its administrative staff remained in Herak- lion; agrees with the Court’s opinion that administrative  costs could be reduced if all the Agency’s staff were  to be centralised in one location and encourages the  Agency to prepare a strategy that would resolve this  issue effectively.  2.5.4.3 Commitments and carryovers  The Discharge authority notes that the total amount  of committed appropriations carried over was  EUR 1 200 000, representing 13.5 % of total ap- propriations; is concerned that out of this amount,  EUR 800 000 are Title II carry-overs, representing 59 %  of Title II total appropriations; acknowledges that the  EUR 500 000 referred to in paragraph 3 as well as an  additional EUR 300 000 carried over for the financing of  furniture and network equipment for the new office in  Athens, explain the high level of carry-overs for Title II.  2.5.4.4 Transfers  The Discharge authority noted with satisfaction that  according to the Agency’s Annual Report, as well as the  Court’s audit findings, the level and nature of transfers in  2013 have remained within the limits of the financial rules.  2.5.4.5 Procurement and recruitment procedures  The Discharge authority noted that that for the year  2013, neither sampled transactions nor other audit  findings have led to any comments on the Agency’s pro- curement procedures in the Court’s report.  The Discharge authority noted that the Court made no  comments in its report as regards the Agency’s recruit- ment procedures.  2.5.4.6 Prevention and management  of conflicts of interests and transparency  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the Man- agement Board approved and signed the decision on  practical arrangements for implementing transparency  and confidentiality rules in October 2013 and ac- knowledged from the Agency that CVs, declarations of  interest of the Executive Director, the Directors and the  Heads of Department were fully published on the Agen- cy’s website as requested by the Discharge authority on  the Agency’s discharge 2012.  2.5.4.7 Comments on internal controls  The Discharge authority noted that in September 2013  the Internal Control Coordinator role (ICC) was fully de- ployed and addressed as a priority the implementation  and subsequent closure of several recommendations  made by the Commission’s Internal Audit Service (IAS).  2.5.4.8 Internal audit  The Discharge authority noted that during 2012,  a risk assessment exercise was conducted by the  IAS in order to determine the audit priorities for the  following 3 years; notes that the IAS submitted its final  strategic audit plan of 2013-2015 for the Agency on 3  December 2012.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the IAS  performed a desk review audit on ‘Project Management  in Operations’ during 2013, which resulted in a total of  5 recommendations; notes that 4 of these recommen- dations have already been closed while the fifth one is  to be reviewed by the IAS.  The Discharge authority noted that no critical recom- mendations from previous IAS reports were open as of  31 December 2013; notes furthermore that the only  ‘Very Important’ rated recommendation open at the  year-end has been implemented and was awaiting to be  reviewed by the IAS; points out that this recommenda- tion relates to the application of ex post controls; calls  on the Agency to inform the Discharge authority when  the ex post controls are validated by the IAS.  2.5.4.9 Other comments  The Discharge authority acknowledged that according  to the lease agreement between the Greek authorities,  the Agency and the landlord, rent for the offices in  Athens is paid by the Greek authorities; is concerned  by the constant late payment of rent, delayed by  several months, which presents business continuity  and financial risks for the Agency; takes note that the  Agency has commenced discussions with the interested  parties in this regard; notes furthermore that to date,  the landlord has accepted the delays attributed to the  procedures of the Greek Government without imposing  any penalty on the Agency; calls on the Agency to  continue its efforts in order to mitigate the risks brought  by this situation and to inform the Discharge authority  on the progress.  The Discharge authority noted with concern that the  Agency failed to answer the question on the cost-effec- tiveness and environment-friendliness of its working  space; calls on the Agency to inform the Discharge  authority on the measures in place.  In detail:  the declassification exercise was done in  2014 as well as the donation of goods to  public institutions in need;  the auction exercise was completed in  2015;  the process regarding the physical  destruction/recycling of the remaining  declassified items is estimated to be  completed in April 2016.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5554  3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT  The Agency is actually using the Risk Assessment done  by the Internal Audit Service in 2012.  The Risk Self-Assessment procedure was adopted in  2015. The Risk Self-Assessment will be done in 2016.  Regarding fraud prevention and detection, the Manage- ment Board adopted the Agency’s Anti-fraud strategy  and action plan in 2014 a specific procedure for whistle- blowing will be done in 2016.  3.2 COMPLIANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS  OF INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational struc- ture and the internal control systems suited to the achieve- ment of policy and control objectives, in accordance with  the standards and having due regard to the risks associated  with the environment in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the  minimum requirements with which its internal control  systems need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the Agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA  and IAS). During 2015, the Agency achieved compliance  with the internal control standards listed below.  3.2.1 Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in the  ENISA Regulation. Mission statements for departments  and units were established based on the evolution of  the organisation in 2015. The roles and tasks of each  department and unit are clearly defined.  3.2.2 Ethical and organisational values (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place — including up- dates and yearly reminders — to ensure that all staff is  aware of relevant ethical and organisational values (e.g.  ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fraud  prevention, reporting of irregularities). Specific training  is organised by the Agency for its staff every year in  order to reinforce professional behaviour, compliance  with the expected behaviour, ethics and integrity, and in  order to prevent workplace harassment.  SECTION III. ASSESSMENT OF THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE  INTERNAL CONTROL  SYSTEMSIII.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5756  SECTION III.  Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  3.2.3 Staff Allocation and Mobility (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary, management aligns organisa- tional structures and staff allocations with priorities  and workload.  3.2.4 Staff evaluation and development  (ICS 4)  In the context of the Career Development Report (CDR)  process, discussions are held individually with all staff to  establish their annual objectives. Staff performance is  evaluated according to standards set by the Agency. An  annual training plan is developed at Agency level based  on needs deriving from the policy of the Agency. As  part of the CDR process, every year each staff member  completes an individual training plan. Management  ensures that at a minimum every staff member attends  the compulsory training courses defined in the annual  training plan.  3.2.5 Objectives and Performance  Indicators (ICS 5)  Work Programme and budget preparation procedures  were developed in 2009 and revised in 2014. The  Annual Work Programme (WP) of the Agency is  developed by the Agency services, with continuous  input and guidance from its two governing bodies,  the Management Board and the Permanent  Stakeholders Group. The WP clearly sets out how  the planned activities at each management level  contribute to the achievement of objectives, taking  into account the resources allocated and the risks  identified. The WP objectives are established on  SMART (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant,  Time-bound) criteria and updated or changed during  the year in order to address significant changes in  priorities and activities.  The role of the Executive Board is to assist preparing  decisions to be adopted by the Management Board on  administrative and budgetary matters only.  The Agency has based the measurement of its perfor- mance on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are  applied to all areas of activity. KPIs are more qualitative  for the Agency’s operational goals, whereas they are  more quantitative for the Agency’s administrative goals.  The effectiveness of key controls is assessed using  relevant KPIs, including self-assessments that have been  carried out in the form of progress reports and follow  up actions that seek to re-align divergences from the  Work Programme.  The Agency’s Work Programmes are annual and mul- ti-annual. The MB and the PSG give orientation and in- put on a regular basis throughout the WP development  process as well as during the year of implementation.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed again to optimise the  budget execution for 5 consecutive years. The commit- ment rate of budget appropriations available for the  year 2015 (C1) reached 100 %, another consecutive  year in which the total Agency budget was consumed.  3.2.6 Risk management process (ICS 6)  The IAS performed a risk assessment of the Agency in  2012. Risks identified as very important during the pre- vious audits were addressed by the Agency and actions  were planned and communicated to the IAS accordingly.  In 2014, effort and resources were devoted to address- ing and mitigating the risks that had been identified.  This satisfactorily addressed the recommendations of  both the ECA and IAS, as noted in their annual reports.  The Risk Self-Assessment procedure was adopted in  2015. The Risk Self-Assessment will be done in 2016.  Moreover, the Internal Audit Service will conduct their  Risk Assessment in September 2016.  3.2.7 Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned and  communicated by means of the Executive Director’s Deci- sions (EDD). It conforms to regulatory requirements and is  appropriate to the level of importance of the decisions to  be taken as well as the risks involved. All delegated, author- ising officers have received and acknowledged the Charter  of the role and responsibility of the Authorising Officer (by  Delegation) as well as the individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date. The Agency records  derogations granted to allow staff to remain in sensitive  functions beyond 5 years along with documentation of  the risk analysis and the controls for mitigation.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been taken  in order to avoid potential conflict of interest situa- tions. However, due to the small size of the Agency, the  mobility of staff in sensitive functions is very limited and  takes into account service needs and available resourc- es. Proper back-ups are designated in order to ensure  business continuity.  3.2.8 Processes and Procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen the Pro- cesses and Procedures Internal Control Standard. The  Agency created a policy on financial circuits. The roles  and responsibilities of financial actors are described in  this policy as well as existing workflows (see comment  on ‘Paperless’ application in ICS 11).  A Code of Professional Conduct for ex ante financial ver- ification was developed. This document emphasises the  role and responsibilities of the Financial Verifying Agent.  The Agency proceeded in 2015 with the full 2014 ex  post control exercise and will deliver the 2015 ex post  control report in the first semester of 2016.  Importantly in 2014, a Quality Management System was  implemented strengthening the performance manage- ment of the Agency.  3.2.9 Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The Management Team, which comprises the  Executive Director and the heads of departments and  units, meets weekly and sets priorities for the actions  to be taken in order to achieve the short- and medi-  The Agency has based  the measurement of  its performance on Key  Performance Indicators  (KPIs) that are applied  to all areas of activity.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5958  SECTION III.  Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  um-term objectives of the Agency. A list of action items  is compiled. It contains all agreed actions as allocated  to specific departments or units. The list is published on  a dedicated Intranet page and regularly reviewed by the  Management Team. Management supervision covers  both legality and regularity aspects (i.e. set up and com- pliance with applicable rules) and operational perfor- mance (i.e. achievement of Annual WP objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in order to  address accepted ECA and IAS audit recommendations  and monitors the implementation of these action plans  throughout the year.  The implementation of the project management tool  MATRIX has enhanced the planning, implementation,  monitoring and reporting of operational projects, and  has enabled the establishment of a common project  management framework across different organisational  units of the Agency.  3.2.10 Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational activ- ities and financial transactions — are in place to ensure  the continuity of all services during ‘business-as-usual’  interruptions (such as sick leave, staff mobility, migra- tion to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been devel- oped and implemented. An Agency-wide BCP, designed  to cover crisis response and recovery arrangements  with respect to major disruptions, has been developed  and fully implemented. The latter BCP identifies the  functions, services and infrastructure that need to be  restored within certain time limits and the resources  necessary for this purpose. Electronic and hardcopy  versions of both BCPs are stored in secure and easily  accessible locations, which are known to relevant staff.  3.2.11 Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related pro- cedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory security  measures; (2) provisions on document management;  and (3) rules on the protection of personal data. Infor- mation security policy specific to data categorisation  and labelling is in place. As regards the exchange of  information classified at the level RESTREINT UE/EU  RESTRICTED, an administrative arrangement between  the Security Directorate of the European Commission  and the Agency was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets  out the conditions according to which documents  need to be registered, filed and saved using the  Agency’s registration and filing systems. A special,  intranet-based tool was developed to capture the  information needed to register and retrieve docu- ments. In addition, an incoming and outgoing mail  procedure was developed.  As regards the financial and administrative workflows,  ENISA adopted in January 2015 a new application, ‘Pa- perless’, which routes documents to staff involved in  preparation, review and approval of all kinds of work  related documents and transactions. All financial and  administrative workflows are well documented and all  supporting documents are uploaded and stored in ‘Pa- perless’ including changes and comments of workflow  actors. Approved workflows are permanently stored  and an appropriate audit trail is produced.  The application ‘Paperless’ was a breakthrough in  ENISA day-to-day operations, as it heavily contributed  to streamlining processes, reducing paper circulation  (green office), reducing courier costs between the two  offices (Athens and Heraklion), reducing time needed  for repetitive administrative tasks and significantly  reducing archive space and management.  3.2.12 Information and communication  (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices are in  place for sharing information and monitoring activities.  These include regular Management Team meetings  during which issues relevant to performance, audit  results and financial information are discussed, and ac- tions are decided upon and assigned. Regular financial  reporting is available to all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All  engagements in new projects are discussed during the  implementation of the Annual Work Programme and  decisions are documented and communicated.  An External Communication Strategy is in place.  ICT security policies are in place for main systems  and sub-systems, and described in procedures and  policies. Internal communication is also supported  through use of the intranet and through weekly staff  meetings within units. External communication and  dissemination procedures must be further developed  and communicated to staff accordingly.  The weekly Staff Meeting is used as platform of  communication between all departments. Every week,  staff members can share their work with the rest of  the Agency.  3.2.13 Accounting and Financial Reporting  (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are document- ed in the Internal Control Manual of the Agency. The  preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting  on budget implementation is centralised in the Fi- nance, Accounting and Procurement Section, within the  Administration and Support Department. The European  Commission’s budget and accounting management sys- tem, ABAC, is the main tool used for financial manage- ment. It is compliant with applicable financial regulatory  frameworks. The ABAC Assets module is used for the  management of ENISA’s inventory. Financial manage- ment information produced by the Agency, including  financial information provided in the Annual Activity  Report, complies with applicable financial and account- ing rules.  3.2.14 Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to  measure the performance and assess the impact of  the Agency’s projects as provided for in its Annual  Work Programmes.  The General Report and the Annual Activity Report are  the tools used by the Agency to report on performance  and impact. The feedback of relevant stakeholders is  taken into account.  3.2.15 Assessment of internal control  systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the compli- ance of annual activities and performance with the  internal control systems in place, as part of preparation  of the Annual Activity Report.  3.2.16 Internal Audit Capability (ICS 16)  The Head of the Administration and Support Depart- ment assumes the Internal Control Coordination (ICC)  function. He is responsible for implementing internal  control systems in the Agency and liaising with the IAS of  the European Commission. As the Agency lacks human  resources, the role of Internal Audit Capability (IAC) can- not be performed. Since 2005, the Agency has relied on  the IAS to carry out internal audits. The IAS plays a key  role in auditing bodies of the European Union.  Internal Control tasks performed in ENISA include 100 %  of ex ante verifications, annual ex post controls, hierar- chical controls and outsourced engagements, coordinat- ed by the ICC.  In line with the Strategic Audit Plan 2014-2016, in 2014  the Internal Audit Service (IAS) carried out a control ‘on  the spot’. Out of 25 open recommendations in 2014,  the Agency has only 1 remaining open which was closed  in February 2015. The role of ICC was reinforced in  order to comply with all the recommendations issued  by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the Agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that  have the requisite knowledge and skills; (2) systems  and procedures designed and implemented to man- age the key risks effectively; and (3) no instances of  ineffective controls that have exposed the Agency to  substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of the  continuous improvement of management procedures.  It includes taking into account any control weaknesses  reported and exceptions recorded.  As regards the financial and  administrative workflows,  ENISA adopted in January  2015 a new application,  ‘Paperless’, which routes  documents to staff involved  in preparation, review and  approval of all kinds of  work related documents  and transactions.  SECTION IV. MANAGEMENT ASSURANCE  4.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The risk framework is used as a common means of  classifying and communicating risk across the Agency.  It provides a common understanding and language  regarding ‘risk’, as well a structure for the assessment,  reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk framework  defines the categories, sub-categories and business  risks applicable at the organisational level, for ENISA as  a whole. It includes:  risk categories and sub-categories;  risks specific to each category (business risks);  risk definition.  Assessment by management:  The Agency’s operations are channelled through  the following activity areas that belong to administra- tive functions:  own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with the annual work programme in terms of  operational and administrative activities;  contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be in-sourced  by the Agency. External agents are appointed either  through a procurement procedure or through a call  for expressions of interest for funding related to the  co-organisation of events. Alternatively, in the case  of working group members, they may be chosen by  means of a selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its adminis- trative activities, the Agency has carried out the activi- ties presented in the table on the next page.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 61  IV.

Number of transactions as compared to number  of erroneous transactions.  4.2 EXCEPTIONS  In 2015, the Agency recorded 21 exceptions. Only 3 are  with high materiality. For one of these cases, the root  of the problem was the late opening of the financial  tool ABAC and one case is regarding the Greek Author- ities for the payment of the rent of the Athens building  (delay in receiving the funds from the Greek Authorities  to pay the rent leaded to an a posteriori commitment).  The last one concerned an error of encoding in ABAC  which was spotted by the Financial Verifying Agent. By  the time that the workflow was redone the commit- ment had become a posteriori.  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors.  The results are contained in the reports listed. These  reports result from a systematic analysis of the evidence  available. This approach provides sufficient guarantees  as to the completeness and reliability of the informa- tion reported, and results in complete coverage of the  budget delegated to the Executive Director of ENISA.

MATERIALITY CRITERIA  ENISA is not using any materiality criteria. Indeed 100 %  of the financial transactions are submitted to the ex  ante control (verification before the authorisation).  In order to further strengthen the controls, ENISA  executes a yearly ex post control exercise (verification  after authorisation).  The exercise methodology for sample selection is  a judgmental (non-statistical) method designed to  demonstrate bias in the selection of transactions for  ex post control taking into account the potential for  error identified by the Agency, either through the value  of the transaction, the initiating procedure used and  the Agency’s risk assessment, their documentation or  through discussion.  D1 STAGE 1: PROCUREMENT  ANNEX D. INTERNAL CONTROL  TEMPLATES FOR BUDGET  IMPLEMENTATION (ICT)  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 81  D.1.1 Planning  Main control objectives: Effectiveness, efficiency and economy. Compliance (legality and regularity).

The authorising officer shall report to the Manage- ment Board on the performance of his duties in the  form of an annual activity report […]. The consolidated  annual activity report shall indicate the results of the  operations by reference to the objectives set, the risks  associated with the operations, the use made of the  resources provided and the efficiency and effective- ness of the internal control systems, including an over- all assessment of the costs and benefits of controls.  The consolidated annual report shall be submitted to  the Management Board for assessment.  2.  No later than 1 July each year the consolidated  annual activity report together with its assessment  shall be sent by the Management Board to the Court  of Auditors, to the Commission, to the European  Parliament and to the Council.  The Management Board received a copy of the 2015  Annual Activity Report produced by the Executive Direc- tor of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 13 June 2016.  After the Executive Board scrutinized the draft assess- ment of the Management Board, here follows the  assessment by the Management Board of the consoli- dated annual activity report (hereafter AAR):  Section 1 of the report presents key results in the  implementation of the ENISA Work programme 2015  and leads to conclusion that The Agency completed  all deliverables agreed with the Management Board  both within time and within budget. A relevant set of  published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and  events are listed as part of the result achieved by the  Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's re- sults exceeded the targets established in the Work  Programme 2015. Overall, the report is in line with  the ENISA Work Programme 2015 in this regard.  Section 2 describes ENISA’s management of resourc- es. This section reports on the budget execution of  the EU subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were  committed at a rate 100%. This section also reports  on results of job screening benchmarking exercise.

LIST OF POLICY DOCUMENTS 89  9  A MESSAGE FROM  THE EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR OVERVIEW  I would like to hereby let the readers of this report know that 2015 was yet another  successful year for the Agency, with ENISA maintaining its track record of delivering  according to plan and within its allocated budget. At the same time, we improved the  positioning of services towards our major stakeholders while ensuring compliance with the  regulatory framework.  EXTERNAL IMPACT Broadly speaking, ENISA’s activities can be divided across three main areas:  recommendations to its stakeholders;  support for policy development and implementation;  ‘hands on’ work with operational communities.  Throughout 2015, ENISA strengthened its contribution in each of these areas, supporting  Member States and private sector actors in responding to a rapidly developing threat  environment and helping to lay solid foundations for the information systems of the future.  ENISA activities are carried on in close collaboration with its stakeholders and during 2015  a number of high profile events have been organised or co-organised by ENISA such as: EU  Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign, Annual Privacy Forum (APF), High Level Event (HLE),  Industry Event, etc. At the same time the pan-European exercises scheduled for 2016 have  been prepared in 2015.  As far as the 2015 annual Work Programme is concerned, the Agency successfully produced  a total of 53 deliverables on a wide variety of subjects ranging from national issues such as  the protection of critical infrastructure to issues affecting individual citizens such as privacy  and Data Protection.  This year’s highlights include best practices and recommendations in sectors such as eHealth,  Finance and Smart Infrastructure and Services.  The work carried out in the area of Article 13a of the Telecommunications Framework Directive  of 2009 continues to be the best known example of where ENISA is working to support policy  initiatives, but it is important to mention that during 2015 the Agency has continued a number  of other well known activities such as CSIRT Training and preparations for Cyber Exercises.  Article 14 requests, which are essentially a mechanism that allow Member States and  EU institutions to request specific items of work from the Agency outside the work  programme execution process, continue to be popular. ENISA received 23 new requests in  2015, which represents an increase of 92 % over the previous year, and continued to work  on 19 ongoing requests.  All the activities carried out in 2015 resulted in various best practices and recommendations,  available on the ENISA website for the benefit of stakeholders and citizens.  INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS  Nowadays the need to optimise the available budget of the European Union as well as the  need to do more with fewer resources is a reality across all the European Union organisations  and bodies. ENISA is not an exception; the Agency continues to pursue efficiency and  effectiveness.  During 2015 the Agency has introduced a new system that supports a fully electronic  workflow. This new ‘Paperless’ system responds to the compliance requirements of our  regulations and has satisfied our internal and external stakeholders. ‘Paperless’ was a great  opportunity to start a full revision of work methods and risk assessment in our business. This  improvement also contributed to the objective of being a green organisation, where paper  use has been significantly reduced.  A formalisation of a Quality Management system is foreseen for 2016 with the objective to  consolidate the excellent compliance and good performance of the Agency. Our people are  considered to be the best asset of ENISA, and having this in mind the Agency will continue to  promote the value of the people that contribute to the success of our work.  CONCLUSIONS  The year 2015 has been another very successful year for the Agency. It has been a year in  which we have strengthened our relations with our stakeholders and assisted them in making  significant improvements to the state of cybersecurity throughout the EU. In parallel, we  continue to make internal improvements that keep staff morale high and make the Agency  a challenging and pleasant place to work.  I would like to end by thanking both our stakeholders and staff for their contributions  to this success.

Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 1 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security extends ENISA’s mandate until  19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and infor- mation security or cybersecurity in Europe. ENISA  supports the EU and the Member States in enhancing  and strengthening their capability and preparedness to  prevent, detect and respond to network and informa- tion security problems and incidents. ENISA’s vision is to  secure and enable Europe’s information society and to  use its unique competencies to help to drive the cyber- landscape in Europe.  The Agency works closely together with members of  both the public and private sector, to deliver advice and  solutions that are based on solid operational experi- ence. ENISA also supports the development of the Eu- ropean Union (EU) policy and law on matters relating to  network and information security (NIS), thereby contrib- uting to economic growth in Europe’s internal market.  ENISA’s strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, inputs from the Member States and relevant  communities, including the private sector.  In cooperation with and in support of Member States  and EU institutions, ENISA prioritises contributions in  terms of:  Expertise: Anticipate and support Europe in facing  emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  potentially impacting the EU, taking into account the  evolutions of the digital environment.  1 For the links and names of all relevant policy documents please  see Annex G.  Policy: Promote network and information security as  an EU policy priority, by assisting the European Union  institutions and Member States in developing and im- plementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  Capacity: Support Europe in maintaining state-of-the- art network and information security capacities by as- sisting the Member States and European Union bodies  in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  Community: Foster the emerging European network  and information security community, by reinforcing  cooperation at the EU level among Member States,  European Union bodies and relevant NIS stakeholders,  including the private sector.  Enabling: Reinforce ENISA’s impact by improving the  management of its resources and engaging more effi- ciently with its stakeholders, including Member States  and EU Institutions, as well as at the international level.  According to Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No  526/2013,  the Agency comprises of the Management Board (MB);  the Executive Director and staff; and the Permanent  Stakeholders Group (PSG). In order to contribute to  enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of the  operation of the Agency, the MB has established an  Executive Board.  The MB held its ordinary meeting to adopt decisions on  budgetary and administrative matters as well as rules  implementing provisions of ENISA Regulation (EU) No  526/2013 and Staff Regulations. The Board also adopted  planning documents such as an annual Work pro- gramme, a multi-annual staff policy plan, a Statement of  Estimates and others.  The PSG is a body that advises the Executive Director  on drawing up a proposal for the Agency’s work pro- gramme. In 2015, 2 formal PSG meetings were held.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 15  IMPLEMENTATION OF  ENISA ANNUAL WORK  PROGRAMME  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR  The European Union Agency for Network and Informa- tion Security (ENISA) contributes to the policy goal of  a high level of network and information security (NIS)  within the European Union. Ensuring adequate levels of  protection for contemporary IT systems in any context  requires recognising and adapting to changes in the  evolving threat environment by making appropriate pol- icy adjustments. As a centre of excellence and expertise  in the field of NIS, ENISA has used its expertise to:  advise its stakeholders on trends in the digital world  that affect security;  suggest good practices in various areas in relation to  information, services and systems security;  support the development and implementation of  policy requirements in the area of security and data  protection;  collaborate with stakeholders and contribute to the  NIS capacity and communities’ building.  The Work programme (WP) of 2015 contained a total  of 53 deliverables (which includes also workshops and  similar activities) that have been produced in full.  The highlights of 2015 include new best practices and  recommendations in sectors such as eHealth, finance, and  smart infrastructure and services. The Agency’s continued  brand activities such as Article 13a reporting, Computer  Security Incidents Response Teams (CSIRT) training and  preparations for Cyber Europe 2016. ENISA updated the  Threat Landscape and published guidelines and best  practice recommendations regarding Privacy Enhancing  Technologies. Requests under Article 14 of the ENISA Reg-  ulation (EU) No 526/2013 continued unabated as a meth- od for stakeholders to request assistance, culminating in 23  new requests, almost double compared to 2014.  The Agency also organised a number of high profile  events throughout the year, such as the High Level Event,  the first ENISA Industry event, the Annual Privacy Forum  and the EU Cyber Security Month campaign. ENISA also  hosted a number of important workshops, gathering  experts in the field to discuss cybersecurity topics.  MOST RELEVANT KEY  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  In 2015, the Agency delivered against its annual work  programme and all deliverables met or exceeded the key  performance indicators set (see Section I for more details).  Notable achievements are mentioned hereunder along  with examples on how the Agency reached its goals.  By 2016 10 private stakeholders use ENISA’s Threat  Analysis/Landscape process in their corporate risk  management processes. (Impact indicator in WPK1.1.  NIS Threat Analysis.)  Major organisations from Member states in both  governmental and sectoral areas have quoted  ENISA Threat Information. In performed impact  assessments, ENISA Threat Landscape has achieved  top results. And individual external stakeholders  continuously contact ENISA to obtain additional in- formation/details on threat information. Finally, the  SUMMARY  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 1716  achieved level of cooperation with competent EU  and Member State organisations is indicative of the  impact level achieved through this stream of work.  By 2017, 8 MS use ENISA’s recommendations and  good practices on National Cyber Security Strategies.  (Impact indicator in WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector  capacity building.)  2015: 2 workshops in 2015 together with the EU  Presidency (Riga: 30 participants, 15 from MSs;  Luxembourg: 28 participants, 18 from MSs), 4  MSs created their national cybersecurity strategy  based on ENISA recommendations (until Novem- ber 2015), ENISA NCSS map was the most popular  webpage (features update).  By 2017, continued CSIRT training will be provided to  a minimum of 20 participants of different organisa- tions in 5 MS. (Impact indicator in WPK 2.1: Assist in  public sector capacity building.)  2015: 11 CSIRT trainings were delivered across 7  MSs reaching over 200 participants representing  various private and public organisations. ENISA  CSIRT training is the most popular Article 14  request in many EU MSs.  Engage at least 5 key sector actors in launching and es- tablishing a forum that brings together 3 communities,  namely: trust service providers from the EU Trusted  List, conformity assessment bodies and supervisory  authorities. The degree of activity of the relevant key  sector actors in this forum is of importance to its suc- cess. (Impact indicator in WPK 3.1: Provide informa- tion and advice to support policy development.)  The 1st TSP Forum was organised in late 2015 and  it was attended by more than 100 participants,  including representatives of all key sectors, many  EU MS National Authorities, etc. A follow up with  the organisation’s 2nd TSP Forum is currently  underway for 2016.  By 2017, 12 MSs will make direct use of the out- comes of Article 13(a) work by explicitly referencing  it or by adopting it at the national level. (Impact  indicator in WPK 3.2: Assist EU MSs and Commission  in the implementation of EU NIS regulations.)  In 2015, a study on the impact assessment of Article  13a in the EU was published. In total 23 countries  responded that they have implemented the Article  13 requirements (although the actual figure is  greater), and on average 15 out of them (more  than 60 %) declared that they have used different  work items produced by the group in their national  implementation and work. More than this, 19 (82 %)  National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) are currently  satisfied with the current work model of the Article  13a expert group, drafting and agreeing on common  technical guidelines and on sharing experiences.  (82 %) NRAs are currently satisfied with the current  work model of the Article 13a expert group.  More than 80 participants in APF’15 (researchers,  policy-makers and industry participants) (Impact  indicator in WPK 3.3: Assist EU MSs and Commission  in the implementation of NIS measures of EU data  protection regulation.)  The Annual Privacy Forum (APF) 2015 was attend- ed by more than 100 participants and the next  editions of this conference have been planned.  KEY CONCLUSIONS ON THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL  CONTROL SYSTEMS AND FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  that policy and operational objectives are achieved. As  regards financial management, compliance with these  standards is compulsory and the Agency meets its goals  in full.  The Agency has put in place an organisational structure  and a set of internal controls that are suited to the  achievement of policy and control objectives, in accord- ance with the standards and suitable to mitigate risks  associated with the environment in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the min- imum requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal procedures  were grouped together, prioritised and implemented in  the daily workflows of the Agency, as deemed appropriate.  In 2015, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern during  the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the recom- mendations raised by the auditing bodies (European  Court of Auditors and the Internal Audit Service of the  European Commission). It has been reported that with  reference to 2014, the Agency achieved compliance with  the internal control standards; for more details please  refer to Sections 3 to 6 and to the Annexes of this report.  INFORMATION FOR THE STAKEHOLDERS  While during 2015 the Agency continued to deliver  against its annual work programme, it is worth stating  that the need for activities aimed at securing Eu- rope’s information security has been increasing.  It should be noted that the objectives of the Agency  address NIS, a fast-changing area. The use of IT, the de- velopment of new technologies but also new challenges  and new security risks are emerging at a relentless pace.  For instance, according to Eurostat, ‘ICT have become  widely available to the general public, both in terms of  accessibility as well as cost. A boundary was crossed  in 2007, when a majority (55 %) of households in the  EU-28 had internet access. This proportion continued to  increase and in 2014 reached 81 %’2.  In 2015, the worldwide cybersecurity market was esti- mated 3as ranging from USD 75 billion and forecasted  to grow to USD 170 billion by 2020. The cybersecu- rity market size in Europe, according to Gartner 4,  was estimated to grow from EUR 20.1 billion (out of  Gartner’s EUR 71.7 billion worldwide estimation for  2015) with 6 % Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)  to EUR 24.4 billion in 2018, maintaining a share above  one quarter of the worldwide cybersecurity market.  At the same time, the estimated worldwide economic  impact of cyber-attacks has reached half a trillion USD5.  Global surveys 6 find that 15 % of businesses say they  have faced a cyber-attack in the past year. Businesses  in the EU (19 %) and North America (18 %) have been  most heavily targeted according to the same source.  ENISA carries out the analysis of cyberthreats and pub- lishes a yearly Threat Landscape report 7 that vouches  for the smooth advancement of maturity on both cyber- security defence and protection as well on cybersecurity  2 Eurostat, Information society statistics — households and  individuals, June 2015, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ statistics-explained/index.php/Information_society_statistics_-_ households_and_individuals  3 Cybersecurity market report, Cybersecurity Ventures, Q4 2015,  available at: http://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-mar- ket-report/  4 Cyber-security market size in Europe, Gartner 2014.  5 McAfee, Net Losses: Estimating the Global Cost of Cybercrime,  report summary, 2014, available at: http://www.mcafee.com/us/ resources/reports/rp-economic-impact-cybercrime2-summary.pdf  6 Grant Thornton, Cyber-attacks cost global business $300bn+,  available at: http://www.grantthornton.global/en/insights/articles/ cyber-attacks-cost-global-business-over-$300bn-a-year/  7 ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 (ETL 2015), January 2016, avail- able at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/ evolving-threat-environment/enisa-threat-landscape/etl2015  threats. Cyberspace stakeholders have gone through  varying degrees of further maturity. While friendly  agents have demonstrated increased cooperation and  orchestrated reaction to cyberthreats, hostile agents  have advanced their malicious tools with obfuscation,  stealth and strike capability.  On the defenders’ side, improvements have been  achieved in coordinated campaigns to disrupt and  dismantle malicious infrastructures, strengthen the legal  and governance cyberdefence framework and develop  more efficient products.  Adversaries have achieved considerable advances too.  Cyberthreats have undergone significant evolution and just  as in 2014, significant breaches have covered front pages  in the media. It is alarming, however, that seemingly cyber- threat agents had the margin and resources to implement  a series of advancements in malicious practices.  In 2015, changes observed referred to two areas men- tioned hereinafter. The attention of cybersecurity experts  has been drawn to incidents in the area of the Internet of  Things (IoT) and attacks against cyber-physical interfaces,  both being upcoming areas of concern for the cyberse- curity community. For instance, from incident statistics it  becomes evident that human error and insider threats,  if taken together, are sufficient to top the list of cyber- threats. Taking into account the relatively novel features  of IoT and the relatively large number of ‘insiders’ within  a smart environment (i.e. smart home) as well as the  interactions with health and safety, it is likely that IoT  becomes the next frontier for abuse. Policy work in  cybersecurity needs continuity and the ability to adjust to  frequent and often disruptive developments.  Positive developments can be reached by strengthen- ing the Agency. While the Agency features mandatory  tasks emanating from the regulatory framework (ENISA  regulation, eIDAS regulation, ePrivacy directive, etc.),  emerging policy and regulatory requirements (Telecom  pack review, Data protection regulation, NIS directive)  create new impetus. In view of these developments it is  expected that if the Agency’s resources are reinforced,  it can contribute to better policy outcomes and aug- ment its policy outreach to the benefit of many more  stakeholders across Europe. Especially in the area of  a digital single market, ENISA can further enhance the  capacity and preparedness of MSs to prevent, detect  and respond to NIS problems and incidents.

The WP 2015 was aligned with the strategic objectives  featured on the strategy and the multi annual planning  of the Agency. The strategic objectives of the WP 2015  were as follows:  SO1: To develop and maintain a high level of expertise  of EU actors taking into account evolutions in Network  & Information Security (NIS). SO2: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU. SO3: To assist the Member States and the Commission  in developing and implementing the policies necessary  to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of  Network and Information Security. SO4: To enhance cooperation both between the  Member States of the EU and between related  NIS communities.  In the following sections the results of WP 2015 imple- mentation are presented for each of the above men- tioned objective. After the description of the concrete  results for each strategic objective, the achievements  against indicators and the detailed results for each  deliverable are presented in tables.  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO1 — DEVELOP  AND MAINTAIN A HIGH LEVEL OF NIS  EXPERTISE OF EU ACTORS  Ensuring adequate levels of protection for contempo- rary IT systems in any context requires recognising and  adapting to changes in the evolving threat environment.  Whilst it is clearly not possible to foresee all future  threats (security practices have often been dramatically  changed as a result of so called ‘black swan’ events,  which are notoriously difficult to predict), it is possible  to predict the evolution of certain threats with a rea- sonable degree of accuracy based on past data.  The Agency supported the MSs and the Commission in  their efforts to improve Critical information Infrastruc- ture protection (CIIP) by fostering a common approach  across the MSs and by ensuring that good practice  and lessons learnt are shared and properly deployed  in an effective manner. The Agency worked with the  MSs, the Commission and the private sector in capacity  building across the EU. In particular, the Agency sup- ported the development of voluntary baseline security  requirements for CIIP sectors and harmonised efforts  in the area of mandatory incident reporting, taking  under consideration existing national and international  frameworks (e.g. NIST). The approach was not limited to  securing Internet related services, but took into consid- eration other networks and services as appropriate.  Where technology is concerned, information security  has traditionally been viewed as an approach to secure  SECTION I. KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF ENISA  WORK PROGRAMME 2015I.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 2120  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  people, processes and technology. Of these three  factors, it is mainly technological evolution that impacts  the way in which people’s behaviour and processes  change. A large part of modern information security  therefore boils down to adapting current methods to  emerging technologies, and business models.  As a centre of excellence and expertise in the field of  NIS, ENISA used the expertise of its staff to advise its  stakeholders about trends in the digital world that affect  security and suggested good practices to be taken in  order to successfully mitigate the associated risks at an  early stage of end-user adoption. In particular, ENISA  sought to identify the consequences of deploying new  technologies and approaches in order to enable the  opportunities that such developments bring.  ENISA assisted the Commission and MSs in defining and  implementing a framework for training professionals in  NIS to meet the requirements of industry at all levels.  The goal was to align training goals with career paths  for security professionals and to provide a more global  background in NIS for professionals in other areas.  The following work packages were part of this  Strategic Objective:  WPK 1.1 — NIS Threats Analysis The main goal of this WPK was to develop the current  cyberthreat landscape. This information is important  in the identification of NIS gaps and security needs for  a wide spectrum of stakeholders.  WPK 1.2 — Improving the Protection  of Critical Information Infrastructures In this WPK, ENISA’s aim was to provide advice and as- sistance on request to targeted stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  WPK 1.3 — Securing emerging  Technologies and Services This WPK aimed to develop good practices on emerg- ing smart infrastructures and services and work with  relevant stakeholders to deploy them at an early stage  of adoption.  WPK 1.4 — Short- and mid-term sharing  of information regarding issues in NIS This WPK aimed to define and implement a framework  that allowed the Agency to provide timely and high  quality responses to NIS developments.  1.1.1 WPK 1.1: NIS Threats Analysis  The main objective of this work package was to collect  and collate current data in order to develop the ENISA  threat landscape. It includes current threats, as well as  threat trends in NIS and emerging technologies. The  threat landscape is based on existing publicly available  material on threats, risks and trends.  The ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 was a continuation of  the work started in 2012. Compared to previous years,  there is noticeable improvement in the quality of threat  information collected within related organisations due  a wider spread and depth of information sources.  In addition, in this work package ENISA further iden- tified emerging technologies for risk assessment and  threat analysis. A report was published highlighting the  threats and potential compromises related to the secu- rity of SDN/5G networks. The report identified related  network assets and the security threats, challenges and  risks arising from these assets. Driven by the identified  threats and risks, existing security mechanism and good  practices for SDN/5G/NFV were identified. Finally based  in the collated information technical, policy and organ- isational recommendations for proactively enhancing  the security of SDN/5G were provided.  1.1.2 WPK 1.2: Improving the protection  of Critical Information Infrastructures  The objective of this work package was to provide ad- vice and assistance to targeted stakeholders of Critical  Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  More specifically ENISA took stock of MS policies,  regulations and strategies including international  frameworks (e.g. US NIST) and identified gaps related  to CIIs. The Agency cooperated with public and private  stakeholders to identify good practices, collected and  analysed requirements and issued recommendations for  improving the way MSs address the protection of CIIs.  In the area of Internet Interconnections, ENISA con- tinued in its development of methodologies for the  identification of critical communication networks, links,  and components. ENISA considered existing outputs  from projects and initiatives in the security and resil- ience of Internet interconnections. In cooperation with  ISPs and other public stakeholders ENISA validated the  methodology and developed a maturity assessment  mechanism. This mechanism allows MSs to assess the  situation within their borders. The Agency also assessed  whether this methodology could be extended to other  CIIs and targeted stakeholders so as to customise it to  their needs and requirements.  In the area of ICS-SCADA security, ENISA cooperated  with SCADA and Control Systems Information Exchange  (EuroSCSIE) as well as other related expert groups to take  stock and conduct an analysis of cybersecurity maturity  levels in critical sectors (e.g. transport, energy, water sup- ply, etc.). ENISA’s work will be utilised by policy-makers  in MSs and EU Institutions to create a secure framework  for the implementation and deployment of more efficient  ICS-SCADA systems. The study also made general rec- ommendations to EU Member States and the European  Commission on how to improve CIIP across the European  Union. The Agency will continue promoting its work on  the security of ICS-SCADA devices.  In the area of smart grids, ENISA continued its work on  appropriate security measures and national governance  security models of smart grids. The Agency promoted  its existing appropriate security measures and further  cooperated with public and private stakeholders to  improve their existing security governance models for  smart grids. A study was published on the evaluation of  the interdependencies and communications between  the assets that make up the new power grids, their  architectures and connections in order to determine  their importance, threats, risks, mitigation factors  and possible security measures to implement. ENISA  also conducted a study identifying the maturity level  of ICS-SCADA cybersecurity in Europe and identified  good practices used by European Member States to  improve. It should be noted that smart grid area covers  more than ICS; so for this activity more areas were  considered: smart cities, smart energy etc. ENISA also  continued its contribution to DG ENER’s Smart Grid Task  Force and all relevant EU initiatives (e.g. CEN/CENELEC/ ETSI, ERNCIP, DENSEK, etc.). Finally the Agency contrib- uted to national and EU efforts (e.g. SOGIS) related to  better alignment of certification policies and strategies  at the EU level.  In the area of cloud computing, ENISA actively contrib- uted to the EU Commission’s EU Cloud Computing Strat- egy by delivering targeted advice on cybersecurity mat- ters (e.g. certification, appropriate security measures,  procurements, SLAs and others). The Agency continued  its work in the area of governmental clouds, assisted  MSs to develop their national governmental strate- gy’s and deploy ENISA’s good practice guide. ENISA also  worked with the public and private sector to promote  its work on the certification of cloud computing compo- nents and services. The Agency worked to establish its  meta-certification framework as a model to be used by  users, SMEs and leading players in the market, so as to  allow cloud users to select the most appropriate existing  certification scheme for their needs.  In the area of finance, ENISA, through consultation with  public and private stakeholders, identified policy, tech- nical and regulatory barriers and challenges for using  cloud, either as infrastructure or as a service, in the  finance sector. Based on the analysis ENISA provided  recommendations to financial institutions, regulators  and cloud service providers about what ENISA believes  should be done to support the secure adoption of  cloud services in the finance sector. The Agency has  issued recommendations for policy-makers, EU MSs  and industry in mitigating barriers and challenges. By  removing known barriers ENISA has helped the EU  industry become more competitive and innovative.  Also the Agency in consultation with public and private  stakeholders has positioned itself to better understand  the security and privacy challenges related with third  party payments providers.  Finally in the area of eHealth, ENISA, with the consul- tation of public and private stakeholders, published  a study that took stock and assessed the security  and resilience of major eHealth infrastructures and  services. The Agency developed good practices and  recommendations for policy-makers, industry and EU  MSs on the resilience and security of eHealth infra- structures and services.  ENISA assisted the  Commission and MS in  defining and implementing  a framework for training  professionals in NIS to  meet the requirements  of industry at all levels.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 2322  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  1.1.3 WPK 1.3: Securing emerging  Technologies and Services  ENISA developed good practices on emerging smart  infrastructures and services in such areas as 8:  intelligent transportation systems used in the  context of smart cities;  Big Data and corresponding services used for  offering critical services;  Smart Home Environments.  In each of these areas ENISA identified relevant public and  private stakeholders, engaged them in working groups and  jointly took stock of and analysed the current situation in  terms of cybersecurity and resilience. The Agency iden- tified EU and nationally funded projects on these topics,  liaised with them, assessed their findings and deliverables,  and further engaged them in the corresponding expert  groups and with the organisation of workshops.  Based on consultation with stakeholders and desk-top  research and analysis, ENISA developed good practices  and issued recommendations addressing policy-makers,  manufacturers, developers, infrastructure owners, oper- ators and service providers. The following reports were  published with the aim to provide smart infrastruc- ture service providers, operators, manufacturers and  developers with good security and resilience practices  when designing and deploying such services in order to  minimise the exposure of such networks and services to  all relevant cyberthreat categories.  8 Infrastructure can be defined as ‘smart’ when investments in  human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern  (ICT) communication infrastructure support sustainable economic  development and a high quality of life, with wise management of  natural resources, through participatory action and engagement.  The Cyber security and resilience of intelligent public  transport report gives an overview of the existing secu- rity measures (good practices) that could be deployed  to protect these critical assets and ensure security of  the IPT system, based on a survey and interviews of  experts from the sector, municipalities, operators, man- ufacturers and policy-makers.  The Cyber security for smart cities — an architecture  model for public transport report describes how good  practices are put into a relationship with different city  maturity levels thus allowing representatives of oper- ators and municipalities to quickly assess whether or  not they lag behind other cities with the same maturity  level in terms of cybersecurity and, if so, to take appro- priate actions.  The Good practices and recommendations on the  security and resilience of Big Data services study aims at  identifying the key security challenges that companies  face when implementing Big Data solutions, from infra- structures to analytics applications, and how those are  mitigated. The analysis focuses on the use of Big Data  by private organisations in given sectors (e.g. Finance,  Energy, Telecom).  The Security and resilience of Smart Home environments  study aims at securing Smart Home environments from  cyberthreats by highlighting good practices that apply  to every step of a product lifecycle: its development, its  integration in Smart Home environments, and its usage  and maintenance until end-of-lifecycle.  It is expected that the early adoption of these recom- mendations and good practices will boost the trust and  confidence of potential users of such technologies and  pave the way for wider deployment.  1.1.4 WPK 1.4: Short- and mid-term  sharing of information regarding  issues in NIS  ENISA implemented a framework that allows the  Agency to provide timely and high quality responses  to NIS developments. ENISA acted on NIS issues and  occurrences that reached a certain level of public and  media attention by giving information and, where  appropriate, guidelines for dealing with the issue on  short notice. The guidelines did not address immediate  responses, but concentrated on medium- to long-term  preparatory measures. The overall goal for each Note  was to highlight fundamental facts and shortcomings  behind specific NIS issues and occurrences, and to give  independent advice to key stakeholders.

In particular the  Agency worked together with national bodies (NRAs,  CSIRTs, etc.) that had been mandated to carry out these  tasks within the MSs, with private sector representatives  and with the European Commission to ensure that the ap- proach was coherent across the EU. The Agency continued  to support the Commission and the MSs in the implemen- tation of methods and tools for ensuring adequate privacy  protection and adherence to EU Data Protection legisla- tion. By supporting initiatives such as the EU cybersecurity  month, the implementation of an NIS driving licence and  MSs’ efforts to introduce NIS topics into education at all  levels, ENISA contributed to increasing the level of partic- ipation of the EU citizens in activities aimed at improving  the level of NIS throughout the Union.  The following work packages constituted this  Strategic Objective:  WPK 2.1 — Assist in public sector capacity building This Work Package aimed at helping operational bodies  and communities (namely CSIRTs, but other communi- ties where appropriate) in developing and extending the  necessary capabilities in order to meet the ever growing  challenges to secure their networks.  WPK 2.2 — Assist in private sector capacity building This WPK aimed at helping the private sector develop  their capacities in the area of cybersecurity (e.g. in  the area of Network and Information Security driving  licence).  WPK 2.3 — Assist in improving  awareness of the general public This WPK aimed at further developing ENISA’s  multi-stakeholder facilitation approach and  public-private activities.  1.2.1 WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector  capacity building  ENISA made great strides to fulfil its aim in terms of  helping the EU MSs and other stakeholders, such as EU  Institutions and bodies, to develop and extend the nec- essary capabilities to meet the ever growing challenges  to network security. Emphasis was made on supporting  operational bodies and communities (namely CSIRTs)  by providing good practice material and advice and  concrete actions such as CSIRT trainings.  The Agency provided support and advice to MSs on the  development, implementation and evaluation of National  Cyber Security Strategies (3 specific requests received).  The information was diffused through the NCSS Experts  Group who shared lessons learnt and prior experience.  Taking utmost account of the knowledge shared, these  MSs are currently in the adoption phase of their NCSS.  The Agency also maintains an interactive NCSS map, with  information on the strategies of the MSs as well as of  countries around the globe. This map is one of the most  popular ENISA sites and on a regular basis the Agency  receives information to keep it up to date.  Another important aspect of this support to MS capability  building, was the rolling out of training for IT specialists  (CSIRTs, etc.) of which more than 200 trainees were trained  in 7 Member States and carrying out national exercises.  A number of handbooks where published in the area of  CSIRT good practices to further strength the knowledge  base of the trainers and maintain an up to date training  library. These included:  Mobile threat incident handling;  Introduction to advanced artefact analysis;  Advanced dynamic analysis;  Advanced static analysis.  An impact assessment of ENISA’s support to CSIRTs  in 2014 was conducted so as to serve as a basis for  a proposed roadmap to 2020. The impact of the ENISA  support to the CSIRT community was assessed from  a dual perspective — legislative and regulatory — as  well as operational, with the key objectives to: up- date the policy analysis; gather additional input from  practitioners, including specific input on the new duties;  and together with ENISA, propose concrete projects or  actions towards the roadmap implementation.  Finally, in line with ENISA’s responsibility to develop  capabilities in the area of national Public Private Part- nerships the Agency provided targeted and customised  assistance (e.g. in a form of a seminar, training) and con-  tinued to support the Commission in the management  of the NIS platform by targeted public and private stake- holders (especially experts from small industry players),  assisting in the formation of virtual groups of experts,  and contributing its expertise to position papers devel- oped within the working groups of the NIS platform.  1.2.2 WPK 2.2: Assist in private  sector capacity building  The background to ENISA’s work in this field includes  the EU’s Cyber Security Strategy suggestion to develop  a roadmap for a ‘Network and Information Security driving  licence’ as a voluntary certification programme to promote  and enhance skills and competences of IT professionals.  User education is key to cybersecurity and as such  a study was undertaken with the following objectives: to  identify gaps between available training courses, certifica- tions and NIS education needs with particular emphasis  on ePrivacy and to suggest further actions based on the  analysed needs of NIS communities in Europe. The report  concludes with a list of recommendation for both the EU  and educational organisations in Member States.  The 2015 network and information security quiz to  test users’ knowledge of ENISA recommendations  built upon the success of the previous year’s quiz  by using feedback received by the users and making  functional enhancements.  1.2.3 WPK 2.3: Assist in improving  awareness of the general public  The 2015 edition of the European Cyber Security Month  (ECSM) resulted in a successful advocacy campaign with  32 countries taking part, some 242 activities from public  and private stakeholders and an outreach in social  media topping the previous year’s statistics. Included  within these results are the 417 courses now registered  in the NIS Education map.  ENISA has produced a basic cyberhygiene report to help  web users (general public) recognise and use tools for  online privacy and security. The objectives of the report  were to define the current level of information and  guidance that is provided to the general public and to  provide a proposal for an assessment model for online  privacy tools that could bring more assurance in their  use, supporting their wider adoption by internet and  mobile users. The Agency has found out that a com- bined effort of all involved stakeholders is needed in the  promotion of online, privacy enhancing technologies.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 2928  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  1.2.4 General results. Achievement of Impact indicators for Objective 2 1.3 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF SO3 —  ASSISTANCE IN DEVELOPING  AND IMPLEMENTING THE  NIS-RELATED POLICIES  In 2015, ENISA continued to provide the Commission  and MSs with high quality information, data and advice  to support policy-making having an EU dimension.  The Agency also had taken into consideration policy and  legislative requirements that are not directly related to  cybersecurity, but which had a bearing on how cyberse- curity principles are integrated.  At the same time, the Agency continued to support  research and development by acting in an advisory role  to the Commission for future Framework Programme  initiatives in this area. Additionally, ENISA continued its  work on Privacy enhancing technologies.  ENISA worked together with the public sector, stand- ards organisations and industry representatives to  identify ways for improving the process for agreeing on  suitable NIS standards and for promoting their uptake in  a cross-border environment.  The following work packages constitute this Strategic  Objective:  WPK 3.1 — Provide information and advice to support  policy development This WPK aimed at supporting work on regulation espe- cially in the area of eID.  WPK 3.2 — Assist EU MSs and Commission in the  implementation of EU NIS regulations This WPK aimed at supporting EU MSs in implementing  regulation, especially in the area of reporting according  to Article 13a of the Telecoms Directive.  WPK 3.3 — Assist EU MSs and Commission in the im- plementation of NIS measures of EU data protection  regulation This WPK aimed at supporting developing and im- plementing regulation in the area of Data Protection  and Privacy.  WPK 3.4 — R & D, Innovation & Standardisation This WPK aimed at supporting work on Standardisation  (i.e. collaborating with standardisation bodies) and Re- search & Development (especially in the area of H2020)  1.3.1 WPK 3.1: Provide information and  advice to support policy development  In order to remove existing barriers for cross-border  e-ID based services, a new Regulation (914/2014)  on electronic identification and trust services for  electronic transactions in the internal market was  published in 2014.  Finally, ENISA collaborated with FESA in the area of  exchange of information on the supervision of TSPs.  1.3.2 WPK 3.2: Assist EU MSs and  Commission in the implementation of EU  NIS regulations  ENISA focussed its efforts on assisting regulatory au- thorities and the Commission in the implementation of  EU regulations related to incident reporting. This effort  built on successful work done in this area from previous  years namely in the area of Article 13a.  SO2 — To assist the Member States and the Commission in enhancing capacity building throughout the EU  WPKs, Impact Indicators Achieved results  WPK 2.1: Assist in public sector capacity building  By 2017, 8 MSs use ENISA’s recommendations and good  practices on National Cyber Security Strategies.  2 workshops were held in 2015 together with the EU  Presidency (Riga: 30 participants, 15 from MSs; Luxembourg:  28 participants, 18 from MSs), 4 MSs created their national  cybersecurity strategy based on ENISA recommendations  (until November 2015), ENISA NCSS map the most popular  webpage (features update). In 2016 ENISA will continue work  on this topic through updating the NCSS online map, creating  training material in a training platform and updating the  good practice guide.  By 2017, continued CSIRT training will be provided to  a minimum of 20 participants of different organisations in  5 MSs.  In 2015, 11 CSIRT trainings provided in 7 MSs for more  than 200 participants representing various private and  public organisations.  By 2017, improved operational practices of CSIRTs in  at least 15 MSs (ongoing support with best practices  development).  In 2015,  a Good practice guide on vulnerability disclosure  was added to the ENISA’s online library for CSIRT services  and operational practice improvement. The annual CSIRT  workshop for national and governmental CSIRTs held in  May in Latvia to discuss and address ‘the CSIRT role and  services during the EU Presidency’ topic (40 participants  from 17 MSs).  More streamlined CSIRT exercise and training material  with CSIRT and other operational communities’ services  and methodologies.  In 2015, ENISA’s start-up train the trainer program was  launched. First workshop for CSIRT trainers in Europe held  in September to streamline CSIRT training material and  training methodology development (24 educators from  18 MSs including GEANT/TRANSITS; FIRST).  WPK 2.2: Assist in private sector capacity building  10 public-private stakeholders from MSs follow up on  the recommendations from the Roadmap on the NIS  in Education.  A mapping of relevant stakeholders in the NIS Education  interactive map gathered more than 400 entries from  over 20 countries. ENISA further developed a model to  disseminate the existing information to interested parties  and a new model of engagement for education providers.  Further develop an effective work process to involve more  universities and certifications providers (NIS in Education).  ENISA introduced an interactive map to be used by all edu- cation providers in the EU to give visibility to their courses.  This established a one-stop-shop for NIS education provid- ers and offers them better interactions at EU level. The NIS  Education interactive map is available following this link:  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities.

This action will be  followed up in 2016 and further.  https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/references/universities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deployment-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deployment-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/european-cyber-security-month-advocacy-campaign/2015/ecsm15-deployment-report https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/basic-cyber-hygiene https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/basic-cyber-hygiene https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/basic-cyber-hygiene  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  ENISA continued collecting and analysing annual, na- tional reports of security breaches from NRAs in accord- ance with Article 13a of the Framework Directive on  electronic communications. The Agency, in cooperation  with experts from NRAs and the private sector (e.g. NIS  Platform), analysed the reports, compared them with  previous years, identified good practices and lessons  learnt and made recommendations to NRAs and the pri- vate sector to mitigate these threats in the future. Also  the Agency assessed the impact of incident reporting  schemes (Article 13a) trying to identify the changes in  outcome that can be attributed to the regulations. The  results of the evaluation have served as input to the EC  public consultation for the new telecom package. Ac- cording to this assessment, 82 % of NRAs are currently  satisfied with the work model of the Article 13a expert  group and the role of ENISA. The Agency also identified  lessons learnt, evaluated the value for money of these  schemes and issued recommendations for stakeholders.  Additionally, ENISA continued its effort to bring NRAs,  DPAs and the Commission together for the harmonisa- tion and implementation of the security and data breach  articles (Article 13a and Article 4). The Agency also further  assessed the Article 4 incident reporting scheme by means  of a survey that was executed with the support of the  Commission, and the results presented in a workshop. In  that survey, all relevant stakeholders had the opportunity  to discuss the challenges and propose recommendations  towards a more harmonised and cost efficient way of  implementing the two articles so as to avoid overlaps.  ENISA also organised a workshop on incident prevention  and reporting in Bucharest (June 2015). The participants  were from Member States, National Regulatory Agencies,  solution providers and assets owners.  ENISA has already contributed to the area of electronic  identification and trusted services (eIDAS) by providing  recommendations on incident reporting by the trust  service providers to the supervisory bodies. In 2015,  ENISA continued its efforts to aggregate together all  relevant stakeholders (Article 19 expert group) from  MSs including the competent regulatory bodies of MSs  and deliberated with them on the development of  a consistent incident reporting framework for Article  19. With ENISA’s support the scope and the parameters  were defined as well as the thresholds for the summa- ry reporting by the supervisory bodies to ENISA and  the Commission. ENISA also considered conceptual  synergies with Article 13a and supported the Article 19  expert group in developing the functional requirements  by an automated tool for reporting incidents in the  context of Article 19.  1.3.3 WPK 3.3: Assist EU MSs and  Commission in the implementation of NIS  measures of EU data protection regulation  In 2015, ENISA intensified its efforts in the field of  privacy and trust in a number of areas.  Firstly, ENISA analysed the obstacles of the adoption  and evolution of privacy technologies and clarified why  in the current practice of web services PETs are rarely  used. The report also studied the technical possibilities  as well as the economic incentives that could be used to  further increase the market penetration of such tools.  Secondly, due to the recognition of privacy enhancing  technologies in several policy documents, e.g. the draft  data protection regulation proposal, that are based  on complex cryptographic building blocks, coupled  with security of these building blocks being constantly  challenged by new attacks, ENISA produced a report  pointing to already established EU policies and process- es to addresses these issues. The report was distributed  to members of the ENISA MB.  Emerging technologies in the areas of online informa- tion sharing, data merging and data mining create new  possibilities for the processing of personal data and,  thus, new privacy risks. ENISA produced a state-of-the  art analysis of the data protection threats, risks and  protection measures in the emerging big and open data  landscape. During the Annual Privacy Forum, ENISA  brought together both policy-makers and the research  30  community to address the lag between data protection  legislation and technological protection mechanisms  and the challenges of data protection and privacy.  The 2015 version of the ENISA report entitled ‘Indicative  list of appropriate cryptographic protection measures’  was distributed to the members of the MB. The report  will be used by the Commission as a main reference  document for the publication of a list of appropriate  technological protection measures pursuant to Arti- cle 4(3) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 611/2013.  Based on the latest scientific evidence at the moment  of publication, technological breakthroughs may occur  that compromise the recommended protection meas- ures, which is why the report was updated. As was the  case in previous years, in the context of this work ENISA  collaborated with well recognised experts in the field  (also ensuring high quality peer reviews). In addition,  ENISA involved experts in the field from National Au- thorities (BSI, ANSSI, etc.).  1.3.4 WPK 3.4: R & D, Innovation &  Standardisation  Since its creation ENISA has tracked the development of  standards in the area of Network and Information Secu- rity, maintaining close contacts and collaboration with  International Standardisation Organisations. In 2015,  the Agency monitored NIS standards across the EU and  globally. This enabled ENISA to keep its activities up-to-  date with the latest developments as well as inform its  stakeholders on new NIS standardisation activities and  flag opportunities and/or risks as they developed.  Since 2012 ENISA contributes actively to the creation  and work of the ETSI CEN-CENELEC Cyber Security Co- ordination Group (CSCG). This collaboration with CSCG  continued and ENISA further strengthened its synergies  between CSCG and its work programme. In this context  of the CSCG activities work was performed to analyse  good practices within the governance framework of  the European Union and proposing recommendations  for stakeholders. A gaps and overlaps analysis of the  standardisation of cybersecurity was also performed in  separate report.  Finally a study was conducted to analyse the adoption  of information security and privacy standards by SMEs  in Europe. Despite rising concerns on information  security risks the results of the analysis indicate that  adoption is low due to a number of identified drivers  and barriers.  In the areas of interest to the ENISA Work Programme  the Agency continued to collaborate with and to  support EU-funded R & D projects (H2020). The main  aim of the activity was to align the objectives of policy  initiatives in the area of NIS with that of the relevant  EU-funded R & D projects (H2020). Collaboration was  formed by way of a workshop organised by ENISA and  representatives from MSs.  The Agency provided support to:  NRAs and EU MSs on the implementation  of Article 13a (disruptions in the telecom  sector) and Article 4 (personal data breach  notification) and the developed synergies  among the two;  NRAs and EU MSs on the implementation  of Article 19 of new Regulation on  electronic identification and trusted  services (eIDAS);  the Commission and MSs on the  implementation of the NIS Directive.

The degree of activity of the relevant key sector actors in  the forum is of importance to its success.  The 1st TSP Forum was organised at the end of June 2015.  The forum was attended by more than 100 participants  and by representatives from all key sector actors from  many EU MSs.  Validations by at least 5 representatives from different  MSs of the contribution to the implementation of the  Regulation on electronic identification and trusted  services for electronic transactions.  The participants of the eIDAS TF were involved throughout  this work and also contributed at all stages of the peer  review.  WPK 3.2: Assist EU MSs and Commission in the implementation of EU NIS regulations  By 2017, 12 MSs make direct use of the outcomes of  Article 13a work by explicitly referencing it or by adopting  it at nationally level.  By 2015, a study on the impact assessment of Article  13a in EU was published. 23 countries have responded  that they have implemented the Article 13 requirements  (although the real number is greater than this), and on  average 15 of them (more than 60 %) declared that they  have used different work produced by the group in their  national implementation and work. More than this, 19  (82 %) NRAs are currently satisfied with the current work  model of Article 13a expert group, drafting and agreeing  on common technical guidelines and sharing experiences.  By 2017, 10 MSs implement recommendations by ENISA  on implementing and enforcing Article 4.  12 MSs participated in ENISA’s survey on Article 4 data  breaches. Workshop organised by EC on data breaches of  Article 4 and more than 20 MSs participated.  By 2017, 10 MSs implement ENISA’s recommendations  on Article 19.  3 workshops of Article 19 expert group organised in 2015.  This working group of experts consists of national regu- latory authorities and ministries from across Europe: the  Article 19 Expert Group. On average, more than 15 MSs  participated in each one of them.  WPK 3.3: Assist EU MSs and Commission in the implementation of NIS measures of EU data protection regulation  At least 5 representatives from different MSs contributing  to ENISA guidelines and best practice recommendations  regarding Privacy Enhancing Technologies.  6 EU MSs representatives contributed to the report and  also supported ENISA in the peer review stages.

In some  cases (e.g. The NIS Platform, as referenced by the EU  Cyber Security Strategy), ENISA supported other institu- tions in creating such communities, whilst in other areas  sought to build such communities itself when requested  to do so by the Commission or the MSs.  ENISA built on the work it had carried out in the area of  the pan-European exercise and supported the TRANSITS  training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build communi- ties through a ‘learn by doing’ approach.  The following work packages constitute this Strategic  Objective:  WPK 4.1 — Support for EU cooperation initiatives  amongst NIS –related communities in the context of  the EU CSS This WPK is aimed at leveraging the positive experience  of ENISA in supporting CSIRTs, the CSIRT communities  and Law Enforcement communities to come up with  mutually satisfactorily ways to collaborate in NIS.  WPK 4.2 — European cybercrisis cooperation through  exercises This WPK sought to facilitate the planning of the next  pan-European Cyber Exercise in 2015-2016. ENISA  further enhanced its methodology, training outreach  and technical capability to organise large-scale  cybercrisis exercises.  1.4.1 WPK 4.1: Support for EU cooperation  initiatives amongst NIS-related  communities in the context of the EU CSS  ENISA leveraged its experience in supporting the CSIRTs,  the CSIRT communities and Law Enforcement communi- ties to enhance collaboration between these actors.  As such, ENISA developed and provided guidance  based on good practice for cooperation between key  stakeholder communities (CSIRTs, CIIP community,  Law Enforcement, Financial Services; Data Protection,  etc.). The Agency continued its work and support of the  TRANSITS training in the area of CSIRTs in order to build  communities through a ‘learning by doing’ approach.  ENISA also continued its support to the collaboration  between CSIRT and law enforcement communities,  which were based on the recent policy and technical  developments in this area in MSs. This work also includ- ed a close collaboration with other institutions active in  the field, namely the EC3. Activities agreed upon in the  collaboration agreement between ENISA and EC3 were  further developed, for example in the area of encourag- ing more operational and systematic flows of informa- tion between CSIRTs and law enforcement communities,  the exchange of specific knowledge and expertise,  the elaboration of general situational reports, reports  resulting from strategic analyses and good practice,  strengthening capacity building through training and  awareness raising in order to safeguard network and  information security at the EU level.  For better coordination and in order to avoid overlaps  ENISA was engaged in the EC3 programme board. The  well-established and jointly organised ENISA-EC3 work- shop continued during 2015.  1.4.2 WPK 4.2: European cybercrisis  cooperation through exercises  The activities of 2015 were focused on the following  areas:  pan-European cyber-exercises management;  enhance the capacity to support and organise  cyber-exercises;  promote maintain and improve EU cybercrisis  cooperation plans and procedures, e.g. the EU  Cyber Standard Operational Procedures (EU- CSOPs), and bring closer the cybercrisis cooperation  community.  Pan-European cyber-exercises management  In 2015 ENISA performed an in-depth analysis of the  evaluation data gathered from the Cyber Europe 2014  exercise. This resulted in a detailed evaluation report  with 33 discrete follow up actions that was shared with  the participating countries.  In addition, in 2015 ENISA kicked off the planning of the  next pan-European cyber-exercise, Cyber Europe 2016.  The lessons learned from Cyber Europe 2014 were  used to drive the plan for the new exercise in 2016; in  particular the upcoming exercises will include an en- hanced programme of different learning opportunities,  including training and small-scale focused exercises, in  addition to the main large-scale exercise event.  Enhance the capacity to support  and organise cyber-exercises  ENISA further improved its methodology as well as  seminar and trainings hand-outs, as well as its technical  capabilities for the organisation and management of  large-scale cybercrisis exercises.  The Agency built yet further its capability to organise  and manage complex, distributed exercises. New tools  and methods were introduced while the Agency also  facilitated strategic partnerships. The development of  an advanced tool for managing exercises, the Cyber  Exercise Platform (CEP), was one of the main achieve- ments in 2015.  International cybersecurity exercises  In 2015, ENISA analysed the options for a potential joint  cyber-exercises with non-EU countries and international  organisations. ENISA discussed with the EU and EFTA  countries the options for such joint initiatives in order  to plan the roadmap of future exercises. The strategic  decision for joint initiatives with non-EU or international  organisations will be taken by ENISA’s Management  Board. The report on the potential, future, joint  exercises was submitted to ENISA’s Management Board  as the one of the input documents in this strategic  decision-making process.  Promote, maintain and improve EU cybercrisis  cooperation plans and procedures, e.g. EU Cyber  SOPs, including bringing closer the cybercrisis  cooperation community.  ENISA continued to support EU countries in the mainte- nance and training of operational procedures for cyber- crisis cooperation. ENISA analysed the EU cross-border  cybercrisis cooperation procedures and plans, with  inputs from previous efforts, such as cyber-exercises,  and other related reports. Also ENISA continued to  work with all EU MSs on the actions, plans and tools  needed for improving the cross-border cooperation and  proposed mechanisms for a possible implementation,  closely involving MSs.  ENISA continued its efforts to bring the cybercrisis co- operation community closer in order increase the trust  building to increase synergies. To that end in 2015 ENISA  studied the EU-level structures on crisis management in  different sectors, such as aviation, health, etc., in order  to learn from their good practices. The report published  identifies recommendations with which the ICT sector  (cyber) can improve at an EU-level the response to major  cyber-incidents (also known as cybercrises).  ENISA leveraged its  experience in supporting  the CSIRTs, the CSIRT  communities and Law  Enforcement communities  to enhance collaboration  between these actors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/policy-industry-research https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/policy-industry-research https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-gaps-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-gaps-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-gaps-in-cybersecurity https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-for-smes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/identity-and-trust/library/deliverables/standardisation-for-smes  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 37  SECTION I.

In addition, LEA and CSIRT communities  were involved in a project to address a common taxonomy  for those communities in order to advance the mutual way  of collaboration.  By 2016, at least 15 MSs are familiar with practices in  addressing different sector regulation challenges of  managing cybersecurity issues.  In 2015 the first step was taken — ENISA published a re- port on Cyber Security Information Sharing: An Overview  of Regulatory and Non-regulatory Approaches. The con- tribution to the report was done in cooperation with the  ENISA NLO network from all 28 MSs.  WPK 4.2: European cybercrisis cooperation through exercises  At least 25 EU MSs and EFTA countries confirm their  support for pan-European Cyber Exercises.  In total 29 EU and EFTA countries are participating in the  planning process of Cyber Europe 2016.  At least 25 MSs are familiar with and use the cross-border  cybercrisis EU Standard Operational Procedures by 2016.  All countries involved in the Cyber Europe series of exercis- es are familiar with the cybercrisis cooperation SOPs.

For the MB, 1 ordinary meeting was organised in  2015. Also, 5 informal meetings were held with the  MB members who volunteered to contribute to the  drafting of the annual work programme. The existing  electronic newsletter continued throughout 2015 as  support for the MB Portal. For the PSG also, 2 formal  meetings were organised. To facilitate the exchange  of views, 3 PSG members were nominated by the  Group to be present at the informal meetings with  the MB members.  For the Executive Board, formal meetings  were organised during 2015, also by using the  teleconferencing facilities.  1.5.2 National Liaison Officer Network  Since 2014, ENISA initiated a number of activities with  the aim to strengthen cooperation within the National  Copyright ©Shutterstock  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/fight-against-cybercrime/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/csirt-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/csirt-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities/csirt-capabilities/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/information-sharing/cybersecurity-information-sharing/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/information-sharing/cybersecurity-information-sharing/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/information-sharing/cybersecurity-information-sharing/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/cce/cyber-europe/ce2014 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/cyber-crisis-cooperation/nis-cooperation-plans/ccc-management/eu-level-crisis-man/at_download/fullReport  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 3938  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  Liaison Officers’ (NLO) Network. NLOs are key actors  for the Agency’s daily work and interaction, assuring in  terms of outreach effective liaison to the MSs and dis- semination of ENISA activities. It expands the NLO-Net- work with contact points from governmental and public  agencies/organisations (e.g. CSIRTs and Regulatory  Bodies/Agencies, etc.).  In 2015, ENISA built upon these efforts and improved  its cooperation with the NLO Network, the first Point of  Contact for ENISA in the MSs. In particular, the Agency  continued working on the following actions:  an NLO meeting was organised on 4 March 2015,  in which improvements of the collaboration were  discussed;  the NLO terms of reference were published on the  ENISA website, clarifying the role of NLOs;  information was sent to the members of the NLO  network at regular intervals on upcoming ENISA  project related tenders, vacancy notices, and  events organised by ENISA or where the Agency  contributes (e.g. co-organiser, etc.);  organisation of 1 ad hoc meeting on a specific topic  was identified in collaboration with the NLOs (visit  of Dutch Delegation from NCSC);  all relevant information on active ENISA projects  (e.g. unit responsible for the project, relevant  tender results, etc.) was sent to the network;  a new section on the ENISA website, called ‘Events  from the Member States’ was created in 2015.  This section provides information on NIS events  of international interest, taking place in EU and  EFTA Member States. This section is based on  information sent by NLOs.  1.5.3 Stakeholders’ engagement:  Key ENISA Events  Throughout 2015, ENISA restructured its engagement  with its stakeholders, focusing on two important lines  addressed to NIS Industry leaders and high level policy  and business representatives. Additionally, ENISA ex- plored the possibility of presenting compelling NIS-relat- ed themes in a different format by organising a thematic  conference. Activities in this area included:  1.5.3.1 Industry Event 2015  Among ENISA’s strategic goals is to enhance community  and capacity building in Europe (1). For this reason, ENI- SA organised a workshop with the European IT security  industry, on 8 July, in Brussels.  The primary goal of this event was to engage industry in  a dialogue on how to best serve their needs in a rapidly  changing threat environment, while focusing on policy  implementation issues.  This event brought together key industry decision-mak- ers in order to (a) explain the strategic vision of ENISA  and how the Agency works with the private sector to  achieve impact and (b) get industry feedback on their  expectation and on how to create impact and continu- ously improve the Agency’s output.  The workshop was structured around several informa- tion exchange sessions and a panel debate. In the infor- mation exchange sessions, ENISA informed EU industry  representatives of the work it is doing and solicited their  opinion on how well this meets their requirements. The  debate evolved around the topic of how the Agency  could help industry to be more secure in an economical- ly optimal fashion.  Due to the success of the event, a follow up event will  be organised in 2016 around two key themes of interest  for Industry.  1.5.3.2 ENISA High Level Event 2015  In 2015, the ENISA’s High Level Event (HLE) was the  main networking event of the Agency and it took place  in Brussels, on 9 November.  The ENISA HLE seeks to bring together key stakeholders of  the Network and Information Security field, policy-makers  and subject experts, including top-level representatives  from the Commission, Member States, Industry and Aca- demia. By interacting with the C-layer of its stakeholders,  ENISA seeks to collect input to improve and expand its  delivery and outreach. By bringing together representa- tives from all of ENISA’s stakeholder communities, HLE15  provided an appropriate platform for discussing the key  challenges that the Agency is likely to face in the next  5-year period and for defining the first set of priorities.  Panel discussions explored three themes which are  widely being discussed among policy and NIS circles:  ‘Cybersecurity at the Service of Industry’, ‘Aligning Cy- bersecurity Goals with Democratic Principles’, and ‘Iden- tifying Challenges and Priorities for NIS in Europe’. Key  participating figures included Commissioner Günther  H. Oettinger who gave the keynote speech on the EU  Perspective on key cybersecurity policy objectives,  representatives from the Luxemburgish Presidency, DG  Justice, European Cyber Crime Centre, eu-LISA, ANSSI  and Digital Rights Ireland, among others.  1.5.3.3 Cyber Security & Privacy Challenges  for Law Enforcement (CySPLE15)  On 18-19 May 2015, ENISA and the Heraklion Chamber  of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) jointly organised  a 2-day conference on the theme of Cyber Security and  Privacy Challenges for Law Enforcement. This confer- ence brought together experts from policy, industry and  academia on a unique opportunity to exchange views  on current EU policy issues and initiatives that intersect  cybersecurity, privacy and law enforcement. Current  and emerging technologies were analysed from an  application, organisational and legal view point in the  wake of new compliance requirements. Cross-border  cooperation, exercising rights, and exchanging informa- tion, in the EU and beyond, was emphasised throughout  this conference. In addition the Agency featured in the  HCCI publication providing its recommendations to  SMEs on cloud services. Beyond operational goals, CyS- PLE15 was a good example of the Agency collaborating  with a local authority in its Seat.  1.5.4 EU Relations  Part of the Agency’s horizontal activities include its  relations within the sphere of EU institutions and bodies  notably with the European Commission, the European  Parliament, as well as contacts within Member States to  promote NIS policy. ENISA’s Executive Director and Head  of Core Operations led the activities at the political  and industry level respectively, with the support of the  relevant departments. The press-media office also con- tributes actively by providing communication support,  input and the appropriate vehicles to disseminate the  Agency’s work in cybersecurity to the relevant stake- holders and citizens. This includes its work on:  supporting the Commission initiatives  n the Digital Single Market (DSM) for Europe;  supporting the first EU wide  cybersecurity Directive (NIS);  support for the European Commission Public  Consultation on ‘Contractual PPP’ launch of a public  consultation, around the Public-Private Partnership  as an important step towards securing the Digital  Single Market, by welcoming the initiative and  inviting its stakeholders to contribute.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 4140  SECTION I.  Key results in the implementation of ENISA Work programme 2015  Within this framework, activities in field included the  Executive Director participating in the following events:  the EPP Hearing on data driven security, on the 1st  July 2015, at the European Parliament in Brussels;  on 23 June 2015, at the IMCO Committee meeting  in Brussels, in an exchange of views on the public  interest information platform of the Universal  Service Directive;  the SEDE (Security and Defence) subcommittee  meeting in Brussels, on 16 March 2015 in an  exchange of views on cybersecurity and defence;  the 4th meeting of the Working Group on Digital  Union of the ITRE Committee on cybersecurity  at the European Parliament (EP) in Brussels.  Prof. Helmbrecht spoke to the Working Group  about ENISA’s role in ‘securing and enabling  Europe’s information society’, focusing on the  Agency’s work with Europe’s Computer Security  Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and the  facilitation of pan-European cyber-exercises;  the European Parliament high-level conference  in Brussels, jointly organised by the Civil Liberties  Committee (LIBE) and the Luxemburg Presidency of  the Council of the EU, co-chaired by the IMCO and  ITRE Committees, which debates the protection  of online privacy by enhancing IT security and  strengthening EU IT capabilities. ENISA welcomed  the separately discussed policy areas of stimulating  the adoption of privacy enhancing technologies  (PETs), addressing software and hardware  vulnerabilities and the internet infrastructure as  well as developing the EU potential for a strong and  vital IT industry. ENISA hopes for a stimulating effect  of the conference in the political debate on these  closely linked policies;  the Chatham House Cyber 2015 meeting on  ‘Security, Privacy and Competing interests’;  the 2nd High Level Conference on EU Cybersecurity,  organised by the European Commission, on 28  May 2015, in Brussels. The event focused on  making the EU an industrial leader in trustworthy  ICT; building capacity to fight cybercrime and  strengthen cybersecurity in the EU and beyond; and  achievements of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the  challenges and opportunities ahead;  the 10th Future Security Conference. The event  hosts high-level panellists mainly from ministries,  institutions and academia. ENISA’s Executive  Director Prof. Helmbrecht delivered the keynote  address on ‘Privacy and Data protection: an EU  Perspective’, where he mentioned the latest  developments in the area and spoke about how the  Agency has become a point of reference on eIDAS;  the 19th Security Conference on  Telecommunications and IT Security in Warsaw on  the 14-15 October 2015, at the Copernicus Science  Centre, Warsaw. ENISA was an honorary patron  of this year’s event. Prof Helmbrecht spoke about  cybersecurity standards giving an insight from the  EU perspective and ENISA’s role;  the Cyber Cooperation Summit in New York. Along  with representatives from the public and private  sectors, Prof. Helmbrecht spoke on the panel ‘Is  Cooperation Possible in Cyberspace?’ discussing the  challenges to protecting critical assets from cyber- attacks at a global level while minimising threats to  IT security;  the panel discussion on ‘Accelerating Digital  Innovation for Social Impact’ at ITU. Prof.  Helmbrecht spoke on the need for a close  collaboration between policy initiatives and  technology innovation, providing notable  examples of areas which offer such a potential,  and elaborated on how the EU needs an industry  policy approach to create a competitive EU based  ICT industry which can be based on a variety of  different tools;  talking to decision-makers at the Deutschland sicher  im Netz e.V event on 3 November 2015, referencing  ENISA’s multi-stakeholder approach. Helmbrecht  recommended cooperating with public authorities  at the state level in order to ‘create synergies  between existing programs and objectives’, for  example with national data protection authorities,  regulatory bodies and academia.  At the main forum at the Omnicard event in  Berlin on 21 January, 2015, on the panel on  ‘Secure identities — an effective tool to increase  information security?’. ENISA’s work ‘Framework on  how to evaluate National Cyber Security strategies’  also featured on the Omnicard website. The report,  addressed to policy experts and government  officials who design, implement and evaluate an  NCSS policy, is strongly aligned with the EU Cyber  Security Strategy (EU CSS) aiming to assist Member  States in developing capabilities in the area of NCSS.  the agency also hosted visits at its premises,  including a 2-day visit by an EP ITRE (Industry,  Research and Energy) delegation, Michal Boni MEP,  and Eva Kaili MEP, at its premises in Heraklion on  24-25 September 2015. The programme of their  visit included a: (i) brief presentation on ENISA and  the agency’s mission and scope of its activities; (ii)  presentation on flagship and major agency projects  including secure and smart infrastructures, cloud  computing, national cybersecurity strategies,  incident reporting, threat landscape, certification,  privacy and data protection, and supporting EC  policy processes. In each case, emphasis was placed  on the impact of the work; (iii) demonstration and  overview of ENISA’s training activities for the EU  CSIRT community and cyber-exercises; (iv) meeting  with ENISA staff for an exchange of views on the  upcoming challenges in the field of cybersecurity  within the European context and activities.  1.5.5 Corporate Communication  Year 2015 was a challenging one for the Agency in view  of the agreements on the NIS Directive, the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the announce- ment of the Digital Single Market (DSM) initiative by the  Commission, as these are areas in which the Agency is  particularly active. These landmark agreements make  the Agency’s work even more important within the EU  in cybersecurity, and its stimulus to the internal market  growth. The Agency also engaged itself this year more  at the EU level, communicating on cybersecurity chal- lenges and efforts — such as CSIRTS cooperation and  training, privacy-by-design (PbD), the need for stand- ards, for cybercooperation, awareness raising, incident  reporting, data protection and privacy issues, data  breach reporting, IoT security, support to private-public  partnerships (PPPs) and the trending developments  both at the industry and policy level. ENISA also got  engaged more by participating at targeted events for  the first time with its own booth at the Bitkom #hub15  event, thus establishing new platforms for dialogue and  networking, while providing support and recommenda- tions to the involved communities.  1.5.5.1 Dissemination activities  ENISA Press Office has sought to enhance its outreach  in the EU increasing its presence mainly in Belgium and  Germany, and also the United Kingdom and France. The  result was increased coverage, editorials, articles and  interviews published in top-tier online press and media  outlets with the major expert media in Europe. Special  emphasis was placed on messages tailored to the spe- cific audiences for ENISA’s events, projects, activities,  deliverables and press presence.  In the following subsections some of the activities,  events, and statistics associated with our communica- tion activities are presented.  Publications  ENISA is active in publishing the results of its work  through its reports, studies, info notes, papers and opin- ions, enhancing its communication and reach with vari- ous stakeholders. Additionally, ad hoc technical or policy  reports, papers, and studies were produced. In 2015 the  Agency published 53 deliverables as Work Programme  deliverables and produced various other reports, papers  and studies — including the Annual Activities Report  2014 and ENISA’s Work Programme 2016.  In 2015, ENISA’s main templates were redesigned and  relaunched improving significantly the look and feel and  functionality. In addition, ENISA’s publication process  was supported with professional graphic designs, imag- es and illustrations. In 2015 ENISA continued to identify  its deliverables using the EU Publication’s Office Identi- fication numbers (e.g. ISBN, DOI) so that all deliverables  are simultaneously published on the EU bookshop.  The Agency strives to make the Executive Director  and select staff members available to communicate  publically and provide their expertise externally to the  relevant communities and to the press and media, pro- moting best practices and developing synergies towards  a smooth cyber EU environment. Along these lines,  through the press office, a large number of interviews,  editorials, and articles have been made available to  leading publications, media outlets and other counter- parts, and the Agency is present at high level events,  promoting cybersecurity from an official, respected EU  ENISA is active in publishing  the results of its work  through its reports, studies,  info notes, papers and  opinions, enhancing its  communication and reach  with various stakeholders.  42  SECTION I.

A multilingual approach to  communication remains a priority for the Agency.  1.5.5.2 Media outreach  ENISA’s impact, outreach and media programme gives  the Agency the opportunity to extend its reach. The  Agency expanded its actions, further enhancing its me- dia distribution and outreach, and promoting a culture  of tailored targeting and cross-referencing aspects of its  work and multipliers.  Cross media impact  ENISA generated 3 383 mentions in EU media main- taining its reach and impact across the EU. Directly,  media releases on the ENISA website received 220 000  unique page views showing an increase, and individual  news stories received around 64 183 direct hits. Figures  continue to show a clear correlation between peaks  in web visitors and the distribution of media releases  in multiple channels, demonstrating the beneficial  effect of the communication and media activity. Total  readership includes an online reach of  2 378 448, 110  and 15 393,097 in print. In addition ENISA extended its  reach (2) to millions of citizens — to and through key EU  expert media — enhancing its reputation as experts and  dialogue partners in cybersecurity.  Social media  ENISA continues its prominent engagement with the  online community through its social media outlets. All  ENISA activities and deliverables are communicated  via social media channels, and generate increasing  traffic towards the Agency website, activities, events  and deliverables. In addition, they are incorporated  in the Agency’s communications (publications,  presentations, emails, brand material, etc.). In  particular, social media monitoring reports show  an increased reach through ENISA’s channels. Key  accomplishments for 2015, include:  The ENISA Twitter channel features 9 300 followers  (6 000 in 2014), generating over 4 000 tweets.  The ENISA LinkedIn page features 5 800 followers.  The ENISA YouTube channel contains 51 videos posted.  Digital media  The ENISA website continues to be the Agency’s main  communication channel, enhancing its presence. In  2015, the website received more than 3 000 000 unique  page views.  Technical improvements in 2015 include initiating the  development of a new online environment for ENI- SA’s website with the joint collaboration of staff mem- bers across all ENISA’s units.  The Agency is making continuous efforts for the im- provement of its website with usability studies and reg- ular updates in order to make it more user friendly and  reach citizens more effectively. Against this background  the Agency’s website layout and information architec- ture have been redesigned to further improve ease of  navigation, usability and end-user experience. The new  site is contemporary, responsive and has a dynamic fast- paced architecture providing access to ENISA’s Work  Programme, latest reports, events, projects, publi- cations and audiovisual material. The new website is  expected to go live early in 2016.  ENISA Portals — used by specialist expert communities  — have also been redesigned to improve end-user ex- perience, while a number of new web tools have been  introduced or updated to support ENISA’s activities.  Furthermore, the structure of the Agency’s three  mini-sites in French, German and Greek continue to  support and attract visitors. In addition, the dedicated  portal for the European Cyber Security Month was  redesigned and enhanced further with new content and  functionalities promoting the ECSM initiative and its  growing community.  Audio-visual material  In 2015, 3 videos were produced to communicate the  Agency’s activities.  ENISA’s Cyber-exercise team created  a video providing a peek into Europe’s  biggest cyber-exercise;  ENISA’s CSIRT team created a ‘train the trainers’  video introducing and demonstrating the teams’  work and training resources for the Member States.  Additionally, 3 videos were produced for internal com- munication purposes.  In addition the Agency’s departments produced info- graphics and posters on the topics of their work, aiming  to improve the visibility of the Agency’s work and key  facts and disseminate messages. These include:  ENISA PETs (privacy enhancing technologies) poster;  Posters and infographics on ENISA’s work on Critical  Information Infrastructure protection;  National Cyber Security Strategies Infographic;  ENISA Cyber Security Exercises and Training posters;  ENISA Threat Landscape 2015 Infographic;  4 new posters on cybersecurity education and  awareness.  1.5.5.3 Additional outreach activities  ENISA actively continued its participation in events,  increasing visibility, involvement, recognition and  awareness at a local, national or EU level through:  Europe Day activities with ENISA staff members  visiting schools in Athens and Heraklion  for a ‘Back to school’ session, giving the  opportunity to students to learn more about  the Agency’s work in cybersecurity for Europe.  The Agency also hosted an interactive seminar  session on trending cybersecurity topics for  representatives of embassies, the Hellenic  Authority for Communication Security and Privacy  (ADAE), local authorities, academia and educators.  The press office for the occasion collected  awareness-raising material on cybersecurity which  as available online on ENISA’s website including  posters, videos, recommendations, infographics  and games. Relevant branding material was also  produced and distributed.  The European Cyber Security Challenge initiative  with organisations from six countries. The  competition is an opportunity for participants, who  are not IT professionals, to test and put their digital  skills at work, and also acts as a platform for the  exchange of good practices among contestants, and  to motivate young people to enhance and further  develop their skills to tackle online threats. In 2016  the event is supported by ENISA.  Hosting visits from EU schools, providing the  opportunity to meet with staff and experts, bringing  educators and students closer to the EU activities  on cybersecurity and seeing the EU Agency from  within, meet staff and follow presentations on  ENISA’s work and awareness on cyberthreats.  An event for the presentation of the new — to be  — School of European Education (SEE) in Heraklion  hosted at its premises on 30 April a welcoming  party of around sixty participants including teachers  and parents from the SEE, and representatives from  Heraklion Municipality, of the School Buildings  Organisation and of the new Regional Director of  Education in Crete.  Supporting NIS experts in the production of the  successful series of ‘Info Notes’ activities where  short, expert reports provide a pragmatic analysis  on trending security issues and themes. The  activity has proven to be an important tool which  stakeholders turn to for reliable information on  security issues.  The News from the Member States activity,  a request of the NIS community, covering the latest  technical cybersecurity updates from EU Member  States aiming at increasing interaction within the  specific community.  The organisation of an information security  workshop (Infosec) in Athens in September 2015.  This invitation-only event welcomed participants  from EU Agencies such as Europol, CEPOL,  BEREC, ECHA, eu-LISA, Cedefop, EFCA, OHIM,  ERA, EEA, EMSA, FRONTEX, FRA, IMI, EIGE, the  Translation Centre of the European Bodies,  and FCH. The workshop aimed at providing  valuable insights on information security at the  highest operational level. ENISA experts gave an  overview on the cyberthreat landscape, risks and  considerations for cloud platforms, as well as an  inside look at ENISA’s technical trainings and the  Cyber Europe Exercises.  Hosting workshops and visits such as that of the:  (i) German Ministry of Interior on areas of shared  interest, such as critical information infrastructure  protection, threat landscape, data protection and  others. The discussion revealed opportunities for  further cooperation between the two organisations  especially in policy implementations where ENISA  has significant experience at an EU level;  In 2015, ENISA:  produced 40 press releases (doubling,  compared 23 media releases in 2014) and  75 news items on the ENISA website;  simultaneously published media  releases and news items on ENISA’s  social media channels on Facebook,  Twitter, and LinkedIn.

An array of varying activities was organised that  included the EU Agencies Network coordination,  ENISA Christmas activities for staff and families,  and various internal coordination activities in  such areas as strategy, organisational culture and  team building.  1.5.6 Quality Management System  and Project Office  The Quality Management System (QMS) of the Agency  aimed at responding to a mix of regulatory and stake- holder requirements for operations mostly, in an effort  to improve organisational performance and compliance.  Scheduled annual activities have aimed at the promulga- tion and maintenance of standard operating procedures  (SOPs) and a methodology that supports the opera- tional processes of the Agency. The primary goal of the  documented QMS in 2015 was to improve performance  across the Agency, while reducing operational costs and  enhancing stakeholder satisfaction. Implementing SOPs  has been a priority in order to increase operational effi- ciency. Good examples of SOPs that had a tangible impact  in improving efficiency and effectiveness include: the SOP  on the Review and Publication of Deliverables, the SOP  on handling Article 14 requests, etc.  The ENISA Project Office supported the smooth prom- ulgation of the annual work program of the Agency co- ordinating an array of contributors among Agency staff  and its MB, PSG and the Commission. Additionally the  Project Office’s work entailed responding to about 150  individual requests for ad hoc contributions to manage- ment work such as briefings on cross-cutting themes,  coordinating the coherence of recommendations across  the Department, etc. In 2015, the editing and produc- tion of the Annual Activity Report 2014 was coordinated  by the Project Office team.  1.5.7 Article 14 Requests  Article 14 requests are an instrument that allows the MSs  or EU institutions to make direct requests to ENISA for car- rying out particular activities. This mechanism has become  increasingly valuable and it has grown in significance to the  extent that the Agency believes that it needs to be explicit- ly planned for in the annual work programme.  The following table provides an overview of the Article  14 requests in 2015 compared to those in 2014.  The table of requests outlines all current ongoing  requests.

On top of these tasks, in 2015 the DPO contributed  to the organisation and follow up of the EDPS visit  at ENISA, which supported the Agency’s compliance  with Regulation 45/2001/EC, as well as its cooperation  with EDPS on operational matters. Moreover, the  ENISA’s DPO organised the 38th meeting of the  EU agencies DPOs & EDPS network (approximately  70 participants), which was hosted by ENISA in Athens  in November 2015.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 49  2.1 MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL  RESOURCES  2.1.1 Budget Execution of EU  subsidy (C1 funds)  In terms of budget execution, the expenditure appropri- ations of ENISA Budget 2015 of EUR 10 064 274, were  committed at a rate of 100.00 % on 31 December 2015.  ENISA did not cancel any appropriations of the year (C1)  appropriations by the end of the year (cancellation  rate 0.00 %).  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven capacity of the Agency to efficiently use the  entrusted funds, in order to implement its annual  Work Programme as well as manage its administrative  expenditure and investments.  SECTION II. MANAGEMENT  OF RESOURCES  The respective payment rate on expenditure appro- priations was 92.89 % in 2015 compared to 85.61 % in  2014. This payment rate is high and demonstrates that  the capacity of the Agency to finalise its annual activ- ities as well as execute the relevant payments within  the year of reference was maintained. The procure- ment planning which was moved forward to the end of  the preceding year (2014) and enabled the launch of  projects related to the Work Programme in early 2015,  contributed significantly to the improvement of the  payment rate of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.2 Amending Budgets/Budgetary Transfers  The following table summarises the effect of the Budget  transfers Nos 1 to 7, approved by the Executive Director  (ED) of ENISA, and the Amending Budget (AB) 1/2015,  approved by the Management Board, on the initial  Budget 2015:  II.

Management of Resources  The table below summarises the effect of the Budget  transfers Nos 8 and 9, approved by the ED after the adop- tion of the AB 1/2015 to the final budget execution:  service level agreements have been concluded with  each of the private schools being used by the children  of the staff.  In 2015, 4 implementing rules prepared by the Commis- sion (Appraisal of CA’s, Appraisal of TA’s, Working Time  and Teleworking) were considered by ENISA and were  sent to the Management Board for approval. These  approved implementing rules provide clarification and  detail on the application of the Staff Regulations which  provide the legal basis for the obligations and rights of  Staff members.  In 2015, ENISA engaged consultants to complete a re- port on cost of living and quality of life in Athens for  all the years from 2011 up to 2015. Also, a number of  team building activities with staff were held through- out the year to improve team spirit and the working  environment. These exercises proved to be very well  received by the staff and also helped to bridge the bar- rier created from the operation of two offices in a small  agency and improved the day-to-day work through new  projects which are running  The organisational chart, establishment plan and the  Statistics for ENISA staff is attached in Annex A.1.  2.2.2 Results of screening  The Agency performed the job screening benchmarking  exercise for the second time for 2015. The result of the  exercise, which is a snapshot of the staffing situation on  end December 2015, appears in Annex A.4. It is relevant  to mention that the ‘Overhead’, support functions, is  only 21.35 % of the total statutory staff count, which is  below the maximum value accepted for the Agencies  that is estimated at 25 %.  2.3 ASSESSMENT BY MANAGEMENT  2.3.1 Control effectiveness as regards  legality and regularity  The Agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multi-annual  character of programmes as well as the nature of the  payments concerned. In order to achieve the best  control possible, the Agency has focused intensively  on the verification of results before transactions are  initiated (‘ex ante verification’).  In line with Internal Control Standard 8 (ICS 8  Processes and Procedures), the Agency has done the  ex post control report of the financial year 2014. The  recommendations issued on the report were addressed  during the year.  The ex post controls of the financial year 2014 were  quiet extensive. A total of 174 financial transactions  were sampled and controlled representing 9.22 % of all  financial transactions of the Agency and representing  70.99 % of the 2014 Agency’s budget.  As a result 1 recommendation was issued which regards  a delay of payments which did not generate any interest  to be paid.  Moreover, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) is in  charge of the annual audit of the Agency which is con- cluded by the publication of an annual report according  to the provisions of Article 287(1) of TFEU. For several  consecutive years, the ECA reports have confirmed the  improvement in the Agency’s overall internal controls  environment and performance.  2.4 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION TASKS  ENTRUSTED TO OTHER SERVICES AND  ENTITIES.  The Agency did not entrust budget implementation to  other services and entities.  2.5 ASSESSMENT OF AUDIT RESULTS  AND FOLLOW UP OF AUDIT  RECOMMENDATIONS.  2.5.1 Internal Audit Services (IAS)  At the beginning of 2015, the Agency had 1 open  recommendation. During the end of January 2015, the  Agency closed it. In 2016, the IAS will perform the Risk  Assessment for the Agency.  2.5.2 European Court of Auditors (ECA)  The annual report of ECA on the accounts of ENISA for  2014 contained 1 important recommendation, which  was open in 2012, when the Court noted a delay in  performance of a physical inventory count.  The recommendation concerning the physical inventory  was completed in 2014.

Summary of transfers’ effect on final budget execution:  2.1.3 Carry forward of  commitment appropriations  The commitment appropriations corresponding to the EU  subsidy (C1 appropriations), which were not consumed  by payments at the end of 2015, were carried forward  (automatic carry forward) to 2016 (C8 appropriations).  All commitment appropriations corresponding to the  subsidy from the Greek Government for the lease of  ENISA premises in Greece (external assigned revenue  — R0 appropriations) were paid by 31 December 2015,  therefore no commitment appropriations were automati- cally carried over to 2016 (R0 appropriations).  The funds carried forward to 2016 (C8 appropriations)  are detailed below:  The total cancelled appropriations carried forward from  2014 to 2015 (C8 appropriations of 2015) but finally not  paid in 2015, was EUR 80 675.08 (representing 6.05 %  of the total appropriations carried forward from 2014  to 2015).  2.1.4 Types of Procurement Procedures  In 2015, a total of 47 Procurement procedures were  launched, resulting in 50 contracts (19 framework  contracts, 11 service contracts and 20 specific con- tracts awarded under Re-Opening of Competition) and  301 Purchase Orders (143 of which were issued under  pre-existing framework contracts) were signed.  2.1.5 Interest charged by suppliers  During 2015, the Agency had to pay no interest to its  suppliers as result of keeping the payment terms agreed  with the suppliers.  2.2 MANAGEMENT OF HUMAN  RESOURCES  2.2.1 Human Resources  At the end of 2015, 69 statutory staff were employed in  the Agency.  During 2015, 4 staff left the Agency, 7 vacancy notices  were published and 17 staff were recruited or took up  new duties within the Agency. ENISA still experiences  significant challenges in attracting and holding suitably  qualified staff to support the activities of the Agency.  This is a challenge due to several factors, mainly the  types of post that are being offered (CA posts) and the  low coefficient factor which applies to salaries of ENISA  employees in Greece.  In relation to the schooling for ENISA staff members in  Athens, where no European Schools are based, several  Title Total C1 appropriations  carried forward to 2016  Title 1 – Staff 335.988,15  Title 2 – Administration 181.037,92  Title 3 - Operations 157.494,47  Total 674.520,54  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5352  SECTION II.  Management of Resources  tion and disposal process, which was launched following  the physical inventory count, is still ongoing.  The ECA’s report on 2015 accounts is expected in the  third quarter of 2016. The Agency expects that the  Court’s opinion on the true and fair presentation of the  accounts as well as on the legality and regularity of the  transactions underlying the accounts will be unqualified  as it has been for the past 8 years.  2.5.3 Follow up of audits plans, audits and  recommendations  The Agency has only 1 open recommendation regarding  the workflows of financial transactions.  This recommendation was closed in the beginning of  2015 when the tool ‘Paperless’ was implemented (Jan- uary 2015).  2.5.4 Follow up of observations  from the Discharge authority  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 29 April  2015, the Executive Director of the Agency was granted  the discharge in respect of the implementation of the  Agency’s budget for the financial year 2013.  Regarding the European Parliament decision of 29 April  2015, the closure of the accounts of the Agency for the  financial year 2013 was approved.  2.5.4.1 Follow up of the 2012 discharge  The Discharge authority notes from the Court’s report  that regarding one comment made in the Court’s 2011  report and marked as ‘Ongoing’ in the Court’s 2012  report, corrective actions were taken and the comment  is now marked in the Court’s report as ‘Completed’.  The Discharge authority notes furthermore that the  comment made in the Court’s 2012 report is now  marked in the Court’s report as ‘Ongoing’.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the infor- mation on the impact of its activities on Union citizens  is provided on the Agency’s website through the yearly  publication of strategic documents including the Annual  Report, as well as new communication channels such as  social media.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the Agency  performed a comprehensive physical inventory count  in 2013; notes that the results of the inventory count  were reported within the Annual Accounts of 2013 and  that the corresponding comment of the Court marked  the action as ‘Ongoing’ because the declassification  procedure for the items out of use was still pending at  the time of the Court’s audit.  2.5.4.2 Budget and financial management  The Discharge authority noted that budget monitor- ing efforts during the financial year 2013 resulted in  a budget implementation rate of 94.41 % and that the  payment appropriations execution rate was 86.46 %;  points out that in November 2013, additional funds  were approved by the Commission for the financing  of the Agency’s new office in Athens; notes that in this  context, a total of EUR 500 000 was not committed at  year-end and was carried over, following a decision by  the Management Board.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that during  2013, the Agency’s operational staff were relocated to  Athens while its administrative staff remained in Herak- lion; agrees with the Court’s opinion that administrative  costs could be reduced if all the Agency’s staff were  to be centralised in one location and encourages the  Agency to prepare a strategy that would resolve this  issue effectively.  2.5.4.3 Commitments and carryovers  The Discharge authority notes that the total amount  of committed appropriations carried over was  EUR 1 200 000, representing 13.5 % of total ap- propriations; is concerned that out of this amount,  EUR 800 000 are Title II carry-overs, representing 59 %  of Title II total appropriations; acknowledges that the  EUR 500 000 referred to in paragraph 3 as well as an  additional EUR 300 000 carried over for the financing of  furniture and network equipment for the new office in  Athens, explain the high level of carry-overs for Title II.  2.5.4.4 Transfers  The Discharge authority noted with satisfaction that  according to the Agency’s Annual Report, as well as the  Court’s audit findings, the level and nature of transfers in  2013 have remained within the limits of the financial rules.  2.5.4.5 Procurement and recruitment procedures  The Discharge authority noted that that for the year  2013, neither sampled transactions nor other audit  findings have led to any comments on the Agency’s pro- curement procedures in the Court’s report.  The Discharge authority noted that the Court made no  comments in its report as regards the Agency’s recruit- ment procedures.  2.5.4.6 Prevention and management  of conflicts of interests and transparency  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the Man- agement Board approved and signed the decision on  practical arrangements for implementing transparency  and confidentiality rules in October 2013 and ac- knowledged from the Agency that CVs, declarations of  interest of the Executive Director, the Directors and the  Heads of Department were fully published on the Agen- cy’s website as requested by the Discharge authority on  the Agency’s discharge 2012.  2.5.4.7 Comments on internal controls  The Discharge authority noted that in September 2013  the Internal Control Coordinator role (ICC) was fully de- ployed and addressed as a priority the implementation  and subsequent closure of several recommendations  made by the Commission’s Internal Audit Service (IAS).  2.5.4.8 Internal audit  The Discharge authority noted that during 2012,  a risk assessment exercise was conducted by the  IAS in order to determine the audit priorities for the  following 3 years; notes that the IAS submitted its final  strategic audit plan of 2013-2015 for the Agency on 3  December 2012.  The Discharge authority acknowledged that the IAS  performed a desk review audit on ‘Project Management  in Operations’ during 2013, which resulted in a total of  5 recommendations; notes that 4 of these recommen- dations have already been closed while the fifth one is  to be reviewed by the IAS.  The Discharge authority noted that no critical recom- mendations from previous IAS reports were open as of  31 December 2013; notes furthermore that the only  ‘Very Important’ rated recommendation open at the  year-end has been implemented and was awaiting to be  reviewed by the IAS; points out that this recommenda- tion relates to the application of ex post controls; calls  on the Agency to inform the Discharge authority when  the ex post controls are validated by the IAS.  2.5.4.9 Other comments  The Discharge authority acknowledged that according  to the lease agreement between the Greek authorities,  the Agency and the landlord, rent for the offices in  Athens is paid by the Greek authorities; is concerned  by the constant late payment of rent, delayed by  several months, which presents business continuity  and financial risks for the Agency; takes note that the  Agency has commenced discussions with the interested  parties in this regard; notes furthermore that to date,  the landlord has accepted the delays attributed to the  procedures of the Greek Government without imposing  any penalty on the Agency; calls on the Agency to  continue its efforts in order to mitigate the risks brought  by this situation and to inform the Discharge authority  on the progress.  The Discharge authority noted with concern that the  Agency failed to answer the question on the cost-effec- tiveness and environment-friendliness of its working  space; calls on the Agency to inform the Discharge  authority on the measures in place.  In detail:  the declassification exercise was done in  2014 as well as the donation of goods to  public institutions in need;  the auction exercise was completed in  2015;  the process regarding the physical  destruction/recycling of the remaining  declassified items is estimated to be  completed in April 2016.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5554  3.1 RISK MANAGEMENT  The Agency is actually using the Risk Assessment done  by the Internal Audit Service in 2012.  The Risk Self-Assessment procedure was adopted in  2015. The Risk Self-Assessment will be done in 2016.  Regarding fraud prevention and detection, the Manage- ment Board adopted the Agency’s Anti-fraud strategy  and action plan in 2014 a specific procedure for whistle- blowing will be done in 2016.  3.2 COMPLIANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS  OF INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control standards,  based on international good practice, that aim to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  The Agency has also put in place the organisational struc- ture and the internal control systems suited to the achieve- ment of policy and control objectives, in accordance with  the standards and having due regard to the risks associated  with the environment in which it operates.  In 2010, the Management Board of the Agency adopted  a set of 16 internal control standards laying down the  minimum requirements with which its internal control  systems need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the Agency, as  deemed appropriate.  In 2014, the Agency focused on compliance with the  standards that were identified as areas of concern  during the risk assessment exercise, as well as on the  recommendations raised by the auditing bodies (ECA  and IAS). During 2015, the Agency achieved compliance  with the internal control standards listed below.  3.2.1 Mission (ICS 1)  The Agency’s mission and scope is described in the  ENISA Regulation. Mission statements for departments  and units were established based on the evolution of  the organisation in 2015. The roles and tasks of each  department and unit are clearly defined.  3.2.2 Ethical and organisational values (ICS 2)  The Agency has procedures in place — including up- dates and yearly reminders — to ensure that all staff is  aware of relevant ethical and organisational values (e.g.  ethical conduct, avoidance of conflicts of interest, fraud  prevention, reporting of irregularities). Specific training  is organised by the Agency for its staff every year in  order to reinforce professional behaviour, compliance  with the expected behaviour, ethics and integrity, and in  order to prevent workplace harassment.  SECTION III. ASSESSMENT OF THE  EFFECTIVENESS OF THE  INTERNAL CONTROL  SYSTEMSIII.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5756  SECTION III.  Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  3.2.3 Staff Allocation and Mobility (ICS 3)  Whenever necessary, management aligns organisa- tional structures and staff allocations with priorities  and workload.  3.2.4 Staff evaluation and development  (ICS 4)  In the context of the Career Development Report (CDR)  process, discussions are held individually with all staff to  establish their annual objectives. Staff performance is  evaluated according to standards set by the Agency. An  annual training plan is developed at Agency level based  on needs deriving from the policy of the Agency. As  part of the CDR process, every year each staff member  completes an individual training plan. Management  ensures that at a minimum every staff member attends  the compulsory training courses defined in the annual  training plan.  3.2.5 Objectives and Performance  Indicators (ICS 5)  Work Programme and budget preparation procedures  were developed in 2009 and revised in 2014. The  Annual Work Programme (WP) of the Agency is  developed by the Agency services, with continuous  input and guidance from its two governing bodies,  the Management Board and the Permanent  Stakeholders Group. The WP clearly sets out how  the planned activities at each management level  contribute to the achievement of objectives, taking  into account the resources allocated and the risks  identified. The WP objectives are established on  SMART (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Relevant,  Time-bound) criteria and updated or changed during  the year in order to address significant changes in  priorities and activities.  The role of the Executive Board is to assist preparing  decisions to be adopted by the Management Board on  administrative and budgetary matters only.  The Agency has based the measurement of its perfor- mance on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that are  applied to all areas of activity. KPIs are more qualitative  for the Agency’s operational goals, whereas they are  more quantitative for the Agency’s administrative goals.  The effectiveness of key controls is assessed using  relevant KPIs, including self-assessments that have been  carried out in the form of progress reports and follow  up actions that seek to re-align divergences from the  Work Programme.  The Agency’s Work Programmes are annual and mul- ti-annual. The MB and the PSG give orientation and in- put on a regular basis throughout the WP development  process as well as during the year of implementation.  ENISA installed the project management tool MATRIX,  which has streamlined and consolidated the planning,  monitoring and reporting functions in a uniform and  comprehensive way.  Finally, the Agency managed again to optimise the  budget execution for 5 consecutive years. The commit- ment rate of budget appropriations available for the  year 2015 (C1) reached 100 %, another consecutive  year in which the total Agency budget was consumed.  3.2.6 Risk management process (ICS 6)  The IAS performed a risk assessment of the Agency in  2012. Risks identified as very important during the pre- vious audits were addressed by the Agency and actions  were planned and communicated to the IAS accordingly.  In 2014, effort and resources were devoted to address- ing and mitigating the risks that had been identified.  This satisfactorily addressed the recommendations of  both the ECA and IAS, as noted in their annual reports.  The Risk Self-Assessment procedure was adopted in  2015. The Risk Self-Assessment will be done in 2016.  Moreover, the Internal Audit Service will conduct their  Risk Assessment in September 2016.  3.2.7 Operational structure (ICS 7)  Delegation of authority is clearly defined, assigned and  communicated by means of the Executive Director’s Deci- sions (EDD). It conforms to regulatory requirements and is  appropriate to the level of importance of the decisions to  be taken as well as the risks involved. All delegated, author- ising officers have received and acknowledged the Charter  of the role and responsibility of the Authorising Officer (by  Delegation) as well as the individual delegation EDD.  The Agency’s sensitive functions are clearly defined,  recorded and kept up to date. The Agency records  derogations granted to allow staff to remain in sensitive  functions beyond 5 years along with documentation of  the risk analysis and the controls for mitigation.  As regards sensitive functions, due care has been taken  in order to avoid potential conflict of interest situa- tions. However, due to the small size of the Agency, the  mobility of staff in sensitive functions is very limited and  takes into account service needs and available resourc- es. Proper back-ups are designated in order to ensure  business continuity.  3.2.8 Processes and Procedures (ICS 8)  Several policies were developed to strengthen the Pro- cesses and Procedures Internal Control Standard. The  Agency created a policy on financial circuits. The roles  and responsibilities of financial actors are described in  this policy as well as existing workflows (see comment  on ‘Paperless’ application in ICS 11).  A Code of Professional Conduct for ex ante financial ver- ification was developed. This document emphasises the  role and responsibilities of the Financial Verifying Agent.  The Agency proceeded in 2015 with the full 2014 ex  post control exercise and will deliver the 2015 ex post  control report in the first semester of 2016.  Importantly in 2014, a Quality Management System was  implemented strengthening the performance manage- ment of the Agency.  3.2.9 Management supervision (ICS 9)  Management at all levels supervises the activities for  which they are responsible and tracks the main issues  identified. The Management Team, which comprises the  Executive Director and the heads of departments and  units, meets weekly and sets priorities for the actions  to be taken in order to achieve the short- and medi-  The Agency has based  the measurement of  its performance on Key  Performance Indicators  (KPIs) that are applied  to all areas of activity.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 5958  SECTION III.  Assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control systems  um-term objectives of the Agency. A list of action items  is compiled. It contains all agreed actions as allocated  to specific departments or units. The list is published on  a dedicated Intranet page and regularly reviewed by the  Management Team. Management supervision covers  both legality and regularity aspects (i.e. set up and com- pliance with applicable rules) and operational perfor- mance (i.e. achievement of Annual WP objectives).  Management also establishes action plans in order to  address accepted ECA and IAS audit recommendations  and monitors the implementation of these action plans  throughout the year.  The implementation of the project management tool  MATRIX has enhanced the planning, implementation,  monitoring and reporting of operational projects, and  has enabled the establishment of a common project  management framework across different organisational  units of the Agency.  3.2.10 Business continuity (ICS 10)  Adequate measures — including handover files and  deputising arrangements for relevant operational activ- ities and financial transactions — are in place to ensure  the continuity of all services during ‘business-as-usual’  interruptions (such as sick leave, staff mobility, migra- tion to new IT systems, incidents, etc.).  An IT Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has been devel- oped and implemented. An Agency-wide BCP, designed  to cover crisis response and recovery arrangements  with respect to major disruptions, has been developed  and fully implemented. The latter BCP identifies the  functions, services and infrastructure that need to be  restored within certain time limits and the resources  necessary for this purpose. Electronic and hardcopy  versions of both BCPs are stored in secure and easily  accessible locations, which are known to relevant staff.  3.2.11 Document management (ICS 11)  Document management systems and their related pro- cedures comply with: (1) relevant compulsory security  measures; (2) provisions on document management;  and (3) rules on the protection of personal data. Infor- mation security policy specific to data categorisation  and labelling is in place. As regards the exchange of  information classified at the level RESTREINT UE/EU  RESTRICTED, an administrative arrangement between  the Security Directorate of the European Commission  and the Agency was signed on 27 May 2011.  An internal document management guide sets  out the conditions according to which documents  need to be registered, filed and saved using the  Agency’s registration and filing systems. A special,  intranet-based tool was developed to capture the  information needed to register and retrieve docu- ments. In addition, an incoming and outgoing mail  procedure was developed.  As regards the financial and administrative workflows,  ENISA adopted in January 2015 a new application, ‘Pa- perless’, which routes documents to staff involved in  preparation, review and approval of all kinds of work  related documents and transactions. All financial and  administrative workflows are well documented and all  supporting documents are uploaded and stored in ‘Pa- perless’ including changes and comments of workflow  actors. Approved workflows are permanently stored  and an appropriate audit trail is produced.  The application ‘Paperless’ was a breakthrough in  ENISA day-to-day operations, as it heavily contributed  to streamlining processes, reducing paper circulation  (green office), reducing courier costs between the two  offices (Athens and Heraklion), reducing time needed  for repetitive administrative tasks and significantly  reducing archive space and management.  3.2.12 Information and communication  (ICS 12)  Internal communication measures and practices are in  place for sharing information and monitoring activities.  These include regular Management Team meetings  during which issues relevant to performance, audit  results and financial information are discussed, and ac- tions are decided upon and assigned. Regular financial  reporting is available to all staff on ENISA’s intranet. All  engagements in new projects are discussed during the  implementation of the Annual Work Programme and  decisions are documented and communicated.  An External Communication Strategy is in place.  ICT security policies are in place for main systems  and sub-systems, and described in procedures and  policies. Internal communication is also supported  through use of the intranet and through weekly staff  meetings within units. External communication and  dissemination procedures must be further developed  and communicated to staff accordingly.  The weekly Staff Meeting is used as platform of  communication between all departments. Every week,  staff members can share their work with the rest of  the Agency.  3.2.13 Accounting and Financial Reporting  (ICS 13)  All finance and accounting procedures are document- ed in the Internal Control Manual of the Agency. The  preparation, implementation, monitoring and reporting  on budget implementation is centralised in the Fi- nance, Accounting and Procurement Section, within the  Administration and Support Department. The European  Commission’s budget and accounting management sys- tem, ABAC, is the main tool used for financial manage- ment. It is compliant with applicable financial regulatory  frameworks. The ABAC Assets module is used for the  management of ENISA’s inventory. Financial manage- ment information produced by the Agency, including  financial information provided in the Annual Activity  Report, complies with applicable financial and account- ing rules.  3.2.14 Evaluation of activities (ICS 14)  Key performance indicators are used in order to  measure the performance and assess the impact of  the Agency’s projects as provided for in its Annual  Work Programmes.  The General Report and the Annual Activity Report are  the tools used by the Agency to report on performance  and impact. The feedback of relevant stakeholders is  taken into account.  3.2.15 Assessment of internal control  systems (ICS 15)  Each year, ENISA’s management assesses the compli- ance of annual activities and performance with the  internal control systems in place, as part of preparation  of the Annual Activity Report.  3.2.16 Internal Audit Capability (ICS 16)  The Head of the Administration and Support Depart- ment assumes the Internal Control Coordination (ICC)  function. He is responsible for implementing internal  control systems in the Agency and liaising with the IAS of  the European Commission. As the Agency lacks human  resources, the role of Internal Audit Capability (IAC) can- not be performed. Since 2005, the Agency has relied on  the IAS to carry out internal audits. The IAS plays a key  role in auditing bodies of the European Union.  Internal Control tasks performed in ENISA include 100 %  of ex ante verifications, annual ex post controls, hierar- chical controls and outsourced engagements, coordinat- ed by the ICC.  In line with the Strategic Audit Plan 2014-2016, in 2014  the Internal Audit Service (IAS) carried out a control ‘on  the spot’. Out of 25 open recommendations in 2014,  the Agency has only 1 remaining open which was closed  in February 2015. The role of ICC was reinforced in  order to comply with all the recommendations issued  by the IAS and ECA.  Concerning the overall state of the internal control  system, generally the Agency complies with the three  assessment criteria for effectiveness: (1) staff that  have the requisite knowledge and skills; (2) systems  and procedures designed and implemented to man- age the key risks effectively; and (3) no instances of  ineffective controls that have exposed the Agency to  substantial risk.  Enhancing the effectiveness of the Agency’s control  arrangements is an ongoing effort, as part of the  continuous improvement of management procedures.  It includes taking into account any control weaknesses  reported and exceptions recorded.  As regards the financial and  administrative workflows,  ENISA adopted in January  2015 a new application,  ‘Paperless’, which routes  documents to staff involved  in preparation, review and  approval of all kinds of  work related documents  and transactions.  SECTION IV. MANAGEMENT ASSURANCE  4.1 REVIEW OF THE ELEMENTS  SUPPORTING ASSURANCE  The risk framework is used as a common means of  classifying and communicating risk across the Agency.  It provides a common understanding and language  regarding ‘risk’, as well a structure for the assessment,  reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk framework  defines the categories, sub-categories and business  risks applicable at the organisational level, for ENISA as  a whole. It includes:  risk categories and sub-categories;  risks specific to each category (business risks);  risk definition.  Assessment by management:  The Agency’s operations are channelled through  the following activity areas that belong to administra- tive functions:  own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with the annual work programme in terms of  operational and administrative activities;  contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be in-sourced  by the Agency. External agents are appointed either  through a procurement procedure or through a call  for expressions of interest for funding related to the  co-organisation of events. Alternatively, in the case  of working group members, they may be chosen by  means of a selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its adminis- trative activities, the Agency has carried out the activi- ties presented in the table on the next page.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 61  IV.

Number of transactions as compared to number  of erroneous transactions.  4.2 EXCEPTIONS  In 2015, the Agency recorded 21 exceptions. Only 3 are  with high materiality. For one of these cases, the root  of the problem was the late opening of the financial  tool ABAC and one case is regarding the Greek Author- ities for the payment of the rent of the Athens building  (delay in receiving the funds from the Greek Authorities  to pay the rent leaded to an a posteriori commitment).  The last one concerned an error of encoding in ABAC  which was spotted by the Financial Verifying Agent. By  the time that the workflow was redone the commit- ment had become a posteriori.  The information reported in Parts 2 and 3 stems from  the results of auditing by management and auditors.  The results are contained in the reports listed. These  reports result from a systematic analysis of the evidence  available. This approach provides sufficient guarantees  as to the completeness and reliability of the informa- tion reported, and results in complete coverage of the  budget delegated to the Executive Director of ENISA.

MATERIALITY CRITERIA  ENISA is not using any materiality criteria. Indeed 100 %  of the financial transactions are submitted to the ex  ante control (verification before the authorisation).  In order to further strengthen the controls, ENISA  executes a yearly ex post control exercise (verification  after authorisation).  The exercise methodology for sample selection is  a judgmental (non-statistical) method designed to  demonstrate bias in the selection of transactions for  ex post control taking into account the potential for  error identified by the Agency, either through the value  of the transaction, the initiating procedure used and  the Agency’s risk assessment, their documentation or  through discussion.  D1 STAGE 1: PROCUREMENT  ANNEX D. INTERNAL CONTROL  TEMPLATES FOR BUDGET  IMPLEMENTATION (ICT)  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2015 81  D.1.1 Planning  Main control objectives: Effectiveness, efficiency and economy. Compliance (legality and regularity).

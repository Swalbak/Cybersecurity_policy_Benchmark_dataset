Under Microsoft’s Windows lifecycle policy, support for Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Windows Server varies  depending on the release (e.g. Microsoft Windows 10), edition (e.g. Enterprise) and version (e.g. 22H2) of the operating  system being used. Following the expiration of the specified servicing timeline, organisations will no longer receive  patches for security vulnerabilities identified in these products. Subsequently, adversaries may target unpatched  security vulnerabilities on workstations or servers running unsupported versions of Microsoft Windows or Microsoft  Windows Server.  Organisations using unsupported versions of Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows Server should upgrade to  supported versions to continue receiving patches for security vulnerabilities, while also potentially benefiting from  security improvements in newer operating system versions. Organisations yet to upgrade to supported versions of  Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Windows Server should review their risk assessments and begin planning for the  implementation of mitigation strategies to reduce their risk exposure – noting there will still be an overall increase in  risk exposure until such a time that unsupported versions are upgraded to supported versions.  The advice in this publication is intended for organisations unable to upgrade unsupported versions of Microsoft  Windows or Microsoft Windows Server on workstations or servers, herein referred to as unsupported workstations or  servers.  Mitigation strategies for unsupported  workstations or servers  Organisations continuing to operate unsupported workstations or servers beyond their specified servicing timeline  should implement the following mitigation strategies:   Implement application control, such as Microsoft’s AppLocker. Application control, when implemented  appropriately, can assist in preventing malicious code execution and network propagation attempts by an  adversary.   For unsupported native applications, either upgrade to supported versions or, if this is not possible, consider  removing the application or using alternative applications to achieve similar business functionality. Each  unsupported application upgraded, removed or replaced with a vendor-supported alternative generally reduces  the attack surface of workstations and servers, and can assist in preventing malicious code execution.  End of Support for  Microsoft Windows and  Microsoft Windows Server  First published: November 2019  Last updated: January 2023  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/lifecycle/faq/windows  2   Ensure that privileged account credentials are not entered into unsupported workstations or servers (e.g. to  administer applications, workstations or servers) as they will be at higher risk of capture by an adversary. Instead,  a supported workstation or server should be used for system administration activities.   If supported, implement Microsoft's Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). Implementing EMET for  applications that commonly interact with data from untrusted sources can reduce the risk of successful malicious  code execution as well as assisting in the identification of such attempts.   Implement a third party software-based application firewall that performs both inbound and outbound filtering of  network traffic. A software-based application firewall can assist in detecting and preventing malicious code  execution, network propagation and data exfiltration by an adversary.   Apply basic hardening, where possible, to operating systems, applications and user accounts. Disabling unneeded  functionality or common intrusion vectors such as AutoRun, SMB and NetBlOS services, can assist in preventing  malicious code execution and network propagation by an adversary.   Ensure antivirus applications continue to be supported by vendors. If support ceases from a vendor, switch to an  alternative vendor that continues to offer support. The use of antivirus applications can assist in detecting and  preventing malicious code execution.  In addition to the above mitigation strategies, a number of mitigation strategies can be implemented to reduce the  likelihood of malicious code reaching unsupported workstations or servers in the first place. These include:   Implement automated dynamic analysis of email and web content in a sandbox to detect suspicious behaviour. By  analysing data from untrusted sources for suspicious activity upon simulated user interaction, malicious code can  be identified and blocked from reaching unsupported workstations or servers.   Implement email and web content filtering of incoming and outgoing data to only allow approved file types. By  controlling the types of data that reach unsupported workstations or servers, organisations can reduce the  likelihood of malicious code execution as well as identify the source of such attempts.   Prevent users from connecting removable media and other devices to unsupported workstations or servers as  they are more susceptible to exploitation. Instead, data transfers to unsupported workstations or servers should  be controlled via an organisation's ICT service desk to reduce the likelihood of malicious code execution and data  exfiltration.   Isolate unsupported workstations or servers from other workstations, servers and non-essential network  resources. If possible, consider running an unsupported workstation or server within its own virtual machine that  can only communicate with a host running a supported operating system. This can reduce the risk of an adversary  using a compromised unsupported workstation or server to propagate throughout a network and access other  workstations, servers or network resources.   Prevent unsupported workstations or servers from directly accessing, and being directly accessible from, the  internet. Restricting access for unsupported workstations or servers to and from the internet can reduce the risk  of them being directly compromised by an adversary.  Additional considerations  Independent of how unsupported workstations and servers are operated by organisations, organisations should  implement a robust centralised logging and auditing framework to capture and analyse both computer, server and  network-based events. In doing so, an appropriate auditing framework within an organisation can assist in identifying  individual workstations or servers that may have been compromised, as well as helping to tailor incident response  measures to remove infected workstations or servers from an organisation's network.  Information on implementing a robust centralised logging and auditing framework can be found in the Australian Cyber  Security Centre’s Windows Event Logging and Forwarding  publication.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/maintaining-devices-and-systems/system-hardening-and-administration/system-monitoring/windows-event-logging-and-forwarding  3  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats.

I am really impressed by the collection  of different sector actors represented in this event today and I would like to thank Europol and the European  Institute of Public Administrations for giving me the chance to address you.  The underlying point of today’s event is that everything is becoming digital, from cars to cities to services to  the whole economy. Network infrastructure, available anywhere and at any time, is transporting a huge  volume of information. An obvious and immediate conclusion would thus be that the integrity of this  information is crucial to the functioning of this economy.  So let's start with this point.  Continuous growth of e-commerce  It is often stated that we depend increasingly on trustworthy network services.  For example in 2014, about 13% of all retail trade in the UK was online; for 2016, retail researchers estimate  that this share will grow by more than 30%. This will be good for 71 bn Euros. For Germany the numbers are  slightly lower (10% in 2014 and 13.5 expected for 2016)1.1 But in essence, for a market that depends on  habits of people this growth rates are tremendous.  While it is harder to find numbers for B2B, my gut feeling says that an even bigger share of B2B transactions  are carried out online or is at least supported by electronic communication – just try to remember when it  was the last time that you selected a product from a paper catalogue and sent a letter to order it for your  work. The younger among this audience might not even understand this question.  As a matter of fact an increasing part of our everyday life is moving online: e-Governance, e-health, and  social networks. Most evident here is the change in the media sector. Most young people use the internet  as news, communications and entertainment source - printed newspapers market share is constantly  declining. For example, quite recently the newspaper The Independent announced its last printed issue on  26 March 2016. It is likely that this was only the first very prominent victim of the change.  Crime also goes online  So it is a fact.  We do depend increasingly on trustworthy network services for business and social life. Unfortunately also  criminals “go digital”. Already in 2012 12% of internet users reported that they experienced online fraud,  and 8% have fallen victim to identity theft2. I am quite sure that our host can confirm that this issue did not  disappear in the last 4 years.  And, vulnerable digital services are not only a risk for the individual users; vulnerable services might also  lead to a general decline of the overall trust in information technology and the services offered. However,  the European Digital Agenda points out that trust in information technology is of uttermost importance for  our economy. This is echoed in the recently published NIS Directive that is aiming to “allow[..] the public and  private sector to trust digital networks' services at national and EU level. By setting incentives to foster  1 http://www.retailresearch.org/onlineretailing.php  2 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-12-751_en.htm?locale=en  Privacy in the Digital Age of Encryption and Anonymity Online  03  investments, transparency and user awareness, the strategy will boost competitiveness, growth and jobs in  the EU.”  In other words: industry needs to be encouraged to provide trust trustworthy services. They need to be  asked to implement up to date technical protection measures. It is our belief that in this, cryptography  plays a key role.  Is there a role for cryptography?  Cryptography is the essential tool to implement secrecy and integrity for electronic communication. It  provides for electronic communication is the equivalent of the letter cover, seal and rubber stamp in the  brick and mortar world. Hence, it is essential to protect IT services from criminal activities. However, the use  of cryptography might also make law enforcement’s investigations on crimes harder. For example, an  investigator might have difficulties to intercept the communication of suspects. In such a scenario ‘it is only  natural’ that under clear rules, law enforcement should be able to intercept suspicious communication. (As  much as they can search a suspicious flat). However, it turns out that this is easier said than done.  Limited key size  Some legislators have proposed to limit the key size to facilitate law enforcement. This has been introduced  under the assumption that these capabilities are used only for legitimate cause, and that criminal or terrorist  organizations do not have access to the technology that would be necessary for abuse.  Now, this assumption might have been correct at the time, but technology moved much faster than expected  and today, with computing power as a service and a tremendous drop in costs, they do not hold anymore.  Allow me here a short advertisement block: Later today there will be a panel on “Lawful Access and Security:  A Transatlantic Perspective” organized by the EastWest Institute where I will comment on the issue of key  sizes a bit more in detail.  Key escrow or recovery / back doors  Others proposed key escrow or recovery. Here, neither algorithms nor key sizes are limited. Instead, the  investigator gets a (technical or organizational) mechanism provided to get the private key of the suspect.  Here, key recovery means being able to reconstruct the key from the encrypted message itself, while key  escrow means keeping a securely stored copy of that key. Back doors on the other hand, allow the  investigator to intercept the communication without the knowledge of a key.  To my knowledge, ready to use implementations of these schemes do not exist. On the one hand, the  deployment of such systems would imply fundamental changes of the telecommunication infrastructure.  The design and development of such systems would require the involvement of several fields of expertise,  namely cryptography, personal data protection and law enforcement.  My fear would be that such systems increase the complexity of protocols, which would in turn increase the  attack surface, which than even might attract criminals; just imagine criminals or terrorist that got access to  private keys or a law enforcement backdoor. Moreover, in the brick and mortar world, we do not deposit  the key of our front door at the local police station; there is a process to require unlocking doors which only  starts after crime investigations have started.  On the other hand, it will be an economic burden to software and service providers in our legislation.  Creating an economic disadvantage for our industries, since providers outside of our legislative scope will  be able to deliver more secure services at a lower cost.  Privacy in the Digital Age of Encryption and Anonymity Online  04  But the worst for law enforcement might be my last consideration: anyone who obtains a private key, can  perfectly impersonate the legitimate key owner. This might be a risk to the quality of evidence that is  gathered by these means.  Bypassing  But let us set aside the considerations above, in the end this all is still a matter of balance.  Society might accept the costs for industry, the risks of abuse, etc. There is a more fundamental problem  with the limitation of the use of strong cryptographic tools, namely, criminals can and, by the very nature of  criminals, will easily bypass all this rules, and it is hard to detect if they do so.  The research community in the field has a long tradition of creating open access and open source crypto  tools; a vast amount of tools is readily free available. Furthermore, the algorithms are publically available  and well documented; hence, an average skilled programmer could implement them (and it would be naïve  to assume, that criminals are any less intelligent than honest people.)  This leads to the following challenge: without contextual information, such as the deployed algorithm, it is  complicated to distinguish a cryptogram from a malformed message that contains only random noise. So a  ban on end-to-end encryption would pose the following difficulty for the potential investigator: How to  prove that a suspect has used such a forbidden technology?  Moreover, even if the use of cryptography could be easily detected, malicious users have access to a vast  body of steganographic protocols, that is to say protocols that allow the user to put a hidden message in a  cover media such as a picture. An investigator will usually not have enough information about the potential  steganogram to discover its mere existence, let alone to decrypt the content.  To conclude  We need cryptography as the electronic equivalent of the letter cover, the seal or rubber stamp, and  signature. These electronic tools are necessary to protect our assets in a highly computerized world.  However, these are dual-use technologies. Any advance in cryptography, will cause new problems for crime  investigation.  1) Key escrow and recovery is theoretically possible. But, it would need a fundamental change of our  communication infrastructure and joint development efforts of many experts.  2) The resulting infrastructure would be more complex, making it more vulnerable to attacks and less  resilient to failures. Future advances in cryptology and computing power might turn any law enforcement  mechanism into a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminal and terroristic organizations.  3) The economic impact of such mechanisms might be undesirable.  4) For individuals, it would be rather simple to bypass these systems (unnoticeable for law enforcement).  One more thing, all the above mentioned issues are mere examples of currently widely used protection  measures; emerging privacy enhancing technologies might introduce even more challenges. To overcome  these issues, ENISA is inviting the European Commission as well as Member States and competent EU bodies  to increase their efforts in performing further R&D.  Concerning all what was said above, my advice only can be: do not weaken encryption on purpose; do not  inhibit the use of tools for data protection and privacy: promote secure IT.

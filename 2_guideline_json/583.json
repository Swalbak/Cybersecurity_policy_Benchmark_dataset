The electronic  communications networks and services allow citizens, businesses, governments and organisations to  communicate and exchange information and to offer and consume online services. Article 13a of the  EU’s electronic communications Framework directive, which was implemented across the EU in  2011, asks EU Member States to ensure the security and resilience of public electronic  communications networks and services.  As part of the implementation of Article 13a, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in the EU  collect reports about incidents with a significant impact on the electronic communications networks  and services. Yearly, ENISA publishes an annual report which summarizes these incident reports and  provides an aggregate analysis of major outages. As can be seen in the ENISA annual report about  major incidents, power cuts are a dominant cause of severe network and service outages in the EU’s  electronic communications sector.  In this report, we study these incidents in more detail and we make recommendations to NRAs and  electronic communications service providers (providers) and to some extent also to actors in the  energy sector as well as civil protection authorities. Our recommendations are not about preventing  power failures in the power supply sector, but they are aimed at improving the electronic  communications sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts.  ENISA conducted an online survey and interviews about how power cuts are handled in the  electronic communications sector. We found that:   A majority of EU Member States have implemented more general resilience policies through  legislation, whereas a minority of the Member States have implemented policies that are  directly linked to resilience against power cuts.   A majority of the NRAs do not and may even lack suitable input to perform risk assessments  that include power cuts. It is also noted that the national use of state funding and public- private partnerships to address power cut resilience are exceptions rather than the norm  within the EU.   Resilience against power cuts is lower in access networks closer to customers than for  network elements that carry traffic for a large number of customers. Mobile networks tend  to be more vulnerable to power cuts compared to fixed networks.   A majority of NRAs believe that current protection levels are not adequate and they would  like to see power cut resilience to become a market differentiating factor for network and  providers.   A review of incident reports from 2011 and 2012 shows that a significant number of power  cuts led to more severe service disruptions than what would have been the case had existing  protection measures worked as intended.   A large number of energy sector regulators within Europe have adopted regulatory  instruments to maintain or improve continuity of supply in the energy sector, balancing  other regulations aiming at increasing competition and market efficiency.   In some countries, the energy sector has taken significant steps in defining socio- economically acceptable quality of service levels, whereas in some countries the providers  face the fact that there are no special contractual agreements with the power companies  containing SLA-based requirements.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  v   Cooperation and information exchange can be improved within the electronic  communications sector and with the energy sector and civil protection authorities, and the  room for improvement is even more significant for cross-sector restoration efforts.   Prioritization schemes to give assets within the electronic communications sector  preferential treatment in the event of more significant power cuts, are not yet widespread in  the EU.  We also make 8 recommendations mainly to NRAs and providers within the electronic  communications sector, and in some recommendations we also address the energy sector and civil  protection authorities. The recommendations describe steps which could be taken to reduce the risk  of network and service outages caused by power failures, and in this way improve the electronic  communications sector’s ability to handle disruptions and outages caused by power supply failures.  Summarizing the recommendations:  1. NRAs should analyse the frequency and impact of network and service outages caused by  power cuts.  2. NRAs should liaise with providers, energy regulators and other NRAs to collect good  practices that could be used to increase resilience against power cuts. These good practices  should be considered as part of a cost-benefit analysis (recommendation 3).  3. NRAs should perform, in cooperation with energy regulators and civil protection authorities,  a cost-benefit analysis, where societal costs and benefits are evaluated, to determine what is  reasonable to expect from different actors regarding power cut resilience measures.  4. Providers should regularly perform checks of existing protection measures, such as checks of  UPS systems and batteries, and running facilities with fixed and transportable power  generators at full load, to avoid and mitigate the impact of network and service outages  from shorter and medium duration power cuts.  5. NRAs should in their follow up of major network and service outages caused by power cuts  ensure that affected providers, based on lessons learned, systematically develop their  protection measures to avoid and mitigate the impact of network and service outages from  shorter and medium duration power cuts.  6. NRAs should act to establish a strategy to promote cooperation and mutual aid agreements  on joint service restoration after severe power cuts which can include cross-sector exercises.  7. NRAs should consider a priority scheme that would give preferential treatment within the  electronic communications sector and decrease service restoration times under exceptional  circumstances.  8. NRAs, providers, actors in the energy sector, civil protection authorities and other societal  functions should cooperate to establish information exchange mechanisms. These  mechanisms should enable an efficient exchange of situational awareness information,  forecasts of restoration times and other information that is essential for the efficient  restoration after severe power cuts.  More details can be found in the body of this report. We look forward to working with the NRAs and  providers to mitigate the impact of network and security incidents caused by power supply failures.  We encourage the different actors to find ways to improve information-sharing about failures and  outages, particularly between the energy sector and the electronic communications sector.

Article 13a addresses security and integrity of public electronic communications networks and  services. The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public  electronic communications networks and services (providers).  Among other things, Article 13a states that:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures  to guarantee security and integrity of their networks   Providers must report to competent national authorities about significant breaches of  security or integrity that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services   National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad  when necessary, for example in case of incidents with cross-border impact   Annually, NRAs should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European Commission  (EC) about the incidents  ENISA started in 2010 an expert group with NRAs from all the Member States, to implement Article  13a and to address security and resilience of electronic communications in general.  Background  ENISA has, based on incident reports sent from NRAs to ENISA and the European Commission under  Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), analysed incidents on an aggregated level  and published two reports, Annual Incident Reports 2011 and Annual Incident Reports 2012. In these  reports, ENISA provides an analysis of the received incident reports, dealing with severe disruptions  in public electronic communications networks or services in the EU.  Examples of public electronic  communications services are fixed and mobile telephony and fixed and mobile internet access. The  diagram below shows the causes of the reported incidents in falling order:  Figure 1: Detailed causes (percentages per service).  (2011)  (2012)  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  2  The diagram below shows the average impact per cause per reported incident from 2012. The  impact is calculated as affected user connections times the duration of the incidents in hours.  Figure 2: Average impact in user-hours (in thousands) from causes per incident.  From the analysis, ENISA has drawn the following conclusions, which have a direct or indirect link to  power supply dependencies within the electronic communications sector:   Power cuts were in 2011 identified as the second most common cause of incidents.   During 2012, power cuts were the fourth most common cause.   Power cuts caused major impact in 2012 in terms of user-hours lost per incident.   During 2012, incidents caused by natural phenomena, mainly storms and heavy snowfall,  were the two root causes that produced the longest incidents averaging to 36 hours.   During 2011, natural phenomena gave rise to incidents that lasted 45 hours on average.   Natural phenomena have a major impact on the power supply to providers within the  electronic communications sector.  Goal  The goal of this report is to   analyse the dependency of the electronic communications sector on power supply, and to   issue recommendations on:  o measures to reduce the frequency of network disruptions and outages caused by  disruptions in the power supply sector, and  o measures that improve the ability for the electronic communications sector to  handle disruptions caused by power supply failures.  The analysis and findings cover three major perspectives:   regulatory requirements in both the electronic communications and utilities domain,   commercial drivers and   public sector initiatives.  Target audience  The target for this report are mainly experts working at NRAs and ministries, who are dealing with  security and resilience within the electronic communications sector, as well as experts working at  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  3  providers of public electronic communications networks and services, particularly experts involved  with security, resilience, business continuity and disaster recovery. Also energy regulators, energy  distributors, fuel providers, transport companies and civil protection authorities are addressed in  this report.  Methodology  The primary sources of information are results from desk top research activities, a web survey  among experts from NRAs across the EU1, and interviews with experts from six providers and two  NRAs. Specific information on national conditions is derived from desk top research activities and  should not be attributed to statements made by individual NRAs or providers.  Structure of this document  The rest of this document is structured as follows. Sections 2 to 5 collect information covering four  principal domains:   the electronic communications policy domain that through legislation, procedures, state  funding or public-private partnerships influences how well the sector can withstand and act  to minimise the negative impact of power cuts;   the electronic communications domain grouping together providers, that are directly  responsible for the choice and implementation of resilience and recovery mechanisms and  procedures, and their customers;   the utility domain in which energy distributors, field technicians, fuel providers and  transport companies act to provide vital services to assets and actors within the electronic  communications sector;   the utilities policy domain that groups together actors that through legislation, procedures  or other means excerpt influence over the utility domain.  Section 6 collects proposals from providers and NRAs on possible measures to improve resilience  against power cuts.  In section 2 to 6, 16 findings are extracted. Each finding, in the form of an observation of an existing  condition that has, or can have a positive or negative impact on the electronic communications  sector’s ability to withstand and/or respond to power cuts, is presented in tabular format:  Short description of the finding  Further text that gives background information or added perspective to the finding.  Section 7 couples the findings made in sections 2 to 6 to a description of the activities that can be  used to improve matters together with the parties that are or would be affected by establishing an  improvement. The report concludes in section 8 with a set of recommendations to identified actors  that individually and collectively can improve the electronic communications sector’s ability to  withstand and respond to power supply failures.  1  The 23 NRAs who responded to the survey are listed in annex A to this document.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  4  2 The electronic communications policy domain  Actors within the electronic communications domain are influenced by policies that bind them to  uphold a certain level of reliability in the provision and maintenance of networks and services. At the  EU level, article 13a states that providers of public electronic communications networks and services  should take measures to guarantee security and integrity of their networks. This article is then  complemented by national legislation that may provide further clarifications of this obligation and  possibly also national additions. In addition, the policy domain can also influence the electronic  communications sector through state investments and public-private partnerships.  This section couples legislation, state investments and public-private partnerships to how well  electronic communications networks can withstand and recover from power cuts.  2.1 Legislation regarding resilience against power cuts  We have asked NRAs to provide information about national policies for electronic communications  providers regarding resilience against power cuts, hereafter called power cut resilience2. The  responses, shown in table 1 below, indicate that while a clear majority have implemented general  resilience policies, less than half of these Member States have adopted policies that are directly  linked to power cut resilience.  Ssdfsdf Yes No Other3  Existence of general resilience policies 174 5 1  Existence of power cut resilience policies  6 13 4  Table 1: Overview of the existence of general and specific power cut resilience policies among the 23 NRAs that have  responded to ENISA’s web survey.  One of the NRAs pointed to the existence of a general legal requirement obliging providers to supply  a security concept to the NRA, which should include provisions taken to withstand or recover from  power supply failures. The law does not specify detailed requirements regarding emergency power  supply.  Another NRA pointed to the existence of a national electronic communications act that was recently  modified to contain provisions that providers are obliged to provide electronic communications  services with appropriate security for end users in times of peace, during crises and even in times of  war. The NRA may decide that a service provider should take action to provide an appropriate level  of security and preparedness. Detailed secondary legislation classifies sites into four classes  2  The term power cut resilience measures is used as a term for measures to reduce the risk for disruptions and  outages caused by disruptions in the power supply, and measures that improves the ability for the electronic  communications sector to handle disruptions caused by power supply failures. The level of protection that  these measures give is denoted as the electronic communications sector’s resilience against power cuts.  3  The term Other is here and throughout the report used to indicate the number of respondents that have  either refrained from providing an answer or have answered Unknown. In cases where the number of  respondents is less than the 23 NRAs that have provided some form of information to ENISA, the remaining  respondents occupy this Other category. If the number of replies that are provided sum up to less than 23, the  remaining answers were in the Other category.  4  The number represents here and throughout the report the number of answers for this particular option in  the web survey to the NRAs.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  5  depending on the network equipment that is stored on the site. For class A and B sites, backup  power must be sufficient for a minimum of three days. Two days of backup power is needed for class  C sites and there are no requirements for class D sites. There must also be documented operating  and maintenance routines which include routines for handling transport of fuel.  A third example is an EU Member State where a proposition for a specific decision on minimum  requirements for power backup on mobile networks has been issued to all four mobile network  providers in the Member State. The proposed decision states that the mobile networks should still  provide services (both speech and data) at least six hours after a cut in primary power. The network  should provide services with outdoor coverage in the areas where people live and work as well as all  main roads in the Member State. The network owners would not receive any compensation for this  resilience measure. The decision is meant to give the public some hours to communicate to prepare  for a major and long-lasting loss of power.  Example 1) Resilience related legislation in Finland  The Finnish Communication Market Act contains general provisions that are related to resilience  aspects but do not point to a set of resilience increasing measures that each operator has to  take, instead pointing to clarifications in secondary legislation, in ordinances. At present, there  are three principal ordinances that have a direct link to resilience:   Regulation 47 on information security management of telecommunications operators  that principally concerns the need for information security control documentation, risk  management practices and information security measures.   Regulation 54 on resilience of communications networks and services designed to ensure  the reliability of communications networks and services, protection of privacy and  information security under normal circumstances, in fault situations in normal  circumstances and in a state of emergency.   Regulation 57 on the maintenance of communications networks and communications  services, procedures and notifications in the event of faults and disturbances.  Of these three regulations, Regulation 54 has the most direct link to power cut resilience. Within  the regulation, components within electronic communications networks are assigned a priority  based on a rating where the geographical area and the number of end users are the two  principal factors that determine the rating. The regulation then assigns a set of resilience  increasing measures based on the rating in a number of areas:   hardware redundancy, reserve routes and cooling systems,   power supply including planning and monitoring aspects,   physical protection measures.  As one example, the regulation stipulates that GSM base stations must have a back-up time of  the emergency power supply of at least three hours, a time that is extended to six hours due to  remote location, difficult terrain conditions and expected weather conditions.  Few NRAs have implemented legislation related to power cut resilience  The motivation to include or not include specific power cut resilience measures can vary between  Member States as the threat environment, in the form of likelihood for and characteristics of  power cuts can be expected to vary. The survey does not provide specific information that can  couple the existence of such policies to results from risk assessments. Many Member States  consider power cut resilience to be a market rather than a regulatory issue (cf. section 2.3).  https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Viestintavirasto47C2009M_EN.pdf https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Viestintavirasto54A2012M_EN.pdf https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Viestintavirasto57A2012M_EN.pdf  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  6  2.2 Risk assessments by NRAs  We asked if NRAs have a structured risk assessment process to analyse to which extent certain  events and conditions can impact electronic communications networks and services. A large  majority, as indicated in table 2, of the NRAs do not perform, compile or distribute risk assessments  that cover power cut resilience aspects.  Ssdfsdf Yes No Other  NRAs performing risk assessments including power  cut resilience  5 17 1  Table 2: The total number of NRAs that perform risk assessment over the electronic communications sector and has a  direct bearing on power cut resilience.  One NRA performing risk assessments regarding power cuts looks back on the previous 14 months  and ranks power cuts just below hardware and software issues as the main cause for incidents.  One NRA subdivides power cuts into categories depending on the geographical area and duration of  the power cut. Storms and other weather related incidents that cause power cuts are treated as part  of one such category. Both regional power cuts of medium duration, with part of a day as an  example, and weather related power cuts are considered as medium risks which is the third highest  level. Several other threats are assigned to the same risk level and software induced errors are  assigned to a higher risk level.  One NRA mentioned they have no access to statistics on power cuts.  Most NRAs do not perform risk assessments which include the risks for network and service  outages due to power cuts  Risk assessments that include risks for network and service outages due to power cuts, where  different types of power cuts and their potential technical and societal consequences are assessed,  can be regarded as a platform from which various actions, for example the introduction of policies  or state funding of resilience increasing measures, can be evaluated.  2.3 State funding and public-private partnerships  Most NRAs indicate that resilience related legislation is in place. Any form of measures that goes  beyond this legally mandated level of resilience can be complemented by market driven  investments, by state funding or through public-private partnerships5. Of the 23 NRAs that  responded to the survey, only four reported that state funding or public-private partnerships had  been used to introduce power cut resilience increasing measures. Examples of the measures that  have been taken in this regard are principally state funded procurements of both stationary and  transportable, fuel-powered generators.  Other NRAs motivate the general lack of state funding activities or public-private partnerships with  statements that reflect a general lack of need or that market forces should be sufficient motivation  for providers to make necessary investments.  5  Market driven aspects related to resilience against power cuts is discussed in section 3.4.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  7  Example 2) State funding – a national example  State funding, in the order of 2.5 million Euros annually over the last decade, has been used in  one EU Member State to improve network resilience. Using this funding, providers have invested  in transportable power generators, stationary power generators and also batteries for spare  telecom exchanges for fixed networks.6  State funding and public-private partnerships that concern power cut resilience are rare  The use of state funding and public-private partnerships to address power cut resilience is the  exception rather than the norm within the EU. There can be several reasons for this disparity, for  example differences in policies, national market conditions and threat environment with respect to  the frequency and duration of power cuts.  6  Government funding has for example paid for some spare parts that service providers keep in stock, for  example a fixed telephony exchange.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  8  3 The electronic communications domain  This section focuses on the measures for resilience taken by providers. We give an overview of:   current risk assessments and protection measures that have been implemented to increase  power cut resilience,   aspects that influence the restoration process after a power cut building on operational  experiences and exercises,   commercial aspects regarding power cut resilience including both the service provider and  customer perspectives, and   a characterisation of power cuts based on incident reports from 2011 and 2012.  The major findings in the section are carried over to (a) section 6.2, where possible actions to  address some of the challenges within the electronic communications sector are analysed, and (b) to  the recommendations that conclude the report in section 8.  3.1 Risk assessments by service providers  The interviews with providers indicate that risk assessment is a well-established practice. The  following three examples give an overview of these practices based on interviews with selected  providers.  Example 3) Risk assessment – a service provider perspective  The service provider performs regular risk management activities based on established routines.  These activities are coordinated by a risk management steering committee that influences all  aspects of the provider’s operations. As part of risk management practices, identified risks are  associated with actions. Power cuts have not been identified as an individual threat: most power  cuts are said to have only minor impact on services and more significant power disruptions are  often associated with natural disasters (for example storms and earthquakes). Risk assessments  for such extraordinary events do not treat power cuts as an individual threat.  The provider considers several other threats as coupled to risk levels greater than what is  considered for power cuts. Examples of such more severe threats are natural disasters, cyber- attacks, civil works and copper thefts.  Example 4) Risk assessments and business continuity planning – a service provider perspective  The provider has an active risk management process accompanied by business continuity and  disaster recovery plans. As part of this risk management process, different types of threats are  evaluated, which influence the provider’s risk mitigation activities. The risk level that has been  associated with power cuts is coupled to two factors: likelihood and consequence. Power cuts are  here deemed to the one of the most common causes of service disruptions so the threat is  associated with a high probability. The loss of client side connections is here regarded as the  most common source of service disruptions.  However, consequences are often local (single site or limited number of customer sites) so that  the overall risk that has been assigned is lower than for several other threats. Two examples of  more severe threats are equipment failures and damage to cables (road works, diggers, etc.). The  probability for power cuts varies within the nation. A majority of the provider’s key assets are  placed in a part that is rarely affected by power cuts compared to other, more exposed areas.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  9  Example 5) Risk assessment – a service provider perspective  The provider has established procedures for performing risk assessments that have been in place  for several years. These cover individual network components, sites and geographical areas. The  risk assessments that are performed are tailored so that the variability of threats governs the  interval between assessments. For example, in areas where there is generally more variability  (over time) in power cuts, risk assessments regarding this aspect would be performed more  regularly than in areas where there is more stability.  Power cuts is in many regions are not considered as a major threat, and is often associated with  a risk level outside the top 5 risks.  In some regions, principally regions undergoing changes and  with more frequent power cuts, the risk level can conceivably motivate a top 5-ranking.  Example 6) Risk assessment – a service provider perspective  The service provider has an established Business Continuity Management program (BCM). Within  this BCM program, there is a phase devoted to business impact analysis and risk assessment  where assets and respective risks are identified and categorized, and associated with appropriate  protection strategies/measures. The provider differentiates between different types of power  cuts:   external power cuts or disturbances (from the external supplier) or   internal power cuts that might be caused by maintenance activities, upgrades or similar.  The risk level that is assigned to power cuts is different for the two types and also depends on the  network component (access network or core network).  In general, the risk is considered as low in  the core network as protection mechanisms will give adequate protection for a wide range of  external power cuts. The main issues are failures to UPS systems and -48V systems, fuel powered  generators and other backup systems. Such issues are very important from an operational  viewpoint as the consequences can be significant.  In access networks, the probability that a power cut leads to service disruptions is higher (more  network elements with a lower protection level than core network elements) but the effects are  also smaller.  Risks associated with power cuts is not always considered a significant threat by providers  Even though the interviews that have been performed as part of this study do not constitute a  sufficiently broad selection of providers, it can be noted that power cuts are typically not  considered as a major threat by the interviewed providers.  3.2 Protection measures taken by service providers  One important aspect regarding the sectors ability to withstand power cuts is the protection levels  that have been implemented in order to overcome shorter or longer power cuts without undue  effects on networks and services. In the web survey, NRAs were asked for information regarding the  time before a power disruption would lead to service disruption within the electronic  communications sector for different network types.7  Table 3 summarizes the results and indicates  7  Results for satellite networks and terrestrial mass communications networks have been omitted as the  number of responses covering these network types is too low to draw any significant conclusions.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  10  that fixed circuit-switched and broadband networks can be expected to exhibit a higher level of  resilience than mobile networks.  Network type < 1 hour 1-2 hours 2-4 hours 4-8 hours > 8 hours  Fixed circuit switched 1 1 2 3 8  Fixed broadband networks 1 2 2 2 7  Mobile networks 2 3 3 3 3  Table 3: Estimation of the time before a power cut leads to service disruptions within the electronic communications  sector based on responses from 23 NRAs.  As stated in section 3.1, vulnerabilities to power cuts tend to be higher in access networks compared  to core components of the networks.  As core platforms and backbone circuits serve both mobile  and fixed networks and are usually located in the same core sites, they have similar levels of  resilience and protection equipment against power cuts at least in the core parts of the networks.  Power cuts may affect more the access component of the mobile network due to the locations of  mobile sites and the difficulty of transporting power supply to them.  Besides that, the mobile network nodes (e.g. base stations) are more exposed to natural phenomena  and other outdoor risks that may impact power supply.  Another reason why fixed networks could have a greater level of resilience can be explained due to  the type of network architecture that is typically more granular in mobile networks than in fixed  networks, thus having more energy dependent components.  NRAs have provided additional clarification and information to this overview through comments.8  One example of such additional information is that certain providers give priority to voice services  over data services and may also prioritize coverage over capacity in mobile networks in order to  prolong network life after a power cut. Another NRA remarks that first priority is always given to  emergency calls, and second priority is given to restore services to customers with service level  agreements. It is also pointed out that the network type, for example the use of 2G or 3G networks  to support a specific service, and how power is supplied in a distributed fashion or from central  offices also lead to variability. Some base stations may only have battery power that is sufficient for  some ten minutes, but where key sites will have reserves that cover several hours.  Mobile networks tend to be more vulnerable to power cuts than fixed networks  While there is considerable variability in resilience against power cuts, between network types and  within networks, mobile networks can be expected to offer less resilience than fixed network  types. This is most likely due to natural consequence of the costs that would come from improving  protection to the large number of network components including base stations that are used.  Providers can implement several different protection measures in order to reach the levels of  resilience that are reported in table 3. One component is the deployment of fixed, fuel-powered  8  Most comments are related to the expected variability within the national sector that was difficult to include  as part of the responses to the web survey.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  11  power generators which typically provide protection during a period that approaches or exceeds 24  hours. Based on the web survey, stationary power generators are principally used in core network  segments more or less independent of the network type (i.e. fixed circuit-switched, broadband and  mobile networks). Uninterruptible power supply with batteries is another protection measure that is  commonly deployed either throughout a network or limited to core network segments. A third  protection measure is the use of transportable power generators that can be moved to a specific site  where there is an ongoing power disruption. In most cases, the deployment of these transportable  power generators is limited with some exceptions. The use of solar cells and similar technologies for  own-generated power supply is rare with some EU Member States reporting some limited  deployment.  In the web survey, NRAs were asked to provide an overall rating of providers’ abilities to cope with  power cuts through existing physical protection measures in relationship to a reasonable balance  between incurred costs and associated risk levels. Table 4 gives an overview of this assessment for  both fixed and mobile networks.  Network type Unsatisfactory Poor Adequate Good  Fixed circuit switched 1 3 12 4  Fixed broadband networks 1 3 12 4  Mobile networks 2 2,5 16,5 —  Table 4: Overall qualitative assessment of protection measures, balancing costs against risk, per network type based on  responses from 23 NRAs.  In general, NRAs consider current protection measures against power cuts as a reasonable  balance between risk and cost  Even though power cuts are a significant cause of incidents within the electronic communications  sector, most NRAs see current protection measures as an adequate balance between the risks  associated with power cuts and the costs of establishing and maintaining protection measures.  Only for mobile networks NRAs consider the current level of protection less than adequate.  The provider view of security measures is naturally broader than the high-level information that  NRAs have at hand. The following examples show some of the considerations that providers make  before establishing a set of resilience measures.  Example 7) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  Protection mechanisms are not applied to individual network elements per se but as part of an  operational risk management methodology. In this methodology, assets are classified in one  category based on technological, societal and commercial aspects. Protection measures are  applied to assets in relationship to this classification rather than only identifying network  element types (for example, base stations) and applying protection measures to them (for  example, batteries).  In general, access networks have some form of protection through batteries. Core network  elements are protected through fixed power generators. The provider also has fuel supplies  stored in underground facilities that can be used during extraordinary circumstances for  transportation and to drive fixed power generators.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  12  The provider has introduced specialized vehicles that have shelter, fuel and communications  infrastructure (Wi-Fi and mobile network infrastructure) that can be transported and quickly re- establish coverage in an area without any other infrastructure in place. The vehicles have been  funded by the provider.  Example 8) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  The provider has four principal protection levels. On level one, assets are placed in facilities with  mains connections as well as UPS solutions and fixed power generators with fuel tanks sufficient  for days of sustained operation even in the absence of mains power. The second level contains  the same protection mechanisms but with smaller fuel generator tanks. On the third level, there  will only be a UPS resource. The fourth level consists of UPS protection but with quite limited  protection time.  In general, the provider prefers to apply protection according to levels 1 and 2 in facilities where  it can exert control (either through direct ownership of the facility or through commercial  agreements with the provider of the data centre or co-location facility). Protection principles are  also applied to be proportionate with site protection mechanisms: A customer that lacks power  protection can make no use of any connectivity as computers and routers will cease to operate  due to a power cut. The provider tries to advise customers to procure protection mechanisms  where it is deemed to be advisable.  Normal redundancy principles will also affect the provider’s ability to withstand power cuts. The  provider does not have access to any transportable power generators.  Example 9) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  The deployment of fixed power backup solutions varies between network segments and  geographical areas. A general rule is that base stations and local exchanges have some form of  UPS system in place. In rural areas, where only a few customers would be affected by a service  disruption due to a power cut, there may not be any UPS system in place at all. In more  populated areas, protection may provide a minimum of 4-6 hours of continued operation.  One motivation for differentiating spare power supply is that many users would also be  negatively impacted by the power cut as they are generally not equipped with own-generated  power supplies. The situation is different for many enterprise customers.  Core network elements are typically protected by fixed power generators. For some sites, 2 or  even 3 power generators can be used to create redundancy. The provider also has the option to  activate the use of transportable power generators.  The provider does evaluate resilience against power cuts as an individual cost driver. A first step  is to establish targets that determine the overall resilience levels that the provider aims to fulfil  followed by the determination of the most cost effective way to achieve these goals.  Example 10) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  Core sites are protected with UPS and batteries (with autonomy between 1 and 2 hours for AC  systems and up to 4 hours for DC systems) and also with stationary power generators (with own  diesel tanks) that will supply the site with sufficient power to continue operation indefinitely as  long as external refuelling can occur at regular intervals. External power generators can also be  used for power supply. If an internal protection measure fails (for example, the fixed power  generator), the provider will attach an external power generator to maintain the same level of  resilience.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  13  In access networks, individual base stations have batteries that give protection of at least two  hours in the event of a power cut. Critical sites in transmission and aggregation network have  battery protection around 8 hours. Assets in these non-core network segments allow them to be  supplied by external power generators.  The provider has a contractor that will transport and deploy mobile power generators. The time  between a decision to initiate a deployment and when a mobile power generator has started  providing power to a network element is subject to geographical variations but is typically  between 2 and 4 hours.  Batteries incur a high cost to procure and maintain but are deemed to be cost effective in the  sense that they ensure that services can be maintained with zero interruption, even in the event  of short duration power cuts or temporary disturbances from the external power supplier.  Example 11) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  Power is remotely supervised by an entity within the provider’s organization which provides  continuous every day, all day  alarm monitoring and technical measurements from all power  elements including electrical line connections, DC batteries, UPS systems, generators and cetera.  Approximately 8 000 network sites are supervised by this entity and all power cut incidents are  remotely managed in coordination with local field technicians, external contractors and power  suppliers.   All network sites are protected with DC batteries and UPS systems.   Medium network sites are also protected with fixed power generators   Strategic network sites are also protected with redundant fixed power generators and  electrical line connections.   The provider has geographically deployed mobile power generators to attend to local  power outages   The provider has five Emergency Logistical Bases with large number of mobile power  generators for attend severe and extensive power outages with regional or national  implications.  These protection mechanisms are a relevant cost driver. However, they are considered to be the  best solution in order to guarantee the availability and quality of services to customers.  3.3 Restoration after power cuts – sector internal cooperation and lessons  learned  The potential negative impact to society of power cuts causing service disruptions within the  electronic communications sector is principally determined by two factors. The first factor is the  security measures described in the previous section. The second factor is the ability of providers to  act efficiently to restore services and networks. Such actions will typically involve contacts with a  number of parties:   an internal or external (to the provider) field service organization that is responsible for the  transport and provisioning of transportable power generators or other temporary solutions,   other providers where the sharing of information and resources can lower service  restoration times,   various actors, such as private customers, other providers and authorities, that require  information from the providers about the service disruption, and  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  14   the energy supplier for information regarding the power cut and forecast regarding  restoration times.  Table 5 provides an overview of an assessment of providers’ individual abilities and the providers’  abilities to cooperate with other providers within the electronic communications sector to respond  to power cuts and act efficiently to minimize service disruptions and restore services after power  cuts.  Response and Cooperation Unsatisfactory Poor Adequate Good  Individual abilities — 3,5 12,5 2  Intra-sector cooperation — 8 9 1  Table 5: Overall qualitative evaluation of service provider’s response and cooperation capabilities after power cuts  Cooperation within the electronic communications sector can be improved  The NRA’s assessment point to a problem where intra-sector cooperation between providers are  deemed to range from poor to adequate which is less than ideal as cooperation becomes  increasingly important as the severity of the power cuts and challenges of the restoration effort  grows.  Information sharing is a critical enabler to the successful cooperation between providers but also to  inform authorities and the general public regarding the impact and forecast for restorations after a  service disruption has started. Table 6 shows that information exchange between providers, such as  web-based solutions or contact paths to NOCs, which enable providers to share information  regarding impact and forecast for restorations are to be considered as limited to a few actors and or  with limited functionality. Information exchange to the authorities and the general public is better or  slightly better.  Information exchange Limited to few  actors and with  limited func.

The situation is better for the information  that goes to authorities and to the general public.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  15  3.4 Power cut resilience – commercial aspects  Improvements to resilience measures for power cuts do not have to come through legislation. One  alternative is commercial drivers rewarding a service provider, who places a higher emphasis on  power cut resilience measures compared to its competitors, with increased market share and  profitability. Another alternative is that the overall level of resilience is the value rather than its  individual components, where power cut resilience would be one of these components. It is also  likely that different market segments make these evaluations differently.  NRAs were asked to assess how different customer segments evaluate resilience against power cuts  as a differentiating factor in their choice of service provider. The same question was also asked  taking the provider perspective, with combined results shown in table 7.  Customer segment  (Service provider view)  Little individual  value  Some  individual  value  Some collective  value with  other  measures  Significant  value with  other  measures  Ordinary customers 13 (10) 3 (2) 1 (5)  — (—)  Private companies 5 (4) 2 (5) 9 (6) 1 (2)  Authorities 5 (3) 1 (4) 5 (7) 6 (3)  Table 7: Overall qualitative assessment on how different customer segments place value on power cut resilience based  on two different perspectives: the customer perspective and the service provider perspective (in parentheses).  A further commercial aspect is if private companies, authorities and other organisations that require  a higher degree of resilience against power cuts, can and will act to seek assurances from their  respective providers of this increased resilience level. This would typically mean that providers  deploy a mix of fixed power generators and UPS systems with batteries in all network segments that  serve this specific customer. Whilst this may be realistic in some circumstances, in particular where  the need is coupled to a single or a few geographical locations, it is perhaps not realistic that this  type of agreement would lead to a higher general, network wide level of resilience.  Example 12) Commercial aspects – a service provider perspective  According to the provider, resilience against power cuts is not regarded as a differentiating  factor, compared to factors such as geographical coverage. The provider has large commercial  contracts with authorities and companies and will not be evaluated for resilience against power  cuts but for resilience as a whole. However, the provider will not divest responsibility regarding a  service disruption caused by third party power supply failure and place the blame on an actor  within the energy sector.  This means all in all that overall resilience is the key according to the provider. Power cuts can be  regarded as one threat that the provider needs to be aware of and consider as part of network  and service continuity planning. But as stated before, according to the interviewed provider,  power cuts are not considered to be the most important issue to consider in this regard.  Example 13) Commercial aspects – a service provider perspective  According to the provider, reliability of electronic communications services as a whole is an  important factor rather than resilience to power cuts. One reason for this statement is that  power supply in the country in question is relatively reliable and there is only one major power  distributor without effective alternatives, although there may be several power retailers. Other  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  16  providers also depend on the same power supplier and are likely to have implemented similar  protection mechanisms. Power supply is understood as a utility and not as a differentiating  factor, therefore resilience against power cuts would not be a point of concern if SLAs were  properly defined in terms of continuity and quality of supply.  Special customers, like customers in the corporate segment and public administration, that seek  additional information regarding reliability never ask specific questions regarding power supply  issues but may ask for information regarding the resilience of telecommunications equipment  and transmission lines (circuits).  Market forces are not deemed to be a significant contributor to the direct improvement to power  cut resilience  NRAs make the assessment that ordinary customers place little value on the extent to which  providers are resilient to power cuts. In the same manner, private companies or authorities are  unlikely to place value on power cut resilience measures specifically but are more likely to place  some value on resilience measures as a whole. Depending on the distribution between the revenue  bases for private customers and other customer segments, an increased market demand that  specifically addresses power cut resilience and leads to increased power cut resilience levels may  be regarded as an unlikely development.  3.5 Power cut resilience – 2011 and 2012 incident reports  As part of this study, ENISA has analysed 12 incidents from 2011 and 10 incidents from 2012 that  were reported to ENISA and the European Commission and that involved power supply failure  causing the incident, either as initial cause or subsequent cause.  In 2011 the four longest lasting incidents were caused by natural phenomena in the form of three  storms and one instance of heavy snowfall. In several cases, the power cut on its own did not  determine the duration of the service outage as five of the incidents had hardware or software  failures as secondary cause. The two incidents with the largest number of affected users were both  due to power surges (rather than power cuts) combined with hardware and software failures.  In 2012 the two longest lasting incidents were caused by natural phenomena, one storm and one  instance of heavy snowfall. Power cut was not the only cause. In one case there was a combined  power cut and a failure in the provider’s emergency power supply which led to an outage that lasted  7 hours and affected more than one million subscribers.  We distinguish two types of events:  • Power cuts where existing protection measures work as intended but do not give the  necessary protection resulting in service disruptions  • Power cuts where existing protection measures do not work as intended adding  to the  length of the service disruption9  Applying this classification to the incidents reports from 2011 and 2012 shows that around half of all  reported incidents that were caused by power cuts can be attributed to this second category.  9  The addition to the length of a service disruption is made in reference to a situation where the protection  measures would have worked as intended by their design and implementation.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  17  Ssdfsdf 2011 2012  Security  measures  worked as  intended  A total of six events affecting from a  few tens of thousands subscribers up  to a million subscribers  A total of four events affecting from more  than 10 000 up to a few hundred thousand  subscribers ranging from a number of  hours to several days  Security  measures  failed  Six incidents affecting hundreds of  thousands of subscribers up to and  over a million subscribers.  Six incidents affecting a few thousand  subscribers up to several hundred  thousand subscribers during a few hours  up to and over 24 hours  Table 8: Categorization of incident reports based on incident reports from 2011 and 2012 depending on whether or not  existing protection measures worked as intended.  This leads to the following finding.  In half of the reported incidents involving power cuts, security measures did not work as intended,  which contributed to the impact on networks and services.  The incident reports show that incidents where existing protection measures did not work as  intended were as frequent and severe as incidents where protection measures did work as intended.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  18  4 The utilities domain  In the previous section, the focus was on the electronic communications sector describing current  protection measures as well as sector internal information exchange mechanisms without including  information that describes more specific details on the interactions between the energy and  electronic communications sectors. In this section we look at how resilience of power supply is  addressed in the energy sector and cooperation mechanisms between the two sectors.  4.1 Continuity of supply – national statistics and variability  Power supply is a critical dependency for the electronic communications sector. This dependency is  shared between EU nations. However, there may be national and even regional differences between  the continuity of power supply. Continuity of supply concerns interruptions in power supply and  focuses on events where the voltage at the supply terminals of a network user drops to zero or  nearly (practically) zero. Continuity of supply can be described by various quality dimensions, for  example the number of interruptions per year.  A large majority of EU Member States monitor continuity of supply10 even though Member States  may apply different definitions of an interruption11. This monitoring enables regulatory authorities  to follow how the continuity of supply evolves over time, and is not confined to specific incidents  where a specific number of users are affected over a more extended period of time as follows from  the incident reporting practices introduced in the electronic communications sector from Article 13a  in the Framework directive.  Figure 3: The number of unplanned, long interruptions per year excluding exceptional events. The voltage level (EHV,  HV, MV and LV) relates to where the incidents occur.  Figure 3 indicates that the number of long interruptions per year varies both between Member  States and over time. Most Member States show stability or improvements in this regard. Storms  and heavy snowfall will typically affect energy networks that utilize a large number of overhead  10  All 26 countries that have contributed to the CEER benchmarking report.  11  For example, most countries define interruptions longer than three minutes as a long interruption but there  are exceptions. The Netherlands do not distinguish between transient, short or long interruptions. All  interruptions longer than at least 5 seconds are monitored.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  19  circuits compared to networks that mostly use underground low voltage cables. Figure 4 shows that  there are considerable variations between EU Member States in this regard.  Figure 4: The length of low voltage circuits differentiating between underground and overhead circuits  Example 14) Continuity of supply in Sweden  The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate (Ei) is responsible for the supervision of electricity grid  operators to ensure that they fulfil their obligations in accordance with the Swedish Electricity  Act. One such aspect is the supply of electricity of good quality, where power failures are used as  one indicator to monitor this quality. Figure 5  below shows that the frequency of power failures  varies between years and also depending on the type of electricity network (rural, municipal and  mixed networks).  Figure 5: The average number of power failures per customer and year in local networks in Sweden with a  subdivision between rural (blue), municipal (green) and mixed (red) networks  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  20  Similar statistics also point to variations between power grid operators leading to the conclusions  that the continuity of power supply can be expected to exhibit regional and also local variability.  The same trend can be expected in other EU Member States.  Variations in the continuity of power supply are to be expected  Indicators that characterize power cuts can be expected to exhibit both national, regional and to  some extent also local variation. This means that resilience measures within the electronic  communications sector could exhibit the same type of variability while still preserving the same  level of protection. A level of resilience that is appropriate in one Member State, as a suitable  balance between cost and risk, may not be appropriate for another Member State.  4.2 Specialized protection measures  Providers in the electronic communications sector can complement spare power systems, in the  form of batteries, fixed and transportable power generators, with other protection measures. One  such protection measure is to feed a high-value site via two independent energy distribution paths  with as much diversity as possible.12 Another possible option is to seek commercial agreements  where the energy network owner agrees to provide increased reliability as regulated by service level  agreements.  Table 9 indicates that such additional resilience increasing measures are not rare but also not  common practice.  Ssdfsdf Yes No Other  Specialized protection measures 9 8 6  Commercial agreements 5 9 9  Table 9: NRA assessment of specialized protection measures and their application within the electronic communications  sector  Example 15) Specialized protection measures – a service provider perspective  Contracts with suppliers within the energy sector contain texts which are related to availability  and business continuity based on ISO-standards. These texts do not describe specific service levels  but oblige the energy supplier to implement practices to monitor and manage availability as well  as develop business continuity plans.  SLAs are deemed to be less suitable to provide guarantees in case of natural disasters and similar  events of an extraordinary nature as few providers will accept such stipulations without force  majeure clauses.  12  Low-voltage energy distribution networks are often monopolies within a given geographic area, which  means that the level of resilience that can be achieved may be limited.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  21  4.3 Restoration after power cuts – cross-sector cooperation and lessons  learned  The previous sections, section 4.1 and 4.2, have described the variability regarding power cuts that  can be expected and specialized protection measures that principally govern how often service  disruptions can occur. A broader view is provided if cross-sector cooperation aspects are also  included. Such cooperation is of particular importance under more severe power cuts where  information exchange and coordination is essential.13  The number of power cuts that have required or could have benefited from coordinated restoration  efforts involving actors from the electronic communications sector and the energy sector varies  between EU member states. Some EU member states point to two to three such events where  others report a lower number or even that no such event has occurred during the last ten years. One  NRA points to three major storms during the period in which between 48 000 and 115 000  subscribers of fixed telephony were affected. In a similar manner, mobile networks were also  affected over regional areas that over time decreased to local areas. Another reported instance was  a massive explosion which destroyed a large part of the power producing capability in the member  state.  There is significant commonality between the lessons learned which can collectively be summarized  as follows:  • there is a general need for improved cooperation and information exchange between the  electronic communications and energy sectors,  • information exchange regarding prioritization can bring significant benefits during the  aftermath of an energy shortage situation,  • each situation is different during major emergencies and the useful pre-planning that can be  done is limited, and  • in case of more significant outages, information about power outages from electric  distribution companies should be quickly distributed to providers and be of high quality. E- mail or other means of communication may be useful here.  An overall assessment of providers’ abilities to cooperate with actors within the energy sector to  respond to power cuts and act efficiently to minimize service disruptions and restore services after  power cuts, indicate a variability ranging from poor to adequate showing that there is room for  improvement regarding cross-sector cooperation.  Cooperation Unsatisfactory Poor Adequate Good  Cross-sector cooperation 1 7,5 6,5 2  Table 10: Overall qualitative NRA evaluation of provider’s cooperation capabilities with the energy sector after power  cuts  In the same manner, information exchange mechanisms that can be used to distribute information  regarding ongoing service disruptions typically are not widespread and with desired functionality.  13  It should be noted that there is a mutual dependency as the energy sector will, to a large extent, rely on  electronic communications both during normal operation and during restoration efforts.

Energy sector 4 6 4 1  Table 11: Overall qualitative NRA evaluation of intra sector and cross-sector information exchange mechanisms  Exercises can be regarded as a complimentary tool to resilience increasing measures, and can be  expected to improve cooperation. Overall, the number of exercises that have been held varies  between EU Member States, from none to five or six and even more. Examples of lessons learned  from Member States is that whilst providers are used to handling power outage, there is still some  room for improvements when it comes to further strengthening cooperation and information  exchange.  Example 16) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  Power cuts is the single most common cause of service disruptions according to the provider, and  the provider is indeed used to dealing with the consequences of power cuts. This experience is for  example used in contacts with clients so that customer service representatives ask the customer  if they have power on-site and if it can be confirmed that relevant equipment has power.  The provider can also contact the energy company but this contact does not give any form of  priority compared to ordinary home owners. It is assumed that functions that have a more  central function to society have more direct contact paths to energy suppliers.  Example 17) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  A working group (WG) has been established under the Ministry for the Interior. This WG collects  actors from the electronic communications, energy and transportation sectors that fulfil some  vital function to society and may need to collaborate during the restoration effort after an  extraordinary event such as an earthquake or heavy storm. The WG collects between 20 and 25  actors. Personal relationships have been formed between key people in the electronic  communications and energy sectors as part of the WG. These relationships are of critical  importance to facilitate efficient cooperation during a crisis.  It has been found that the cooperation that is established through the WG, associated training  and exercises, together form a good basis for larger restoration efforts, as no plan can account  for the multitude of variations that can exist between different events. For example, two recent  severe natural events occurred in regions that had been assigned to a low risk with respect to the  specific threat. Exercises are held at least annually on national level, collecting actors from  several sectors. On a regional level, the same type of exercises is held at least twice annually.  Example 18) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  Several elements of cooperation are lacking. Information sharing is one component here where  providers within the electronic communications sector would like to have information regarding  planned maintenance and power cuts in advance and they would also like to have notifications  regarding ongoing power cuts or disturbances. Another aspect here is that providers are treated  no different than a domestic customer, who is referred to general customer support, when  reporting or requesting information regarding an ongoing power cut from the power company.  Example 19) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  The provider states that about two to three power cuts annually during the last ten years have  required or could have benefited from coordinated restoration efforts involving actors from the  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  23  electronic communications sector and the energy sectors to minimize service disruption after  power outages with national or regional impact.  The provider also points to a daily need of  coordinated restoration efforts with the owners of the energy networks in order to minimize  service disruption after power outages with local impact.  Lessons learned are:   There is a need to know, in real time, actions and estimations with respect to restoration  in energy networks in order to prioritize and mobilize our human and material protection  resources for communications network sites.   Energy network owners must prioritize repair of power supply to important  communications network sites. This prioritization should be coordinated with  communications service providers.  Cross-sector cooperation and information exchange can be improved  Efficient service restoration requires cooperation and information exchange between the energy  sector and the electronic communications sector, and improvements in this domain can decrease  the negative impact of power cuts in general and more severe power cuts in particular. Exercises  can be a useful tool to practice and maintain an established collaboration.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  24  5 The utilities policy domain  Actors within the utilities domain are subject to legislation which will affect power cut restoration  efforts. The primary such influence is through prioritization schemes where assets within the  communications sector are given preferential treatment, and through regulation that affect the  quality of power supply as is described in this section.  5.1 Prioritization schemes  The service restoration time (in the electronic communications sector) after a power cut will vary  depending on a number of factors, ranging from meteorological conditions to access to  transportable power generators that can be used to continue network operation. There are basically  three principal policy areas that will influence the severity of service disruptions, in the case of more  severe power cuts, in order to deploy transportable power generators and maintain their operation  together with that of fixed power generators:14   a preference scheme where power supply would be restored to assets in the electronic  communications sector with priority,   preference schemes that would give providers priority access to transportation resources,  and   preference schemes that would give providers priority access to fuel.  The parties that would participate in preference schemes, outside the providers and power grid  operators, would vary depending on national conditions.  As indicated in table 12, only a few NRAs report the existence of such preference schemes.  S Yes No Other  Priority restoration  2 7 14  Priority transport  — 9 14  Priority to fuel 2 8 13  Table 12: Existence of preference schemes that could decrease the negative impact of more severe power cuts  Example 20) A national example of a priority restoration scheme  One NRA in an interview points to a preference scheme that builds on national regulations within  the energy sector requiring energy distribution companies to have a list of priority customers and  also the reason behind the prioritization. Power would here be restored to customers respecting  this priority order even though the order would not always be preserved, as power companies  resolve problems in the high-voltage network first and then low-voltage network to which assets  in the electronic communications sector is typically connected. Some base stations and other  telecommunications installations are on this national list. In the low-voltage network there are  many prioritized customers like hospitals that will be higher up on the list.  14  These three areas are complemented by general regulation, as described in section 5.2. A further policy  domain is priority schemes where, during a general energy shortage situation, assets within the electronic  communications sector would not be disconnected while other customers that do not fulfil an equally  important function to society would be. This situation may not be caused by a power cut and is not treated  here even though the electronic communications sector would certainly benefit from this type of policy.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  25  The NRA does not have enough working experience or statistics to state that the priority  restoration schemes have led to a quicker restoration of electronic communications services.  Example 21) Prioritization – a service provider perspective  Prioritization is one of the issues that can be said to be within the realm of the WG (cf. example  17).  During an extraordinary event, members within the WG could interact to determine suitable  actions to minimize the effects of the event on society. The prioritization scheme could therefore  be regarded as an informal arrangement rather than a set of pre-established rules. The  prioritization scheme has been used operationally.  Example 22) Prioritization – a service provider perspective  The provider has no special contractual agreement with the power company that contains SLA- based requirements. The provider has tried to establish a priority communication channel with  the power company and also to provide a list of critical sites/assets of the access network but,  considering the few past experience, the provider does not know if this mechanism is effective  when needed in critical situations.  There seem to be few national examples of priority schemes within the utilities domain  Of those intyerviewed, only two member states point to the existence of national preference  schemes even though such schemes can be expected to lead to some improvements in certain,  more severe situations.  5.2 Regulation of quality of power supply within the European energy sector  European energy regulators work to promote well-functioning and competitive EU energy markets  so that consumers get fair prices, the widest choice of supplier and the best quality of supply  possible15. To achieve the third goal, ensuring that consumers are given the best quality of supply  possible, regulatory oversight and control within the European energy sector is principally exercised  in three areas:   the continuity of supply which relates to the number and duration of power cuts,   voltage quality that relates to the power surges or dips that affect electronic equipment, and   commercial quality that concerns the timeliness and efficiency of the customer service  provided by electricity companies.  The three areas influence the electronic communications sector’s ability to withstand and react to  power cuts in different ways. The first area, continuity of supply, is principally linked to protection  measures in the form of UPS systems, fixed and transportable power generators that are applied to  network elements in order to avoid or suitably minimize service interruptions after power cuts. In  the same manner, network elements need to be equipped with protection measures against power  surges and dips. The third area will primarily influence, indirectly rather than directly, the electronic  communications sector’s ability to react to various forms of power cuts and act efficiently to  maintain and restore services to consumers.  A large number of energy regulators within Europe have adopted regulatory instruments to maintain  or improve continuity of supply, as a balance to other regulation that aims to increase market  15  CEER 5th Benchmarking Report, page iii.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  26  efficiency16. Quality incentive schemes, through reward or penalty schemes or incentives, have  evolved within parts of the European energy sector as a means to optimise continuity of supply  levels. The use of rewards, penalties and a combination of the two varies between Member States  and is also applied differently to different energy network levels17. The main intention of these  schemes is to keep quality levels at an efficient socio-economic level.  Example 23) Energy sector regulation in Great Britain  Incentive rates are used in Great Britain to reward or penalise distribution companies based on  their performance regarding continuity standards.18 Companies must reach targets for customer  interruptions and customer minutes lost which are set during the price control process, with  exceptional events excluded. Each distribution company performance determines the resulting  penalty or reward through a complex formula with a lag of two years.  Great Britain also employs a compensation scheme that distinguishes between domestic and  business customers. Domestic customers are eligible for a 54£ compensation after the first 18  hours of interruptions. Business customers are eligible to twice that amount for the same  duration.  Example 24) Energy sector regulation in Sweden  Energy distribution companies may also be subject to more direct legal obligations as is the case  in Sweden. The Electricity Act (1997:857) stipulates that network concessionaires shall ensure  that outages in the transmission of electrical power to an electricity consumer never exceed  twenty-four hours. One exception to this rule is when a concessionaire can show that the outage  results from:   an impediment outside the concessionaire's control,   which the concessionaire could not reasonably be expected to have anticipated, and the   consequences of which the concessionaire could neither have reasonably avoided or  overcome.  Storms and similar events would typically not be regarded as an exception to this obligation.  The energy sector seems to have progressed further in their assessment of obligations and socio- economic effects  The energy sector has worked for a number of years to establish different forms of incentive  schemes that include limits to the number and duration of power cuts as well as other quality  dimensions. The evaluation of socio-economic effects has been an integral part of this process.  16  Examples of market efficiency regulation can be price or revenue-cap mechanisms.  17  Ibid, page 41.  18  Ibid, page 43.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  27  6 Assessing the need for improvements and proposals  In this section we take stock of the need for resilience improvements and of proposals from  providers and NRAs for measures that can be taken to reach these improvements. The material in  this section and in section 7 (evaluation of possible actions), together form the input for  recommendations presented in section 8.  6.1 Assessing the need for improvements to power cut resilience  The need for improved power cut resilience within the electronic communications sector can be  evaluated from two perspectives:   a societal perspective in which the effects of service disruptions caused by power cuts are  evaluated in dimensions that can include the possible loss of lives and economic losses,   a commercial (service provider) perspective in which the costs of introducing resilience  increasing measures are evaluated against the possible monetary gains, and  As we shall see, the two perspectives can lead to different results. Taking the first perspective, as  shown in table 13, shows that most NRAs consider it to be important to increase power cut  resilience compared to other risk mitigation activities.  Unimportant Not very  important  Important Critical  Need for improvement — 3 15 1  Table 13: Qualitative evaluation of the importance of increasing power cut resilience within the electronic  communications sector from an NRA perspective  NRAs also pointed to a number of resilience aspects that are deemed to be more important, for  example:   decreasing the number of software induced errors as service disruptions caused by software  issues are fairly frequent and can also give rise to national disruptions for several hours,   implementation of priority schemes, increasing redundancy and improvements to business  continuity planning,   measures that prevent cyber-attacks and introduce disaster recovery procedures, and   protection measures against overloads.  One NRA also identified human errors, hardware and software failures, damage through excavations  and digging activities without ranking.  One NRA stated that there probably is not much that is more important than power supply aspects  for electronic communications resilience but notes that it does not necessarily mean that this  resilience area needs improvements. The NRA was here of the opinion that providers react and cope  well so that the current level of resilience may have an optimal balance between resilience and cost  already. If this optimal level has not yet been established, the NRA stated that it may be more  efficient to improve the resilience of the power supply itself, rather than of the electronic  communications sector, noting that the dependency between the two sectors is two-way.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  28  A majority of NRAs consider it to be important to increase resilience against power cuts compared  to other risk mitigation activities.  Even though  most NRAs see current protection measures as an adequate balance between the risks  associated with power cuts and the costs of establishing and maintaining protection measures, NRAs  still consider it to be important to increase power cut resilience compared to other risk mitigation  activities.  Whilst the NRA view points at the importance of increasing power cut resilience, the provider  perspective indicates a lower evaluation as the following examples show.  Example 25)  Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  The provider considers several other threats to have risk levels greater than what is considered  for power cuts. Examples of such more severe threats are natural disasters with direct impact on  networks, cyber-attacks, civil works and copper thefts.  It is always possible to improve the capability to withstand and respond to power cuts. At  present, the provider has no immediate plans to make such improvements. However, the  provider is acutely aware of the importance of electronic communications services to society as a  whole.  Example 26) Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  The provider places higher emphasis on equipment resilience than resilience against power cuts  and sees some, limited room for improvement with respect to their own operation’s resilience  against power cuts. Customer improvements are a far more important issue in this regard. One  other improvement would be information provided by the energy sector regarding power  disruptions which would make the provider more efficient even though resilience would not be  increased.  Example 27) Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  A number of flooding incidents have occurred in the last 5 to 10 years and seem to be increasing.  Physical risks would be regarded as a more significant set of threats that require more attention  for the future. Logical threats however, for example if someone would break the encryption on  SIM-cards, could lead to more significant commercial consequences.  An important aspect is to ensure that the power sector is as resilient as the electronic  communications sector. One possible improvement is the better understanding of recovery  procedures and resilience aspects between actors in the two sectors.  Example 28) Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  Current internal protection measures, including the possibility to deploy mobile power generators  by an external contractor, are at a level where the provider considers itself to be well prepared to  deal with external power cuts. One remark must be done given that there are only 5 to 6 big  contractors that supply mobile generators in the country, which could lead to a capacity shortage  in case there is a major and prolonged power failure that impact a significant part of the access  network sites.  The provider regards its current protection measures for dealing with power cuts as appropriate  when compared to other risks, given that it has N+1 protection in core sites and battery supply in  access networks. There is currently no plan to further improve investment levels regarding  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  29  protection equipment to withstand power cuts, although there is still room for improvements  regarding resilience architecture and procedural enhancements, at the internal level in the  provider’s and at the external level with the power suppliers.  6.2 Proposals to improve resilience against power supply failures  6.2.1 Proposals from providers  Interviewed providers have brought forward a number of proposals that could be used to improve  power supply resilience:   The establishment of an EU level round table forum where providers from different sectors  participate to discuss protection mechanisms and experiences from events so that lessons  learned and procedures are shared as much as possible.   The establishment of some form of commercial incentives for providers to ensure that they  consider protection mechanisms that go beyond those which are applied for commercial  purposes. One possible alternative in this regard is tax relief.   The establishment of priority and ease of access to the sites by the civil protection  authorities for the emergency teams of the providers and the power suppliers, as well as  giving priority in the provisioning of diesel reserves for power generators.   The establishment of increased protection of network sites by the police authorities to  ensure continuity of operations, both for access network sites (given the increased  occurrence of batteries thefts) and for core sites (given the possible public disorders due to  social and political instability).   The establishment of a priority customer relationship between providers and power  companies.   Improved information exchange mechanisms that allow for continuous sharing regarding  ongoing power disturbances and predictions of restoration times.   Improved early warnings and information sharing from civil protection authorities regarding  storms and fires to enable the operators to prepare for and efficiently work to minimize  service disruptions.  Providers see several  measures that could improve resilience against power supply failures  As part of the interviews, a number of providers have pointed to actions that could improve the  resilience against power cuts. Even though the number of providers that have been interviewed is  limited, the finding leads to a recommendation to NRAs to collect and evaluate different proposals  before any action is taken.  6.2.2 Proposals from NRAs  In the web survey and interviews also NRAs pointed to a number of possible actions and  observations that can be taken to reach improvements:   an increased use of fixed power generators,   well prepared crisis management in each critical infrastructure company,  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  30   improving customer understanding of the limitations of the current communications  services related to power cut resilience to allow market pressure to increase commercial  incentives to improve, starting with government and big business customers,   forcing providers to establish connections with multiple suppliers of electricity in a number  of points in order to have an alternative, and   incentives for closer collaboration between providers and the energy sector.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  31  7 Possible actions and evaluation of actions to address identified findings  This study started from the knowledge that a significant number of the major incidents that have  been reported to ENISA during 2011 and 2012 can, directly or indirectly, be attributed to power cuts.  The material in sections 2 to 5 has described aspects of power supply dependencies from four  different perspectives. In chapter 6, providers and NRAs have given their opinion on the need for  improvements regarding resilience against power cuts, and they have given proposals to increase  resilience. The discussions in section 2 to 6 have led to a total of 16 findings. These findings are in  this section collected and attributed with possible actions without taking a stand, as described in  table 14 below.  The material in this section and in section 6 form input to the recommendations presented in section  8.  7.1 Possible actions to address identified findings  The table below describes possible actions to address the identified findings from the previous  sections.  Domain Finding Possible actions  Electronic  communications  policy domain  Few NRAs have implemented  legislation related to power cut  resilience  There are four principal options to decrease the  negative impact of service disruptions due to  power cuts:  a) improve the quality of supply in the energy  sector (reducing the threat)  b) increasing resilience in the electronic  communications sector through legislation  c) increasing resilience in the electronic  communications through state funding or  private-public partnerships  d) trust that market forces will lead to an  increase in power cut resilience over time  Most NRAs do not perform risk  assessments which include the risks  for network and service outages due  to power cuts  Each NRA may not be obliged to perform risk  assessments as part of their remit. The  responsibility to perform such risk assessments  may also be performed by some other  government agency.  ENISA’s view is that NRAs should consider  national risk assessments as standard practice  in order to evaluate different threats and  consider appropriate actions. Power cuts is one  threat category that is important to consider in  this regard. No other option is therefore  associated with this finding.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  32  State funding and public-private  partnerships that concern power cut  resilience are rare  The practice of using state funding and public- private partnerships is one possible activity that  can contribute to increasing power cut  resilience.  A majority of NRAs consider it to be  important to increase resilience  against power cuts compared to  other risk mitigation activities  The finding is not attributed to an individual  action but can be considered as important  motivations for the recommendations that are  given in chapter 7.  Electronic  communications  domain  Risks associated with power cuts is  not always considered a significant  threat by providers  Providers typically perform risk assessment  based on a commercial perspective. The  interviews indicate that most providers can be  expected to have established a number of  protection measures that are considered to be  sufficient from commercial and current  legislative perspectives.  No specific action is attributed to this finding.  Mobile networks tend to be more  vulnerable to power cuts than fixed  networks  This fact should be included in risk assessments  where society’s increased reliance on mobile  services should be included.  In general, NRAs consider current  protection measures against power  cuts as a reasonable balance  between risk and cost  The conclusion that ENISA draws here is that it  is by no means certain that additional resilience  increasing measures should be mandated.  Depending on national circumstances priorities  between different types of existing security  measures for resilience could be defined, cf.  section 6.1.  In the case of any new action taken, for  example the introduction of specific obligations,  it should be preceded by a cost-benefit analysis  that includes other possible options.  Cooperation within the electronic  communications sector can be  improved  The primary actions that can be taken is:  a) the introduction of tools and routines for  information exchange, and  b) strategies and procedures that can be used  to increase cooperation with exercises as  one example.  Information exchange mechanisms  between providers can be improved  Market forces are not deemed to be  a significant contributor to the direct  improvement to power cut resilience  This finding is primarily an indication that  improvements are to be sought elsewhere and  is therefore not attributed to a specific action.  The cost-benefit analysis should include this  option as one alternative along with state  funding or private-public partnerships.  In half of the reported incidents The finding is treated as part of a  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  33  involving power cuts, security  measures did not work as intended,  which contributed to the impact on  networks and services.  recommendation to NRAs to follow up on the  power supply related incidents and take lessons  learned from them to continuously work for  improvements of the security measures.  Providers see several measures that  could improve resilience against  power supply failures  The finding is treated as part of a  recommendation to NRAs to liaise with  providers and other NRAs to collect and  evaluate different options to increase power cut  resilience as an initial measure.  Utilities domain  Variations in the continuity of power  supply are to be expected  Risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses  need to include a relevant threat description  that includes information regarding the  characteristics and frequency of power cuts.  The finding is not on its own attributed to an  action.  Cross-sector cooperation and  information exchange can be  improved  The possible actions are captured above adding  the energy sector to the reach of tools for  information exchange and improved  cooperation.  Utilities policy  domain  There seems to be few national  examples of priority schemes within  the utilities domain  As the power cut threat varies between EU  member states, the most appropriate action is  to make a national evaluation of the need for  and components in a priority scheme.  The energy sector seems to have  progressed in their assessment of  obligations and socio-economic  effects  Some policies and measures in the energy  sector may be interesting to learn from in the  electronic communications sector, for instance  incentive schemes.  Table 14: Mapping between findings and possible actions  7.2 Evaluation of actions  The findings, proposals and possible actions lead to the identification of a number of general actions  to consider:   Introducing or strengthening legislation in the electronic communications sector placing  stricter requirements on providers   Introducing or strengthening legislation in the energy sector placing stricter requirements on  the frequency and duration of power cuts   Increasing commercial incentives for providers in the electronic communications sector   Improved routines and technical systems for collaboration and information exchange  between the two sectors   Increased number of cross-sector exercises geared towards restoration after significant  power cuts   Introduction of priority restoration schemes within the utilities domain  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  34   Increase the number of transportable power generators that are available for use in the  electronic communications sectors.  NRAs were asked to evaluate these actions in two dimensions. The first dimension describes the  improvements that can come from the implementation of the action and is shown in table 15.  Action No real  improvement  Limited  improvement  Substantial  improvement  Very significant  improvement  eComms legislation 3 10 6 1  Energy sector legislation 2 11 5 1  Commercial incentives 3 10 5 2  Tools for information  exchange  − 9 10 1  Exercises − 9 7 4  Priority restoration 3 10 5 2  Transportable power  generators  − 12 6 1  Table 15: NRA evaluation of example actions that can be undertaken to improve resilience against power cuts  The second dimension that was evaluated by NRAs was how difficult the action would be to  implement. This evaluation is shown in table 16.  Action May not be  possible  Very difficult Difficult Normal  eComms legislation 2 3 7 7  Energy sector legislation − 3 11 4  Commercial incentives 3 2 9 5  Tools for information  exchange  − 1 2 17  Exercises − 2 5 13  Priority restoration 1 5 5 7  Transportable power  generators  − 7 9 3  Table 16: NRA evaluation of the difficulty of implementing actions to increase power cut resilience  The tables indicate that no specific actions, with the possible exception of tools for information  exchange and exercises, stand out as actions that can be expected to bring substantially greater  benefits than any other measure.  This may be a consequence of the national and regional variations  to the threat environment that was reported earlier.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  35  8 Recommendations  This study attempts to address two principal questions:   Which measures should be implemented to reduce the frequency of disruptions and outages  in the electronic communications sector caused by power supply failures?, and   Which measures should be introduced to improve the electronic communications sector’s  ability to handle disruptions and outages caused by power supply failures?  To meet these two questions in our recommendations, we propose a subdivision of power cuts  within one principal, the duration of the power cuts. The duration we divide in three categories,  power cuts of shorter, medium and longer duration.  Power cuts of shorter duration range from sub-second voltage fluctuations to failures in the order of  a few hours.  Power cuts of medium duration are failures that last from a few hours up to about 10 hours.  Power cuts of longer duration we categorise as extended failures lasting longer than about 10 hours.  Longer power cuts are typically related to natural causes such as severe storms, heavy snowfall,  floods, earthquakes et cetera, and where it is no longer reasonable to expect providers to introduce  resilience measures that are sufficient to avoid network and service disruptions or outages.  However, from a society perspective, the need for measures to reduce the impact from such causes  is extremely high. Here, efficient joint mitigation activities within and between sectors are the  principal goals.  The recommendations are mainly aimed at NRAs and providers, and some of the recommendations  also address the energy sector and civil protection authorities.  Recommendation 1: NRAs should analyse the frequency and impact of network and  service outages caused by power cuts.  One finding of this study is that NRAs typically do not perform risk assessments that include power  cuts. We believe such risk assessments are important tools to evaluate if extra measures are needed  to improve resilience of networks and services in the face of power cuts. Important input for such  risk assessments would be incident reports about past disruptions and outages caused by power  cuts, and statistics about the number of users affected and the duration. This characterization could  then enable NRAs, aided by information from providers, to relate these statistics to electronic  communications effects through dimensions such as:   the expected number of service disruptions within the electronic communications sector  within a given time frame,   the length of these service disruptions in time,   the impact in terms of number of users and services affected, and   the severity of these incidents, distinguishing between degradations and full outages.  The NRA would then attempt to determine a risk level based on power cut statistics and the societal  impact of the risks related to power cuts.  Recommendation 2: NRAs should liaise with providers, energy regulators and other NRAs  to collect good practices that could be used to increase resilience against power cuts.  These good practices should be considered as part of a cost-benefit analysis  (recommendation 3).  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  36  The providers that have been interviewed as part of this study have brought forward a number of  suggestions that could be used to increase resilience against power supply failures. Before any  actions are taken by NRAs they should meet with providers, energy regulators, actors in the utility  domain and other NRAs to collect proposals for measures to improve power cut resilience. This  collection serves as important input to a cost-benefit analysis, see recommendation 3.  Recommendation 3: NRAs should perform, in cooperation with energy regulators and civil  protection authorities, a cost-benefit analysis, where societal costs and benefits are  evaluated, to determine what is reasonable to expect from different actors regarding  power cut resilience measures.  Within a risk management framework, a risk assessment would be followed by an analysis of what  measures can and should be expected from providers and energy distributors in order to reduce the  impact of power cuts. This risk treatment should include a cost-benefit analysis to compare risk  mitigation activities within both the electronic communications and the energy sector and should be  done in cooperation with energy regulators and civil protection authorities.19  As noted in section 4.1, national and regional variations can be expected and may lead to different  results within and between EU Member States. One outcome can be that it is not relevant to  formulate specific regulatory requirements if power cuts are rare and resulting service disruptions in  the electronic communications sector are rare and do not have significant negative impact. Another  possible outcome here could be that incentive schemes (including market demand for increased  resilience), state funding, and private-public partnerships individually or collectively could lead to  more efficient increases to resilience.  Recommendation 4: Providers should regularly perform checks of existing protection  measures, such as checks of UPS systems and batteries, and running facilities with fixed  and transportable power generators at full load, to avoid and mitigate the impact of  network and service outages from shorter and medium duration power cuts.  Recommendation 5: NRAs should in their follow up of major network and service outages  caused by power cuts ensure that affected providers, based on lessons learned,  systematically develop their protection measures to avoid and mitigate the impact of  network and service outages from shorter and medium duration power cuts.  No matter how resilient providers build their networks and develop their security measures to avoid  network and service outages, there will still be incidents. In those cases it is important to learn from  the incidents to address similar types of incidents in the future. When NRAS follow up major outages  caused by power cuts to see that the providers continuously develop their security measures, NRAs  should consult the cost-benefit analysis (recommendation 3) in order to have a balanced approach  on expectations of enhanced security measures. For instance, expecting backup diesel generators at  core network elements carrying traffic for a large number of users could be considered relevant,  whereas backup diesel generators for “critical” mobile base stations may require increased physical  protection of the sites to prevent the generators from being stolen, which will come at a cost.  19  Based on national conditions, it may for example be more efficient to increase the quality of service within  the energy sector rather than imposing obligations on service providers within the electronic communications  sector to introduce costly protection measures, or to use state funding combined with public-private  partnerships to increase power cut resilience.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  37  Recommendation 6: NRAs should act to establish a strategy to promote cooperation and  mutual aid agreements on joint service restoration after severe power cuts which can  include cross-sector exercises.  The goal of a strategy to promote cooperation and joint service restoration including exercises is to  establish and maintain strong every day working relationships, within the sector and across sector  boundaries, that will carry over to more challenging circumstances.  Recommendation 7: NRAs should consider a priority scheme that would give preferential  treatment within the electronic communications sector and decrease service restoration  times under exceptional circumstances.  Recommendation 8: NRAs, providers, actors in the energy sector and other societal  functions should cooperate to establish information exchange mechanisms. These  mechanisms should enable an efficient exchange of situational awareness information,  forecasts of restoration times and other information that is essential for the efficient  restoration after severe power cuts.  Power failures of longer duration are often connected with increased stress on society and the  supply of electronic communications services is then even more important. The need for priority  schemes and information exchange within the sector as well as with the energy sector, weather  stations, the civil protection authorities and other societal functions can be considered as crucial in  order to reduce the impact from service disruptions and outages.

The electronic  communications networks and services allow citizens, businesses, governments and organisations to  communicate and exchange information and to offer and consume online services. Article 13a of the  EU’s electronic communications Framework directive, which was implemented across the EU in  2011, asks EU Member States to ensure the security and resilience of public electronic  communications networks and services.  As part of the implementation of Article 13a, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in the EU  collect reports about incidents with a significant impact on the electronic communications networks  and services. Yearly, ENISA publishes an annual report which summarizes these incident reports and  provides an aggregate analysis of major outages. As can be seen in the ENISA annual report about  major incidents, power cuts are a dominant cause of severe network and service outages in the EU’s  electronic communications sector.  In this report, we study these incidents in more detail and we make recommendations to NRAs and  electronic communications service providers (providers) and to some extent also to actors in the  energy sector as well as civil protection authorities. Our recommendations are not about preventing  power failures in the power supply sector, but they are aimed at improving the electronic  communications sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts.  ENISA conducted an online survey and interviews about how power cuts are handled in the  electronic communications sector. We found that:   A majority of EU Member States have implemented more general resilience policies through  legislation, whereas a minority of the Member States have implemented policies that are  directly linked to resilience against power cuts.   A majority of the NRAs do not and may even lack suitable input to perform risk assessments  that include power cuts. It is also noted that the national use of state funding and public- private partnerships to address power cut resilience are exceptions rather than the norm  within the EU.   Resilience against power cuts is lower in access networks closer to customers than for  network elements that carry traffic for a large number of customers. Mobile networks tend  to be more vulnerable to power cuts compared to fixed networks.   A majority of NRAs believe that current protection levels are not adequate and they would  like to see power cut resilience to become a market differentiating factor for network and  providers.   A review of incident reports from 2011 and 2012 shows that a significant number of power  cuts led to more severe service disruptions than what would have been the case had existing  protection measures worked as intended.   A large number of energy sector regulators within Europe have adopted regulatory  instruments to maintain or improve continuity of supply in the energy sector, balancing  other regulations aiming at increasing competition and market efficiency.   In some countries, the energy sector has taken significant steps in defining socio- economically acceptable quality of service levels, whereas in some countries the providers  face the fact that there are no special contractual agreements with the power companies  containing SLA-based requirements.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  v   Cooperation and information exchange can be improved within the electronic  communications sector and with the energy sector and civil protection authorities, and the  room for improvement is even more significant for cross-sector restoration efforts.   Prioritization schemes to give assets within the electronic communications sector  preferential treatment in the event of more significant power cuts, are not yet widespread in  the EU.  We also make 8 recommendations mainly to NRAs and providers within the electronic  communications sector, and in some recommendations we also address the energy sector and civil  protection authorities. The recommendations describe steps which could be taken to reduce the risk  of network and service outages caused by power failures, and in this way improve the electronic  communications sector’s ability to handle disruptions and outages caused by power supply failures.  Summarizing the recommendations:  1. NRAs should analyse the frequency and impact of network and service outages caused by  power cuts.  2. NRAs should liaise with providers, energy regulators and other NRAs to collect good  practices that could be used to increase resilience against power cuts. These good practices  should be considered as part of a cost-benefit analysis (recommendation 3).  3. NRAs should perform, in cooperation with energy regulators and civil protection authorities,  a cost-benefit analysis, where societal costs and benefits are evaluated, to determine what is  reasonable to expect from different actors regarding power cut resilience measures.  4. Providers should regularly perform checks of existing protection measures, such as checks of  UPS systems and batteries, and running facilities with fixed and transportable power  generators at full load, to avoid and mitigate the impact of network and service outages  from shorter and medium duration power cuts.  5. NRAs should in their follow up of major network and service outages caused by power cuts  ensure that affected providers, based on lessons learned, systematically develop their  protection measures to avoid and mitigate the impact of network and service outages from  shorter and medium duration power cuts.  6. NRAs should act to establish a strategy to promote cooperation and mutual aid agreements  on joint service restoration after severe power cuts which can include cross-sector exercises.  7. NRAs should consider a priority scheme that would give preferential treatment within the  electronic communications sector and decrease service restoration times under exceptional  circumstances.  8. NRAs, providers, actors in the energy sector, civil protection authorities and other societal  functions should cooperate to establish information exchange mechanisms. These  mechanisms should enable an efficient exchange of situational awareness information,  forecasts of restoration times and other information that is essential for the efficient  restoration after severe power cuts.  More details can be found in the body of this report. We look forward to working with the NRAs and  providers to mitigate the impact of network and security incidents caused by power supply failures.  We encourage the different actors to find ways to improve information-sharing about failures and  outages, particularly between the energy sector and the electronic communications sector.

Article 13a addresses security and integrity of public electronic communications networks and  services. The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public  electronic communications networks and services (providers).  Among other things, Article 13a states that:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures  to guarantee security and integrity of their networks   Providers must report to competent national authorities about significant breaches of  security or integrity that have had a significant impact on the operation of networks or  services   National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad  when necessary, for example in case of incidents with cross-border impact   Annually, NRAs should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European Commission  (EC) about the incidents  ENISA started in 2010 an expert group with NRAs from all the Member States, to implement Article  13a and to address security and resilience of electronic communications in general.  Background  ENISA has, based on incident reports sent from NRAs to ENISA and the European Commission under  Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC), analysed incidents on an aggregated level  and published two reports, Annual Incident Reports 2011 and Annual Incident Reports 2012. In these  reports, ENISA provides an analysis of the received incident reports, dealing with severe disruptions  in public electronic communications networks or services in the EU.  Examples of public electronic  communications services are fixed and mobile telephony and fixed and mobile internet access. The  diagram below shows the causes of the reported incidents in falling order:  Figure 1: Detailed causes (percentages per service).  (2011)  (2012)  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:337:0037:0069:EN:PDF http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  2  The diagram below shows the average impact per cause per reported incident from 2012. The  impact is calculated as affected user connections times the duration of the incidents in hours.  Figure 2: Average impact in user-hours (in thousands) from causes per incident.  From the analysis, ENISA has drawn the following conclusions, which have a direct or indirect link to  power supply dependencies within the electronic communications sector:   Power cuts were in 2011 identified as the second most common cause of incidents.   During 2012, power cuts were the fourth most common cause.   Power cuts caused major impact in 2012 in terms of user-hours lost per incident.   During 2012, incidents caused by natural phenomena, mainly storms and heavy snowfall,  were the two root causes that produced the longest incidents averaging to 36 hours.   During 2011, natural phenomena gave rise to incidents that lasted 45 hours on average.   Natural phenomena have a major impact on the power supply to providers within the  electronic communications sector.  Goal  The goal of this report is to   analyse the dependency of the electronic communications sector on power supply, and to   issue recommendations on:  o measures to reduce the frequency of network disruptions and outages caused by  disruptions in the power supply sector, and  o measures that improve the ability for the electronic communications sector to  handle disruptions caused by power supply failures.  The analysis and findings cover three major perspectives:   regulatory requirements in both the electronic communications and utilities domain,   commercial drivers and   public sector initiatives.  Target audience  The target for this report are mainly experts working at NRAs and ministries, who are dealing with  security and resilience within the electronic communications sector, as well as experts working at  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  3  providers of public electronic communications networks and services, particularly experts involved  with security, resilience, business continuity and disaster recovery. Also energy regulators, energy  distributors, fuel providers, transport companies and civil protection authorities are addressed in  this report.  Methodology  The primary sources of information are results from desk top research activities, a web survey  among experts from NRAs across the EU1, and interviews with experts from six providers and two  NRAs. Specific information on national conditions is derived from desk top research activities and  should not be attributed to statements made by individual NRAs or providers.  Structure of this document  The rest of this document is structured as follows. Sections 2 to 5 collect information covering four  principal domains:   the electronic communications policy domain that through legislation, procedures, state  funding or public-private partnerships influences how well the sector can withstand and act  to minimise the negative impact of power cuts;   the electronic communications domain grouping together providers, that are directly  responsible for the choice and implementation of resilience and recovery mechanisms and  procedures, and their customers;   the utility domain in which energy distributors, field technicians, fuel providers and  transport companies act to provide vital services to assets and actors within the electronic  communications sector;   the utilities policy domain that groups together actors that through legislation, procedures  or other means excerpt influence over the utility domain.  Section 6 collects proposals from providers and NRAs on possible measures to improve resilience  against power cuts.  In section 2 to 6, 16 findings are extracted. Each finding, in the form of an observation of an existing  condition that has, or can have a positive or negative impact on the electronic communications  sector’s ability to withstand and/or respond to power cuts, is presented in tabular format:  Short description of the finding  Further text that gives background information or added perspective to the finding.  Section 7 couples the findings made in sections 2 to 6 to a description of the activities that can be  used to improve matters together with the parties that are or would be affected by establishing an  improvement. The report concludes in section 8 with a set of recommendations to identified actors  that individually and collectively can improve the electronic communications sector’s ability to  withstand and respond to power supply failures.  1  The 23 NRAs who responded to the survey are listed in annex A to this document.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  4  2 The electronic communications policy domain  Actors within the electronic communications domain are influenced by policies that bind them to  uphold a certain level of reliability in the provision and maintenance of networks and services. At the  EU level, article 13a states that providers of public electronic communications networks and services  should take measures to guarantee security and integrity of their networks. This article is then  complemented by national legislation that may provide further clarifications of this obligation and  possibly also national additions. In addition, the policy domain can also influence the electronic  communications sector through state investments and public-private partnerships.  This section couples legislation, state investments and public-private partnerships to how well  electronic communications networks can withstand and recover from power cuts.  2.1 Legislation regarding resilience against power cuts  We have asked NRAs to provide information about national policies for electronic communications  providers regarding resilience against power cuts, hereafter called power cut resilience2. The  responses, shown in table 1 below, indicate that while a clear majority have implemented general  resilience policies, less than half of these Member States have adopted policies that are directly  linked to power cut resilience.  Ssdfsdf Yes No Other3  Existence of general resilience policies 174 5 1  Existence of power cut resilience policies  6 13 4  Table 1: Overview of the existence of general and specific power cut resilience policies among the 23 NRAs that have  responded to ENISA’s web survey.  One of the NRAs pointed to the existence of a general legal requirement obliging providers to supply  a security concept to the NRA, which should include provisions taken to withstand or recover from  power supply failures. The law does not specify detailed requirements regarding emergency power  supply.  Another NRA pointed to the existence of a national electronic communications act that was recently  modified to contain provisions that providers are obliged to provide electronic communications  services with appropriate security for end users in times of peace, during crises and even in times of  war. The NRA may decide that a service provider should take action to provide an appropriate level  of security and preparedness. Detailed secondary legislation classifies sites into four classes  2  The term power cut resilience measures is used as a term for measures to reduce the risk for disruptions and  outages caused by disruptions in the power supply, and measures that improves the ability for the electronic  communications sector to handle disruptions caused by power supply failures. The level of protection that  these measures give is denoted as the electronic communications sector’s resilience against power cuts.  3  The term Other is here and throughout the report used to indicate the number of respondents that have  either refrained from providing an answer or have answered Unknown. In cases where the number of  respondents is less than the 23 NRAs that have provided some form of information to ENISA, the remaining  respondents occupy this Other category. If the number of replies that are provided sum up to less than 23, the  remaining answers were in the Other category.  4  The number represents here and throughout the report the number of answers for this particular option in  the web survey to the NRAs.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  5  depending on the network equipment that is stored on the site. For class A and B sites, backup  power must be sufficient for a minimum of three days. Two days of backup power is needed for class  C sites and there are no requirements for class D sites. There must also be documented operating  and maintenance routines which include routines for handling transport of fuel.  A third example is an EU Member State where a proposition for a specific decision on minimum  requirements for power backup on mobile networks has been issued to all four mobile network  providers in the Member State. The proposed decision states that the mobile networks should still  provide services (both speech and data) at least six hours after a cut in primary power. The network  should provide services with outdoor coverage in the areas where people live and work as well as all  main roads in the Member State. The network owners would not receive any compensation for this  resilience measure. The decision is meant to give the public some hours to communicate to prepare  for a major and long-lasting loss of power.  Example 1) Resilience related legislation in Finland  The Finnish Communication Market Act contains general provisions that are related to resilience  aspects but do not point to a set of resilience increasing measures that each operator has to  take, instead pointing to clarifications in secondary legislation, in ordinances. At present, there  are three principal ordinances that have a direct link to resilience:   Regulation 47 on information security management of telecommunications operators  that principally concerns the need for information security control documentation, risk  management practices and information security measures.   Regulation 54 on resilience of communications networks and services designed to ensure  the reliability of communications networks and services, protection of privacy and  information security under normal circumstances, in fault situations in normal  circumstances and in a state of emergency.   Regulation 57 on the maintenance of communications networks and communications  services, procedures and notifications in the event of faults and disturbances.  Of these three regulations, Regulation 54 has the most direct link to power cut resilience. Within  the regulation, components within electronic communications networks are assigned a priority  based on a rating where the geographical area and the number of end users are the two  principal factors that determine the rating. The regulation then assigns a set of resilience  increasing measures based on the rating in a number of areas:   hardware redundancy, reserve routes and cooling systems,   power supply including planning and monitoring aspects,   physical protection measures.  As one example, the regulation stipulates that GSM base stations must have a back-up time of  the emergency power supply of at least three hours, a time that is extended to six hours due to  remote location, difficult terrain conditions and expected weather conditions.  Few NRAs have implemented legislation related to power cut resilience  The motivation to include or not include specific power cut resilience measures can vary between  Member States as the threat environment, in the form of likelihood for and characteristics of  power cuts can be expected to vary. The survey does not provide specific information that can  couple the existence of such policies to results from risk assessments. Many Member States  consider power cut resilience to be a market rather than a regulatory issue (cf. section 2.3).  https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Viestintavirasto47C2009M_EN.pdf https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Viestintavirasto54A2012M_EN.pdf https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/attachments/maaraykset/Viestintavirasto57A2012M_EN.pdf  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  6  2.2 Risk assessments by NRAs  We asked if NRAs have a structured risk assessment process to analyse to which extent certain  events and conditions can impact electronic communications networks and services. A large  majority, as indicated in table 2, of the NRAs do not perform, compile or distribute risk assessments  that cover power cut resilience aspects.  Ssdfsdf Yes No Other  NRAs performing risk assessments including power  cut resilience  5 17 1  Table 2: The total number of NRAs that perform risk assessment over the electronic communications sector and has a  direct bearing on power cut resilience.  One NRA performing risk assessments regarding power cuts looks back on the previous 14 months  and ranks power cuts just below hardware and software issues as the main cause for incidents.  One NRA subdivides power cuts into categories depending on the geographical area and duration of  the power cut. Storms and other weather related incidents that cause power cuts are treated as part  of one such category. Both regional power cuts of medium duration, with part of a day as an  example, and weather related power cuts are considered as medium risks which is the third highest  level. Several other threats are assigned to the same risk level and software induced errors are  assigned to a higher risk level.  One NRA mentioned they have no access to statistics on power cuts.  Most NRAs do not perform risk assessments which include the risks for network and service  outages due to power cuts  Risk assessments that include risks for network and service outages due to power cuts, where  different types of power cuts and their potential technical and societal consequences are assessed,  can be regarded as a platform from which various actions, for example the introduction of policies  or state funding of resilience increasing measures, can be evaluated.  2.3 State funding and public-private partnerships  Most NRAs indicate that resilience related legislation is in place. Any form of measures that goes  beyond this legally mandated level of resilience can be complemented by market driven  investments, by state funding or through public-private partnerships5. Of the 23 NRAs that  responded to the survey, only four reported that state funding or public-private partnerships had  been used to introduce power cut resilience increasing measures. Examples of the measures that  have been taken in this regard are principally state funded procurements of both stationary and  transportable, fuel-powered generators.  Other NRAs motivate the general lack of state funding activities or public-private partnerships with  statements that reflect a general lack of need or that market forces should be sufficient motivation  for providers to make necessary investments.  5  Market driven aspects related to resilience against power cuts is discussed in section 3.4.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  7  Example 2) State funding – a national example  State funding, in the order of 2.5 million Euros annually over the last decade, has been used in  one EU Member State to improve network resilience. Using this funding, providers have invested  in transportable power generators, stationary power generators and also batteries for spare  telecom exchanges for fixed networks.6  State funding and public-private partnerships that concern power cut resilience are rare  The use of state funding and public-private partnerships to address power cut resilience is the  exception rather than the norm within the EU. There can be several reasons for this disparity, for  example differences in policies, national market conditions and threat environment with respect to  the frequency and duration of power cuts.  6  Government funding has for example paid for some spare parts that service providers keep in stock, for  example a fixed telephony exchange.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  8  3 The electronic communications domain  This section focuses on the measures for resilience taken by providers. We give an overview of:   current risk assessments and protection measures that have been implemented to increase  power cut resilience,   aspects that influence the restoration process after a power cut building on operational  experiences and exercises,   commercial aspects regarding power cut resilience including both the service provider and  customer perspectives, and   a characterisation of power cuts based on incident reports from 2011 and 2012.  The major findings in the section are carried over to (a) section 6.2, where possible actions to  address some of the challenges within the electronic communications sector are analysed, and (b) to  the recommendations that conclude the report in section 8.  3.1 Risk assessments by service providers  The interviews with providers indicate that risk assessment is a well-established practice. The  following three examples give an overview of these practices based on interviews with selected  providers.  Example 3) Risk assessment – a service provider perspective  The service provider performs regular risk management activities based on established routines.  These activities are coordinated by a risk management steering committee that influences all  aspects of the provider’s operations. As part of risk management practices, identified risks are  associated with actions. Power cuts have not been identified as an individual threat: most power  cuts are said to have only minor impact on services and more significant power disruptions are  often associated with natural disasters (for example storms and earthquakes). Risk assessments  for such extraordinary events do not treat power cuts as an individual threat.  The provider considers several other threats as coupled to risk levels greater than what is  considered for power cuts. Examples of such more severe threats are natural disasters, cyber- attacks, civil works and copper thefts.  Example 4) Risk assessments and business continuity planning – a service provider perspective  The provider has an active risk management process accompanied by business continuity and  disaster recovery plans. As part of this risk management process, different types of threats are  evaluated, which influence the provider’s risk mitigation activities. The risk level that has been  associated with power cuts is coupled to two factors: likelihood and consequence. Power cuts are  here deemed to the one of the most common causes of service disruptions so the threat is  associated with a high probability. The loss of client side connections is here regarded as the  most common source of service disruptions.  However, consequences are often local (single site or limited number of customer sites) so that  the overall risk that has been assigned is lower than for several other threats. Two examples of  more severe threats are equipment failures and damage to cables (road works, diggers, etc.). The  probability for power cuts varies within the nation. A majority of the provider’s key assets are  placed in a part that is rarely affected by power cuts compared to other, more exposed areas.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  9  Example 5) Risk assessment – a service provider perspective  The provider has established procedures for performing risk assessments that have been in place  for several years. These cover individual network components, sites and geographical areas. The  risk assessments that are performed are tailored so that the variability of threats governs the  interval between assessments. For example, in areas where there is generally more variability  (over time) in power cuts, risk assessments regarding this aspect would be performed more  regularly than in areas where there is more stability.  Power cuts is in many regions are not considered as a major threat, and is often associated with  a risk level outside the top 5 risks.  In some regions, principally regions undergoing changes and  with more frequent power cuts, the risk level can conceivably motivate a top 5-ranking.  Example 6) Risk assessment – a service provider perspective  The service provider has an established Business Continuity Management program (BCM). Within  this BCM program, there is a phase devoted to business impact analysis and risk assessment  where assets and respective risks are identified and categorized, and associated with appropriate  protection strategies/measures. The provider differentiates between different types of power  cuts:   external power cuts or disturbances (from the external supplier) or   internal power cuts that might be caused by maintenance activities, upgrades or similar.  The risk level that is assigned to power cuts is different for the two types and also depends on the  network component (access network or core network).  In general, the risk is considered as low in  the core network as protection mechanisms will give adequate protection for a wide range of  external power cuts. The main issues are failures to UPS systems and -48V systems, fuel powered  generators and other backup systems. Such issues are very important from an operational  viewpoint as the consequences can be significant.  In access networks, the probability that a power cut leads to service disruptions is higher (more  network elements with a lower protection level than core network elements) but the effects are  also smaller.  Risks associated with power cuts is not always considered a significant threat by providers  Even though the interviews that have been performed as part of this study do not constitute a  sufficiently broad selection of providers, it can be noted that power cuts are typically not  considered as a major threat by the interviewed providers.  3.2 Protection measures taken by service providers  One important aspect regarding the sectors ability to withstand power cuts is the protection levels  that have been implemented in order to overcome shorter or longer power cuts without undue  effects on networks and services. In the web survey, NRAs were asked for information regarding the  time before a power disruption would lead to service disruption within the electronic  communications sector for different network types.7  Table 3 summarizes the results and indicates  7  Results for satellite networks and terrestrial mass communications networks have been omitted as the  number of responses covering these network types is too low to draw any significant conclusions.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  10  that fixed circuit-switched and broadband networks can be expected to exhibit a higher level of  resilience than mobile networks.  Network type < 1 hour 1-2 hours 2-4 hours 4-8 hours > 8 hours  Fixed circuit switched 1 1 2 3 8  Fixed broadband networks 1 2 2 2 7  Mobile networks 2 3 3 3 3  Table 3: Estimation of the time before a power cut leads to service disruptions within the electronic communications  sector based on responses from 23 NRAs.  As stated in section 3.1, vulnerabilities to power cuts tend to be higher in access networks compared  to core components of the networks.  As core platforms and backbone circuits serve both mobile  and fixed networks and are usually located in the same core sites, they have similar levels of  resilience and protection equipment against power cuts at least in the core parts of the networks.  Power cuts may affect more the access component of the mobile network due to the locations of  mobile sites and the difficulty of transporting power supply to them.  Besides that, the mobile network nodes (e.g. base stations) are more exposed to natural phenomena  and other outdoor risks that may impact power supply.  Another reason why fixed networks could have a greater level of resilience can be explained due to  the type of network architecture that is typically more granular in mobile networks than in fixed  networks, thus having more energy dependent components.  NRAs have provided additional clarification and information to this overview through comments.8  One example of such additional information is that certain providers give priority to voice services  over data services and may also prioritize coverage over capacity in mobile networks in order to  prolong network life after a power cut. Another NRA remarks that first priority is always given to  emergency calls, and second priority is given to restore services to customers with service level  agreements. It is also pointed out that the network type, for example the use of 2G or 3G networks  to support a specific service, and how power is supplied in a distributed fashion or from central  offices also lead to variability. Some base stations may only have battery power that is sufficient for  some ten minutes, but where key sites will have reserves that cover several hours.  Mobile networks tend to be more vulnerable to power cuts than fixed networks  While there is considerable variability in resilience against power cuts, between network types and  within networks, mobile networks can be expected to offer less resilience than fixed network  types. This is most likely due to natural consequence of the costs that would come from improving  protection to the large number of network components including base stations that are used.  Providers can implement several different protection measures in order to reach the levels of  resilience that are reported in table 3. One component is the deployment of fixed, fuel-powered  8  Most comments are related to the expected variability within the national sector that was difficult to include  as part of the responses to the web survey.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  11  power generators which typically provide protection during a period that approaches or exceeds 24  hours. Based on the web survey, stationary power generators are principally used in core network  segments more or less independent of the network type (i.e. fixed circuit-switched, broadband and  mobile networks). Uninterruptible power supply with batteries is another protection measure that is  commonly deployed either throughout a network or limited to core network segments. A third  protection measure is the use of transportable power generators that can be moved to a specific site  where there is an ongoing power disruption. In most cases, the deployment of these transportable  power generators is limited with some exceptions. The use of solar cells and similar technologies for  own-generated power supply is rare with some EU Member States reporting some limited  deployment.  In the web survey, NRAs were asked to provide an overall rating of providers’ abilities to cope with  power cuts through existing physical protection measures in relationship to a reasonable balance  between incurred costs and associated risk levels. Table 4 gives an overview of this assessment for  both fixed and mobile networks.  Network type Unsatisfactory Poor Adequate Good  Fixed circuit switched 1 3 12 4  Fixed broadband networks 1 3 12 4  Mobile networks 2 2,5 16,5 —  Table 4: Overall qualitative assessment of protection measures, balancing costs against risk, per network type based on  responses from 23 NRAs.  In general, NRAs consider current protection measures against power cuts as a reasonable  balance between risk and cost  Even though power cuts are a significant cause of incidents within the electronic communications  sector, most NRAs see current protection measures as an adequate balance between the risks  associated with power cuts and the costs of establishing and maintaining protection measures.  Only for mobile networks NRAs consider the current level of protection less than adequate.  The provider view of security measures is naturally broader than the high-level information that  NRAs have at hand. The following examples show some of the considerations that providers make  before establishing a set of resilience measures.  Example 7) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  Protection mechanisms are not applied to individual network elements per se but as part of an  operational risk management methodology. In this methodology, assets are classified in one  category based on technological, societal and commercial aspects. Protection measures are  applied to assets in relationship to this classification rather than only identifying network  element types (for example, base stations) and applying protection measures to them (for  example, batteries).  In general, access networks have some form of protection through batteries. Core network  elements are protected through fixed power generators. The provider also has fuel supplies  stored in underground facilities that can be used during extraordinary circumstances for  transportation and to drive fixed power generators.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  12  The provider has introduced specialized vehicles that have shelter, fuel and communications  infrastructure (Wi-Fi and mobile network infrastructure) that can be transported and quickly re- establish coverage in an area without any other infrastructure in place. The vehicles have been  funded by the provider.  Example 8) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  The provider has four principal protection levels. On level one, assets are placed in facilities with  mains connections as well as UPS solutions and fixed power generators with fuel tanks sufficient  for days of sustained operation even in the absence of mains power. The second level contains  the same protection mechanisms but with smaller fuel generator tanks. On the third level, there  will only be a UPS resource. The fourth level consists of UPS protection but with quite limited  protection time.  In general, the provider prefers to apply protection according to levels 1 and 2 in facilities where  it can exert control (either through direct ownership of the facility or through commercial  agreements with the provider of the data centre or co-location facility). Protection principles are  also applied to be proportionate with site protection mechanisms: A customer that lacks power  protection can make no use of any connectivity as computers and routers will cease to operate  due to a power cut. The provider tries to advise customers to procure protection mechanisms  where it is deemed to be advisable.  Normal redundancy principles will also affect the provider’s ability to withstand power cuts. The  provider does not have access to any transportable power generators.  Example 9) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  The deployment of fixed power backup solutions varies between network segments and  geographical areas. A general rule is that base stations and local exchanges have some form of  UPS system in place. In rural areas, where only a few customers would be affected by a service  disruption due to a power cut, there may not be any UPS system in place at all. In more  populated areas, protection may provide a minimum of 4-6 hours of continued operation.  One motivation for differentiating spare power supply is that many users would also be  negatively impacted by the power cut as they are generally not equipped with own-generated  power supplies. The situation is different for many enterprise customers.  Core network elements are typically protected by fixed power generators. For some sites, 2 or  even 3 power generators can be used to create redundancy. The provider also has the option to  activate the use of transportable power generators.  The provider does evaluate resilience against power cuts as an individual cost driver. A first step  is to establish targets that determine the overall resilience levels that the provider aims to fulfil  followed by the determination of the most cost effective way to achieve these goals.  Example 10) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  Core sites are protected with UPS and batteries (with autonomy between 1 and 2 hours for AC  systems and up to 4 hours for DC systems) and also with stationary power generators (with own  diesel tanks) that will supply the site with sufficient power to continue operation indefinitely as  long as external refuelling can occur at regular intervals. External power generators can also be  used for power supply. If an internal protection measure fails (for example, the fixed power  generator), the provider will attach an external power generator to maintain the same level of  resilience.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  13  In access networks, individual base stations have batteries that give protection of at least two  hours in the event of a power cut. Critical sites in transmission and aggregation network have  battery protection around 8 hours. Assets in these non-core network segments allow them to be  supplied by external power generators.  The provider has a contractor that will transport and deploy mobile power generators. The time  between a decision to initiate a deployment and when a mobile power generator has started  providing power to a network element is subject to geographical variations but is typically  between 2 and 4 hours.  Batteries incur a high cost to procure and maintain but are deemed to be cost effective in the  sense that they ensure that services can be maintained with zero interruption, even in the event  of short duration power cuts or temporary disturbances from the external power supplier.  Example 11) Protection measures – a service provider perspective  Power is remotely supervised by an entity within the provider’s organization which provides  continuous every day, all day  alarm monitoring and technical measurements from all power  elements including electrical line connections, DC batteries, UPS systems, generators and cetera.  Approximately 8 000 network sites are supervised by this entity and all power cut incidents are  remotely managed in coordination with local field technicians, external contractors and power  suppliers.   All network sites are protected with DC batteries and UPS systems.   Medium network sites are also protected with fixed power generators   Strategic network sites are also protected with redundant fixed power generators and  electrical line connections.   The provider has geographically deployed mobile power generators to attend to local  power outages   The provider has five Emergency Logistical Bases with large number of mobile power  generators for attend severe and extensive power outages with regional or national  implications.  These protection mechanisms are a relevant cost driver. However, they are considered to be the  best solution in order to guarantee the availability and quality of services to customers.  3.3 Restoration after power cuts – sector internal cooperation and lessons  learned  The potential negative impact to society of power cuts causing service disruptions within the  electronic communications sector is principally determined by two factors. The first factor is the  security measures described in the previous section. The second factor is the ability of providers to  act efficiently to restore services and networks. Such actions will typically involve contacts with a  number of parties:   an internal or external (to the provider) field service organization that is responsible for the  transport and provisioning of transportable power generators or other temporary solutions,   other providers where the sharing of information and resources can lower service  restoration times,   various actors, such as private customers, other providers and authorities, that require  information from the providers about the service disruption, and  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  14   the energy supplier for information regarding the power cut and forecast regarding  restoration times.  Table 5 provides an overview of an assessment of providers’ individual abilities and the providers’  abilities to cooperate with other providers within the electronic communications sector to respond  to power cuts and act efficiently to minimize service disruptions and restore services after power  cuts.  Response and Cooperation Unsatisfactory Poor Adequate Good  Individual abilities — 3,5 12,5 2  Intra-sector cooperation — 8 9 1  Table 5: Overall qualitative evaluation of service provider’s response and cooperation capabilities after power cuts  Cooperation within the electronic communications sector can be improved  The NRA’s assessment point to a problem where intra-sector cooperation between providers are  deemed to range from poor to adequate which is less than ideal as cooperation becomes  increasingly important as the severity of the power cuts and challenges of the restoration effort  grows.  Information sharing is a critical enabler to the successful cooperation between providers but also to  inform authorities and the general public regarding the impact and forecast for restorations after a  service disruption has started. Table 6 shows that information exchange between providers, such as  web-based solutions or contact paths to NOCs, which enable providers to share information  regarding impact and forecast for restorations are to be considered as limited to a few actors and or  with limited functionality. Information exchange to the authorities and the general public is better or  slightly better.  Information exchange Limited to few  actors and with  limited func.

The situation is better for the information  that goes to authorities and to the general public.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  15  3.4 Power cut resilience – commercial aspects  Improvements to resilience measures for power cuts do not have to come through legislation. One  alternative is commercial drivers rewarding a service provider, who places a higher emphasis on  power cut resilience measures compared to its competitors, with increased market share and  profitability. Another alternative is that the overall level of resilience is the value rather than its  individual components, where power cut resilience would be one of these components. It is also  likely that different market segments make these evaluations differently.  NRAs were asked to assess how different customer segments evaluate resilience against power cuts  as a differentiating factor in their choice of service provider. The same question was also asked  taking the provider perspective, with combined results shown in table 7.  Customer segment  (Service provider view)  Little individual  value  Some  individual  value  Some collective  value with  other  measures  Significant  value with  other  measures  Ordinary customers 13 (10) 3 (2) 1 (5)  — (—)  Private companies 5 (4) 2 (5) 9 (6) 1 (2)  Authorities 5 (3) 1 (4) 5 (7) 6 (3)  Table 7: Overall qualitative assessment on how different customer segments place value on power cut resilience based  on two different perspectives: the customer perspective and the service provider perspective (in parentheses).  A further commercial aspect is if private companies, authorities and other organisations that require  a higher degree of resilience against power cuts, can and will act to seek assurances from their  respective providers of this increased resilience level. This would typically mean that providers  deploy a mix of fixed power generators and UPS systems with batteries in all network segments that  serve this specific customer. Whilst this may be realistic in some circumstances, in particular where  the need is coupled to a single or a few geographical locations, it is perhaps not realistic that this  type of agreement would lead to a higher general, network wide level of resilience.  Example 12) Commercial aspects – a service provider perspective  According to the provider, resilience against power cuts is not regarded as a differentiating  factor, compared to factors such as geographical coverage. The provider has large commercial  contracts with authorities and companies and will not be evaluated for resilience against power  cuts but for resilience as a whole. However, the provider will not divest responsibility regarding a  service disruption caused by third party power supply failure and place the blame on an actor  within the energy sector.  This means all in all that overall resilience is the key according to the provider. Power cuts can be  regarded as one threat that the provider needs to be aware of and consider as part of network  and service continuity planning. But as stated before, according to the interviewed provider,  power cuts are not considered to be the most important issue to consider in this regard.  Example 13) Commercial aspects – a service provider perspective  According to the provider, reliability of electronic communications services as a whole is an  important factor rather than resilience to power cuts. One reason for this statement is that  power supply in the country in question is relatively reliable and there is only one major power  distributor without effective alternatives, although there may be several power retailers. Other  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  16  providers also depend on the same power supplier and are likely to have implemented similar  protection mechanisms. Power supply is understood as a utility and not as a differentiating  factor, therefore resilience against power cuts would not be a point of concern if SLAs were  properly defined in terms of continuity and quality of supply.  Special customers, like customers in the corporate segment and public administration, that seek  additional information regarding reliability never ask specific questions regarding power supply  issues but may ask for information regarding the resilience of telecommunications equipment  and transmission lines (circuits).  Market forces are not deemed to be a significant contributor to the direct improvement to power  cut resilience  NRAs make the assessment that ordinary customers place little value on the extent to which  providers are resilient to power cuts. In the same manner, private companies or authorities are  unlikely to place value on power cut resilience measures specifically but are more likely to place  some value on resilience measures as a whole. Depending on the distribution between the revenue  bases for private customers and other customer segments, an increased market demand that  specifically addresses power cut resilience and leads to increased power cut resilience levels may  be regarded as an unlikely development.  3.5 Power cut resilience – 2011 and 2012 incident reports  As part of this study, ENISA has analysed 12 incidents from 2011 and 10 incidents from 2012 that  were reported to ENISA and the European Commission and that involved power supply failure  causing the incident, either as initial cause or subsequent cause.  In 2011 the four longest lasting incidents were caused by natural phenomena in the form of three  storms and one instance of heavy snowfall. In several cases, the power cut on its own did not  determine the duration of the service outage as five of the incidents had hardware or software  failures as secondary cause. The two incidents with the largest number of affected users were both  due to power surges (rather than power cuts) combined with hardware and software failures.  In 2012 the two longest lasting incidents were caused by natural phenomena, one storm and one  instance of heavy snowfall. Power cut was not the only cause. In one case there was a combined  power cut and a failure in the provider’s emergency power supply which led to an outage that lasted  7 hours and affected more than one million subscribers.  We distinguish two types of events:  • Power cuts where existing protection measures work as intended but do not give the  necessary protection resulting in service disruptions  • Power cuts where existing protection measures do not work as intended adding  to the  length of the service disruption9  Applying this classification to the incidents reports from 2011 and 2012 shows that around half of all  reported incidents that were caused by power cuts can be attributed to this second category.  9  The addition to the length of a service disruption is made in reference to a situation where the protection  measures would have worked as intended by their design and implementation.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  17  Ssdfsdf 2011 2012  Security  measures  worked as  intended  A total of six events affecting from a  few tens of thousands subscribers up  to a million subscribers  A total of four events affecting from more  than 10 000 up to a few hundred thousand  subscribers ranging from a number of  hours to several days  Security  measures  failed  Six incidents affecting hundreds of  thousands of subscribers up to and  over a million subscribers.  Six incidents affecting a few thousand  subscribers up to several hundred  thousand subscribers during a few hours  up to and over 24 hours  Table 8: Categorization of incident reports based on incident reports from 2011 and 2012 depending on whether or not  existing protection measures worked as intended.  This leads to the following finding.  In half of the reported incidents involving power cuts, security measures did not work as intended,  which contributed to the impact on networks and services.  The incident reports show that incidents where existing protection measures did not work as  intended were as frequent and severe as incidents where protection measures did work as intended.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  18  4 The utilities domain  In the previous section, the focus was on the electronic communications sector describing current  protection measures as well as sector internal information exchange mechanisms without including  information that describes more specific details on the interactions between the energy and  electronic communications sectors. In this section we look at how resilience of power supply is  addressed in the energy sector and cooperation mechanisms between the two sectors.  4.1 Continuity of supply – national statistics and variability  Power supply is a critical dependency for the electronic communications sector. This dependency is  shared between EU nations. However, there may be national and even regional differences between  the continuity of power supply. Continuity of supply concerns interruptions in power supply and  focuses on events where the voltage at the supply terminals of a network user drops to zero or  nearly (practically) zero. Continuity of supply can be described by various quality dimensions, for  example the number of interruptions per year.  A large majority of EU Member States monitor continuity of supply10 even though Member States  may apply different definitions of an interruption11. This monitoring enables regulatory authorities  to follow how the continuity of supply evolves over time, and is not confined to specific incidents  where a specific number of users are affected over a more extended period of time as follows from  the incident reporting practices introduced in the electronic communications sector from Article 13a  in the Framework directive.  Figure 3: The number of unplanned, long interruptions per year excluding exceptional events. The voltage level (EHV,  HV, MV and LV) relates to where the incidents occur.  Figure 3 indicates that the number of long interruptions per year varies both between Member  States and over time. Most Member States show stability or improvements in this regard. Storms  and heavy snowfall will typically affect energy networks that utilize a large number of overhead  10  All 26 countries that have contributed to the CEER benchmarking report.  11  For example, most countries define interruptions longer than three minutes as a long interruption but there  are exceptions. The Netherlands do not distinguish between transient, short or long interruptions. All  interruptions longer than at least 5 seconds are monitored.

Figure 4 shows that  there are considerable variations between EU Member States in this regard.  Figure 4: The length of low voltage circuits differentiating between underground and overhead circuits  Example 14) Continuity of supply in Sweden  The Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate (Ei) is responsible for the supervision of electricity grid  operators to ensure that they fulfil their obligations in accordance with the Swedish Electricity  Act. One such aspect is the supply of electricity of good quality, where power failures are used as  one indicator to monitor this quality. Figure 5  below shows that the frequency of power failures  varies between years and also depending on the type of electricity network (rural, municipal and  mixed networks).  Figure 5: The average number of power failures per customer and year in local networks in Sweden with a  subdivision between rural (blue), municipal (green) and mixed (red) networks  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  20  Similar statistics also point to variations between power grid operators leading to the conclusions  that the continuity of power supply can be expected to exhibit regional and also local variability.  The same trend can be expected in other EU Member States.  Variations in the continuity of power supply are to be expected  Indicators that characterize power cuts can be expected to exhibit both national, regional and to  some extent also local variation. This means that resilience measures within the electronic  communications sector could exhibit the same type of variability while still preserving the same  level of protection. A level of resilience that is appropriate in one Member State, as a suitable  balance between cost and risk, may not be appropriate for another Member State.  4.2 Specialized protection measures  Providers in the electronic communications sector can complement spare power systems, in the  form of batteries, fixed and transportable power generators, with other protection measures. One  such protection measure is to feed a high-value site via two independent energy distribution paths  with as much diversity as possible.12 Another possible option is to seek commercial agreements  where the energy network owner agrees to provide increased reliability as regulated by service level  agreements.  Table 9 indicates that such additional resilience increasing measures are not rare but also not  common practice.  Ssdfsdf Yes No Other  Specialized protection measures 9 8 6  Commercial agreements 5 9 9  Table 9: NRA assessment of specialized protection measures and their application within the electronic communications  sector  Example 15) Specialized protection measures – a service provider perspective  Contracts with suppliers within the energy sector contain texts which are related to availability  and business continuity based on ISO-standards. These texts do not describe specific service levels  but oblige the energy supplier to implement practices to monitor and manage availability as well  as develop business continuity plans.  SLAs are deemed to be less suitable to provide guarantees in case of natural disasters and similar  events of an extraordinary nature as few providers will accept such stipulations without force  majeure clauses.  12  Low-voltage energy distribution networks are often monopolies within a given geographic area, which  means that the level of resilience that can be achieved may be limited.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  21  4.3 Restoration after power cuts – cross-sector cooperation and lessons  learned  The previous sections, section 4.1 and 4.2, have described the variability regarding power cuts that  can be expected and specialized protection measures that principally govern how often service  disruptions can occur. A broader view is provided if cross-sector cooperation aspects are also  included. Such cooperation is of particular importance under more severe power cuts where  information exchange and coordination is essential.13  The number of power cuts that have required or could have benefited from coordinated restoration  efforts involving actors from the electronic communications sector and the energy sector varies  between EU member states. Some EU member states point to two to three such events where  others report a lower number or even that no such event has occurred during the last ten years. One  NRA points to three major storms during the period in which between 48 000 and 115 000  subscribers of fixed telephony were affected. In a similar manner, mobile networks were also  affected over regional areas that over time decreased to local areas. Another reported instance was  a massive explosion which destroyed a large part of the power producing capability in the member  state.  There is significant commonality between the lessons learned which can collectively be summarized  as follows:  • there is a general need for improved cooperation and information exchange between the  electronic communications and energy sectors,  • information exchange regarding prioritization can bring significant benefits during the  aftermath of an energy shortage situation,  • each situation is different during major emergencies and the useful pre-planning that can be  done is limited, and  • in case of more significant outages, information about power outages from electric  distribution companies should be quickly distributed to providers and be of high quality. E- mail or other means of communication may be useful here.  An overall assessment of providers’ abilities to cooperate with actors within the energy sector to  respond to power cuts and act efficiently to minimize service disruptions and restore services after  power cuts, indicate a variability ranging from poor to adequate showing that there is room for  improvement regarding cross-sector cooperation.  Cooperation Unsatisfactory Poor Adequate Good  Cross-sector cooperation 1 7,5 6,5 2  Table 10: Overall qualitative NRA evaluation of provider’s cooperation capabilities with the energy sector after power  cuts  In the same manner, information exchange mechanisms that can be used to distribute information  regarding ongoing service disruptions typically are not widespread and with desired functionality.  13  It should be noted that there is a mutual dependency as the energy sector will, to a large extent, rely on  electronic communications both during normal operation and during restoration efforts.

Energy sector 4 6 4 1  Table 11: Overall qualitative NRA evaluation of intra sector and cross-sector information exchange mechanisms  Exercises can be regarded as a complimentary tool to resilience increasing measures, and can be  expected to improve cooperation. Overall, the number of exercises that have been held varies  between EU Member States, from none to five or six and even more. Examples of lessons learned  from Member States is that whilst providers are used to handling power outage, there is still some  room for improvements when it comes to further strengthening cooperation and information  exchange.  Example 16) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  Power cuts is the single most common cause of service disruptions according to the provider, and  the provider is indeed used to dealing with the consequences of power cuts. This experience is for  example used in contacts with clients so that customer service representatives ask the customer  if they have power on-site and if it can be confirmed that relevant equipment has power.  The provider can also contact the energy company but this contact does not give any form of  priority compared to ordinary home owners. It is assumed that functions that have a more  central function to society have more direct contact paths to energy suppliers.  Example 17) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  A working group (WG) has been established under the Ministry for the Interior. This WG collects  actors from the electronic communications, energy and transportation sectors that fulfil some  vital function to society and may need to collaborate during the restoration effort after an  extraordinary event such as an earthquake or heavy storm. The WG collects between 20 and 25  actors. Personal relationships have been formed between key people in the electronic  communications and energy sectors as part of the WG. These relationships are of critical  importance to facilitate efficient cooperation during a crisis.  It has been found that the cooperation that is established through the WG, associated training  and exercises, together form a good basis for larger restoration efforts, as no plan can account  for the multitude of variations that can exist between different events. For example, two recent  severe natural events occurred in regions that had been assigned to a low risk with respect to the  specific threat. Exercises are held at least annually on national level, collecting actors from  several sectors. On a regional level, the same type of exercises is held at least twice annually.  Example 18) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  Several elements of cooperation are lacking. Information sharing is one component here where  providers within the electronic communications sector would like to have information regarding  planned maintenance and power cuts in advance and they would also like to have notifications  regarding ongoing power cuts or disturbances. Another aspect here is that providers are treated  no different than a domestic customer, who is referred to general customer support, when  reporting or requesting information regarding an ongoing power cut from the power company.  Example 19) Cooperation, exercises and operational experiences – a service provider perspective  The provider states that about two to three power cuts annually during the last ten years have  required or could have benefited from coordinated restoration efforts involving actors from the  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  23  electronic communications sector and the energy sectors to minimize service disruption after  power outages with national or regional impact.  The provider also points to a daily need of  coordinated restoration efforts with the owners of the energy networks in order to minimize  service disruption after power outages with local impact.  Lessons learned are:   There is a need to know, in real time, actions and estimations with respect to restoration  in energy networks in order to prioritize and mobilize our human and material protection  resources for communications network sites.   Energy network owners must prioritize repair of power supply to important  communications network sites. This prioritization should be coordinated with  communications service providers.  Cross-sector cooperation and information exchange can be improved  Efficient service restoration requires cooperation and information exchange between the energy  sector and the electronic communications sector, and improvements in this domain can decrease  the negative impact of power cuts in general and more severe power cuts in particular. Exercises  can be a useful tool to practice and maintain an established collaboration.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  24  5 The utilities policy domain  Actors within the utilities domain are subject to legislation which will affect power cut restoration  efforts. The primary such influence is through prioritization schemes where assets within the  communications sector are given preferential treatment, and through regulation that affect the  quality of power supply as is described in this section.  5.1 Prioritization schemes  The service restoration time (in the electronic communications sector) after a power cut will vary  depending on a number of factors, ranging from meteorological conditions to access to  transportable power generators that can be used to continue network operation. There are basically  three principal policy areas that will influence the severity of service disruptions, in the case of more  severe power cuts, in order to deploy transportable power generators and maintain their operation  together with that of fixed power generators:14   a preference scheme where power supply would be restored to assets in the electronic  communications sector with priority,   preference schemes that would give providers priority access to transportation resources,  and   preference schemes that would give providers priority access to fuel.  The parties that would participate in preference schemes, outside the providers and power grid  operators, would vary depending on national conditions.  As indicated in table 12, only a few NRAs report the existence of such preference schemes.  S Yes No Other  Priority restoration  2 7 14  Priority transport  — 9 14  Priority to fuel 2 8 13  Table 12: Existence of preference schemes that could decrease the negative impact of more severe power cuts  Example 20) A national example of a priority restoration scheme  One NRA in an interview points to a preference scheme that builds on national regulations within  the energy sector requiring energy distribution companies to have a list of priority customers and  also the reason behind the prioritization. Power would here be restored to customers respecting  this priority order even though the order would not always be preserved, as power companies  resolve problems in the high-voltage network first and then low-voltage network to which assets  in the electronic communications sector is typically connected. Some base stations and other  telecommunications installations are on this national list. In the low-voltage network there are  many prioritized customers like hospitals that will be higher up on the list.  14  These three areas are complemented by general regulation, as described in section 5.2. A further policy  domain is priority schemes where, during a general energy shortage situation, assets within the electronic  communications sector would not be disconnected while other customers that do not fulfil an equally  important function to society would be. This situation may not be caused by a power cut and is not treated  here even though the electronic communications sector would certainly benefit from this type of policy.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  25  The NRA does not have enough working experience or statistics to state that the priority  restoration schemes have led to a quicker restoration of electronic communications services.  Example 21) Prioritization – a service provider perspective  Prioritization is one of the issues that can be said to be within the realm of the WG (cf. example  17).  During an extraordinary event, members within the WG could interact to determine suitable  actions to minimize the effects of the event on society. The prioritization scheme could therefore  be regarded as an informal arrangement rather than a set of pre-established rules. The  prioritization scheme has been used operationally.  Example 22) Prioritization – a service provider perspective  The provider has no special contractual agreement with the power company that contains SLA- based requirements. The provider has tried to establish a priority communication channel with  the power company and also to provide a list of critical sites/assets of the access network but,  considering the few past experience, the provider does not know if this mechanism is effective  when needed in critical situations.  There seem to be few national examples of priority schemes within the utilities domain  Of those intyerviewed, only two member states point to the existence of national preference  schemes even though such schemes can be expected to lead to some improvements in certain,  more severe situations.  5.2 Regulation of quality of power supply within the European energy sector  European energy regulators work to promote well-functioning and competitive EU energy markets  so that consumers get fair prices, the widest choice of supplier and the best quality of supply  possible15. To achieve the third goal, ensuring that consumers are given the best quality of supply  possible, regulatory oversight and control within the European energy sector is principally exercised  in three areas:   the continuity of supply which relates to the number and duration of power cuts,   voltage quality that relates to the power surges or dips that affect electronic equipment, and   commercial quality that concerns the timeliness and efficiency of the customer service  provided by electricity companies.  The three areas influence the electronic communications sector’s ability to withstand and react to  power cuts in different ways. The first area, continuity of supply, is principally linked to protection  measures in the form of UPS systems, fixed and transportable power generators that are applied to  network elements in order to avoid or suitably minimize service interruptions after power cuts. In  the same manner, network elements need to be equipped with protection measures against power  surges and dips. The third area will primarily influence, indirectly rather than directly, the electronic  communications sector’s ability to react to various forms of power cuts and act efficiently to  maintain and restore services to consumers.  A large number of energy regulators within Europe have adopted regulatory instruments to maintain  or improve continuity of supply, as a balance to other regulation that aims to increase market  15  CEER 5th Benchmarking Report, page iii.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  26  efficiency16. Quality incentive schemes, through reward or penalty schemes or incentives, have  evolved within parts of the European energy sector as a means to optimise continuity of supply  levels. The use of rewards, penalties and a combination of the two varies between Member States  and is also applied differently to different energy network levels17. The main intention of these  schemes is to keep quality levels at an efficient socio-economic level.  Example 23) Energy sector regulation in Great Britain  Incentive rates are used in Great Britain to reward or penalise distribution companies based on  their performance regarding continuity standards.18 Companies must reach targets for customer  interruptions and customer minutes lost which are set during the price control process, with  exceptional events excluded. Each distribution company performance determines the resulting  penalty or reward through a complex formula with a lag of two years.  Great Britain also employs a compensation scheme that distinguishes between domestic and  business customers. Domestic customers are eligible for a 54£ compensation after the first 18  hours of interruptions. Business customers are eligible to twice that amount for the same  duration.  Example 24) Energy sector regulation in Sweden  Energy distribution companies may also be subject to more direct legal obligations as is the case  in Sweden. The Electricity Act (1997:857) stipulates that network concessionaires shall ensure  that outages in the transmission of electrical power to an electricity consumer never exceed  twenty-four hours. One exception to this rule is when a concessionaire can show that the outage  results from:   an impediment outside the concessionaire's control,   which the concessionaire could not reasonably be expected to have anticipated, and the   consequences of which the concessionaire could neither have reasonably avoided or  overcome.  Storms and similar events would typically not be regarded as an exception to this obligation.  The energy sector seems to have progressed further in their assessment of obligations and socio- economic effects  The energy sector has worked for a number of years to establish different forms of incentive  schemes that include limits to the number and duration of power cuts as well as other quality  dimensions. The evaluation of socio-economic effects has been an integral part of this process.  16  Examples of market efficiency regulation can be price or revenue-cap mechanisms.  17  Ibid, page 41.  18  Ibid, page 43.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  27  6 Assessing the need for improvements and proposals  In this section we take stock of the need for resilience improvements and of proposals from  providers and NRAs for measures that can be taken to reach these improvements. The material in  this section and in section 7 (evaluation of possible actions), together form the input for  recommendations presented in section 8.  6.1 Assessing the need for improvements to power cut resilience  The need for improved power cut resilience within the electronic communications sector can be  evaluated from two perspectives:   a societal perspective in which the effects of service disruptions caused by power cuts are  evaluated in dimensions that can include the possible loss of lives and economic losses,   a commercial (service provider) perspective in which the costs of introducing resilience  increasing measures are evaluated against the possible monetary gains, and  As we shall see, the two perspectives can lead to different results. Taking the first perspective, as  shown in table 13, shows that most NRAs consider it to be important to increase power cut  resilience compared to other risk mitigation activities.  Unimportant Not very  important  Important Critical  Need for improvement — 3 15 1  Table 13: Qualitative evaluation of the importance of increasing power cut resilience within the electronic  communications sector from an NRA perspective  NRAs also pointed to a number of resilience aspects that are deemed to be more important, for  example:   decreasing the number of software induced errors as service disruptions caused by software  issues are fairly frequent and can also give rise to national disruptions for several hours,   implementation of priority schemes, increasing redundancy and improvements to business  continuity planning,   measures that prevent cyber-attacks and introduce disaster recovery procedures, and   protection measures against overloads.  One NRA also identified human errors, hardware and software failures, damage through excavations  and digging activities without ranking.  One NRA stated that there probably is not much that is more important than power supply aspects  for electronic communications resilience but notes that it does not necessarily mean that this  resilience area needs improvements. The NRA was here of the opinion that providers react and cope  well so that the current level of resilience may have an optimal balance between resilience and cost  already. If this optimal level has not yet been established, the NRA stated that it may be more  efficient to improve the resilience of the power supply itself, rather than of the electronic  communications sector, noting that the dependency between the two sectors is two-way.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  28  A majority of NRAs consider it to be important to increase resilience against power cuts compared  to other risk mitigation activities.  Even though  most NRAs see current protection measures as an adequate balance between the risks  associated with power cuts and the costs of establishing and maintaining protection measures, NRAs  still consider it to be important to increase power cut resilience compared to other risk mitigation  activities.  Whilst the NRA view points at the importance of increasing power cut resilience, the provider  perspective indicates a lower evaluation as the following examples show.  Example 25)  Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  The provider considers several other threats to have risk levels greater than what is considered  for power cuts. Examples of such more severe threats are natural disasters with direct impact on  networks, cyber-attacks, civil works and copper thefts.  It is always possible to improve the capability to withstand and respond to power cuts. At  present, the provider has no immediate plans to make such improvements. However, the  provider is acutely aware of the importance of electronic communications services to society as a  whole.  Example 26) Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  The provider places higher emphasis on equipment resilience than resilience against power cuts  and sees some, limited room for improvement with respect to their own operation’s resilience  against power cuts. Customer improvements are a far more important issue in this regard. One  other improvement would be information provided by the energy sector regarding power  disruptions which would make the provider more efficient even though resilience would not be  increased.  Example 27) Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  A number of flooding incidents have occurred in the last 5 to 10 years and seem to be increasing.  Physical risks would be regarded as a more significant set of threats that require more attention  for the future. Logical threats however, for example if someone would break the encryption on  SIM-cards, could lead to more significant commercial consequences.  An important aspect is to ensure that the power sector is as resilient as the electronic  communications sector. One possible improvement is the better understanding of recovery  procedures and resilience aspects between actors in the two sectors.  Example 28) Increasing power cut resilience – a service provider perspective  Current internal protection measures, including the possibility to deploy mobile power generators  by an external contractor, are at a level where the provider considers itself to be well prepared to  deal with external power cuts. One remark must be done given that there are only 5 to 6 big  contractors that supply mobile generators in the country, which could lead to a capacity shortage  in case there is a major and prolonged power failure that impact a significant part of the access  network sites.  The provider regards its current protection measures for dealing with power cuts as appropriate  when compared to other risks, given that it has N+1 protection in core sites and battery supply in  access networks. There is currently no plan to further improve investment levels regarding  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  29  protection equipment to withstand power cuts, although there is still room for improvements  regarding resilience architecture and procedural enhancements, at the internal level in the  provider’s and at the external level with the power suppliers.  6.2 Proposals to improve resilience against power supply failures  6.2.1 Proposals from providers  Interviewed providers have brought forward a number of proposals that could be used to improve  power supply resilience:   The establishment of an EU level round table forum where providers from different sectors  participate to discuss protection mechanisms and experiences from events so that lessons  learned and procedures are shared as much as possible.   The establishment of some form of commercial incentives for providers to ensure that they  consider protection mechanisms that go beyond those which are applied for commercial  purposes. One possible alternative in this regard is tax relief.   The establishment of priority and ease of access to the sites by the civil protection  authorities for the emergency teams of the providers and the power suppliers, as well as  giving priority in the provisioning of diesel reserves for power generators.   The establishment of increased protection of network sites by the police authorities to  ensure continuity of operations, both for access network sites (given the increased  occurrence of batteries thefts) and for core sites (given the possible public disorders due to  social and political instability).   The establishment of a priority customer relationship between providers and power  companies.   Improved information exchange mechanisms that allow for continuous sharing regarding  ongoing power disturbances and predictions of restoration times.   Improved early warnings and information sharing from civil protection authorities regarding  storms and fires to enable the operators to prepare for and efficiently work to minimize  service disruptions.  Providers see several  measures that could improve resilience against power supply failures  As part of the interviews, a number of providers have pointed to actions that could improve the  resilience against power cuts. Even though the number of providers that have been interviewed is  limited, the finding leads to a recommendation to NRAs to collect and evaluate different proposals  before any action is taken.  6.2.2 Proposals from NRAs  In the web survey and interviews also NRAs pointed to a number of possible actions and  observations that can be taken to reach improvements:   an increased use of fixed power generators,   well prepared crisis management in each critical infrastructure company,  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  30   improving customer understanding of the limitations of the current communications  services related to power cut resilience to allow market pressure to increase commercial  incentives to improve, starting with government and big business customers,   forcing providers to establish connections with multiple suppliers of electricity in a number  of points in order to have an alternative, and   incentives for closer collaboration between providers and the energy sector.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  31  7 Possible actions and evaluation of actions to address identified findings  This study started from the knowledge that a significant number of the major incidents that have  been reported to ENISA during 2011 and 2012 can, directly or indirectly, be attributed to power cuts.  The material in sections 2 to 5 has described aspects of power supply dependencies from four  different perspectives. In chapter 6, providers and NRAs have given their opinion on the need for  improvements regarding resilience against power cuts, and they have given proposals to increase  resilience. The discussions in section 2 to 6 have led to a total of 16 findings. These findings are in  this section collected and attributed with possible actions without taking a stand, as described in  table 14 below.  The material in this section and in section 6 form input to the recommendations presented in section  8.  7.1 Possible actions to address identified findings  The table below describes possible actions to address the identified findings from the previous  sections.  Domain Finding Possible actions  Electronic  communications  policy domain  Few NRAs have implemented  legislation related to power cut  resilience  There are four principal options to decrease the  negative impact of service disruptions due to  power cuts:  a) improve the quality of supply in the energy  sector (reducing the threat)  b) increasing resilience in the electronic  communications sector through legislation  c) increasing resilience in the electronic  communications through state funding or  private-public partnerships  d) trust that market forces will lead to an  increase in power cut resilience over time  Most NRAs do not perform risk  assessments which include the risks  for network and service outages due  to power cuts  Each NRA may not be obliged to perform risk  assessments as part of their remit. The  responsibility to perform such risk assessments  may also be performed by some other  government agency.  ENISA’s view is that NRAs should consider  national risk assessments as standard practice  in order to evaluate different threats and  consider appropriate actions. Power cuts is one  threat category that is important to consider in  this regard. No other option is therefore  associated with this finding.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  32  State funding and public-private  partnerships that concern power cut  resilience are rare  The practice of using state funding and public- private partnerships is one possible activity that  can contribute to increasing power cut  resilience.  A majority of NRAs consider it to be  important to increase resilience  against power cuts compared to  other risk mitigation activities  The finding is not attributed to an individual  action but can be considered as important  motivations for the recommendations that are  given in chapter 7.  Electronic  communications  domain  Risks associated with power cuts is  not always considered a significant  threat by providers  Providers typically perform risk assessment  based on a commercial perspective. The  interviews indicate that most providers can be  expected to have established a number of  protection measures that are considered to be  sufficient from commercial and current  legislative perspectives.  No specific action is attributed to this finding.  Mobile networks tend to be more  vulnerable to power cuts than fixed  networks  This fact should be included in risk assessments  where society’s increased reliance on mobile  services should be included.  In general, NRAs consider current  protection measures against power  cuts as a reasonable balance  between risk and cost  The conclusion that ENISA draws here is that it  is by no means certain that additional resilience  increasing measures should be mandated.  Depending on national circumstances priorities  between different types of existing security  measures for resilience could be defined, cf.  section 6.1.  In the case of any new action taken, for  example the introduction of specific obligations,  it should be preceded by a cost-benefit analysis  that includes other possible options.  Cooperation within the electronic  communications sector can be  improved  The primary actions that can be taken is:  a) the introduction of tools and routines for  information exchange, and  b) strategies and procedures that can be used  to increase cooperation with exercises as  one example.  Information exchange mechanisms  between providers can be improved  Market forces are not deemed to be  a significant contributor to the direct  improvement to power cut resilience  This finding is primarily an indication that  improvements are to be sought elsewhere and  is therefore not attributed to a specific action.  The cost-benefit analysis should include this  option as one alternative along with state  funding or private-public partnerships.  In half of the reported incidents The finding is treated as part of a  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  33  involving power cuts, security  measures did not work as intended,  which contributed to the impact on  networks and services.  recommendation to NRAs to follow up on the  power supply related incidents and take lessons  learned from them to continuously work for  improvements of the security measures.  Providers see several measures that  could improve resilience against  power supply failures  The finding is treated as part of a  recommendation to NRAs to liaise with  providers and other NRAs to collect and  evaluate different options to increase power cut  resilience as an initial measure.  Utilities domain  Variations in the continuity of power  supply are to be expected  Risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses  need to include a relevant threat description  that includes information regarding the  characteristics and frequency of power cuts.  The finding is not on its own attributed to an  action.  Cross-sector cooperation and  information exchange can be  improved  The possible actions are captured above adding  the energy sector to the reach of tools for  information exchange and improved  cooperation.  Utilities policy  domain  There seems to be few national  examples of priority schemes within  the utilities domain  As the power cut threat varies between EU  member states, the most appropriate action is  to make a national evaluation of the need for  and components in a priority scheme.  The energy sector seems to have  progressed in their assessment of  obligations and socio-economic  effects  Some policies and measures in the energy  sector may be interesting to learn from in the  electronic communications sector, for instance  incentive schemes.  Table 14: Mapping between findings and possible actions  7.2 Evaluation of actions  The findings, proposals and possible actions lead to the identification of a number of general actions  to consider:   Introducing or strengthening legislation in the electronic communications sector placing  stricter requirements on providers   Introducing or strengthening legislation in the energy sector placing stricter requirements on  the frequency and duration of power cuts   Increasing commercial incentives for providers in the electronic communications sector   Improved routines and technical systems for collaboration and information exchange  between the two sectors   Increased number of cross-sector exercises geared towards restoration after significant  power cuts   Introduction of priority restoration schemes within the utilities domain  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  34   Increase the number of transportable power generators that are available for use in the  electronic communications sectors.  NRAs were asked to evaluate these actions in two dimensions. The first dimension describes the  improvements that can come from the implementation of the action and is shown in table 15.

Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  35  8 Recommendations  This study attempts to address two principal questions:   Which measures should be implemented to reduce the frequency of disruptions and outages  in the electronic communications sector caused by power supply failures?, and   Which measures should be introduced to improve the electronic communications sector’s  ability to handle disruptions and outages caused by power supply failures?  To meet these two questions in our recommendations, we propose a subdivision of power cuts  within one principal, the duration of the power cuts. The duration we divide in three categories,  power cuts of shorter, medium and longer duration.  Power cuts of shorter duration range from sub-second voltage fluctuations to failures in the order of  a few hours.  Power cuts of medium duration are failures that last from a few hours up to about 10 hours.  Power cuts of longer duration we categorise as extended failures lasting longer than about 10 hours.  Longer power cuts are typically related to natural causes such as severe storms, heavy snowfall,  floods, earthquakes et cetera, and where it is no longer reasonable to expect providers to introduce  resilience measures that are sufficient to avoid network and service disruptions or outages.  However, from a society perspective, the need for measures to reduce the impact from such causes  is extremely high. Here, efficient joint mitigation activities within and between sectors are the  principal goals.  The recommendations are mainly aimed at NRAs and providers, and some of the recommendations  also address the energy sector and civil protection authorities.  Recommendation 1: NRAs should analyse the frequency and impact of network and  service outages caused by power cuts.  One finding of this study is that NRAs typically do not perform risk assessments that include power  cuts. We believe such risk assessments are important tools to evaluate if extra measures are needed  to improve resilience of networks and services in the face of power cuts. Important input for such  risk assessments would be incident reports about past disruptions and outages caused by power  cuts, and statistics about the number of users affected and the duration. This characterization could  then enable NRAs, aided by information from providers, to relate these statistics to electronic  communications effects through dimensions such as:   the expected number of service disruptions within the electronic communications sector  within a given time frame,   the length of these service disruptions in time,   the impact in terms of number of users and services affected, and   the severity of these incidents, distinguishing between degradations and full outages.  The NRA would then attempt to determine a risk level based on power cut statistics and the societal  impact of the risks related to power cuts.  Recommendation 2: NRAs should liaise with providers, energy regulators and other NRAs  to collect good practices that could be used to increase resilience against power cuts.  These good practices should be considered as part of a cost-benefit analysis  (recommendation 3).  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  36  The providers that have been interviewed as part of this study have brought forward a number of  suggestions that could be used to increase resilience against power supply failures. Before any  actions are taken by NRAs they should meet with providers, energy regulators, actors in the utility  domain and other NRAs to collect proposals for measures to improve power cut resilience. This  collection serves as important input to a cost-benefit analysis, see recommendation 3.  Recommendation 3: NRAs should perform, in cooperation with energy regulators and civil  protection authorities, a cost-benefit analysis, where societal costs and benefits are  evaluated, to determine what is reasonable to expect from different actors regarding  power cut resilience measures.  Within a risk management framework, a risk assessment would be followed by an analysis of what  measures can and should be expected from providers and energy distributors in order to reduce the  impact of power cuts. This risk treatment should include a cost-benefit analysis to compare risk  mitigation activities within both the electronic communications and the energy sector and should be  done in cooperation with energy regulators and civil protection authorities.19  As noted in section 4.1, national and regional variations can be expected and may lead to different  results within and between EU Member States. One outcome can be that it is not relevant to  formulate specific regulatory requirements if power cuts are rare and resulting service disruptions in  the electronic communications sector are rare and do not have significant negative impact. Another  possible outcome here could be that incentive schemes (including market demand for increased  resilience), state funding, and private-public partnerships individually or collectively could lead to  more efficient increases to resilience.  Recommendation 4: Providers should regularly perform checks of existing protection  measures, such as checks of UPS systems and batteries, and running facilities with fixed  and transportable power generators at full load, to avoid and mitigate the impact of  network and service outages from shorter and medium duration power cuts.  Recommendation 5: NRAs should in their follow up of major network and service outages  caused by power cuts ensure that affected providers, based on lessons learned,  systematically develop their protection measures to avoid and mitigate the impact of  network and service outages from shorter and medium duration power cuts.  No matter how resilient providers build their networks and develop their security measures to avoid  network and service outages, there will still be incidents. In those cases it is important to learn from  the incidents to address similar types of incidents in the future. When NRAS follow up major outages  caused by power cuts to see that the providers continuously develop their security measures, NRAs  should consult the cost-benefit analysis (recommendation 3) in order to have a balanced approach  on expectations of enhanced security measures. For instance, expecting backup diesel generators at  core network elements carrying traffic for a large number of users could be considered relevant,  whereas backup diesel generators for “critical” mobile base stations may require increased physical  protection of the sites to prevent the generators from being stolen, which will come at a cost.  19  Based on national conditions, it may for example be more efficient to increase the quality of service within  the energy sector rather than imposing obligations on service providers within the electronic communications  sector to introduce costly protection measures, or to use state funding combined with public-private  partnerships to increase power cut resilience.  Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector  Survey, analysis and recommendations for resilience against power supply failures  Page  37  Recommendation 6: NRAs should act to establish a strategy to promote cooperation and  mutual aid agreements on joint service restoration after severe power cuts which can  include cross-sector exercises.  The goal of a strategy to promote cooperation and joint service restoration including exercises is to  establish and maintain strong every day working relationships, within the sector and across sector  boundaries, that will carry over to more challenging circumstances.  Recommendation 7: NRAs should consider a priority scheme that would give preferential  treatment within the electronic communications sector and decrease service restoration  times under exceptional circumstances.  Recommendation 8: NRAs, providers, actors in the energy sector and other societal  functions should cooperate to establish information exchange mechanisms. These  mechanisms should enable an efficient exchange of situational awareness information,  forecasts of restoration times and other information that is essential for the efficient  restoration after severe power cuts.  Power failures of longer duration are often connected with increased stress on society and the  supply of electronic communications services is then even more important. The need for priority  schemes and information exchange within the sector as well as with the energy sector, weather  stations, the civil protection authorities and other societal functions can be considered as crucial in  order to reduce the impact from service disruptions and outages.

    "abstract": "Electronic communications are the backbone of the EU’s digital society. Article 13a of the EU’s electronic communications Framework directive asks EU Member States to ensure the security and resilience of public electronic communications networks and services. As part of the implementation of Article 13a, National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in the EU collect reports about incidents with a significant impact on the electronic communications networks and services. Yearly, ENISA publishes an annual report which summarizes these incident reports and provides an aggregate analysis of major outages. As can be seen in the ENISA annual report, power cuts are a dominant cause of severe network and service outages in the EU’s electronic communications sector. In the report “Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector”, we study these incidents in more detail and we make recommendations to NRAs and electronic communications service providers and to some extent also to actors in the energy sector as well as civil protection authorities. Our recommendations are aimed at improving the electronic communications sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts."

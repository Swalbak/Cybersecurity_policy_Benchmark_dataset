Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Executive Summary  The Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (MARIE) Issue 1 Report (2011)1, which reflects  the Phase 1 effort of this initiative, presented twelve Key Observations about Mutual Aid Assistance  (MAA) which will be summarised later in this document.  The objective of this initiative is to promote the resilience of European ICT infrastructures through  the use of MAA strategies. To accomplish this, the value of mutual aid assistance will be described,  insights into challenges in implementing MAAs will be captured and guidance will be articulated that  will lead to greater utilisation of this advanced emergency preparedness measure.  In presenting those Key Observations lays the foundation for actionable recommendations, which  are included in this Report, and reflects work done during this initiative.  This MARIE Issue 2 Report adds five actionable recommendations;  1. Member States Level the Road  2. A Mutual Aid Agreement Template  3. Critical Information Infrastructure Provider Due Diligence for Stakeholders  4. Scarce Resource Strategy  5. Local Communities Self-Reliance  The approach used by the MARIE Study and Report builds upon existing progress made. It extends  this progress by conducting analyses of the current situation that would lend insights into how best  to move forward, providing guidance to achieve further MAA deployments and creating an  environment in Europe that will continue to sustain long term utilisation of mutual aid strategies  that greatly enhance European critical Information infrastructures.  1  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid- assistance  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  1 Introduction  One of the most prominent obstacles to further utilisation of Mutual Aid Assistance (MAAs) is that  organisations which embrace emergency preparedness responsibilities may not correctly take  account of low probability and high impact events.  Most of the observations presented here tightly couple with emergency preparedness  motivation,with the primary concern leaning towards those types of large-scale incidents.  Goal 1.1  This report presents 5 main recommendations which will –if implemented- improve emergency  preparedness for ICT Stakeholders. The results of the preliminary study performed in 2011 showed  that the preparedness for Black Swan events (low probability / high impact) cannot be handled in  isolation, and that one of the possible responses to this issue could be the use of Mutual Aid  Agreements. The recommendations intend to provide a high level coverage to raise awareness and  encourage their development.  Target audience 1.2  The 2007 ARECI Report called on the private sector across Europe to take the initiative to establish  formal Mutual Aid Assistance in order to enhance existing resilience capabilities. As a result, some  notable progress has been made, however there are many more opportunities for Mutual Aid  Assistance to be implemented. The European private sector could champion the available  opportunities: the difference between getting, and not getting this done, can mean the continued  operation, or failure, of critical information infrastructure in the times when it is most needed by  society.  The first phase of this initiative has presented twelve Key Observations that concisely capture the  most important aspects of the current landscape in Europe regarding the state of MAAs. These  observations are foundational for these recommendations.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  2 Scope  Mutual Aid Assistance is an arrangement entered into by two or more parties that make provision  for lending assistance across normal boundaries during an emergency situation. The types of mutual  aid with the scope of this study include:  Sector orientation  •private sector aid to private sector  •private sector aid to public sector  •public sector aid to private sector  •public sector aid to public sector  Types of assistance  •equipment  •services  •manpower  Geographical range  •local  •national  •regional (within Europe)  •international  Network and Technology  •all network access types  •cable (coaxial cable)  •optical (fibre optic cable)  •wireless (air interface)  •wireline (copper wire)  •all technologies (ATM, BWA, DOCSIS,  CDMA, GSM, IN, IP, IMS, MPLS, SIP,  C7, SS7, SONET, SDH, 3G, 4G, TDM,  WIFI, WLAN, WIMAX, …)  •all services types (data, hosting,  Internet, test, video, voice …)  Formality  •ad hoc (informal)  •contracted (formal)  •combinations of informal and  formal  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Ingredients 2.1  Ingredients are usual “components” which  contribute to the overall Resilience of a given  Critical Inforamtion Infrastructure. A set of  suggested ingredients were initially devised2 in  a Bell-Labs publications for the enhancement  of Networks Reliability and Security.  The diagram below shows these 8 ingredients,  and provides one example for each.  Key Observations 2.2  This section presents twelve observations that  are pivotal in understanding the situation in  Europe for why Mutual Aid Assistance are  underutilised as a strategy for preparing for  catastrophic events.  Other relevant observations could be  presented here, but these are the crucial ones  on which the recommendations have been  made during the Phase 2 part of this initiative.  It should also be noted that there are existing,  good examples of private-sector led formal  Mutual Aid Assistance and their model can be  a useful example as the recommendations are  developed.  In addition to its brief title, each observation is  composed of three elements: its Essence, an  Examination, and its Effect. The first provides a  concise statement of the heart of the matter.  The second, an analysis to enhance  understanding of why the observation is what  it is. The third element underscores the  significance of the insight.  The twelve Key Observations are summarised below. Their order is significant as there is a  progressive logical flow for most of them. Observations 1 through 5 deal progressively with the  environment that affects decision-making in emergency preparedness. Observations 6 through 8  address the prioritisation of actual shared resources.  2  Karl F. Rauscher, Richard E. Krock, and James P.

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  •Mutual aid provides high value for emergency situations that are typically of (a) low frequency  and (b) of very high impact.  Maximum Opportunity for Mutual Aid Assistance  •Corporate and Member States emergency preparedness is often reactive in nature, and little  forethought is usually given to low frequency, catastrophic events.  Tail Event Syndrome  •The degree of planning for low frequency catastrophic events suffers from diminished  responsibilities for managing responses for these types of events, as they are treated as out of  scope.  Planning  •Critical emergency preparedness planning neglects low-probability events that have a high  impact due to the very natures of these two distinguishing attributes.  Economic Considerations  •Emergency response and restoration capabilities are usually considered successful based on  best effort with available resources, and especially so for rare, unexpected events.  Best Effort Acceptance  •Resource sharing is possible for six of the eight ingredients that constitute information and  communication technology (ICT) infrastructure: power, environment, hardware, software,  networks and human.  Ingredient Transfer Potential  •The ultimate support is provided when the responsibility for completing services is transferred  between contracted parties.  Transfer of Responsibility  •Mutual Aid Assistance are an advanced means of extending resilience through the use of  mutual common interests.  Mutual Aid Is Good Policy  •Perceived and real constraints regarding competitive and legal issues impede early and  sustained dialogue with potential mutual aid partners.  Resource Sharing Constraints  •Mutual aid agreement activity in Europe has been largely uncelebrated and therefore general  awareness suffers.  Unsung Mutual Aid Successes  •Mutual Aid Assistance are essential for critical infrastructure operators that need to be  prepared for the full range of crisis scenarios.  Full Spectrum Emergency Preparedness  •The utilization of Mutual Aid Assistance for managing low frequency, high impact events is an  emergency preparedness ROI breakthrough.  Smart Planning  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3 Recommendations  This section presents 5 actionable recommendations that, if implemented, will greatly enhance the  resilience of European critical information infrastructure in the midst of a crisis. The  recommendations are presented to Member States and the Private sector. Each recommendation is  presented with supporting material, such as the Key Observations of the previous section, required  commitments, benefits of implementation, alternatives and their consequences, next steps and  measures of success.  With the underpinning of the Key Observations generated from the MARIE Phase I effort, a solid  foundation was laid for this Phase 2 work, which focused on developing guidance that can effectively  establish a trajectory for on-going, sustained mutual aid agreements.

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Member States Level the Road 3.1  3.1.1 Background  Regulations and Fragmentation may have imposed hurdles along the path to private sector mutual  aid agreements. These hurdles may be generic legacy wording that may be silent on emergency  situational exemptions. An excess of regulation may discourage companies from pursing mutual aid  agreements.3  This report presents an opportunity for new awareness of the benefits of mutual aid as an option for  resilience of critical information infrastructure. Member States can “shine a spotlight” on good  corporate emergency preparedness by applauding examples that should serve as role models.4  When elevating the level of visibility of mutual agreements, Member States should include options  that are both cross-industry and cross-border.  Thus, mutual aid agreement discussions should identify areas where the Member States – at the  local, national and international levels - need to address and resolve impediments to industry  collaboration for the purpose of critical information infrastructure resilience.  In addition to removing obstacles to collaboration, Member States can also move to strengthen  mutual aid agreement potentials by providing a  way to address specific issues such as temporary  waivers of certain rules in a crisis. There are other  rules for commerce that need to be identified and  addressed so that a rule does not block the rapid  flow of aid.  Because Member States have unique roles in  protecting economic stability, national security  and public safety, they should be most conscious  of the very real possibility of rare but devastating  events that could impair critical information  infrastructure functionality.5  3.1.2 Required Commitments  Private industry needs to produce an outline of the most effective mutual aid models and then  identify Laws and Regulation changes that will be necessary for implementation. Member States at  all levels (local, national, and international) need to be responsive to the identified modifications  requested and balanced by good governance to avoid abuse, while providing the flexibility needed  during times of crisis. Private industry then needs to draft and execute the agreements.  3.1.3 Benefits  The ‘levelling of the field’ to reduce hurdles to collaboration for mutual aid will enable many more  Mutual Aid Assistance agreements to be established and thus greatly improve resilience.

Recommendation No. 1  Governments should be responsive in  creating an environment that supports  private sector initiatives that seek to  establish Mutual Aid Assistance by reducing  regulatory obstacles and by raising  awareness about agreements that clearly  provide added safety and security to the  public.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  resolution of regulatory impediments prior to a crisis will allow the mutual aid to flow immediately  during a crisis.  3.1.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  The sole alternative consists actually in leaving the current situation to continue, and slow down the  development of Mutual Aid Assistance in Europe. Consequences of mutual aid can restrict and/or  delay the resolve of a crisis because of regulatory barriers.  3.1.5 Next Steps  Member States should initiate reviews to determine what, if any, policies or regulations pose  impediments to private sector progress in developing mutual aid agreements.  3.1.6 Measures of Success  The ultimate goal is for Member States here to make way for the development of more mutual aid  agreements. However, specific improvements in the regulatory landscape are tangible, midway,  measures of success. Also, having the aid agreements in place and documented before a crisis occurs  is another important measure of midway progress. The final measure of success occurs after the  agreements are invoked during a crisis.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  A Mutual Aid Agreement Template 3.2  3.2.1 Background  Fortunately, there are existing models of Mutual Aid Assistance that have proven effective. This  recommendation is aimed at capturing a framework for proven elements of Mutual Aid Assistance  for critical information infrastructures.  The template should be flexible and should include the widest possible set of combinations, e.g.,  intra-sector and inter-sector, within private sector and with public sector, national and international.  Once created, the template should be maintained and should be enhanced with new learning from  experiences.  The mutual aid agreement will include the terms and conditions that are explicitly spelled out and  agreed to before a crisis occurs. This is imperative so that aid not be delayed while seeking internal  approvals from someone in the lending entity beyond the initial agreement. Little benefit comes  from last minute negotiations or clarifications. The plan must be complete enough to simply be  invoked. Thus, the mutual aid template should strive to be as complete as possible to anticipate the  parameters and details that will be most effective when the Mutual Aid Assistance that are derived  from it become operational.6 7  This recommendation is about optimum preparation  that is still cost effective. This is in stark contrast to  an ad hoc “best effort” approach to mutual aid, if  any effort at all, that surprisingly dominates many  critical information infrastructure cultures.8  3.2.2 Required Commitments  The private sector, as the owner of most of Europe’s  critical information infrastructure, must take the  initiative for generating the first mutual aid template, making sure to include all critical template  elements. The private sector should work with the various industries to extend the template to be  inclusive of cross-industry and cross-border opportunities and must collaborate to develop an  acceptable template, i.e. one with broad appeal. The template must be stored and maintained as the  process matures.  3.2.3 Benefits  Having a reference template will expedite the development of Mutual Aid Assistance between the  parties by providing a standardised framework. A readily available template will lower the barrier to  entry for organisation seeking to improve their resilience posture.  6  Key Observation No. 6, Ingredient Transfer Potential, Section 3.6.  7  Key Observation No. 7, Transfer of Responsibility, Section 3.7.  8  Key Observation No. 5, Best Effort Acceptance, Section 3.5.  Recommendation No. 2  The private sector should develop and  maintain a standard mutual aid  agreement template for reference that  outlines the essential elements of a  comprehensive mutual aid agreement.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3.2.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  If this recommendation is not implemented, fewer Mutual Aid Assistance agreements will be  developed. Those that are developed without such template will take longer to create and will likely  be less complete, not having the benefit of a previous editions. Also the agreements will be less  uniform, leading to concerns of unfairness and confusion as to the terms when many entities are  involved. The end result will be less resilience and delayed restoration of critical functions during a  crisis.  3.2.5 Next Steps  The next steps begin with the private sector gathering existing templates and then beginning to  develop a common template derived from the best elements of those aggregated. This template  development exercise is extended to explicitly address intra-industry, inter-industry and cross- border aspects.  3.2.6 Measures of Success  The first key measures of success is the development of a mutual aid template with broad appeal. A  second key measure of success is a long term sustainable process to manage enhancements. This is  best performed by the private sector because of the private sector ownership reality and therefore  private sector cultural orientation. The third key measure of success is the realisation of complete  Mutual Aid Assistance documented and executed between partners prior to a crisis occurring.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Critical Information Infrastructure Provider Due-Diligence for 3.3 Stakeholders  3.3.1 Background  The owners and operators of critical functions play a vital role in society, with dependencies on them  for national security, economic stability and public safety. As such, there are high expectations on  these critical information infrastructure owners and operators to keep critical functions running –  especially during times of crises. However, all systems have limitations and the cost for providing  functions in crises, when stress is above normal, can often be above the cost of what the market will  bear, particularly in a competitive free market environment.9  Fortunately, MAAs offer a way of providing greatly increased resilience at very little additional cost.10  In fact, it is rare that such ROIs are possible to achieve.11 Both direct customers, as well as other  stakeholders, will benefit from the added robustness provided from MAAs.  In order to achieve its potential for resilience with existing cost structures, the private sector can  implement many more Mutual Aid Assistance agreements than has been done in the past. In  pursuing this goal, options should not be restricted to those within a given industry, but rather also  between industries since much of the equipment is common. MAAs can be created between  different industries to take advantage of  diversity, that when one industry is  stressed, a dissimilar industry may have  less pressure on its resources (e.g., water  and power industries have common  resources such as trucks, backhoes fuel,  some craft).  Plans that do not explicitly address all of  the potential resources are simply  incomplete and may be regretted during a major crisis.12  This recommendation is about companies that provide critical information infrastructure functions  to society taking new steps to ensure their due diligence in planning for worst case (i.e. “rainy day”)  scenarios.13  3.3.2 Required Commitments  Individual private sector companies should implement MAAs with peers, cross sector entities. The  role of Member States is to eliminate obstacles to private sector creation of MAAs.  9  Key Observation No. 4, Economic Considerations, Section 3.4.  10  Key Observation No. 8, Mutual Aid Is Good Policy, Section 3.8.  11  Key Observation No. 12, Smart Planning, Section 3.12.  12  Key decision makers in critical infrastructure operations should consider applying for priority  communications schemes, where available. Rauscher, Karl Frederick and Goldman, Stuart, Priority  International Communications (PIC) – Staying Connected in Times of Crisis, EastWest Institute, 2012;  www.ewi.info/pic .  13  Key Observation No. 3, Planning, Section 3.3.  Recommendation No. 3  The private sector entities with critical  infrastructure functions should establish formal  Mutual Aid Assistance with industry peers, cross- sector entities and governments, as appropriate, in  order to ensure appropriate levels of resilience of  their operations.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3.3.3 Benefits  The implementation of this recommendation will enhance business continuity of the participating  organisations, avoid costly alternatives with unattractive ROIs, make unnecessary additional  government oversight and regulation and improve the resilience of the organisations, sectors and  nation-states.  3.3.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  Without formal MAAs, aid can be restricted and or delayed during a crisis by unresolved concerns,  jeopardising public safety, economic stability or even national security.  3.3.5 Next Steps  Private sector companies should identify potential partners for mutual beneficial arrangements.14  Like other private sector agreements, these arrangements may be a private matter. Thus it is not  necessary for Member States to be aware of them, though critical information infrastructure  operators may choose to advise key stakeholders.  3.3.6 Measures of Success  The direct measure of success is having an industry with abundant MAAs in place and documented  before a crisis occurs.  14  Must be done with legal consideration depending on the jurisdictions involved.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Scarce Resource Strategy 3.4  3.4.1 Background  Some rare crises will place such severe stress on specific resources that competition for them may  prevent their utilisation. Resources that are susceptible to this problem include fuel, generators,  vehicles and anything else that can be essential for the operation of multiple critical information  infrastructures. Thus, in considering possible crisis scenarios, Mutual Aid Assistance agreements  need to explicitly address the rare cases where multiple parties are in need of the same scarce  resource. Allocation schemes are needed to define frameworks for working through conflicts of  interests. The method in which they are invoked is also important. Member States should be  involved to ensure that the framework being used will provide the most relief for the affected  public.  Therefore, there is a need for the identification of both potential critical resources and general  policies for handling those scenarios that may be otherwise unanticipated. Both issues need to be  communicated with, and agreed with, the appropriate Member States. Because critical information  infrastructure operation is typically not the primary function of the government entities being  engaged, Member States should not be expected to immediately understand the implications of a  scarce resource on critical information  infrastructure operations  Potentially, this will prove to be a difficult  recommendation to achieve, but its value can be  inestimable during massive crises. Mutual Aid  Assistance can break down when both parties  have urgent need for the same resources at the  same time, which can be the situation during a  large crisis. In a massive crisis at the level where  Member States may need to step in and declare  Emergency law, having such an agreement may provide for the common good of the citizen without  the otherwise interminable delay while Member State officials try to determine resource allocations  without the aid of such prior agreements.15  3.4.2 Required Commitments  The private sector must consider the most severe crises that can occur and be willing to commit  their resources for the public good even to the detriment of a particular sector. The role of the  Member States will be decisive in prioritising the general public’s interests.  3.4.3 Benefits  The benefits from implementing this recommendation are that the MAAs developed will be even  more valuable as they will now be prepared for two of the most common obstacles to effective  mutual aid: i) limited resources and ii) indecision in the midst of a crisis response that prevents much  needed resources from being utilised. This approach allows the industries to use their vast  15  Key Observation No. 12, Smart Planning, Section 3.12.  Recommendation No. 4  The private sector, in consultation with  government, should develop strategies to  manage the scarcest resources in order to  provide opportunities for their use in a  way that will provide the most relief for  the affected public(s).

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  experience to create a mutually beneficial plan for the public good well in advance of the time when  decisions are needed.  3.4.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  The absence of such a plan may result in the declaration of martial law and attempts to create a plan  from scratch by officials lacking the intimate knowledge necessary to properly deploy limited  resources.  3.4.5 Next Steps  Each industry should identify and then rank the resources that could be under heavy pressure during  a crisis. Additional steps include engaging other industries and Member States to agree on both  frameworks for decision making and specific policies for specific resources. Each crisis should be a  trigger for a revision of the framework’s flexibility and actual usability, and the update may also be  planned on a regular basis as a complement.  3.4.6 Measures of Success  The key measure of success here is to the most critical resources identified and a framework  established and agreed to with key industries and the appropriate Member States.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Self-Reliance of Local Communities 3.5  3.5.1 Background  It is important for the general public to be reminded from time to time of their dependence on  critical information infrastructure functions and the possibility of their temporary unavailability.  Because losing such critical support only occurs rarely, such reminders and self-reliance education  are needed from those who understand the real possibility and consequences on public safety.16  Experience has taught us that the first 72 hours after an event are often the most difficult hours for  the public.  The types of local communities that can be engaged include schools, shopping malls, business areas,  housing complex communities and others. The types of critical services include water, food, medical  care, power, police, transportation, and communication.  Without communities that are well informed and that can withstand outages for a limited time,  restoration resources would be redirected away from fixing the problems and would be too focused  on providing temporary help to the public. For example, if the general public is encouraged to have  plans that include a 72-hour supply of potable water per household, then resources can be devoted  to fixing a pipe break rather than passing out bottled water to the public, and thereby delaying the  repair.  3.5.2 Required Commitments  European institutions, Member States and  Industries are all key in taking the initiative to  identify the important messages to be given to  local communities. The identification and  engagement of local communities is also a key  component of this recommendation.  The private sector’s contribution will be to provide professional knowledge and required skills to  ensure the plans are comprehensive and viable.  3.5.3 Benefits  Having disaster plans in each community will reduce the adverse impacts on the public during a  temporary absence of the normal support services. This reduction will facilitate the critical  information infrastructure operators to invoke their recovery plans (including the specific  recommendations in this report) with a better balance of optimising the permanent restoration of  services rather than redirection of limited resources to first provide emergency services to the public  at the expense of further delaying normal restoration.  3.5.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  Without communities that are well informed and that can withstand outages for a limited time,  restoration resources would be redirected away from fixing the most important problems.  16  Key Observation No. 1, Maximum Opportunity for Mutual Aid Assistance, Section 3.1.  Recommendation No. 5  The public and private sectors should  cooperate with local organisations to  raise the awareness of the need for  specific plans for the temporary  unavailability of critical infrastructure  functions.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3.5.5 Next Steps  European institutions, Member States and industries should work together to identify the few key  messages to send to local groups. The same would identify potential recipients of such guidance and  education. Templates are developed that include flexible components for customisation of  communication based on group type or other pertinent factors. Local community groups develop  plans sites. The template is stored and maintained by an appropriate entity as the process matures.  Select community leaders are encouraged to subscribe to priority communications schemes if  available.  3.5.6 Measures of Success  The key measure of success is individuals and local community groups that are prepared for short  term crises.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  4 Conclusion  The recognised main issue of Mutual Aid in Europe lays in the fact that working agreements are not  well publicised. To date, there has been no platform that has enabled the creation of the necessary  bonds between key players of Crisis Management at Pan-European level.  An initial attempt to bring this topic to discussion was made in an EP3R (European Public-Private  Partnership) Task Force, which has concluded based on the early recommendations of this research.  Still, the road ahead for sound European implementation of such mechanism is still to be crossed,  and should not be overlooked at the profit of more trendy topics: such a voluntary approach where  Member States would be seen as facilitators and coordinators is not an immense obstacle, and yet  could allow a much faster recovery of large-scale incidents (cross border or not), and therefore the  saving of a significant amount of money.

Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Executive Summary  The Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (MARIE) Issue 1 Report (2011)1, which reflects  the Phase 1 effort of this initiative, presented twelve Key Observations about Mutual Aid Assistance  (MAA) which will be summarised later in this document.  The objective of this initiative is to promote the resilience of European ICT infrastructures through  the use of MAA strategies. To accomplish this, the value of mutual aid assistance will be described,  insights into challenges in implementing MAAs will be captured and guidance will be articulated that  will lead to greater utilisation of this advanced emergency preparedness measure.  In presenting those Key Observations lays the foundation for actionable recommendations, which  are included in this Report, and reflects work done during this initiative.  This MARIE Issue 2 Report adds five actionable recommendations;  1. Member States Level the Road  2. A Mutual Aid Agreement Template  3. Critical Information Infrastructure Provider Due Diligence for Stakeholders  4. Scarce Resource Strategy  5. Local Communities Self-Reliance  The approach used by the MARIE Study and Report builds upon existing progress made. It extends  this progress by conducting analyses of the current situation that would lend insights into how best  to move forward, providing guidance to achieve further MAA deployments and creating an  environment in Europe that will continue to sustain long term utilisation of mutual aid strategies  that greatly enhance European critical Information infrastructures.  1  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/mutual-aid- assistance  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  1 Introduction  One of the most prominent obstacles to further utilisation of Mutual Aid Assistance (MAAs) is that  organisations which embrace emergency preparedness responsibilities may not correctly take  account of low probability and high impact events.  Most of the observations presented here tightly couple with emergency preparedness  motivation,with the primary concern leaning towards those types of large-scale incidents.  Goal 1.1  This report presents 5 main recommendations which will –if implemented- improve emergency  preparedness for ICT Stakeholders. The results of the preliminary study performed in 2011 showed  that the preparedness for Black Swan events (low probability / high impact) cannot be handled in  isolation, and that one of the possible responses to this issue could be the use of Mutual Aid  Agreements. The recommendations intend to provide a high level coverage to raise awareness and  encourage their development.  Target audience 1.2  The 2007 ARECI Report called on the private sector across Europe to take the initiative to establish  formal Mutual Aid Assistance in order to enhance existing resilience capabilities. As a result, some  notable progress has been made, however there are many more opportunities for Mutual Aid  Assistance to be implemented. The European private sector could champion the available  opportunities: the difference between getting, and not getting this done, can mean the continued  operation, or failure, of critical information infrastructure in the times when it is most needed by  society.  The first phase of this initiative has presented twelve Key Observations that concisely capture the  most important aspects of the current landscape in Europe regarding the state of MAAs. These  observations are foundational for these recommendations.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  2 Scope  Mutual Aid Assistance is an arrangement entered into by two or more parties that make provision  for lending assistance across normal boundaries during an emergency situation. The types of mutual  aid with the scope of this study include:  Sector orientation  •private sector aid to private sector  •private sector aid to public sector  •public sector aid to private sector  •public sector aid to public sector  Types of assistance  •equipment  •services  •manpower  Geographical range  •local  •national  •regional (within Europe)  •international  Network and Technology  •all network access types  •cable (coaxial cable)  •optical (fibre optic cable)  •wireless (air interface)  •wireline (copper wire)  •all technologies (ATM, BWA, DOCSIS,  CDMA, GSM, IN, IP, IMS, MPLS, SIP,  C7, SS7, SONET, SDH, 3G, 4G, TDM,  WIFI, WLAN, WIMAX, …)  •all services types (data, hosting,  Internet, test, video, voice …)  Formality  •ad hoc (informal)  •contracted (formal)  •combinations of informal and  formal  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Ingredients 2.1  Ingredients are usual “components” which  contribute to the overall Resilience of a given  Critical Inforamtion Infrastructure. A set of  suggested ingredients were initially devised2 in  a Bell-Labs publications for the enhancement  of Networks Reliability and Security.  The diagram below shows these 8 ingredients,  and provides one example for each.  Key Observations 2.2  This section presents twelve observations that  are pivotal in understanding the situation in  Europe for why Mutual Aid Assistance are  underutilised as a strategy for preparing for  catastrophic events.  Other relevant observations could be  presented here, but these are the crucial ones  on which the recommendations have been  made during the Phase 2 part of this initiative.  It should also be noted that there are existing,  good examples of private-sector led formal  Mutual Aid Assistance and their model can be  a useful example as the recommendations are  developed.  In addition to its brief title, each observation is  composed of three elements: its Essence, an  Examination, and its Effect. The first provides a  concise statement of the heart of the matter.  The second, an analysis to enhance  understanding of why the observation is what  it is. The third element underscores the  significance of the insight.  The twelve Key Observations are summarised below. Their order is significant as there is a  progressive logical flow for most of them. Observations 1 through 5 deal progressively with the  environment that affects decision-making in emergency preparedness. Observations 6 through 8  address the prioritisation of actual shared resources.  2  Karl F. Rauscher, Richard E. Krock, and James P.

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  •Mutual aid provides high value for emergency situations that are typically of (a) low frequency  and (b) of very high impact.  Maximum Opportunity for Mutual Aid Assistance  •Corporate and Member States emergency preparedness is often reactive in nature, and little  forethought is usually given to low frequency, catastrophic events.  Tail Event Syndrome  •The degree of planning for low frequency catastrophic events suffers from diminished  responsibilities for managing responses for these types of events, as they are treated as out of  scope.  Planning  •Critical emergency preparedness planning neglects low-probability events that have a high  impact due to the very natures of these two distinguishing attributes.  Economic Considerations  •Emergency response and restoration capabilities are usually considered successful based on  best effort with available resources, and especially so for rare, unexpected events.  Best Effort Acceptance  •Resource sharing is possible for six of the eight ingredients that constitute information and  communication technology (ICT) infrastructure: power, environment, hardware, software,  networks and human.  Ingredient Transfer Potential  •The ultimate support is provided when the responsibility for completing services is transferred  between contracted parties.  Transfer of Responsibility  •Mutual Aid Assistance are an advanced means of extending resilience through the use of  mutual common interests.  Mutual Aid Is Good Policy  •Perceived and real constraints regarding competitive and legal issues impede early and  sustained dialogue with potential mutual aid partners.  Resource Sharing Constraints  •Mutual aid agreement activity in Europe has been largely uncelebrated and therefore general  awareness suffers.  Unsung Mutual Aid Successes  •Mutual Aid Assistance are essential for critical infrastructure operators that need to be  prepared for the full range of crisis scenarios.  Full Spectrum Emergency Preparedness  •The utilization of Mutual Aid Assistance for managing low frequency, high impact events is an  emergency preparedness ROI breakthrough.  Smart Planning  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3 Recommendations  This section presents 5 actionable recommendations that, if implemented, will greatly enhance the  resilience of European critical information infrastructure in the midst of a crisis. The  recommendations are presented to Member States and the Private sector. Each recommendation is  presented with supporting material, such as the Key Observations of the previous section, required  commitments, benefits of implementation, alternatives and their consequences, next steps and  measures of success.  With the underpinning of the Key Observations generated from the MARIE Phase I effort, a solid  foundation was laid for this Phase 2 work, which focused on developing guidance that can effectively  establish a trajectory for on-going, sustained mutual aid agreements.

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Member States Level the Road 3.1  3.1.1 Background  Regulations and Fragmentation may have imposed hurdles along the path to private sector mutual  aid agreements. These hurdles may be generic legacy wording that may be silent on emergency  situational exemptions. An excess of regulation may discourage companies from pursing mutual aid  agreements.3  This report presents an opportunity for new awareness of the benefits of mutual aid as an option for  resilience of critical information infrastructure. Member States can “shine a spotlight” on good  corporate emergency preparedness by applauding examples that should serve as role models.4  When elevating the level of visibility of mutual agreements, Member States should include options  that are both cross-industry and cross-border.  Thus, mutual aid agreement discussions should identify areas where the Member States – at the  local, national and international levels - need to address and resolve impediments to industry  collaboration for the purpose of critical information infrastructure resilience.  In addition to removing obstacles to collaboration, Member States can also move to strengthen  mutual aid agreement potentials by providing a  way to address specific issues such as temporary  waivers of certain rules in a crisis. There are other  rules for commerce that need to be identified and  addressed so that a rule does not block the rapid  flow of aid.  Because Member States have unique roles in  protecting economic stability, national security  and public safety, they should be most conscious  of the very real possibility of rare but devastating  events that could impair critical information  infrastructure functionality.5  3.1.2 Required Commitments  Private industry needs to produce an outline of the most effective mutual aid models and then  identify Laws and Regulation changes that will be necessary for implementation. Member States at  all levels (local, national, and international) need to be responsive to the identified modifications  requested and balanced by good governance to avoid abuse, while providing the flexibility needed  during times of crisis. Private industry then needs to draft and execute the agreements.  3.1.3 Benefits  The ‘levelling of the field’ to reduce hurdles to collaboration for mutual aid will enable many more  Mutual Aid Assistance agreements to be established and thus greatly improve resilience.

Recommendation No. 1  Governments should be responsive in  creating an environment that supports  private sector initiatives that seek to  establish Mutual Aid Assistance by reducing  regulatory obstacles and by raising  awareness about agreements that clearly  provide added safety and security to the  public.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  resolution of regulatory impediments prior to a crisis will allow the mutual aid to flow immediately  during a crisis.  3.1.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  The sole alternative consists actually in leaving the current situation to continue, and slow down the  development of Mutual Aid Assistance in Europe. Consequences of mutual aid can restrict and/or  delay the resolve of a crisis because of regulatory barriers.  3.1.5 Next Steps  Member States should initiate reviews to determine what, if any, policies or regulations pose  impediments to private sector progress in developing mutual aid agreements.  3.1.6 Measures of Success  The ultimate goal is for Member States here to make way for the development of more mutual aid  agreements. However, specific improvements in the regulatory landscape are tangible, midway,  measures of success. Also, having the aid agreements in place and documented before a crisis occurs  is another important measure of midway progress. The final measure of success occurs after the  agreements are invoked during a crisis.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  A Mutual Aid Agreement Template 3.2  3.2.1 Background  Fortunately, there are existing models of Mutual Aid Assistance that have proven effective. This  recommendation is aimed at capturing a framework for proven elements of Mutual Aid Assistance  for critical information infrastructures.  The template should be flexible and should include the widest possible set of combinations, e.g.,  intra-sector and inter-sector, within private sector and with public sector, national and international.  Once created, the template should be maintained and should be enhanced with new learning from  experiences.  The mutual aid agreement will include the terms and conditions that are explicitly spelled out and  agreed to before a crisis occurs. This is imperative so that aid not be delayed while seeking internal  approvals from someone in the lending entity beyond the initial agreement. Little benefit comes  from last minute negotiations or clarifications. The plan must be complete enough to simply be  invoked. Thus, the mutual aid template should strive to be as complete as possible to anticipate the  parameters and details that will be most effective when the Mutual Aid Assistance that are derived  from it become operational.6 7  This recommendation is about optimum preparation  that is still cost effective. This is in stark contrast to  an ad hoc “best effort” approach to mutual aid, if  any effort at all, that surprisingly dominates many  critical information infrastructure cultures.8  3.2.2 Required Commitments  The private sector, as the owner of most of Europe’s  critical information infrastructure, must take the  initiative for generating the first mutual aid template, making sure to include all critical template  elements. The private sector should work with the various industries to extend the template to be  inclusive of cross-industry and cross-border opportunities and must collaborate to develop an  acceptable template, i.e. one with broad appeal. The template must be stored and maintained as the  process matures.  3.2.3 Benefits  Having a reference template will expedite the development of Mutual Aid Assistance between the  parties by providing a standardised framework. A readily available template will lower the barrier to  entry for organisation seeking to improve their resilience posture.  6  Key Observation No. 6, Ingredient Transfer Potential, Section 3.6.  7  Key Observation No. 7, Transfer of Responsibility, Section 3.7.  8  Key Observation No. 5, Best Effort Acceptance, Section 3.5.  Recommendation No. 2  The private sector should develop and  maintain a standard mutual aid  agreement template for reference that  outlines the essential elements of a  comprehensive mutual aid agreement.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3.2.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  If this recommendation is not implemented, fewer Mutual Aid Assistance agreements will be  developed. Those that are developed without such template will take longer to create and will likely  be less complete, not having the benefit of a previous editions. Also the agreements will be less  uniform, leading to concerns of unfairness and confusion as to the terms when many entities are  involved. The end result will be less resilience and delayed restoration of critical functions during a  crisis.  3.2.5 Next Steps  The next steps begin with the private sector gathering existing templates and then beginning to  develop a common template derived from the best elements of those aggregated. This template  development exercise is extended to explicitly address intra-industry, inter-industry and cross- border aspects.  3.2.6 Measures of Success  The first key measures of success is the development of a mutual aid template with broad appeal. A  second key measure of success is a long term sustainable process to manage enhancements. This is  best performed by the private sector because of the private sector ownership reality and therefore  private sector cultural orientation. The third key measure of success is the realisation of complete  Mutual Aid Assistance documented and executed between partners prior to a crisis occurring.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Critical Information Infrastructure Provider Due-Diligence for 3.3 Stakeholders  3.3.1 Background  The owners and operators of critical functions play a vital role in society, with dependencies on them  for national security, economic stability and public safety. As such, there are high expectations on  these critical information infrastructure owners and operators to keep critical functions running –  especially during times of crises. However, all systems have limitations and the cost for providing  functions in crises, when stress is above normal, can often be above the cost of what the market will  bear, particularly in a competitive free market environment.9  Fortunately, MAAs offer a way of providing greatly increased resilience at very little additional cost.10  In fact, it is rare that such ROIs are possible to achieve.11 Both direct customers, as well as other  stakeholders, will benefit from the added robustness provided from MAAs.  In order to achieve its potential for resilience with existing cost structures, the private sector can  implement many more Mutual Aid Assistance agreements than has been done in the past. In  pursuing this goal, options should not be restricted to those within a given industry, but rather also  between industries since much of the equipment is common. MAAs can be created between  different industries to take advantage of  diversity, that when one industry is  stressed, a dissimilar industry may have  less pressure on its resources (e.g., water  and power industries have common  resources such as trucks, backhoes fuel,  some craft).  Plans that do not explicitly address all of  the potential resources are simply  incomplete and may be regretted during a major crisis.12  This recommendation is about companies that provide critical information infrastructure functions  to society taking new steps to ensure their due diligence in planning for worst case (i.e. “rainy day”)  scenarios.13  3.3.2 Required Commitments  Individual private sector companies should implement MAAs with peers, cross sector entities. The  role of Member States is to eliminate obstacles to private sector creation of MAAs.  9  Key Observation No. 4, Economic Considerations, Section 3.4.  10  Key Observation No. 8, Mutual Aid Is Good Policy, Section 3.8.  11  Key Observation No. 12, Smart Planning, Section 3.12.  12  Key decision makers in critical infrastructure operations should consider applying for priority  communications schemes, where available. Rauscher, Karl Frederick and Goldman, Stuart, Priority  International Communications (PIC) – Staying Connected in Times of Crisis, EastWest Institute, 2012;  www.ewi.info/pic .  13  Key Observation No. 3, Planning, Section 3.3.  Recommendation No. 3  The private sector entities with critical  infrastructure functions should establish formal  Mutual Aid Assistance with industry peers, cross- sector entities and governments, as appropriate, in  order to ensure appropriate levels of resilience of  their operations.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3.3.3 Benefits  The implementation of this recommendation will enhance business continuity of the participating  organisations, avoid costly alternatives with unattractive ROIs, make unnecessary additional  government oversight and regulation and improve the resilience of the organisations, sectors and  nation-states.  3.3.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  Without formal MAAs, aid can be restricted and or delayed during a crisis by unresolved concerns,  jeopardising public safety, economic stability or even national security.  3.3.5 Next Steps  Private sector companies should identify potential partners for mutual beneficial arrangements.14  Like other private sector agreements, these arrangements may be a private matter. Thus it is not  necessary for Member States to be aware of them, though critical information infrastructure  operators may choose to advise key stakeholders.  3.3.6 Measures of Success  The direct measure of success is having an industry with abundant MAAs in place and documented  before a crisis occurs.  14  Must be done with legal consideration depending on the jurisdictions involved.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Scarce Resource Strategy 3.4  3.4.1 Background  Some rare crises will place such severe stress on specific resources that competition for them may  prevent their utilisation. Resources that are susceptible to this problem include fuel, generators,  vehicles and anything else that can be essential for the operation of multiple critical information  infrastructures. Thus, in considering possible crisis scenarios, Mutual Aid Assistance agreements  need to explicitly address the rare cases where multiple parties are in need of the same scarce  resource. Allocation schemes are needed to define frameworks for working through conflicts of  interests. The method in which they are invoked is also important. Member States should be  involved to ensure that the framework being used will provide the most relief for the affected  public.  Therefore, there is a need for the identification of both potential critical resources and general  policies for handling those scenarios that may be otherwise unanticipated. Both issues need to be  communicated with, and agreed with, the appropriate Member States. Because critical information  infrastructure operation is typically not the primary function of the government entities being  engaged, Member States should not be expected to immediately understand the implications of a  scarce resource on critical information  infrastructure operations  Potentially, this will prove to be a difficult  recommendation to achieve, but its value can be  inestimable during massive crises. Mutual Aid  Assistance can break down when both parties  have urgent need for the same resources at the  same time, which can be the situation during a  large crisis. In a massive crisis at the level where  Member States may need to step in and declare  Emergency law, having such an agreement may provide for the common good of the citizen without  the otherwise interminable delay while Member State officials try to determine resource allocations  without the aid of such prior agreements.15  3.4.2 Required Commitments  The private sector must consider the most severe crises that can occur and be willing to commit  their resources for the public good even to the detriment of a particular sector. The role of the  Member States will be decisive in prioritising the general public’s interests.  3.4.3 Benefits  The benefits from implementing this recommendation are that the MAAs developed will be even  more valuable as they will now be prepared for two of the most common obstacles to effective  mutual aid: i) limited resources and ii) indecision in the midst of a crisis response that prevents much  needed resources from being utilised. This approach allows the industries to use their vast  15  Key Observation No. 12, Smart Planning, Section 3.12.  Recommendation No. 4  The private sector, in consultation with  government, should develop strategies to  manage the scarcest resources in order to  provide opportunities for their use in a  way that will provide the most relief for  the affected public(s).  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  experience to create a mutually beneficial plan for the public good well in advance of the time when  decisions are needed.  3.4.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  The absence of such a plan may result in the declaration of martial law and attempts to create a plan  from scratch by officials lacking the intimate knowledge necessary to properly deploy limited  resources.  3.4.5 Next Steps  Each industry should identify and then rank the resources that could be under heavy pressure during  a crisis. Additional steps include engaging other industries and Member States to agree on both  frameworks for decision making and specific policies for specific resources. Each crisis should be a  trigger for a revision of the framework’s flexibility and actual usability, and the update may also be  planned on a regular basis as a complement.  3.4.6 Measures of Success  The key measure of success here is to the most critical resources identified and a framework  established and agreed to with key industries and the appropriate Member States.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  Self-Reliance of Local Communities 3.5  3.5.1 Background  It is important for the general public to be reminded from time to time of their dependence on  critical information infrastructure functions and the possibility of their temporary unavailability.  Because losing such critical support only occurs rarely, such reminders and self-reliance education  are needed from those who understand the real possibility and consequences on public safety.16  Experience has taught us that the first 72 hours after an event are often the most difficult hours for  the public.  The types of local communities that can be engaged include schools, shopping malls, business areas,  housing complex communities and others. The types of critical services include water, food, medical  care, power, police, transportation, and communication.  Without communities that are well informed and that can withstand outages for a limited time,  restoration resources would be redirected away from fixing the problems and would be too focused  on providing temporary help to the public. For example, if the general public is encouraged to have  plans that include a 72-hour supply of potable water per household, then resources can be devoted  to fixing a pipe break rather than passing out bottled water to the public, and thereby delaying the  repair.  3.5.2 Required Commitments  European institutions, Member States and  Industries are all key in taking the initiative to  identify the important messages to be given to  local communities. The identification and  engagement of local communities is also a key  component of this recommendation.  The private sector’s contribution will be to provide professional knowledge and required skills to  ensure the plans are comprehensive and viable.  3.5.3 Benefits  Having disaster plans in each community will reduce the adverse impacts on the public during a  temporary absence of the normal support services. This reduction will facilitate the critical  information infrastructure operators to invoke their recovery plans (including the specific  recommendations in this report) with a better balance of optimising the permanent restoration of  services rather than redirection of limited resources to first provide emergency services to the public  at the expense of further delaying normal restoration.  3.5.4 Alternatives and their Consequences  Without communities that are well informed and that can withstand outages for a limited time,  restoration resources would be redirected away from fixing the most important problems.  16  Key Observation No. 1, Maximum Opportunity for Mutual Aid Assistance, Section 3.1.  Recommendation No. 5  The public and private sectors should  cooperate with local organisations to  raise the awareness of the need for  specific plans for the temporary  unavailability of critical infrastructure  functions.  Mutual Aid for Resilient Infrastructure in Europe (M.A.R.I.E.)  Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  3.5.5 Next Steps  European institutions, Member States and industries should work together to identify the few key  messages to send to local groups. The same would identify potential recipients of such guidance and  education. Templates are developed that include flexible components for customisation of  communication based on group type or other pertinent factors. Local community groups develop  plans sites. The template is stored and maintained by an appropriate entity as the process matures.  Select community leaders are encouraged to subscribe to priority communications schemes if  available.  3.5.6 Measures of Success  The key measure of success is individuals and local community groups that are prepared for short  term crises.

Phase II: Recommendations Report  1.0, November 2013  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security  www.enisa.europa.eu  4 Conclusion  The recognised main issue of Mutual Aid in Europe lays in the fact that working agreements are not  well publicised. To date, there has been no platform that has enabled the creation of the necessary  bonds between key players of Crisis Management at Pan-European level.  An initial attempt to bring this topic to discussion was made in an EP3R (European Public-Private  Partnership) Task Force, which has concluded based on the early recommendations of this research.  Still, the road ahead for sound European implementation of such mechanism is still to be crossed,  and should not be overlooked at the profit of more trendy topics: such a voluntary approach where  Member States would be seen as facilitators and coordinators is not an immense obstacle, and yet  could allow a much faster recovery of large-scale incidents (cross border or not), and therefore the  saving of a significant amount of money.

The results of the preliminary study performed in 2011 showed that the preparedness for Black Swan events (low probability / high impact) cannot be handled in isolation, and that one of the possible responses to this issue could be the use of Mutual Aid Agreements. The recommendations intend to provide a high level coverage to raise awareness and encourage their development."

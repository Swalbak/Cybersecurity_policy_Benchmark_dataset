Considering that the organisation of this European event brings  together more than 350 young people coming from all over Europe, the ECSC Steering  Committee wants above all to safeguard the health of all participants.  Consequently, the committee, together with the Austrian national planners, with the support of  the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the agreement of the future ECSC  organising countries, decided to change the dates of the ECSC 2020 final and postpone the 7th  edition to 2021.  Therefore, the 7th edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague, Czechia, in 2021. Austria will  host the event in 2022.  Despite this, to maintain support for the growth of the competition, keep the spirit of the ECSC  alive and prepare for the 2021 edition, various activities were performed during 2020, such as  the first ENISA Hackfest, the initial steps towards the selection of Team Europe for the  International Cyber Security Challenge (ICSC) planned for Athens in December 2021 and the  launch of the ICSC Steering Committee, responsible for the international competition.  ENISA is currently hosting a number of platforms and performing several activities to support  the ECSC hosting country and the future development of the project, including hosting the  ECSC main website, hosting the ECSC planning platform, working on the public affairs strategy,  creating challenges, overseeing the governance framework of the competition and providing  support for the ECSC Steering Committee as the acting secretariat.  In order to ensure appropriate and transparent reporting to the ECSC Steering Committee, the  following key observations were made by independent third-party observers who attended  ECSC 2020 planning meetings. These observations were made based on the feedback  collected from participants, members of the ECSC Steering Committee and attendees at the  Hackfest event, including through an online evaluation survey and personal interviews.   Concerning the way in which the 2020 cancellation was managed, it was stressed that  the transparency shown by ENISA and its involvement of the ECSC Steering  Committee in the decision-making were good. Decisions were made in agreement with  all countries concerned, for example on how to communicate the cancellation of ECSC  2020.   There is no need for the committee to do things very differently. Some improvements  could be made to accelerate the circulation of official documents when finalised and to  clearly state who is to receive ECSC-related documents. Based on the responses to  the organisers’ questionnaire, 77 % of respondents considered that the ECSC Steering  Committee performs well.   A clearer dissemination plan would be helpful, but there is also a need to establish a  transmission channel between the ECSC public affairs team and contractor on the one  side and national teams on the other. Many ECSC participants would welcome  messages and communication materials crafted at ECSC level. This should include  infographics and other visual elements to help to ensure that posts on Twitter or on  participants’ websites are eye-catching and engaging.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  3   Regarding ENISA Hackfest 2020, based on the questionnaire sent to participants,  76 % of respondents considered that the performance of the platform was good or  excellent. No major issues or incidents with regard to the availability of network  infrastructure were reported by respondents to the questionnaire or in interviews.  In addition, it seems worth noting that some of the open-ended comments made by the ECSC  Steering Committee members who participated in the study concerned:   the strengthening of the European dimension of the ECSC;   the need to preserve the ECSC’s spirit of fun;   the balance to be struck between opening the competition to as many countries as  possible and logistical and financial issues;   the need to develop a sense of a community and to build a community inclusive of  women and very young participants;   the need for reflection on ways to attract more women into the cybersecurity field;   the possibility of tapping into the pool of expertise formed by ECSC members.  The final of the 2021 edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague in September 2021; at least  22 countries are expected to participate. The latest updates will be published on the ECSC  2021 website (https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/).  This report is not for public dissemination. It concerns only ENISA and the members of the  ECSC Steering Committee, namely the representatives of the countries that participate in the  ECSC.  https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  4  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  The growing need for IT security professionals is widely acknowledged. According to recent  estimates, it is expected that more than 3.5 million cybersecurity professionals will be needed  worldwide by 2021 (1) to prevent, react to and protect citizens from cyber threats. Europe has to  make an effort to attract talent to and retain it in cybersecurity and, at the same time, create  solid and powerful educational, entrepreneurial and business structures in cybersecurity.  To help mitigate this shortage of skills, many countries have launched national cybersecurity  competitions targeting students, university graduates and even non-IT professionals, with a  clear aim:  ‘Identify new and young cyber talents and encourage young people to pursue a career in cyber  security.’2  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)  (https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/) leverages on these competitions by adding a  pan-European layer. Top cybersecurity talents from each participating country meet to network  and collaborate and, finally, compete against each other. Contestants are challenged to solve  security-related tasks in different domains.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that brings together young talent from across  Europe to have fun and compete in cybersecurity. Its main aim is to highlight the importance of  the national competitions.  1.1. Background to the ECSC  The project was initiated under the umbrella of the European Union’s cybersecurity strategy of  February 2013, which stated that the European Commission would:  ‘organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity championship in 2014, where university  students will compete in proposing [network and information security] solutions.’3  Since 2014, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has been supporting the  organisation of the ECSC. ENISA actively organises the meetings of the governance structures,  supports the development of the competition’s rules and challenges and is part of the ECSC  jury. Since 2016, ENISA has been the acting secretariat of the ESCS Steering Committee.  In the 2018 edition, 200 participants (contestants, coaches and judges), representing 17 EU and  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czechia,  Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Romania,  Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), competed in the ECSC final in London.  The 2019 edition of the ECSC took place in the parliament building in Bucharest, Romania, from  9 to11 October 2019. For the first time, teams from 20 countries participated in the final (Austria,  Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein,  Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the  United Kingdom).The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications, binaries and  (1) https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis  (2) ECSC Charter document  (3) https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  In a nutshell,  ECSC is the  annual European  event that brings  together young  talent from across  Europe to have  fun and compete  in cybersecurity.

However, technical skills  are just one part of the story. Time and resources were limited, and teamwork and presentation  skills were also evaluated. The top teams in ECSC 2019 were the teams from Romania, Italy  and Austria.  The 2020 edition of the ECSC, planned initially for 4 and 5 November in Vienna, had to be  cancelled owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  The 2021 edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague, Czechia, on 29 and 30 September.  1.2. The ECSC set-up  Each country is represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprising the  winners of the national competition. Half of them are 14–20 years old and half are 21–25 years  old.  Two preparatory pilot phases of the ECSC were held in 2014 (in Austria) and 2015 (in  Switzerland), attended by three and six countries, respectively. Since 2015, ENISA has used its  experience and position to coordinate and organise the ECSC and enable it to reach full  maturity.  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a steering committee, composed of  representatives of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and  provides strategic guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC  Charter, which is revised and approved every year by the ECSC Steering Committee.  ENISA is currently hosting a number of platforms and performing several activities to support  the ECSC hosting country and the future development of the project, including hosting the  ECSC main website, hosting the ECSC information-sharing platform, working on the public  affairs strategy and creating challenges.  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the hosts of future editions in order to ensure  appropriate and transparent reporting to the ECSC Steering Committee.  Each year, two ECSC Steering Committee meetings are held prior to the event:   the initial planning conference in February or March,   the main planning conference in June or July.  ENISA organised these preparatory events and had overall responsibility for the efficient  running of the project, including minuting meetings and following up on proposed actions.

Steering Committee management  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a steering committee composed of representatives  of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and provides strategic  guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC Charter, which is revised  and approved every year by the ECSC Steering Committee.  During the preparations for ECSC 2020, ENISA was responsible for the following activities  related to the management of the ECSC Steering Committee:   platform maintenance and updates,   mailing list management,   updating and creating ECSC Steering Committee-related documentation,   supporting the organisation of the initial planning conference in Vienna,   organising follow-up meetings with the ECSC Steering Committee,   organising a follow-up meeting with the ECSC 2020 chair,   COVID-19 situational assessment,   accommodation, execution and follow-up of ECSC Steering Committee requests,   implementation of changes and suggestions collected through surveys and other  feedback from previous editions,   management of the public affairs support contract,   management of the ECSC support contract,   updating the public affairs strategy,   creating various subcommittees and working groups to support new activities,   deciding on the methods for the creation of Team Europe for the International Cyber  Security Challenge (ICSC),   organisation of a hot-wash meeting,   collecting feedback through a report on lessons learned and a survey of participants.  3.2. Initial planning conference  On 13 and 14 February 2020, the ECSC initial planning conference was held in Vienna. The  following topics were discussed during the meeting:   the ECSC 2019 experience,   presentation from Austria on plans for the 2020 edition (logistics, hotels, etc.),   lessons learned from ECSC 2019,   ECSC 2020 planning status,   Brexit and new countries,   update on the ECSC Connecting Europe Facility call,   update on the ICSC,   presentation of new platforms.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  11  The following actions and decisions were agreed in the meeting:   a code of conduct was to be created;   credentials and vouchers were to be provided to enable access to the Austrian  platform that was to be used during the competition;   the presentations were to be eliminated in the next edition of the ECSC, with a  subcommittee to be formed to submit proposals on the development of soft skills;   a calculation tool was to be provided for checking the ages of the participants;   two subcommittees were to be formed, with the following members:  o Subcommittee No 1 on ICSC decisions:   Austria   Cyprus   Czechia   Germany   Ireland   Luxembourg   Portugal   Spain   ENISA.  o Subcommittee No 2 on soft skills:   Austria   Czechia   France   Germany   Greece   Norway   the Netherlands.  After the event, the minutes of the meeting were circulated to the ECSC Steering Committee for  review and approval.  3.3. COVID-19 impact assessment  During the months of April and May 2020, ENISA and the ECSC Steering Committee  chair/organising country (Austria) were continuously assessing the situation in order to monitor  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the participant countries and have available the  information required to enable the best decision to be taken on holding the final in Vienna.  During May 2020, ENISA led the collection of information from the participant countries  regarding the following issues:   impact of the situation on national competitions,   impact on meetings of national teams,   measures taken and special considerations required,   if the situation threatened national teams’ participation in the final.  Given the force majeure of the situation and the measures imposed by the Austrian  government, finally Austria decided that the competition needed to be either postponed or  cancelled, and an ad hoc meeting between ECSC organising countries was arranged in order to  present and consult on the different options. After the situation was explained, Norway, the  2022 host, and the subsequent organising countries agreed to the postponement of their  competitions for 1 year and yielded the 2022 edition to Austria. It was not possible to postpone  until next year because Czechia already had organisational commitments in place.  Following this agreement between Norway, Italy and Poland, the ECSC final will take place in  Austria in 2022, Norway in 2023, Italy in 2024 and Poland in 2025. The 2021 edition remains  the same.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  12  After this agreement, on 18 May, an extraordinary ECSC Steering Committee teleconference  was arranged to announce the postponement and the new dates for the competitions and to  formally approve the decision.  In addition, at this meeting special measures to mitigate the impact of the situation were  adopted by the ECSC Steering Committee, such as raising by 1 year the maximum age for  participation in the 2021 competition.  Regarding the official announcement of the changes, the ECSC Steering Committee proposed  that the participating countries create a joint communication plan, define a common message  and coordinate media activities. A dedicated teleconference was organised by ENISA’s public  affairs team on 29 May. The official postponement announcement was launched on 3 June on  the ENISA website (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-  challenge-2020-dates-changed), followed by various social media activities. In addition, the  ECSC official website was modified accordingly.  Figure 2: News item on the ENISA website announcing the postponement of ECSC 2020  3.4. International Cyber Security Challenge  Building on the success of the ECSC, ENISA, with the help of other regional and international  organisations, decided to design and host the ICSC. The aim of the challenge is to attract young  talent and raise awareness in the global community of the education and skills needed in the  area of cybersecurity.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-challenge-2020-dates-changed https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-challenge-2020-dates-changed  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  13  To this end, a steering committee comprising representatives of government and regional  institutions and universities and research centres will design a competition between teams from  different regions. So far, teams from South-East Asia, Oceania, the United States, Latin  America and Africa have expressed a clear interest in participating.  Teams will compete in a series of challenges (to be decided by the ICSC Steering Committee)  in a number of areas, such as web application and system exploitation, cryptography, reverse  engineering, hardware challenges, forensics and escape rooms. The ICSC brand is expected to  be associated with the top cybersecurity talents of the world, and ENISA anticipates that the  ICSC will become one of the world’s key incubators of cybersecurity entrepreneurship and top  security experts.  ENISA is committed to organising the first ICSC final in Greece and supporting the development  of the competition’s rules and governing body. Each region will be represented at the  competition by a team comprising young talent from countries in the region. The regions will be  responsible for selecting and training team members. ENISA proposes that the first ICSC  final be held during the second week of December 2021. The international competition  will be held in Athens.  This competition can have a significant impact on strengthening cybersecurity; some of the  objectives are the following:   create and nurture a global multistakeholder cybersecurity challenge;   strengthen international cooperation on cybersecurity;   contribute to the world’s strategy on cyberspace;   promote capture the flag (CTF) competitions by leveraging to an international level;   engage a wider audience and increase the level of awareness of the importance of holding  events such as the ECSC;   promote young talent across the world;   promote cybersecurity training at an international level;   develop various skills, including both technical skills and soft skills such as teamwork,  presentation skills and public speaking;   promote professional careers in cybersecurity by putting the young professionals in the  spotlight and highlighting the interesting career paths available, in order to address the  shortage of cybersecurity professionals.  During early 2020, ENISA completed the creation of the ICSC Steering Committee to support  management activities. The committee:   is composed of representatives of the regions that have committed to competing in the ICSC;   is the ultimate decision-making body on the ICSC;   defines the role and composition of the ICSC secretariat.   provides leadership and direction on the scope and management of the work to be undertaken  on matters that relate to the ICSC’s scope and objectives, and related risks and issues, as  necessary;   acts in the best interests of the ICSC;   provides steering and guidance on ICSC activities, while respecting the overall responsibilities  of all stakeholders;   is a delegated decision-making authority on the related activities within the scope of the ICSC;   keeps relevant stakeholders informed on the ICSC and related developments.   approves the ICSC Charter and the ICSC competition rules, accepts submissions from  potential future hosting countries, decides on the dates and location of ICSC events, and  makes decisions on any other issues arising, for example in the event of disputes.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  14  Representatives of the various regions were engaged by ENISA during 2020 and began  discussions to establish the required structures and the basis for the long-term development of  future editions, namely:   a consistent set of rules for the competition (ages and number of participants,  requirements, etc.);   the final curricula for the competition;   the final format of the competition and the methods for maintaining a high level of  transparency and trust between the regions.  ENISA, in the role of ICSC secretariat and organising body, executed the following actions in  order to support ICSC activities:   making initial contact with and engaging the International Steering Committee,   creating a mailing list,   creating a common roadmap,   creating of space in the collaboration platform (Communication and Information  Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (CIRCAB)),   organising follow-up meetings during the year,   starting preparatory activities for the competition,   developing key documentation,   organising surveys and collection of information to support the decision-making  process,   carrying out activities to prepare for the final in December 2021.  3.5.  ENISA HACKFEST 2020  On 16–18 November, ENISA hosted ENISA Hackfest 2020 (https://enisa-  hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/), a CTF event for cybersecurity professionals and students to  connect and train the teams participating in the 2021 ECSC. Contestants were challenged on  an individual level to solve cybersecurity problems in areas such as web security, mobile  security, cryptography, reverse engineering and forensics. The Hackfest brought together more  than 250 participants from 17 EU and EFTA countries. The event was held in a virtual format.  The event was to be used:   as a testbed for future Team Europe selection activities;   by ECSC national teams to assess future players’ performance;   as training for ECSC participants;   to provide support to countries that cannot afford a national qualifying competition.  The event was hosted on a cloud-based platform (cyberEDU.ro) that can host large CTF  competitions of various types, such as jeopardy, attack-and-defence and king-of-the-hill  competitions, as well as competitions in other, more complex, formats such as cyber-range,  classroom style, etc. The platform supports individual and team-based competitions. The  technology can host events with as few as 10 players or as many as 5 000 and even more.  https://enisa-hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/ https://enisa-hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/ https://cyberedu.ro/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  15  Figure 3: The ENISA Hackfest 2020 logo  3.5.1.

ENISA Hackfest 2020 – lessons learned  3.5.4.1. Scoring  Dynamic scoring continues to be one of the most objective and accurate ways to evaluate the  difficulty of challenges based on the technical level of players. The proposed algorithm worked as  expected and no malicious behaviour was detected.  The potential risks and disadvantages of dynamic scoring are that:  ● providing the same challenges to a group of players with different experience could give different  results;  ● malicious players could register additional fake users and solve a particular challenge in order  to decrease the total number of points, providing an unfair advantage to other players who solve  other challenges.  Lesson learned. ENISA recommends considering the use of dynamic scoring for any type of  jeopardy competition but also keeping in mind the potential risks.  3.5.5. Challenges  The Hackfest Consortium set 26 challenges with 2 backups (14 previously used and 12 new  challenges) for the event. No significant disruption of infrastructure was detected during the  competition, but certain Layer 7-oriented attacks (mostly denial of service) were addressed.  Players who had previously solved the reused challenges found this situation unattractive and  their tendency was to search for write-ups or use their previous solutions, rather than trying to  solve the challenge again. However, many players did prefer to try to solve the challenges again  and actually learn from this experience.  Lesson learned. ENISA recommends not reusing challenges in future.  3.5.6. Communication  The consortium took an innovative approach to communication this year, using an official Discord  group with several communication channels.  Access to each channel was granted by a custom-made bot developed by the consortium. The  bot granted access to channels to players based on invitation links, in accordance with predefined  user roles (player, country coordinator and organiser). Moreover, the bot monitored  communication between players and removed any message that potentially contained a flag or  part of it.  The benefits were:  ● voice chat, which allowed networking between players;  ● flexible application programming interfaces (APIs), to enable the creation of bots with different  levels of capabilities;  ● very good and granular user access.  The disadvantages were that:  ● the bot developer needed to introduce failover/healing features, since Discord APIs can have  downtime quite often.  ● voice chat could be used for flag sharing, bypassing the bot’s control.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  19  Lesson learned. Discord channels can be an alternative to Telegram or Slack for this type of  event; however, certain issues must be taken into consideration.  Figure 4: The ENISA Hackfest 2020 platform  3.5.7. Support  In order to provide 24/7 technical support for 48 hours, the consortium used the following  mechanisms.  ● The challenge authors were available during the event and they answered questions when  addressed.  ● Each question answered was added to a common frequently asked questions (FAQs) document,  which allowed the support team to answer common questions more quickly and focus on new  or critical situations.  ● During the night, at least one person was available at any point and was able to respond to all  questions received.  Lesson learned. Developing a live FAQs document for challenges can speed up support  resolutions during CTF competitions, which are quite intensive and exhausting for support teams  if the event happens over several days.  Feature improvement. Another potential improvement would be adding a bot that can manage  tickets, which could speed up the process, since a player would no longer have to wait for the  identification of a staff member who was available to answer their question.  3.5.8. Complaints  Players and country coordinators had channels where they could make complaints. During the  event, most of the conversations were challenge-related. The only question that could be  construed as a complaint was related to the availability of rankings for individual players, so that  participants could see how their country was situated in comparison with other countries.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  20  3.5.9. Infrastructure and platform  The event was hosted on a cloud-based platform (cyberEDU.ro) that can host large CTF  competitions in various formats. The platform and infrastructure had 100 % uptime during the  event, with some minor issues during the first hour relating to reporting of results to country  coordinators and organisers, which were immediately addressed by the consortium.  The benefits of using the platform, rather than other open-source/standard technologies, are as  follows.  ● Management of the competition. The platform allowed the consortium to set up and manage  the event in minutes, with various custom fields at registration, multiple-level access  (i.e.. organiser, teacher/country coordinator and player levels), dynamic scoring and more.  ● Scalability. Since the entire application uses Kubernetes, the infrastructure can be scaled as  needed for the existing load with no downtime recorded.  ● Moderation. Having moderation support for registration allowed country leaders to accept or  reject players.  ● Self-healing challenges. The platform allowed players to vote for restart when a challenge  seemed to be down or malfunctioning, and it automatically restarted the challenge when the  system detected suspicious delays in response.  Lessons learned are the following.  ● Self-healing challenges. These proved to be an improvement in terms of reducing staff effort  required to manage the infrastructure; staff were able to solve downtime and malfunctioning  from their phones.  ● One-to-one resources for players. To further improve the experience of players, the platform  used for future editions of the event should allow each player to run and restart their own  instance of each challenge.  3.5.10. Miscellaneous lessons learned and recommendations  ● Some players complained that organising the event over a weekend would have allowed them  more involvement in the competition.  ● Some players complained about the lack of prizes/stakes, sometimes stating that this was one  of the main reasons for limited numbers of players representing their countries.  ● Some players recommended not reusing challenges in future.  ● Some players complained that participation by women needed to be considerably increased.  ● The consortium recommends considering the possibility of (distributed) denial of service  attacks on the infrastructure (the CTF platform and the challenges infrastructure) when  creating such events, especially competitions with publicly available access, and enabling  various security measures including:  ○ backup infrastructure;  ○ anti-denial of service attack solutions (e.g. websites should have Cloudflare or other  traffic-filtering technologies in place);  ○ auto-scaling infrastructures to address higher loads;  ○ available response teams that can monitor the load and/or attacks and can respond  properly in minutes;  ○ dedicated resources for each player or for a number of players;  ○ controlling access to infrastructures with tunnelling technologies such as  OpenVPN/Wireguard.  https://cyberedu.ro/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  21  3.5.11. Public affairs and communications  After the competition, ENISA created and sent to the ECSC mailing list a document intended to  align communication activities with all media points of contacts in the various ECSC participant  countries.  The document contained the following information:   links and guidelines on sharing information (text, hashtags, etc.),   a link to an ENISA news item (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-  news/enisa2019s-48h-hackfest-puts-europe2019s-cybersecurity-talent-to-the-test),   social media links:  o Twitter post 1 (https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329365661928177664),  o Twitter post 2 (https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381551575019520),  o Twitter post 3  (https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381843263746048/photo/1),  o Facebook post  (https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY/posts/3108688432569452),  LinkedIn post (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-  cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-  6735131891386658816-g3wi),   statistics (some general information about the participation in the event),   the competition logo,   a screenshot of the platform,   visual material for social media, developed by ENISA’s public affairs team, as shown in  Figure 5.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa2019s-48h-hackfest-puts-europe2019s-cybersecurity-talent-to-the-test https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa2019s-48h-hackfest-puts-europe2019s-cybersecurity-talent-to-the-test https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329365661928177664 https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381551575019520 https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381843263746048/photo/1 https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY/posts/3108688432569452 https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-6735131891386658816-g3wi https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-6735131891386658816-g3wi https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-6735131891386658816-g3wi  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  22  Figure 5: Social media material on ENISA Hackfest 2020  3.6. PLATFORMS  The updated list of ECSC-related platforms is the following:   test scoreboard and contracts platform (only available from a certain point before the  competition) (https://board.ecsc.eu),   test scoreboard code repository (https://github.com/enisaeu/ecsc-gameboard),   file-sharing platform (ownCloud) used for information sharing and as a contingency  mechanism (https://storage.ecsc.eu/),   the ECSC website used to promote the event and provide real-time scoring information  during the challenge to external interested parties  (https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/),  https://board.ecsc.eu/ https://github.com/enisaeu/ecsc-gameboard https://storage.ecsc.eu/ https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  23   the challenges platform on which previous years’ ECSC challenges are collected  (https://challenges.ecsc.eu/),   the collaboration platform (https://cermit.enisa.europa.eu/ui/welcome).  During 2020, two new platforms were added to support ECSC activities, the ECSC challenges  platform and the collaboration platform.  3.6.1. ECSC challenges platform  The idea was to create a simple, public-facing platform to provide access to all the challenges  from past ECSCs and others that were not used during past events and could be used for  training.  Figure 6: The ECSC challenges repository  3.6.2. ECSC collaboration platform  The objectives of this platform are to improve the exchange of information among ECSC  Steering Committee members and to provide a single place to store all ECSC-related  information.  The selected platform, Cermit/CIRCABC, is supported and maintained by the European  Commission and uses the European Commission Authentication Service (ECAS) as an  authentication service.  https://challenges.ecsc.eu/ https://cermit.enisa.europa.eu/ui/welcome  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  24  Figure 7: The ECSC collaboration platform  3.7. Public affairs and media activities  The following key media activities were carried out during 2020 in collaboration with the various  media points of contact appointed from the ECSC Steering Committee:   coordinating the communication of the cancellation of the ECSC 2020 final,   coordinating the announcement of the ENISA Hackfest 2020 post-event activities,   updating attendees at the ECSC hot-wash meeting on ECSC public affairs activities.  Figure 8: Update on ECSC public affairs activities presented at the ECSC hot-wash meeting  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  25  Figure 9: Phases of ECSC public affairs activities  3.8. WORKING GROUPS  During 2020, three new working groups were created, two of them as per the ECSC Steering  Committee’s decision during the initial planning conference in Vienna.  3.8.1. International working group  This group is intended to support the creation of Team Europe for the ICSC, planned for  December 2021. During 2020, it carried out the following actions.   The working group created the mandate for the ICSC Subcommittee, which was  approved by the ECSC Steering Committee on 20 July 2020. The aim of the document  is to set out the delegation of responsibilities from the ECSC Steering Committee to the  subcommittee, and in particular to specify:  o the composition and the means of acceptance of the subcommittee;  o the tasks, purpose, role, boundaries and responsibilities of the subcommittee;  o the duration of the subcommittee’s mandate and the means of renewal.   It created a document on the trainer selection process (‘Coaches requirements and  selection’), which was approved by the ECSC Steering Committee on 20 November  2020. The aim of the document is to set out the process for selecting the trainers for  the future Team Europe, and in particular to specify:  o the composition of the team of trainers and the means of selection;  o the goals for Team Europe;  o requirements for the trainers;  o tasks, role, boundaries and responsibilities of the trainers;  o the selection process;  o the duration of the trainers´ mandate and the means of renewal.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  26   The working group created the call for trainers, launched on 23 November 2020.   It proceeded with the final selection of trainers, which was completed on 11 December  2020.   It started discussions about the selection mechanisms and the training path, in  coordination with ENISA.  Figure 10: Relations between the international and European committees  3.8.2. Soft skills development working group  This working group was created to discuss and propose new ideas to replace the presentations  as a soft skills development mechanism during the finals.  A space on the collaboration platform was created for this group; however, owing to the COVID-  19 pandemic and the cancellation of the 2020 edition, no relevant decisions were made on this  topic.  3.8.3. Media and public affairs points of contact working group  This working group was created to address the identified need to establish a permanent  coordination group for the alignment of public affairs, communication and media activities.  This list of contact points is expected to improve timeliness and collaboration with regard to  communication activities.  The group was started to work on the communication of the cancellation of the 2020 final and  on communication activities relating to ENISA Hackfest 2020.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  27  4. ECSC 2020 – LESSONS  LEARNED AND MATURITY  ASSESSMENT  A report on lessons learned has been produced by an external contractor on behalf of ENISA. It  builds to some extent on the report on lessons learned from ECSC 2019, for the sake of  consistency, and highlights comments and views provided by a number of ECSC Steering  Committee members and ECSC representatives recommended by ENISA, as well as by several  ENISA Hackfest 2020 organisers and participants.  Figure 10: Process of building the lessons learned  The report aggregates and puts into perspective a number of comments and views from  stakeholders who were prompted to reflect on Hackfest 2020 and on the maturity of the ECSC.  This feedback was collected through the following methods.   Two online EUSurvey-based questionnaires, which combined closed and open-ended  questions, and which were intended respectively for participants in Hackfest 2020  (defined as the individuals who were selected at national level and joined the event to  try to solve the challenges) and for the organisers of Hackfest 2020 (understood in a  generic way and referring to the people behind the organisation of the Hackfest event,  including ECSC Steering Committee members). In total, 56 people responded to the  questionnaires, distributed as follows: 47 participants and 9 organisers.   A series of phone, Microsoft Teams or GoToMeeting interviews with ECSC Steering  Committee members (or ECSC representatives acting as deputies) recommended by  ENISA. In total, six interviews with eight people were conducted.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  28  It is important to note that ENISA acted only as an intermediary in the data collection process. It  provided support to encourage participation in the surveys and helped in identifying ECSC  Steering Committee members to contact, but it refrained from any participation in the interviews  in order to ensure the neutrality of the discussion.  Although the intention was to replicate the approach and methodology adopted for the maturity  assessment conducted in 2019, the focus of which was ECSC 2019 (held in Bucharest,  Romania), this report on lessons learned had to introduce some changes to the methodology  owing to the specific circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, namely:   no field research or direct observation-based inputs as part of the collected qualitative  data;   revision of the high-level domains because of the irrelevance of those related to venue  and logistics;   revision of some of the objectives to account for the change in event (Hackfest 2020  instead of ECSC 2020);   adoption of a distinction between a general perspective (still appropriate for  governance and decision-making and public affairs high-level domains) and a focus on  Hackfest 2020 (for challenges and compliance).  For the sake of consistency, the high-level domains, parameters and evaluation criteria  previously defined have been kept for this report. The change of scope, with Hackfest 2020  replacing ECSC 2020, has, however, rendered it impossible to conduct a maturity assessment  directly comparable to the 2019 maturity assessment.  The following domains were evaluated:  1. governance and decision-making aspects,  2. public affairs – general perspective,  3. challenges – focus on Hackfest 2020,  4. logistics – aspects of the competition related to the venue, catering, hotels,  transportation, etc.,  5. side events – aspects of the competition related to social events and networking  meetings,  6. compliance – aspects of the competition related to compliance with laws and  standards.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  29  4.1. GOVERNANCE AND DECISION-MAKING ASPECTS  Parameter Objective  Feedback from Hackfest / maturity assessment,  questionnaires and interviews  Roles and  responsibilities  An ECSC project governance  model is established, which  specifies that a dedicated team  is to be established to organise  the ECSC. This model includes  clear roles and responsibilities  to facilitate the correct  ownership of tasks and project  management.  • The presentation of the ECSC 2021 organisation team at the  hot-wash meeting on 26 November 2020 was very useful. Some  participants were pleasantly surprised that logistics-related  aspects had already tackled and were reported on at this stage.  • The hot-wash meeting on the last day of ECSC 2019 made the  ECSC Steering Committee members realise that the Romanian  organisational team had been relatively small and that each  member of the organisational team had had a lot of  responsibilities. The ECSC 2021 organisational team has been  put together to ensure that the workload remains manageable for  each team member. The decision has also been made by the  Czech organisers that each team member is to be the  coordinator of his or her own tasks, with clear prioritisation of  tasks.  • The Czech organisational team has adopted a ‘crisis  management’ approach and has started thinking about potential  problems that may arise and how to deal with them in a timely  manner.  Decision- making of the  ECSC Steering  Committee and  jury  The ECSC Steering Committee  is a decision-making body that  serves the improvement of the  ECSC. Meetings of the  committee are highly effective  and have a clear and agreed-  upon agenda. Decisions taken  by the ECSC Steering  Committee are logged in a  decision-making register that  can be referred to in subsequent  meetings. This logbook contains  information about decisions,  owners and actions.  • A steering committee of 27 members is challenging. The ECSC  Steering Committee nevertheless operates in a clear way and  works towards improvements, concerned with learning from the  past to make the next edition better.  • Based on the responses to the organisers’ questionnaire, 77 %  of respondents consider that the ECSC Steering Committee  performs well.  • Suggestions for improvements are openly discussed within the  committee and then followed up on.  • There is no need for the ECSC Steering Committee to do things  very differently. Some improvements could be made to  accelerate the circulation of official documents when finalised  and to clearly state who is to receive ECSC-related documents,  for example everyone, ECSC participants or the members of the  ECSC Steering Committee.  • There is a good feeling that there are no hidden agendas within  the ECSC Steering Committee and that committee members are  willing to discuss and sort out any potential issues.  • Concerning the way in which the 2020 cancellation was  managed, it was stressed that the transparency shown by ENISA  and its involvement of the ECSC Steering Committee in the  decision-making were good. Decisions were made in agreement  with all countries concerned, for example on how to  communicate the cancellation of ECSC 2020.  • It is helpful to have the CIRCABC as a centralised source of  information.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  30  Transparency Decisions taken by the ECSC  Steering Committee are  communicated in a transparent  manner to all relevant  stakeholders including  participants and organisers.  Clear guidelines on the  practicalities of the event are  communicated to the audience  in a timely manner.  • It is important that jury members be selected in a  straightforward and transparent way. The jury selection process  as designed and led by ENISA is efficient.  • In addition to a clear division of labour and of roles and  responsibilities, there is a need for ENISA and the ECSC hosting  country to coordinate their communication and align the  information they deliver to participants.  • The model according to which the ECSC organiser takes the  chair makes sense and has proved a good governance model.  • The decision adopted for ECSC 2019 to have a jury making  decisions then communicating them to the ECSC Steering  Committee should be replicated, as it ensures unbiased  decisions.  • It was deemed by organisers that all the questions they raised  about Hackfest 2020 received a timely and helpful response from  ENISA.  National  participation  As ECSC relates to European  strategic policy objectives, the  ECSC Steering Committee  actively attracts and encourages  non-participating European  countries to become part of the  initiative.  • There is value in having an increased number of participating  countries.  • Certain limitations need to be kept in mind, such as the  logistical burden, costs for the hosting country, constraints on  selecting an appropriate platform.  • Since 2017, the ECSC has attracted more professionals and  more countries. This has resulted in greater costs, a heavy  logistical burden and funding-related issues. There is also a risk  that the spirit of competition will prevails over the intended spirit  of fun.  4.2. PUBLIC AFFAIRS – GENERAL PERSPECTIVE  Parameter Objective  Feedback from Hackfest / maturity assessment and  questionnaires  Monitoring,  measurement  and analysis  (key  performance  indicators  (KPIs))  In order to measure the  effectiveness of the public affairs  strategy, KPIs are set. These  KPIs make it possible to monitor  the impact of communication  activities on the general public,  measure the strategy’s success  in accordance with the objectives  set and analyse the overall  outcome of the strategy. In  addition, this objective- and data- driven approach to assessing the  activities conducted under the  public affairs strategy make it  possible to compare strategies  over the years and identify  trends.  • For guidance, participating teams need to be aware of the KPIs  set out in the public affairs strategy. Collecting social media  statistics from them should be feasible.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  31  Dissemination  plan  An ECSC dissemination plan is  established in order to facilitate  timely and coordinated  implementation of the ECSC  public affairs strategy among all  participants and ECSC  stakeholders. The plan ensures  coherent and synchronised  communication about ECSC in  accordance with a well-defined  dissemination timeline.  • The clear dissemination plan is helpful, but there is also a need  to establish a transmission channel between the ECSC public  affairs team and contractor on the one side and national teams  on the other  • Finding the right contact point in each country can be an issue.  • ECSC provides a good dissemination plan and tools. However,  some countries do not have sufficient resources to promote  ECSC at national level or are not forceful enough in doing so.  • To ensure consistent communication about ECSC, ‘ready to  post’ messages should be prepared and communicated in  advance when possible.  • Special efforts should be put into the crafting of short sentences  to make their translation from English into the participants’  languages and the hosting country’s national language easy.  • Presenting all the ECSC 2021 participating teams in a soccer  tournament-style graphic could be seen as a coherent and  synchronised communication activity. This would enhance the  ECSC’s visual identity and underline the pan-European spirit of  the event.  • Communication during the challenges has to be very dynamic  (e.g. live streaming). It should target the people who are not  participating, since ECSC participants are very engaged anyway.  Key  Messages  Targeted and effective key  messages are developed to  promote / communicate about the  ECSC to all participants and  ECSC stakeholders. The key  messages are tailored to the  different audiences (i.e. key  audience, keep informed, keep  satisfied, monitor) and  dissemination phases (i.e.  awareness, understanding,  excitement, commitment,  satisfaction).  • Many ECSC participants, especially those that do not have  dedicated resources for communication activities, would welcome  messages and communication materials crafted at ECSC level.  This should include infographics and other visual elements to  help to ensure that posts on Twitter or on participants’ websites  are eye-catching and engaging.  • ECSC communication materials need to be easy to customise  and to integrate into participants’ own communication channels.  • Using centralised/standardised communication materials has  some limitations, especially when communicating with young  people. Communication that is too official may be badly received,  or not received at all, and could be detrimental to the ‘fun  competition’ image that the ESCS is expected to convey.  • There are differences between the way countries communicate  (e.g. between northern and southern European countries).  Centralised communication messages should be ‘basic’ enough  to allow for cultural twists.  • ECSC messages are more difficult to relay through national  print media, as press articles cannot focus only on the  competition. These messages have to include a reminder about  what the ECSC is about in addition to adopting a clear national  focus.  • ECSC participants are likely to lack connections in the  European print media and cannot be always expected to relay  ECSC communication messages in this way.  Engagement  and reach  The ECSC public affairs strategy  is designed in such a way as to  achieve maximum engagement  of the audience. In order to sculpt  the most relevant messages and  maximise the interest and  engagement of the audience,  different engagement groups  have been identified (i.e. key  audience, keep informed, keep  satisfied, monitor).  • Media influencers could be a good idea, but payment for them  may be an issue.  • Some organisations have embedded media influencers (e.g. a  community manager). The issue at stake in this case relates  more to alignment and coordination between participating  countries.  • Some channels are already well followed and YouTubers on  cybersecurity would be great media influencers.  • Having well-known female researchers in cyber active on  Twitter and relaying messages about the ECSC would be helpful  to attract more girls.  • More media visibility is needed to improve all the teams.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  32  Social media  and visibility  Social media platforms (Twitter,  LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)  are used to facilitate interaction  and dissemination of key  messages with limited effort.  Social media messages should  be short, tailored to the audience  and follow the dissemination plan  in order to reach their full  potential.  • There should be specific communication channels for ECSC,  not only communication through ENISA’s channels.  • Specific ECSC LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram  accounts are a step in the right direction. They will generate  content that is easy to circulate and should trigger more  interaction.  • There is uncertainty about whether creating ECSC LinkedIn,  Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts will be useful in  teasing out and attracting new participants. YouTube might have  greater reach.  • Dedicated ECSC social media channels would make it possible  to give more visibility to participating countries’ posts, as ENISA  cannot be expected to focus only on ECSC.  • Dedicated ECSC social media channels would help centralise  information and keep it up to date.  • The fact that it is up to the hosting country and organisers to set  up dedicated ECSC social media channels may mean that the  ECSC misses out on benefits because of a lack of cumulative  effects. Having permanent ECSC social media accounts would  raise issues about ownership, though.  • An explicit ECSC social media identity would increase the  ECSC’s visibility.  Website An official ECSC website is set  up to publish news updates (e.g.  press releases) before, during  and after the ECSC. The website  allows the audience to replicate  published messages and share  them with other websites.  • The official ECSC website provides clear and informative  content.  • The redesign of the website after ECSC 2018 was well done  and the site for ECSC 2019 offered better ergonomics and richer  content.  • Using the ECSC website to post news updates that are easy for  participants to replicate and circulate should be helpful, especially  if these updates include real-time information on the scoreboard.  4.3. CHALLENGES – FOCUS ON ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Objective  Feedback from Hackfest / maturity assessment and  questionnaires  Design The design of the challenges  reflects a reasonable learning  curve in accordance with the  average level of the participants.  The challenges include real-life  scenarios, which involve multiple  aspects of cybersecurity and push  participants to their limits.  • Based on the questionnaire sent to participants, 56 % of  respondents did not find, or found only to some extent, the  challenges diverse enough and requiring different skills.  • There was an unbalanced number of challenges per category  (e.g. there was only one exploiting challenge) and, generally  speaking, too much web hacking.  • Challenges that were a matter of guessing a certain method or  approach, relying on random algorithms, were not considered  good teaching material.  • Forensics challenges that were more about steganography and  random miscellaneous concepts than real-life forensic techniques  were considered less interesting from a teaching perspective.  • Steganography was commented on as not a valid CTF category  in timed events, as, at most, it evaluates the users’ creative  insights and analytical skills.  • Challenges should test participants’ understanding of  computers, not the creators’ mindset or general knowledge of  trivia.  • Easier warm-up challenges were lacking and would have kept  motivation high.  • Challenges were lacking an intermediate waypoint to let  participants know that they were on the right track.  • Social skills were not really tested.  • Solo participation instead of doing a CTF challenge as a team  was considered far less fun and not as good from a learning  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  33  perspective. It was also suspected to discourage participation in  Hackfest 2020, as there are other online places that permit  participants to tackle challenges with friends.  • Prizes or goody bags would have been nice, as they are  expected when participating in CTF competitions.  Rules The rules are clear, unambiguous  and agreed upon by all  participants. The rules are clearly  communicated to the teams.  Compliance with the rules is  monitored and used to avoid  malicious activities.  • There was good awareness about the Hackfest rules among the  participants.  • Participants knew whom to approach with questions or if they  had technical difficulties.  • The overall process of qualification was unclear without  concrete rules on how Hackfest 2020 related to qualifying  competitions.  Enforcement The rules are enforced in a  consistent manner. Breaches of  the rules are followed by the  consequences are agreed upon  by the jury.  • Some participants noticed that at some point during the CTF  competition more than 20 people were in the Discord voice chat  exchanging flags.  • It was very difficult to judge whether some participants did or did  not use existing write-ups in their solutions to challenges.  Presentations  (NB: this  parameter  relates  specifically to  the ECSC)  The content of presentations  given by participants and/or  sponsors aligns with the  objectives of the ECSC regarding  building expertise and meets the  expectations of participants.  • The team presentation at the ECSC is deemed a challenge in  itself.  • The jury’s expectations are unclear, and this makes it difficult for  people presenting to pitch for the right audience; they run the risk  of being too technical (or not technical enough).  Platform A capacity and quality  assessment of the platform is  performed to ensure the stability  and security of the platform during  the challenge and its ongoing  ability to meet the requirements,  standards, scale and expectations  of the ECSC. Unforeseen  circumstances that might affect  the continuity of the platform –  and of the event – are thereby  taken into account. The  assessment of the platform  includes regular and adequate  testing of the platform by the  service provider.  • Based on the questionnaire sent to participants, 76 % of  respondents considered that the performance of the platform was  good or excellent.  • The platform was considered reliable and stable, with good  support provided by the Bit Sentinel team.  Infrastructure The IT infrastructure supporting  the platform for the ECSC is  reliable, trustworthy and ensures  all participants can equally and  fairly connect to the platform. The  infrastructure provider should take  into account potential unforeseen  circumstances that might affect  the continuity of the infrastructure  and take preventive and reactive  measures as appropriate  (including failovers, backup  configurations, high-availability  measures).  • No major issues or incidents with regard to the availability of  network infrastructure were reported by respondents to  questionnaire and interviewees.  • The registration process could have been more straightforward,  according to some participants, but in general, it was deemed  fine.  Complexity The level of complexity of the  challenge is sufficiently mature to  provide a challenging competition  that attracts top cybersecurity  talent from all over Europe. The  complexity meets the participants’  expectations.  • Based on the questionnaire sent to participants, 34 % of  respondents were satisfied to some extent by the technical  complexity of the challenges and 30 % were not.  • Some challenges were considered fun but, in general,  participants felt that the challenges were not of the quality  expected of such an event. In particular, the reuse of several  challenges, write-ups on which were already widely available  online (e.g. from DefCamp Capture the Flag 2019), was  disappointing to them.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  34  • Participants who were familiar with CyberEDU or the DefCamp  2019 competition were perceived as having a slight advantage.  • In addition to challenges that were re-used, those involving too  much guessing were deemed ‘unfair’ and even to ruin part of the  fun.  • Some participants noticed spelling mistakes.  • Challenges involving Braille, Morse code or guessing were  criticised by some participants.  • Brute-forcing as an intended solution to recover a flag was not  deemed a good thing. Where a task had a good back story but  some cipher (considered ‘obscure’) was put on the flag when all  the other parts of the task had been solved, ending the challenge  in this way was not considered enjoyable.  • Hints should have been more useful and more numerous.  • From a practical point of view, it was regretted that the Hackfest  had taken place during the week. As the participants were mostly  students and young professionals, it was difficult for them to free  themselves up to participate fully. This factor alone limited the  level of participation in Hackfest 2020 and led to some  participants thinking they had been at a disadvantage.  • Holding an event during the working week makes it more  difficult to guarantee that all the participants from all countries  have the same availability to compete.  Scoring The scoring mechanism is  transparent with regard to  attribution and distribution of  points and is approved by the  ECSC Steering Committee.  • The lack of a global scoreboard, making it impossible for  participants to compare their performance against others, was  considered an issue.  • The scoring method was not clear.  • Some participants resented the fact that dynamic scoring was  mixed with so many challenges that required guessing, so that  some challenges that required a huge amount of work and  competence were worth less than some challenges that were not  instructive.  • The scoreboard seemed to be not completely fair.  • A lack of opportunities for participants to receive some feedback  on how well they perform is likely to reduce the incentive to  participate, especially in the case of solo CTF challenges.  4.4. COMPLIANCE – FOCUS ON ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Objective Observations  Data  protection  The ECSC Steering Committee is  committed to ensuring compliance  with relevant data protection and  privacy legislation such as the  general data protection regulation.  Although the ECSC does not  process personal data as part of its  core business, it may happen that  some activities require processing of  personal data (e.g. collecting  customer satisfaction information or  publishing pictures of the event)  • The requirement to have a Google account for submitting write- ups, especially when having a registered account on the CyberEDU  platform already, was puzzling to some participants.  • Some participants did not like that documents were shared on  Google Drive.  • Some participants found it weird to have to give their full name and  that it was displayed on the scoreboard. They were expecting that  usernames would be enough.  • An issue was reported on the Discord server. The ticket to access  a dedicated page was not clearly communicated and some  participants found themselves receiving messages from other events  going on at the same time.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  35  5. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1. GOVERNANCE AND DECISION-MAKING ASPECTS  Parameter Recommendations  Roles and  responsibilities  • National teams should be made aware of the amount of work involved in the preparation for and  organisation of ECSC events, to manage expectations.  • National team members should be encouraged and reminded to respond to the survey circulated  by the Czech organisers, in order to help them anticipate as much as possible participants’ needs  and facilitate their work.  Decision- making of the  ECSC Steering  Committee and  jury  • Ensure that all ECSC 2021 participants are aware that the Czech national team will not take part  in the competition, to end any potential concerns about the national team’s having some undue  advantages.  • Make the most of the CIRCABC platform, ensuring that all the ECSC Steering Committee  members who were experiencing issues with logging in have sorted them out and that news, the  committee’s agendas, minutes and related documents are uploaded in a timely manner and kept  up to date on the platform.  • The decision-making process adopted in Romania, with the jury taking decisions then passing  them on to the ECSC Steering Committee, should be retained, as it proved to be efficient.  Transparency • Make sure that the recipients to be sent ECSC-related documents are explicitly mentioned in the  documents, to facilitate their circulation.  • Clarify the relationship between the ECSC and ICSC steering committees and have more  meetings minuted to avoid any misunderstandings or misinterpretations that could lead to  confusion among the ECSC Steering Committee members.  National  participation  • Concerns voiced by some ECSC members that by expanding to new countries, logistics- and  funding-related issues have grown to the point that they are compromising the ECSC’s spirit of fun  should be taken into account and addressed.  5.2. PUBLIC AFFAIRS – GENERAL PERSPECTIVE  Parameter Recommendations  Monitoring,  measurement  and analysis  (KPIs)  • Inform participating teams in advance that social media statistics will be collected from them by  public affairs personnel and start thinking about an easy and straightforward way of doing that.  Dissemination  plan  • Make sure that participating teams are well aware of the dissemination plan, for example by  organising a brief dedicated videoconference during which ENISA’s public affairs team and  contractor present the key aspects of the dissemination plan to participating teams.  • Provide some guidance about social media and communication.  • Incentivise participating teams to jointly disseminate information with combined messages, for  example through the establishment of a top three or top five ranking of the most active participating  teams, to be made public at the end of the event (with a prize, if possible).  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  36  Key  messages  • Ensure that the pan-European spirit of the ECSC is well reflected in the communication  messages, to appeal to the collaborative mindset of the participating teams and convey clearly the  European identity of the ECSC. This would be well received by participants, who sometimes feel  like the ‘E’ is missing in ‘ECSC’.  • Develop ECSC-specific and easy to customise digital media content, including graphic elements  such as infographics and appealing visuals for publication on social media channels.  • ENISA’s public affairs team and contractor are to be responsible for liaison with the European print  media, as they have connections that participating teams do not have.  • Key messages should be crafted to attract more women.  Engagement  and reach  • Identify ECSC members with connections with YouTubers active on cybersecurity-related topics or  find a way to contact them and ask them for their support in raising awareness about the ECSC.  • Identify potential ECSC members with connections with female researchers in cybersecurity active  on social media, not only to raise awareness about the ECSC but also to attract more girls to the  cybersecurity sector.  • Make the most of the European Cybersecurity Month in October to promote the ECSC.  • Reach out to schools and invite more students.  Social media  and visibility  • Find a way to avoid starting from scratch when social media accounts are being created by the  new ECSC organisers, to capitalise on the experience and good ideas of the organisers who  launched the social media accounts the year before.  • Explore possible solutions to deal with the ownership issue and make it possible to create a  dedicated ECSC social media identity (e.g. on Twitter and LinkedIn) and strengthen the ECSC  brand.  Website • Ensure that the ECSC website is regularly updated to provide participants with all relevant  information in a timely and accurate way.  • Post dynamic content on the website (e.g. live streaming and live scoreboard information).  5.3. CHALLENGES – LESSONS LEARNED FROM ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Recommendations  Design • Ensure enough diversity in the challenges.  • A ‘very good challenge’, according to one of the respondents to the participants’  questionnaire would meet the following requirements:  o very well designed  o a learning experience  o innovative  o fair  o fun.  • Try to harmonise flags’ formats, which can vary a lot depending on the supplier.  • Enhance the cooperative mindset and the European ‘branding’.  • Small countries (e.g. the five smallest ones) should be allowed to cooperate against  major teams.  • Consider adding some boot2root challenges and create activities that members of  teams from different countries are expected to collaborate on, instead of their having to  compete against each other for the duration of the event.  • Even if the event has to become virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic, find  ways to encourage interaction and collaboration.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  37  Rules • Implement a section on the ECSC platform that details the ECSC rules and the good  conduct expected of the participants.  • Find a way to display the Charter of Good Conduct during the event.  • Something as simple as a terminology brief describing the roles, functions and  responsibilities of the various people taking part in ECSC events could be helpful in  making people aware of the rules, especially those that apply more particularly to them  depending on their function (captains, coaches, trainers, qualifiers, organisers, etc.).  • The choice of a channel for communication among participants should be made in  advance and thought should be put into how communication will be structured  (e.g. who should have access to what, which spaces should be created). Once it has  been decided on, registration with the communication channel could be made  compulsory.  Enforcement • Identify a platform or a channel (within Discord, for instance) where an incident- reporting space could be created for participants to notify the jury of potential issues,  such as cheating or unethical behaviour.  • If using a Discord-type channel, check that participants do not use it to exchange  flags.  • Consider publishing exchanges on a Discord-type channel for transparency  purposes.  Presentations  (NB: this  parameter  relates  specifically to  the ECSC)  • Explain clearly what the requirements for the presentations are and what the level of  technical expertise of the jury panel is.  • Post an agenda giving the order and timing of the presentations on the ECSC  platform and website.  Complexity • Participants are more and more demanding about the quality and complexity of  challenges and tend to expect that considerable thought and care will have been put  into their creation, for example by forensics professionals.  • Do not reuse challenges, to ensure that no write-ups are available.  • Avoid challenges that involve guessing or that are not originals.  • Create more education-oriented challenges.  • Check carefully for misspellings.  Scoring • Ensure that challenges that require a lot of work to find the solution are worth more  than challenges that require guessing or random algorithms to be solved.  5.4. COMPLIANCE – LESSONS LEARNED FROM ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Recommendations  Data protection • Do not require participants to have a Google account to submit write-ups.  • Do not display full names on the scoreboard.

Considering that the organisation of this European event brings  together more than 350 young people coming from all over Europe, the ECSC Steering  Committee wants above all to safeguard the health of all participants.  Consequently, the committee, together with the Austrian national planners, with the support of  the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the agreement of the future ECSC  organising countries, decided to change the dates of the ECSC 2020 final and postpone the 7th  edition to 2021.  Therefore, the 7th edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague, Czechia, in 2021. Austria will  host the event in 2022.  Despite this, to maintain support for the growth of the competition, keep the spirit of the ECSC  alive and prepare for the 2021 edition, various activities were performed during 2020, such as  the first ENISA Hackfest, the initial steps towards the selection of Team Europe for the  International Cyber Security Challenge (ICSC) planned for Athens in December 2021 and the  launch of the ICSC Steering Committee, responsible for the international competition.  ENISA is currently hosting a number of platforms and performing several activities to support  the ECSC hosting country and the future development of the project, including hosting the  ECSC main website, hosting the ECSC planning platform, working on the public affairs strategy,  creating challenges, overseeing the governance framework of the competition and providing  support for the ECSC Steering Committee as the acting secretariat.  In order to ensure appropriate and transparent reporting to the ECSC Steering Committee, the  following key observations were made by independent third-party observers who attended  ECSC 2020 planning meetings. These observations were made based on the feedback  collected from participants, members of the ECSC Steering Committee and attendees at the  Hackfest event, including through an online evaluation survey and personal interviews.   Concerning the way in which the 2020 cancellation was managed, it was stressed that  the transparency shown by ENISA and its involvement of the ECSC Steering  Committee in the decision-making were good. Decisions were made in agreement with  all countries concerned, for example on how to communicate the cancellation of ECSC  2020.   There is no need for the committee to do things very differently. Some improvements  could be made to accelerate the circulation of official documents when finalised and to  clearly state who is to receive ECSC-related documents. Based on the responses to  the organisers’ questionnaire, 77 % of respondents considered that the ECSC Steering  Committee performs well.   A clearer dissemination plan would be helpful, but there is also a need to establish a  transmission channel between the ECSC public affairs team and contractor on the one  side and national teams on the other. Many ECSC participants would welcome  messages and communication materials crafted at ECSC level. This should include  infographics and other visual elements to help to ensure that posts on Twitter or on  participants’ websites are eye-catching and engaging.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  3   Regarding ENISA Hackfest 2020, based on the questionnaire sent to participants,  76 % of respondents considered that the performance of the platform was good or  excellent. No major issues or incidents with regard to the availability of network  infrastructure were reported by respondents to the questionnaire or in interviews.  In addition, it seems worth noting that some of the open-ended comments made by the ECSC  Steering Committee members who participated in the study concerned:   the strengthening of the European dimension of the ECSC;   the need to preserve the ECSC’s spirit of fun;   the balance to be struck between opening the competition to as many countries as  possible and logistical and financial issues;   the need to develop a sense of a community and to build a community inclusive of  women and very young participants;   the need for reflection on ways to attract more women into the cybersecurity field;   the possibility of tapping into the pool of expertise formed by ECSC members.  The final of the 2021 edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague in September 2021; at least  22 countries are expected to participate. The latest updates will be published on the ECSC  2021 website (https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/).  This report is not for public dissemination. It concerns only ENISA and the members of the  ECSC Steering Committee, namely the representatives of the countries that participate in the  ECSC.  https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  4  TABLE OF CONTENTS  1.

INTRODUCTION  The growing need for IT security professionals is widely acknowledged. According to recent  estimates, it is expected that more than 3.5 million cybersecurity professionals will be needed  worldwide by 2021 (1) to prevent, react to and protect citizens from cyber threats. Europe has to  make an effort to attract talent to and retain it in cybersecurity and, at the same time, create  solid and powerful educational, entrepreneurial and business structures in cybersecurity.  To help mitigate this shortage of skills, many countries have launched national cybersecurity  competitions targeting students, university graduates and even non-IT professionals, with a  clear aim:  ‘Identify new and young cyber talents and encourage young people to pursue a career in cyber  security.’2  The European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)  (https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/) leverages on these competitions by adding a  pan-European layer. Top cybersecurity talents from each participating country meet to network  and collaborate and, finally, compete against each other. Contestants are challenged to solve  security-related tasks in different domains.  In a nutshell, ECSC is the annual European event that brings together young talent from across  Europe to have fun and compete in cybersecurity. Its main aim is to highlight the importance of  the national competitions.  1.1. Background to the ECSC  The project was initiated under the umbrella of the European Union’s cybersecurity strategy of  February 2013, which stated that the European Commission would:  ‘organise, with the support of ENISA, a cybersecurity championship in 2014, where university  students will compete in proposing [network and information security] solutions.’3  Since 2014, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has been supporting the  organisation of the ECSC. ENISA actively organises the meetings of the governance structures,  supports the development of the competition’s rules and challenges and is part of the ECSC  jury. Since 2016, ENISA has been the acting secretariat of the ESCS Steering Committee.  In the 2018 edition, 200 participants (contestants, coaches and judges), representing 17 EU and  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czechia,  Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Liechtenstein, Norway, Poland, Romania,  Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom), competed in the ECSC final in London.  The 2019 edition of the ECSC took place in the parliament building in Bucharest, Romania, from  9 to11 October 2019. For the first time, teams from 20 countries participated in the final (Austria,  Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein,  Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland and the  United Kingdom).The participants investigated vulnerabilities in web applications, binaries and  (1) https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis  (2) ECSC Charter document  (3) https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  In a nutshell,  ECSC is the  annual European  event that brings  together young  talent from across  Europe to have  fun and compete  in cybersecurity.  Its main aim is to  highlight the  importance of the  national  competitions.  https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/08/09/the-cybersecurity-talent-gap-is-an-industry-crisis https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  7  document files; solved crypto puzzles; and hack hardware systems. However, technical skills  are just one part of the story. Time and resources were limited, and teamwork and presentation  skills were also evaluated. The top teams in ECSC 2019 were the teams from Romania, Italy  and Austria.  The 2020 edition of the ECSC, planned initially for 4 and 5 November in Vienna, had to be  cancelled owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  The 2021 edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague, Czechia, on 29 and 30 September.  1.2. The ECSC set-up  Each country is represented at the ECSC final by a team of 10 contestants, comprising the  winners of the national competition. Half of them are 14–20 years old and half are 21–25 years  old.  Two preparatory pilot phases of the ECSC were held in 2014 (in Austria) and 2015 (in  Switzerland), attended by three and six countries, respectively. Since 2015, ENISA has used its  experience and position to coordinate and organise the ECSC and enable it to reach full  maturity.  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a steering committee, composed of  representatives of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and  provides strategic guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC  Charter, which is revised and approved every year by the ECSC Steering Committee.  ENISA is currently hosting a number of platforms and performing several activities to support  the ECSC hosting country and the future development of the project, including hosting the  ECSC main website, hosting the ECSC information-sharing platform, working on the public  affairs strategy and creating challenges.  In addition, ENISA is working closely with the hosts of future editions in order to ensure  appropriate and transparent reporting to the ECSC Steering Committee.  Each year, two ECSC Steering Committee meetings are held prior to the event:   the initial planning conference in February or March,   the main planning conference in June or July.  ENISA organised these preparatory events and had overall responsibility for the efficient  running of the project, including minuting meetings and following up on proposed actions.

Steering Committee management  The activities of the ECSC are supervised by a steering committee composed of representatives  of the attending countries. ENISA facilitates the meetings of this group and provides strategic  guidance. The decision-making processes are described in the ECSC Charter, which is revised  and approved every year by the ECSC Steering Committee.  During the preparations for ECSC 2020, ENISA was responsible for the following activities  related to the management of the ECSC Steering Committee:   platform maintenance and updates,   mailing list management,   updating and creating ECSC Steering Committee-related documentation,   supporting the organisation of the initial planning conference in Vienna,   organising follow-up meetings with the ECSC Steering Committee,   organising a follow-up meeting with the ECSC 2020 chair,   COVID-19 situational assessment,   accommodation, execution and follow-up of ECSC Steering Committee requests,   implementation of changes and suggestions collected through surveys and other  feedback from previous editions,   management of the public affairs support contract,   management of the ECSC support contract,   updating the public affairs strategy,   creating various subcommittees and working groups to support new activities,   deciding on the methods for the creation of Team Europe for the International Cyber  Security Challenge (ICSC),   organisation of a hot-wash meeting,   collecting feedback through a report on lessons learned and a survey of participants.  3.2. Initial planning conference  On 13 and 14 February 2020, the ECSC initial planning conference was held in Vienna. The  following topics were discussed during the meeting:   the ECSC 2019 experience,   presentation from Austria on plans for the 2020 edition (logistics, hotels, etc.),   lessons learned from ECSC 2019,   ECSC 2020 planning status,   Brexit and new countries,   update on the ECSC Connecting Europe Facility call,   update on the ICSC,   presentation of new platforms.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  11  The following actions and decisions were agreed in the meeting:   a code of conduct was to be created;   credentials and vouchers were to be provided to enable access to the Austrian  platform that was to be used during the competition;   the presentations were to be eliminated in the next edition of the ECSC, with a  subcommittee to be formed to submit proposals on the development of soft skills;   a calculation tool was to be provided for checking the ages of the participants;   two subcommittees were to be formed, with the following members:  o Subcommittee No 1 on ICSC decisions:   Austria   Cyprus   Czechia   Germany   Ireland   Luxembourg   Portugal   Spain   ENISA.  o Subcommittee No 2 on soft skills:   Austria   Czechia   France   Germany   Greece   Norway   the Netherlands.  After the event, the minutes of the meeting were circulated to the ECSC Steering Committee for  review and approval.  3.3. COVID-19 impact assessment  During the months of April and May 2020, ENISA and the ECSC Steering Committee  chair/organising country (Austria) were continuously assessing the situation in order to monitor  the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the participant countries and have available the  information required to enable the best decision to be taken on holding the final in Vienna.  During May 2020, ENISA led the collection of information from the participant countries  regarding the following issues:   impact of the situation on national competitions,   impact on meetings of national teams,   measures taken and special considerations required,   if the situation threatened national teams’ participation in the final.  Given the force majeure of the situation and the measures imposed by the Austrian  government, finally Austria decided that the competition needed to be either postponed or  cancelled, and an ad hoc meeting between ECSC organising countries was arranged in order to  present and consult on the different options. After the situation was explained, Norway, the  2022 host, and the subsequent organising countries agreed to the postponement of their  competitions for 1 year and yielded the 2022 edition to Austria. It was not possible to postpone  until next year because Czechia already had organisational commitments in place.  Following this agreement between Norway, Italy and Poland, the ECSC final will take place in  Austria in 2022, Norway in 2023, Italy in 2024 and Poland in 2025. The 2021 edition remains  the same.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  12  After this agreement, on 18 May, an extraordinary ECSC Steering Committee teleconference  was arranged to announce the postponement and the new dates for the competitions and to  formally approve the decision.  In addition, at this meeting special measures to mitigate the impact of the situation were  adopted by the ECSC Steering Committee, such as raising by 1 year the maximum age for  participation in the 2021 competition.  Regarding the official announcement of the changes, the ECSC Steering Committee proposed  that the participating countries create a joint communication plan, define a common message  and coordinate media activities. A dedicated teleconference was organised by ENISA’s public  affairs team on 29 May. The official postponement announcement was launched on 3 June on  the ENISA website (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-  challenge-2020-dates-changed), followed by various social media activities. In addition, the  ECSC official website was modified accordingly.  Figure 2: News item on the ENISA website announcing the postponement of ECSC 2020  3.4. International Cyber Security Challenge  Building on the success of the ECSC, ENISA, with the help of other regional and international  organisations, decided to design and host the ICSC. The aim of the challenge is to attract young  talent and raise awareness in the global community of the education and skills needed in the  area of cybersecurity.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-challenge-2020-dates-changed https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-challenge-2020-dates-changed  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  13  To this end, a steering committee comprising representatives of government and regional  institutions and universities and research centres will design a competition between teams from  different regions. So far, teams from South-East Asia, Oceania, the United States, Latin  America and Africa have expressed a clear interest in participating.  Teams will compete in a series of challenges (to be decided by the ICSC Steering Committee)  in a number of areas, such as web application and system exploitation, cryptography, reverse  engineering, hardware challenges, forensics and escape rooms. The ICSC brand is expected to  be associated with the top cybersecurity talents of the world, and ENISA anticipates that the  ICSC will become one of the world’s key incubators of cybersecurity entrepreneurship and top  security experts.  ENISA is committed to organising the first ICSC final in Greece and supporting the development  of the competition’s rules and governing body. Each region will be represented at the  competition by a team comprising young talent from countries in the region. The regions will be  responsible for selecting and training team members. ENISA proposes that the first ICSC  final be held during the second week of December 2021. The international competition  will be held in Athens.  This competition can have a significant impact on strengthening cybersecurity; some of the  objectives are the following:   create and nurture a global multistakeholder cybersecurity challenge;   strengthen international cooperation on cybersecurity;   contribute to the world’s strategy on cyberspace;   promote capture the flag (CTF) competitions by leveraging to an international level;   engage a wider audience and increase the level of awareness of the importance of holding  events such as the ECSC;   promote young talent across the world;   promote cybersecurity training at an international level;   develop various skills, including both technical skills and soft skills such as teamwork,  presentation skills and public speaking;   promote professional careers in cybersecurity by putting the young professionals in the  spotlight and highlighting the interesting career paths available, in order to address the  shortage of cybersecurity professionals.  During early 2020, ENISA completed the creation of the ICSC Steering Committee to support  management activities. The committee:   is composed of representatives of the regions that have committed to competing in the ICSC;   is the ultimate decision-making body on the ICSC;   defines the role and composition of the ICSC secretariat.   provides leadership and direction on the scope and management of the work to be undertaken  on matters that relate to the ICSC’s scope and objectives, and related risks and issues, as  necessary;   acts in the best interests of the ICSC;   provides steering and guidance on ICSC activities, while respecting the overall responsibilities  of all stakeholders;   is a delegated decision-making authority on the related activities within the scope of the ICSC;   keeps relevant stakeholders informed on the ICSC and related developments.   approves the ICSC Charter and the ICSC competition rules, accepts submissions from  potential future hosting countries, decides on the dates and location of ICSC events, and  makes decisions on any other issues arising, for example in the event of disputes.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  14  Representatives of the various regions were engaged by ENISA during 2020 and began  discussions to establish the required structures and the basis for the long-term development of  future editions, namely:   a consistent set of rules for the competition (ages and number of participants,  requirements, etc.);   the final curricula for the competition;   the final format of the competition and the methods for maintaining a high level of  transparency and trust between the regions.  ENISA, in the role of ICSC secretariat and organising body, executed the following actions in  order to support ICSC activities:   making initial contact with and engaging the International Steering Committee,   creating a mailing list,   creating a common roadmap,   creating of space in the collaboration platform (Communication and Information  Resource Centre for Administrations, Businesses and Citizens (CIRCAB)),   organising follow-up meetings during the year,   starting preparatory activities for the competition,   developing key documentation,   organising surveys and collection of information to support the decision-making  process,   carrying out activities to prepare for the final in December 2021.  3.5.  ENISA HACKFEST 2020  On 16–18 November, ENISA hosted ENISA Hackfest 2020 (https://enisa-  hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/), a CTF event for cybersecurity professionals and students to  connect and train the teams participating in the 2021 ECSC. Contestants were challenged on  an individual level to solve cybersecurity problems in areas such as web security, mobile  security, cryptography, reverse engineering and forensics. The Hackfest brought together more  than 250 participants from 17 EU and EFTA countries. The event was held in a virtual format.  The event was to be used:   as a testbed for future Team Europe selection activities;   by ECSC national teams to assess future players’ performance;   as training for ECSC participants;   to provide support to countries that cannot afford a national qualifying competition.  The event was hosted on a cloud-based platform (cyberEDU.ro) that can host large CTF  competitions of various types, such as jeopardy, attack-and-defence and king-of-the-hill  competitions, as well as competitions in other, more complex, formats such as cyber-range,  classroom style, etc. The platform supports individual and team-based competitions. The  technology can host events with as few as 10 players or as many as 5 000 and even more.  https://enisa-hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/ https://enisa-hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/ https://cyberedu.ro/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  15  Figure 3: The ENISA Hackfest 2020 logo  3.5.1.

Train the trainers event  To provide information to the team captains and coaches, a train the trainers event was  organised by ENISA and the contractor; this event was expected to provide clarification on  various key issues:   roles during the competition,   rules,   communication with and support from the organisers,   challenges (types, difficulty, etc.),   complaint management,   scoring mechanisms,   user management,   reports and information,   the look and feel of the platform,   the registration process,   flag submission.  In addition, access to a demo platform with real challenges was provided to participants before  the event started, for testing purposes, and a trainer’s manual was provided with all the relevant  information.  http://enisa-hackfest2020.cyberedu.ro/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  16  The train the trainers event was organised virtually (using Cisco WebEx) on 6 November. A  video and the manual were released on the ECSC collaboration platform and sent to the mailing  list.  3.5.3.

ENISA Hackfest 2020 – lessons learned  3.5.4.1. Scoring  Dynamic scoring continues to be one of the most objective and accurate ways to evaluate the  difficulty of challenges based on the technical level of players. The proposed algorithm worked as  expected and no malicious behaviour was detected.  The potential risks and disadvantages of dynamic scoring are that:  ● providing the same challenges to a group of players with different experience could give different  results;  ● malicious players could register additional fake users and solve a particular challenge in order  to decrease the total number of points, providing an unfair advantage to other players who solve  other challenges.  Lesson learned. ENISA recommends considering the use of dynamic scoring for any type of  jeopardy competition but also keeping in mind the potential risks.  3.5.5. Challenges  The Hackfest Consortium set 26 challenges with 2 backups (14 previously used and 12 new  challenges) for the event. No significant disruption of infrastructure was detected during the  competition, but certain Layer 7-oriented attacks (mostly denial of service) were addressed.  Players who had previously solved the reused challenges found this situation unattractive and  their tendency was to search for write-ups or use their previous solutions, rather than trying to  solve the challenge again. However, many players did prefer to try to solve the challenges again  and actually learn from this experience.  Lesson learned. ENISA recommends not reusing challenges in future.  3.5.6. Communication  The consortium took an innovative approach to communication this year, using an official Discord  group with several communication channels.  Access to each channel was granted by a custom-made bot developed by the consortium. The  bot granted access to channels to players based on invitation links, in accordance with predefined  user roles (player, country coordinator and organiser). Moreover, the bot monitored  communication between players and removed any message that potentially contained a flag or  part of it.  The benefits were:  ● voice chat, which allowed networking between players;  ● flexible application programming interfaces (APIs), to enable the creation of bots with different  levels of capabilities;  ● very good and granular user access.  The disadvantages were that:  ● the bot developer needed to introduce failover/healing features, since Discord APIs can have  downtime quite often.  ● voice chat could be used for flag sharing, bypassing the bot’s control.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  19  Lesson learned. Discord channels can be an alternative to Telegram or Slack for this type of  event; however, certain issues must be taken into consideration.  Figure 4: The ENISA Hackfest 2020 platform  3.5.7. Support  In order to provide 24/7 technical support for 48 hours, the consortium used the following  mechanisms.  ● The challenge authors were available during the event and they answered questions when  addressed.  ● Each question answered was added to a common frequently asked questions (FAQs) document,  which allowed the support team to answer common questions more quickly and focus on new  or critical situations.  ● During the night, at least one person was available at any point and was able to respond to all  questions received.  Lesson learned. Developing a live FAQs document for challenges can speed up support  resolutions during CTF competitions, which are quite intensive and exhausting for support teams  if the event happens over several days.  Feature improvement. Another potential improvement would be adding a bot that can manage  tickets, which could speed up the process, since a player would no longer have to wait for the  identification of a staff member who was available to answer their question.  3.5.8. Complaints  Players and country coordinators had channels where they could make complaints. During the  event, most of the conversations were challenge-related. The only question that could be  construed as a complaint was related to the availability of rankings for individual players, so that  participants could see how their country was situated in comparison with other countries.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  20  3.5.9. Infrastructure and platform  The event was hosted on a cloud-based platform (cyberEDU.ro) that can host large CTF  competitions in various formats. The platform and infrastructure had 100 % uptime during the  event, with some minor issues during the first hour relating to reporting of results to country  coordinators and organisers, which were immediately addressed by the consortium.  The benefits of using the platform, rather than other open-source/standard technologies, are as  follows.  ● Management of the competition. The platform allowed the consortium to set up and manage  the event in minutes, with various custom fields at registration, multiple-level access  (i.e.. organiser, teacher/country coordinator and player levels), dynamic scoring and more.  ● Scalability. Since the entire application uses Kubernetes, the infrastructure can be scaled as  needed for the existing load with no downtime recorded.  ● Moderation. Having moderation support for registration allowed country leaders to accept or  reject players.  ● Self-healing challenges. The platform allowed players to vote for restart when a challenge  seemed to be down or malfunctioning, and it automatically restarted the challenge when the  system detected suspicious delays in response.  Lessons learned are the following.  ● Self-healing challenges. These proved to be an improvement in terms of reducing staff effort  required to manage the infrastructure; staff were able to solve downtime and malfunctioning  from their phones.  ● One-to-one resources for players. To further improve the experience of players, the platform  used for future editions of the event should allow each player to run and restart their own  instance of each challenge.  3.5.10. Miscellaneous lessons learned and recommendations  ● Some players complained that organising the event over a weekend would have allowed them  more involvement in the competition.  ● Some players complained about the lack of prizes/stakes, sometimes stating that this was one  of the main reasons for limited numbers of players representing their countries.  ● Some players recommended not reusing challenges in future.  ● Some players complained that participation by women needed to be considerably increased.  ● The consortium recommends considering the possibility of (distributed) denial of service  attacks on the infrastructure (the CTF platform and the challenges infrastructure) when  creating such events, especially competitions with publicly available access, and enabling  various security measures including:  ○ backup infrastructure;  ○ anti-denial of service attack solutions (e.g. websites should have Cloudflare or other  traffic-filtering technologies in place);  ○ auto-scaling infrastructures to address higher loads;  ○ available response teams that can monitor the load and/or attacks and can respond  properly in minutes;  ○ dedicated resources for each player or for a number of players;  ○ controlling access to infrastructures with tunnelling technologies such as  OpenVPN/Wireguard.  https://cyberedu.ro/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  21  3.5.11. Public affairs and communications  After the competition, ENISA created and sent to the ECSC mailing list a document intended to  align communication activities with all media points of contacts in the various ECSC participant  countries.  The document contained the following information:   links and guidelines on sharing information (text, hashtags, etc.),   a link to an ENISA news item (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-  news/enisa2019s-48h-hackfest-puts-europe2019s-cybersecurity-talent-to-the-test),   social media links:  o Twitter post 1 (https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329365661928177664),  o Twitter post 2 (https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381551575019520),  o Twitter post 3  (https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381843263746048/photo/1),  o Facebook post  (https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY/posts/3108688432569452),  LinkedIn post (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-  cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-  6735131891386658816-g3wi),   statistics (some general information about the participation in the event),   the competition logo,   a screenshot of the platform,   visual material for social media, developed by ENISA’s public affairs team, as shown in  Figure 5.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa2019s-48h-hackfest-puts-europe2019s-cybersecurity-talent-to-the-test https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/enisa2019s-48h-hackfest-puts-europe2019s-cybersecurity-talent-to-the-test https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329365661928177664 https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381551575019520 https://twitter.com/enisa_eu/status/1329381843263746048/photo/1 https://www.facebook.com/ENISAEUAGENCY/posts/3108688432569452 https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-6735131891386658816-g3wi https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-6735131891386658816-g3wi https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-union-agency-for-cybersecurity-enisa_enisahackfest-cybersecurity-eu-activity-6735131891386658816-g3wi  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  22  Figure 5: Social media material on ENISA Hackfest 2020  3.6. PLATFORMS  The updated list of ECSC-related platforms is the following:   test scoreboard and contracts platform (only available from a certain point before the  competition) (https://board.ecsc.eu),   test scoreboard code repository (https://github.com/enisaeu/ecsc-gameboard),   file-sharing platform (ownCloud) used for information sharing and as a contingency  mechanism (https://storage.ecsc.eu/),   the ECSC website used to promote the event and provide real-time scoring information  during the challenge to external interested parties  (https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/),  https://board.ecsc.eu/ https://github.com/enisaeu/ecsc-gameboard https://storage.ecsc.eu/ https://www.europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  23   the challenges platform on which previous years’ ECSC challenges are collected  (https://challenges.ecsc.eu/),   the collaboration platform (https://cermit.enisa.europa.eu/ui/welcome).  During 2020, two new platforms were added to support ECSC activities, the ECSC challenges  platform and the collaboration platform.  3.6.1. ECSC challenges platform  The idea was to create a simple, public-facing platform to provide access to all the challenges  from past ECSCs and others that were not used during past events and could be used for  training.  Figure 6: The ECSC challenges repository  3.6.2. ECSC collaboration platform  The objectives of this platform are to improve the exchange of information among ECSC  Steering Committee members and to provide a single place to store all ECSC-related  information.  The selected platform, Cermit/CIRCABC, is supported and maintained by the European  Commission and uses the European Commission Authentication Service (ECAS) as an  authentication service.  https://challenges.ecsc.eu/ https://cermit.enisa.europa.eu/ui/welcome  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  24  Figure 7: The ECSC collaboration platform  3.7. Public affairs and media activities  The following key media activities were carried out during 2020 in collaboration with the various  media points of contact appointed from the ECSC Steering Committee:   coordinating the communication of the cancellation of the ECSC 2020 final,   coordinating the announcement of the ENISA Hackfest 2020 post-event activities,   updating attendees at the ECSC hot-wash meeting on ECSC public affairs activities.

WORKING GROUPS  During 2020, three new working groups were created, two of them as per the ECSC Steering  Committee’s decision during the initial planning conference in Vienna.  3.8.1. International working group  This group is intended to support the creation of Team Europe for the ICSC, planned for  December 2021. During 2020, it carried out the following actions.   The working group created the mandate for the ICSC Subcommittee, which was  approved by the ECSC Steering Committee on 20 July 2020. The aim of the document  is to set out the delegation of responsibilities from the ECSC Steering Committee to the  subcommittee, and in particular to specify:  o the composition and the means of acceptance of the subcommittee;  o the tasks, purpose, role, boundaries and responsibilities of the subcommittee;  o the duration of the subcommittee’s mandate and the means of renewal.   It created a document on the trainer selection process (‘Coaches requirements and  selection’), which was approved by the ECSC Steering Committee on 20 November  2020. The aim of the document is to set out the process for selecting the trainers for  the future Team Europe, and in particular to specify:  o the composition of the team of trainers and the means of selection;  o the goals for Team Europe;  o requirements for the trainers;  o tasks, role, boundaries and responsibilities of the trainers;  o the selection process;  o the duration of the trainers´ mandate and the means of renewal.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  26   The working group created the call for trainers, launched on 23 November 2020.   It proceeded with the final selection of trainers, which was completed on 11 December  2020.   It started discussions about the selection mechanisms and the training path, in  coordination with ENISA.  Figure 10: Relations between the international and European committees  3.8.2. Soft skills development working group  This working group was created to discuss and propose new ideas to replace the presentations  as a soft skills development mechanism during the finals.  A space on the collaboration platform was created for this group; however, owing to the COVID-  19 pandemic and the cancellation of the 2020 edition, no relevant decisions were made on this  topic.  3.8.3. Media and public affairs points of contact working group  This working group was created to address the identified need to establish a permanent  coordination group for the alignment of public affairs, communication and media activities.  This list of contact points is expected to improve timeliness and collaboration with regard to  communication activities.  The group was started to work on the communication of the cancellation of the 2020 final and  on communication activities relating to ENISA Hackfest 2020.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  27  4. ECSC 2020 – LESSONS  LEARNED AND MATURITY  ASSESSMENT  A report on lessons learned has been produced by an external contractor on behalf of ENISA. It  builds to some extent on the report on lessons learned from ECSC 2019, for the sake of  consistency, and highlights comments and views provided by a number of ECSC Steering  Committee members and ECSC representatives recommended by ENISA, as well as by several  ENISA Hackfest 2020 organisers and participants.  Figure 10: Process of building the lessons learned  The report aggregates and puts into perspective a number of comments and views from  stakeholders who were prompted to reflect on Hackfest 2020 and on the maturity of the ECSC.  This feedback was collected through the following methods.   Two online EUSurvey-based questionnaires, which combined closed and open-ended  questions, and which were intended respectively for participants in Hackfest 2020  (defined as the individuals who were selected at national level and joined the event to  try to solve the challenges) and for the organisers of Hackfest 2020 (understood in a  generic way and referring to the people behind the organisation of the Hackfest event,  including ECSC Steering Committee members). In total, 56 people responded to the  questionnaires, distributed as follows: 47 participants and 9 organisers.   A series of phone, Microsoft Teams or GoToMeeting interviews with ECSC Steering  Committee members (or ECSC representatives acting as deputies) recommended by  ENISA. In total, six interviews with eight people were conducted.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  28  It is important to note that ENISA acted only as an intermediary in the data collection process. It  provided support to encourage participation in the surveys and helped in identifying ECSC  Steering Committee members to contact, but it refrained from any participation in the interviews  in order to ensure the neutrality of the discussion.  Although the intention was to replicate the approach and methodology adopted for the maturity  assessment conducted in 2019, the focus of which was ECSC 2019 (held in Bucharest,  Romania), this report on lessons learned had to introduce some changes to the methodology  owing to the specific circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, namely:   no field research or direct observation-based inputs as part of the collected qualitative  data;   revision of the high-level domains because of the irrelevance of those related to venue  and logistics;   revision of some of the objectives to account for the change in event (Hackfest 2020  instead of ECSC 2020);   adoption of a distinction between a general perspective (still appropriate for  governance and decision-making and public affairs high-level domains) and a focus on  Hackfest 2020 (for challenges and compliance).  For the sake of consistency, the high-level domains, parameters and evaluation criteria  previously defined have been kept for this report. The change of scope, with Hackfest 2020  replacing ECSC 2020, has, however, rendered it impossible to conduct a maturity assessment  directly comparable to the 2019 maturity assessment.  The following domains were evaluated:  1. governance and decision-making aspects,  2. public affairs – general perspective,  3. challenges – focus on Hackfest 2020,  4. logistics – aspects of the competition related to the venue, catering, hotels,  transportation, etc.,  5. side events – aspects of the competition related to social events and networking  meetings,  6. compliance – aspects of the competition related to compliance with laws and  standards.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  29  4.1. GOVERNANCE AND DECISION-MAKING ASPECTS  Parameter Objective  Feedback from Hackfest / maturity assessment,  questionnaires and interviews  Roles and  responsibilities  An ECSC project governance  model is established, which  specifies that a dedicated team  is to be established to organise  the ECSC. This model includes  clear roles and responsibilities  to facilitate the correct  ownership of tasks and project  management.  • The presentation of the ECSC 2021 organisation team at the  hot-wash meeting on 26 November 2020 was very useful. Some  participants were pleasantly surprised that logistics-related  aspects had already tackled and were reported on at this stage.  • The hot-wash meeting on the last day of ECSC 2019 made the  ECSC Steering Committee members realise that the Romanian  organisational team had been relatively small and that each  member of the organisational team had had a lot of  responsibilities. The ECSC 2021 organisational team has been  put together to ensure that the workload remains manageable for  each team member. The decision has also been made by the  Czech organisers that each team member is to be the  coordinator of his or her own tasks, with clear prioritisation of  tasks.  • The Czech organisational team has adopted a ‘crisis  management’ approach and has started thinking about potential  problems that may arise and how to deal with them in a timely  manner.  Decision- making of the  ECSC Steering  Committee and  jury  The ECSC Steering Committee  is a decision-making body that  serves the improvement of the  ECSC. Meetings of the  committee are highly effective  and have a clear and agreed-  upon agenda. Decisions taken  by the ECSC Steering  Committee are logged in a  decision-making register that  can be referred to in subsequent  meetings. This logbook contains  information about decisions,  owners and actions.  • A steering committee of 27 members is challenging. The ECSC  Steering Committee nevertheless operates in a clear way and  works towards improvements, concerned with learning from the  past to make the next edition better.  • Based on the responses to the organisers’ questionnaire, 77 %  of respondents consider that the ECSC Steering Committee  performs well.  • Suggestions for improvements are openly discussed within the  committee and then followed up on.  • There is no need for the ECSC Steering Committee to do things  very differently. Some improvements could be made to  accelerate the circulation of official documents when finalised  and to clearly state who is to receive ECSC-related documents,  for example everyone, ECSC participants or the members of the  ECSC Steering Committee.  • There is a good feeling that there are no hidden agendas within  the ECSC Steering Committee and that committee members are  willing to discuss and sort out any potential issues.  • Concerning the way in which the 2020 cancellation was  managed, it was stressed that the transparency shown by ENISA  and its involvement of the ECSC Steering Committee in the  decision-making were good. Decisions were made in agreement  with all countries concerned, for example on how to  communicate the cancellation of ECSC 2020.  • It is helpful to have the CIRCABC as a centralised source of  information.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  30  Transparency Decisions taken by the ECSC  Steering Committee are  communicated in a transparent  manner to all relevant  stakeholders including  participants and organisers.  Clear guidelines on the  practicalities of the event are  communicated to the audience  in a timely manner.  • It is important that jury members be selected in a  straightforward and transparent way. The jury selection process  as designed and led by ENISA is efficient.  • In addition to a clear division of labour and of roles and  responsibilities, there is a need for ENISA and the ECSC hosting  country to coordinate their communication and align the  information they deliver to participants.  • The model according to which the ECSC organiser takes the  chair makes sense and has proved a good governance model.  • The decision adopted for ECSC 2019 to have a jury making  decisions then communicating them to the ECSC Steering  Committee should be replicated, as it ensures unbiased  decisions.  • It was deemed by organisers that all the questions they raised  about Hackfest 2020 received a timely and helpful response from  ENISA.  National  participation  As ECSC relates to European  strategic policy objectives, the  ECSC Steering Committee  actively attracts and encourages  non-participating European  countries to become part of the  initiative.  • There is value in having an increased number of participating  countries.  • Certain limitations need to be kept in mind, such as the  logistical burden, costs for the hosting country, constraints on  selecting an appropriate platform.  • Since 2017, the ECSC has attracted more professionals and  more countries. This has resulted in greater costs, a heavy  logistical burden and funding-related issues. There is also a risk  that the spirit of competition will prevails over the intended spirit  of fun.  4.2. PUBLIC AFFAIRS – GENERAL PERSPECTIVE  Parameter Objective  Feedback from Hackfest / maturity assessment and  questionnaires  Monitoring,  measurement  and analysis  (key  performance  indicators  (KPIs))  In order to measure the  effectiveness of the public affairs  strategy, KPIs are set. These  KPIs make it possible to monitor  the impact of communication  activities on the general public,  measure the strategy’s success  in accordance with the objectives  set and analyse the overall  outcome of the strategy. In  addition, this objective- and data- driven approach to assessing the  activities conducted under the  public affairs strategy make it  possible to compare strategies  over the years and identify  trends.  • For guidance, participating teams need to be aware of the KPIs  set out in the public affairs strategy. Collecting social media  statistics from them should be feasible.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  31  Dissemination  plan  An ECSC dissemination plan is  established in order to facilitate  timely and coordinated  implementation of the ECSC  public affairs strategy among all  participants and ECSC  stakeholders. The plan ensures  coherent and synchronised  communication about ECSC in  accordance with a well-defined  dissemination timeline.  • The clear dissemination plan is helpful, but there is also a need  to establish a transmission channel between the ECSC public  affairs team and contractor on the one side and national teams  on the other  • Finding the right contact point in each country can be an issue.  • ECSC provides a good dissemination plan and tools. However,  some countries do not have sufficient resources to promote  ECSC at national level or are not forceful enough in doing so.  • To ensure consistent communication about ECSC, ‘ready to  post’ messages should be prepared and communicated in  advance when possible.  • Special efforts should be put into the crafting of short sentences  to make their translation from English into the participants’  languages and the hosting country’s national language easy.  • Presenting all the ECSC 2021 participating teams in a soccer  tournament-style graphic could be seen as a coherent and  synchronised communication activity. This would enhance the  ECSC’s visual identity and underline the pan-European spirit of  the event.  • Communication during the challenges has to be very dynamic  (e.g. live streaming). It should target the people who are not  participating, since ECSC participants are very engaged anyway.  Key  Messages  Targeted and effective key  messages are developed to  promote / communicate about the  ECSC to all participants and  ECSC stakeholders. The key  messages are tailored to the  different audiences (i.e. key  audience, keep informed, keep  satisfied, monitor) and  dissemination phases (i.e.  awareness, understanding,  excitement, commitment,  satisfaction).  • Many ECSC participants, especially those that do not have  dedicated resources for communication activities, would welcome  messages and communication materials crafted at ECSC level.  This should include infographics and other visual elements to  help to ensure that posts on Twitter or on participants’ websites  are eye-catching and engaging.  • ECSC communication materials need to be easy to customise  and to integrate into participants’ own communication channels.  • Using centralised/standardised communication materials has  some limitations, especially when communicating with young  people. Communication that is too official may be badly received,  or not received at all, and could be detrimental to the ‘fun  competition’ image that the ESCS is expected to convey.  • There are differences between the way countries communicate  (e.g. between northern and southern European countries).  Centralised communication messages should be ‘basic’ enough  to allow for cultural twists.  • ECSC messages are more difficult to relay through national  print media, as press articles cannot focus only on the  competition. These messages have to include a reminder about  what the ECSC is about in addition to adopting a clear national  focus.  • ECSC participants are likely to lack connections in the  European print media and cannot be always expected to relay  ECSC communication messages in this way.  Engagement  and reach  The ECSC public affairs strategy  is designed in such a way as to  achieve maximum engagement  of the audience. In order to sculpt  the most relevant messages and  maximise the interest and  engagement of the audience,  different engagement groups  have been identified (i.e. key  audience, keep informed, keep  satisfied, monitor).  • Media influencers could be a good idea, but payment for them  may be an issue.  • Some organisations have embedded media influencers (e.g. a  community manager). The issue at stake in this case relates  more to alignment and coordination between participating  countries.  • Some channels are already well followed and YouTubers on  cybersecurity would be great media influencers.  • Having well-known female researchers in cyber active on  Twitter and relaying messages about the ECSC would be helpful  to attract more girls.  • More media visibility is needed to improve all the teams.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  32  Social media  and visibility  Social media platforms (Twitter,  LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)  are used to facilitate interaction  and dissemination of key  messages with limited effort.  Social media messages should  be short, tailored to the audience  and follow the dissemination plan  in order to reach their full  potential.  • There should be specific communication channels for ECSC,  not only communication through ENISA’s channels.  • Specific ECSC LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram  accounts are a step in the right direction. They will generate  content that is easy to circulate and should trigger more  interaction.  • There is uncertainty about whether creating ECSC LinkedIn,  Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts will be useful in  teasing out and attracting new participants. YouTube might have  greater reach.  • Dedicated ECSC social media channels would make it possible  to give more visibility to participating countries’ posts, as ENISA  cannot be expected to focus only on ECSC.  • Dedicated ECSC social media channels would help centralise  information and keep it up to date.  • The fact that it is up to the hosting country and organisers to set  up dedicated ECSC social media channels may mean that the  ECSC misses out on benefits because of a lack of cumulative  effects. Having permanent ECSC social media accounts would  raise issues about ownership, though.  • An explicit ECSC social media identity would increase the  ECSC’s visibility.  Website An official ECSC website is set  up to publish news updates (e.g.  press releases) before, during  and after the ECSC. The website  allows the audience to replicate  published messages and share  them with other websites.  • The official ECSC website provides clear and informative  content.  • The redesign of the website after ECSC 2018 was well done  and the site for ECSC 2019 offered better ergonomics and richer  content.  • Using the ECSC website to post news updates that are easy for  participants to replicate and circulate should be helpful, especially  if these updates include real-time information on the scoreboard.  4.3. CHALLENGES – FOCUS ON ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Objective  Feedback from Hackfest / maturity assessment and  questionnaires  Design The design of the challenges  reflects a reasonable learning  curve in accordance with the  average level of the participants.  The challenges include real-life  scenarios, which involve multiple  aspects of cybersecurity and push  participants to their limits.  • Based on the questionnaire sent to participants, 56 % of  respondents did not find, or found only to some extent, the  challenges diverse enough and requiring different skills.  • There was an unbalanced number of challenges per category  (e.g. there was only one exploiting challenge) and, generally  speaking, too much web hacking.  • Challenges that were a matter of guessing a certain method or  approach, relying on random algorithms, were not considered  good teaching material.  • Forensics challenges that were more about steganography and  random miscellaneous concepts than real-life forensic techniques  were considered less interesting from a teaching perspective.  • Steganography was commented on as not a valid CTF category  in timed events, as, at most, it evaluates the users’ creative  insights and analytical skills.  • Challenges should test participants’ understanding of  computers, not the creators’ mindset or general knowledge of  trivia.  • Easier warm-up challenges were lacking and would have kept  motivation high.  • Challenges were lacking an intermediate waypoint to let  participants know that they were on the right track.  • Social skills were not really tested.  • Solo participation instead of doing a CTF challenge as a team  was considered far less fun and not as good from a learning  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  33  perspective. It was also suspected to discourage participation in  Hackfest 2020, as there are other online places that permit  participants to tackle challenges with friends.  • Prizes or goody bags would have been nice, as they are  expected when participating in CTF competitions.  Rules The rules are clear, unambiguous  and agreed upon by all  participants. The rules are clearly  communicated to the teams.  Compliance with the rules is  monitored and used to avoid  malicious activities.  • There was good awareness about the Hackfest rules among the  participants.  • Participants knew whom to approach with questions or if they  had technical difficulties.  • The overall process of qualification was unclear without  concrete rules on how Hackfest 2020 related to qualifying  competitions.  Enforcement The rules are enforced in a  consistent manner. Breaches of  the rules are followed by the  consequences are agreed upon  by the jury.  • Some participants noticed that at some point during the CTF  competition more than 20 people were in the Discord voice chat  exchanging flags.  • It was very difficult to judge whether some participants did or did  not use existing write-ups in their solutions to challenges.  Presentations  (NB: this  parameter  relates  specifically to  the ECSC)  The content of presentations  given by participants and/or  sponsors aligns with the  objectives of the ECSC regarding  building expertise and meets the  expectations of participants.  • The team presentation at the ECSC is deemed a challenge in  itself.  • The jury’s expectations are unclear, and this makes it difficult for  people presenting to pitch for the right audience; they run the risk  of being too technical (or not technical enough).  Platform A capacity and quality  assessment of the platform is  performed to ensure the stability  and security of the platform during  the challenge and its ongoing  ability to meet the requirements,  standards, scale and expectations  of the ECSC. Unforeseen  circumstances that might affect  the continuity of the platform –  and of the event – are thereby  taken into account. The  assessment of the platform  includes regular and adequate  testing of the platform by the  service provider.  • Based on the questionnaire sent to participants, 76 % of  respondents considered that the performance of the platform was  good or excellent.  • The platform was considered reliable and stable, with good  support provided by the Bit Sentinel team.  Infrastructure The IT infrastructure supporting  the platform for the ECSC is  reliable, trustworthy and ensures  all participants can equally and  fairly connect to the platform. The  infrastructure provider should take  into account potential unforeseen  circumstances that might affect  the continuity of the infrastructure  and take preventive and reactive  measures as appropriate  (including failovers, backup  configurations, high-availability  measures).  • No major issues or incidents with regard to the availability of  network infrastructure were reported by respondents to  questionnaire and interviewees.  • The registration process could have been more straightforward,  according to some participants, but in general, it was deemed  fine.  Complexity The level of complexity of the  challenge is sufficiently mature to  provide a challenging competition  that attracts top cybersecurity  talent from all over Europe. The  complexity meets the participants’  expectations.  • Based on the questionnaire sent to participants, 34 % of  respondents were satisfied to some extent by the technical  complexity of the challenges and 30 % were not.  • Some challenges were considered fun but, in general,  participants felt that the challenges were not of the quality  expected of such an event. In particular, the reuse of several  challenges, write-ups on which were already widely available  online (e.g. from DefCamp Capture the Flag 2019), was  disappointing to them.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  34  • Participants who were familiar with CyberEDU or the DefCamp  2019 competition were perceived as having a slight advantage.  • In addition to challenges that were re-used, those involving too  much guessing were deemed ‘unfair’ and even to ruin part of the  fun.  • Some participants noticed spelling mistakes.  • Challenges involving Braille, Morse code or guessing were  criticised by some participants.  • Brute-forcing as an intended solution to recover a flag was not  deemed a good thing. Where a task had a good back story but  some cipher (considered ‘obscure’) was put on the flag when all  the other parts of the task had been solved, ending the challenge  in this way was not considered enjoyable.  • Hints should have been more useful and more numerous.  • From a practical point of view, it was regretted that the Hackfest  had taken place during the week. As the participants were mostly  students and young professionals, it was difficult for them to free  themselves up to participate fully. This factor alone limited the  level of participation in Hackfest 2020 and led to some  participants thinking they had been at a disadvantage.  • Holding an event during the working week makes it more  difficult to guarantee that all the participants from all countries  have the same availability to compete.  Scoring The scoring mechanism is  transparent with regard to  attribution and distribution of  points and is approved by the  ECSC Steering Committee.  • The lack of a global scoreboard, making it impossible for  participants to compare their performance against others, was  considered an issue.  • The scoring method was not clear.  • Some participants resented the fact that dynamic scoring was  mixed with so many challenges that required guessing, so that  some challenges that required a huge amount of work and  competence were worth less than some challenges that were not  instructive.  • The scoreboard seemed to be not completely fair.  • A lack of opportunities for participants to receive some feedback  on how well they perform is likely to reduce the incentive to  participate, especially in the case of solo CTF challenges.  4.4. COMPLIANCE – FOCUS ON ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Objective Observations  Data  protection  The ECSC Steering Committee is  committed to ensuring compliance  with relevant data protection and  privacy legislation such as the  general data protection regulation.  Although the ECSC does not  process personal data as part of its  core business, it may happen that  some activities require processing of  personal data (e.g. collecting  customer satisfaction information or  publishing pictures of the event)  • The requirement to have a Google account for submitting write- ups, especially when having a registered account on the CyberEDU  platform already, was puzzling to some participants.  • Some participants did not like that documents were shared on  Google Drive.  • Some participants found it weird to have to give their full name and  that it was displayed on the scoreboard. They were expecting that  usernames would be enough.  • An issue was reported on the Discord server. The ticket to access  a dedicated page was not clearly communicated and some  participants found themselves receiving messages from other events  going on at the same time.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  35  5. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  5.1. GOVERNANCE AND DECISION-MAKING ASPECTS  Parameter Recommendations  Roles and  responsibilities  • National teams should be made aware of the amount of work involved in the preparation for and  organisation of ECSC events, to manage expectations.  • National team members should be encouraged and reminded to respond to the survey circulated  by the Czech organisers, in order to help them anticipate as much as possible participants’ needs  and facilitate their work.  Decision- making of the  ECSC Steering  Committee and  jury  • Ensure that all ECSC 2021 participants are aware that the Czech national team will not take part  in the competition, to end any potential concerns about the national team’s having some undue  advantages.  • Make the most of the CIRCABC platform, ensuring that all the ECSC Steering Committee  members who were experiencing issues with logging in have sorted them out and that news, the  committee’s agendas, minutes and related documents are uploaded in a timely manner and kept  up to date on the platform.  • The decision-making process adopted in Romania, with the jury taking decisions then passing  them on to the ECSC Steering Committee, should be retained, as it proved to be efficient.  Transparency • Make sure that the recipients to be sent ECSC-related documents are explicitly mentioned in the  documents, to facilitate their circulation.  • Clarify the relationship between the ECSC and ICSC steering committees and have more  meetings minuted to avoid any misunderstandings or misinterpretations that could lead to  confusion among the ECSC Steering Committee members.  National  participation  • Concerns voiced by some ECSC members that by expanding to new countries, logistics- and  funding-related issues have grown to the point that they are compromising the ECSC’s spirit of fun  should be taken into account and addressed.  5.2. PUBLIC AFFAIRS – GENERAL PERSPECTIVE  Parameter Recommendations  Monitoring,  measurement  and analysis  (KPIs)  • Inform participating teams in advance that social media statistics will be collected from them by  public affairs personnel and start thinking about an easy and straightforward way of doing that.  Dissemination  plan  • Make sure that participating teams are well aware of the dissemination plan, for example by  organising a brief dedicated videoconference during which ENISA’s public affairs team and  contractor present the key aspects of the dissemination plan to participating teams.  • Provide some guidance about social media and communication.  • Incentivise participating teams to jointly disseminate information with combined messages, for  example through the establishment of a top three or top five ranking of the most active participating  teams, to be made public at the end of the event (with a prize, if possible).  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  36  Key  messages  • Ensure that the pan-European spirit of the ECSC is well reflected in the communication  messages, to appeal to the collaborative mindset of the participating teams and convey clearly the  European identity of the ECSC. This would be well received by participants, who sometimes feel  like the ‘E’ is missing in ‘ECSC’.  • Develop ECSC-specific and easy to customise digital media content, including graphic elements  such as infographics and appealing visuals for publication on social media channels.  • ENISA’s public affairs team and contractor are to be responsible for liaison with the European print  media, as they have connections that participating teams do not have.  • Key messages should be crafted to attract more women.  Engagement  and reach  • Identify ECSC members with connections with YouTubers active on cybersecurity-related topics or  find a way to contact them and ask them for their support in raising awareness about the ECSC.  • Identify potential ECSC members with connections with female researchers in cybersecurity active  on social media, not only to raise awareness about the ECSC but also to attract more girls to the  cybersecurity sector.  • Make the most of the European Cybersecurity Month in October to promote the ECSC.  • Reach out to schools and invite more students.  Social media  and visibility  • Find a way to avoid starting from scratch when social media accounts are being created by the  new ECSC organisers, to capitalise on the experience and good ideas of the organisers who  launched the social media accounts the year before.  • Explore possible solutions to deal with the ownership issue and make it possible to create a  dedicated ECSC social media identity (e.g. on Twitter and LinkedIn) and strengthen the ECSC  brand.  Website • Ensure that the ECSC website is regularly updated to provide participants with all relevant  information in a timely and accurate way.  • Post dynamic content on the website (e.g. live streaming and live scoreboard information).  5.3. CHALLENGES – LESSONS LEARNED FROM ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Recommendations  Design • Ensure enough diversity in the challenges.  • A ‘very good challenge’, according to one of the respondents to the participants’  questionnaire would meet the following requirements:  o very well designed  o a learning experience  o innovative  o fair  o fun.  • Try to harmonise flags’ formats, which can vary a lot depending on the supplier.  • Enhance the cooperative mindset and the European ‘branding’.  • Small countries (e.g. the five smallest ones) should be allowed to cooperate against  major teams.  • Consider adding some boot2root challenges and create activities that members of  teams from different countries are expected to collaborate on, instead of their having to  compete against each other for the duration of the event.  • Even if the event has to become virtual because of the COVID-19 pandemic, find  ways to encourage interaction and collaboration.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  37  Rules • Implement a section on the ECSC platform that details the ECSC rules and the good  conduct expected of the participants.  • Find a way to display the Charter of Good Conduct during the event.  • Something as simple as a terminology brief describing the roles, functions and  responsibilities of the various people taking part in ECSC events could be helpful in  making people aware of the rules, especially those that apply more particularly to them  depending on their function (captains, coaches, trainers, qualifiers, organisers, etc.).  • The choice of a channel for communication among participants should be made in  advance and thought should be put into how communication will be structured  (e.g. who should have access to what, which spaces should be created). Once it has  been decided on, registration with the communication channel could be made  compulsory.  Enforcement • Identify a platform or a channel (within Discord, for instance) where an incident- reporting space could be created for participants to notify the jury of potential issues,  such as cheating or unethical behaviour.  • If using a Discord-type channel, check that participants do not use it to exchange  flags.  • Consider publishing exchanges on a Discord-type channel for transparency  purposes.  Presentations  (NB: this  parameter  relates  specifically to  the ECSC)  • Explain clearly what the requirements for the presentations are and what the level of  technical expertise of the jury panel is.  • Post an agenda giving the order and timing of the presentations on the ECSC  platform and website.  Complexity • Participants are more and more demanding about the quality and complexity of  challenges and tend to expect that considerable thought and care will have been put  into their creation, for example by forensics professionals.  • Do not reuse challenges, to ensure that no write-ups are available.  • Avoid challenges that involve guessing or that are not originals.  • Create more education-oriented challenges.  • Check carefully for misspellings.  Scoring • Ensure that challenges that require a lot of work to find the solution are worth more  than challenges that require guessing or random algorithms to be solved.  5.4. COMPLIANCE – LESSONS LEARNED FROM ENISA HACKFEST 2020  Parameter Recommendations  Data protection • Do not require participants to have a Google account to submit write-ups.  • Do not display full names on the scoreboard.  ECSC 2020 ANALYSIS REPORT  April 2021  38  6. ECSC 2021  The final of the 2021 edition of the ECSC will take place in Prague in September 2021; at least  22 countries are expected to participate.

    "abstract": "This report analyses the efforts provided by ENISA and national partners during the 2020 to support the growing of the European Cyber Security Challenge. The 7th Edition of the European Cyber Security Challenge, ECSC2020 planned initially for the 4th and 5th of November in Vienna had to be postponed due to the COVID19 pandemic. Despite of that, organisers worked to keep the spirit of the competition alive with different activities were performed during this year, such the first ‘ENISA Hackfest 2020’. Furthermore, intense work was done to prepare for 2021 edition in Prague and the new ICSC - International Cyberecurity Challenge, planned for December 2021 in Athens."

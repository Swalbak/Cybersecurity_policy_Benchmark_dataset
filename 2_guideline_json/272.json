This report is a follow-up covering all  27 EU Member States and offering additional insights into the allocation of NIS budgets  of OES/DSP, the economic impact of cybersecurity incidents and the organisation of  cybersecurity in these operators. In addition, global cybersecurity market trends are presented  through Gartner security data and insights observed globally and in the EU, in order to provide a  better understanding of the relevant dynamics.  Data was collected through a survey of 947 organisations identified as OES/DSP across the  27 Member States. In this second edition of the report, besides covering all Member States,  additional and complementary questions were asked to the surveyed organisations.  Overall, 48.9 % of surveyed organisations acknowledge a very significant or significant  impact of the NIS Directive on their information security (IS). Other key findings of this  report are as follows.   Almost 50 % of the established OES/DSP within the EU believe that implementing the  NIS Directive has strengthened their detection capabilities, while 26 % believe that it  has strengthened their ability to recover from incidents.   67 % of OES/DSP required a dedicated budget for the NIS Directive implementation,  with a median value of EUR 40 000 or 5.1 % of their overall information security  budgets. Around 50 % of organisations required on median four additional full-time  employees (FTEs) for the implementation, either via recruitment or outsourcing.   The estimated direct cost of a major security incident is EUR 100 000 on median, with  the banking and healthcare sectors experiencing the highest such costs of  EUR 300 000 and EUR 213 000 respectively. The primary cost factors for this figure  include costs related to revenue losses and data recovery or business continuity  management. 9 % of organisations have suffered a major security incident that  impacted external stakeholders.   In 28 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief  Technology Officer (CTO) is responsible for information security while in over 50 % of  cases, the Head of Information Security reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer  (CEO), the Board of Directors (BOD) or the President.   More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP do not possess any form of cyber  insurance, but around 25 % are planning to obtain coverage.   More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP certify their systems and processes.   The majority of the surveyed OES/DSP report that their information security controls  meet or exceed industry standards, with only 5 % reporting that they do not meet those  standards.   The results indicate a strong correlation between a very positive self-perception of  cybersecurity maturity and the existence of cybersecurity certifications for processes,  people and products within an organisation.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investment  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investment https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)3 represents  the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity, with the objective of achieving a high common  level of cybersecurity for all Member States. One of the three pillars of the NIS Directive is the  implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators of Essential  Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). Annex II and Annex III of the NIS Directive  identify the following categories of operators/sectors as OES and DSPs respectively:  Table 1: Categories of OES/DSP as defined in the NIS Directive  Categories of OES and DSPs  OES DSPs   Energy (electricity, oil and gas)   Transport (air, rail, water and road)   Banking   Financial market infrastructures   Health   Drinking water supply and distribution   Digital infrastructure   Online marketplace   Online search engine   Cloud computing service  The objective of this report is to document how operators within these sectors invest in  cybersecurity and comply with the objectives set forth in the NIS Directive, and to shed  some light on other aspects such as certification, cyber insurance and organisation of  information security in OES/DSP. In this context, this report could provide additional inputs for  ‘NIS 2’, a proposal for a directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across  the EU that is under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the European  Union.  NIS investment data for this report was collected from two sources.   Chapter 2 (Information security dynamics and outlook), consisting of high-level  insights into the EU cybersecurity market, is based on data drawn from Gartner’s  research databases, combined with additional analysis of the current market  dynamics and the latest forecasts.   Chapter 3 (Information security investments for implementing the directive) is based  on data from a dedicated market survey that focused on the directive and was  conducted on 947 organisations identified as OES/DSP in the EU.  In order to ensure a representative account of all 27 Member States, a minimum of 35  organisations were surveyed per Member State.  Additional information on the survey demographics is available in Annex A.  The target audience of this report is EU and national policymakers. The report may also  provide useful information to OES/DSP as a secondary audience.  3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  7  2. INFORMATION SECURITY  DYNAMICS AND OUTLOOK  This chapter aims to provide a high-level outline of global information security trends and  outlooks. In order to provide actionable insights, it leverages data and metrics that were  collected and assessed by Gartner, independently from the dedicated survey at hand. The  specific sources of data for the following analysis include:   Gartner IT Key Metrics Data 2021: IT Security Measures4, Worldwide   Gartner Forecast: IT Security and Risk Management, Worldwide, 2020-2025, 2Q21  Update.5  It should be noted that the source of the data for Chapter 2 (Gartner databases) is different  to the source of the data for Chapter 3 (survey). Specifically:   the definitions of the industries referenced in Chapter 2 are not aligned with the  definitions of the OES/DSP sectors in Chapter 3 and set out by the NIS Directive;   the figures provided by Gartner in the IT Key Metrics data 2021 are financial figures  collected for the entire year 2020.  A detailed description of the relevant definitions is available in Annex B.  This data set is presented before the detailed data related to implementing the directive in order  to provide a high-level overview of the global market (including Member States) in terms of  information security investments and to highlight a few key statistics and trends. This broader  view serves as an introduction to the focused analysis presented in Chapter 3 for  OES/DSP in the Member States.  2.1 INFORMATION SECURITY BUDGETS  The data shows that tracking and the corresponding allocation of information security budgets is  still increasing within most organisations and earmarked predominantly for IT security.  Regardless of this positive trend, 38% of the surveyed organisations still did not possess a  distinct information security budget and 62% of these organisations did not effectively  communicate the costs associated with information security to the relevant business units and  process owners.  4 https://www.gartner.com/document/3993567?ref=solrAll&refval=291617539  5 https://www.gartner.com/document/code/752504?ref=authbody&refval=4004647  https://www.gartner.com/document/3993567?ref=solrAll&refval=291617539 https://www.gartner.com/document/code/752504?ref=authbody&refval=4004647  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  8  Figure 1: Overview of information security budgets (2020)  When evaluating the ownership of information security budgets (Figure 2) and the lines of  hierarchical reporting (Figure 3), it must be observed that information security is still widely  recognised as an exclusive IT discipline, without due consideration for the wider business  impact thereof.  Figure 2: Location of information security budgets (2020)  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  9  Figure 3: - Most senior level of reporting by IT security (2020)  2.2 INFORMATION SECURITY SPENDING DISTRIBUTION  Further insights into the specific types of investments can be derived from a breakdown of the  distribution of information security spending across functional security domains6. Following this  approach, Gartner identifies the following categories.   Vulnerability management and security analytics investments focus on establishing  proactive capabilities to minimise the impact of possible breaches once they occur.   Application security encompasses the design, development and operation of a  specific application. Furthermore, application security focuses on the configuration and  deployment of both the application and its supporting components – such as network,  operating system or database – with the objective of ensuring security.   Governance risk and compliance focuses on how organisations mitigate a specific  set of risks through developing strategies, policies, standards and awareness. It strives  to manage risks in an effective and transparent manner while ensuring that legal and  regulatory compliance requirements are met, and information security is embedded  throughout the organisation.   Operational infrastructure security – including network security, identity and access  management, endpoint security and data security – focuses on protecting the network,  the hosts and the data. Furthermore, it aims to guarantee secure and authorised  access to systems.  Relevant data clearly indicates that organisations worldwide dedicate most of their security  spending on the following three functional security domains:   vulnerability management and security analytics, with a share of 20 %;   governance, risk and compliance, with a share of 18 %;   network security, with a share of 16 %.  6 Annex B provides detailed definitions for the security domains referenced in Chapter 2.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  10  Figure 4: IT security spending distribution by functional area (2020)  As illustrated in Figure 5, the year-on-year evolution between 2019 and 2020 shows only marginal  changes in the overall distribution of IT security spending.  Figure 5: IT security spending distribution – year-on-year evolution by functional security domain  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  11  The distribution of IT spending between the different functional security domains has been  relatively stable over the last 5 years. However, spending varies significantly between different  industries, as illustrated in Figure 6.  Figure 6: IT security spending distribution by functional area by industry (2020)  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  12  In terms of IT assets, the main area of spending for information security is personnel (37 %),  followed by software (28 %) and hardware (13 %). The share of external services such as  advisory, outsourcing or cloud-based services is 22 %.  Figure 7: IT security spending distribution by asset class (2020)  Similarly to the distribution by functional security domains, the distribution of spending by asset  class remains relatively stable, despite a slight decrease (– 2 %) in hardware spending in 2020  compared to 2019.  Figure 8: IT security spending distribution – year-on-year evolution by asset class  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  13  2.3 INFORMATION SECURITY STAFFING  As IT continues to develop exponentially, the demand for available and qualified information  security professionals continues to grow. With competition steadily increasing, many  organisations are facing real issues in finding talented people with the necessary skill sets and  experience.  Figure 9: Global trends in information security staffing  In addition to the overall shortage of IT professionals, the increased focus on automation clearly  affects the security skills and qualifications that are in market demand. As such, various skills  that were in high demand during the previous years – such as manual penetration testing, tier  1/2 SOC7 analysis or technology management – are expected to decrease in importance. They  will be gradually replaced by skills in risk management, service management, incident response,  threat intelligence, data science and analysis or coding.  Figure 10: The information security skills landscape dynamics  7 Security Operations Centre  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  14  2.4 INFORMATION SECURITY MARKET OUTLOOK  In terms of market outlook, Gartner’s IT security forecast indicates which solution types are  expected to grow in the coming years. The main area of interest is cloud access security  brokers (33 %), closely followed by vulnerability assessments and web application firewalls at  25 %. Furthermore, access management, application security testing and encryption are  expected to benefit from a 23 % increase in market interest.  Figure 11: IT Security forecast — compound annual growth rate, 2020 – 2025 (%) by solution type  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  15  2.5 SECURITY PERFORMANCE  Despite multiple risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic – such as the new work  environment and environmental, social and governance concerns – information security controls  failure was listed as the top emerging risk within Gartner’s latest Emerging Risks Monitor  Report. To assess the maturity of an organisation, the mere existence of cybersecurity  framework (CSF) controls or tooling does not necessarily imply a high level of cybersecurity  maturity, their performance and effectiveness are more appropriate measures.  Figure 12: Cybersecurity controls – existence vs performance  2.6 FUTURE OF INFORMATION SECURITY  According to Gartner, it is estimated that8:   by 2022, 30 % of all security teams will have increased the number of employees  working remotely on a permanent basis.   by 2025, 40 % of boards of directors will have a dedicated cybersecurity committee  overseen by a qualified board member, up from less than 10% today.   by 2024, 60 % of Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) will establish critical  partnerships with key market-facing executives in sales, finance and marketing, up  from less than 20 % today.   by 2025, 50 % of asset-intensive organisations will converge their cyber, physical and  supply chain security teams under a single Chief Security Officer (CSO) role that  reports directly to the CEO.  8 Gartner Predicts 2021: Cybersecurity Program Management and IT Risk Management ID G00735901 January 2021  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  16  2.7 CISO EFFECTIVENESS  The operating environment of CISOs is becoming more complex. Distributed decision-making  has expanded the volume and variety of information risk decisions to support, while regulators  are approaching data privacy with greater scrutiny and executive teams and boards of directors  are starting to turn their sights toward information risk and its implications for strategic planning.  All of these changes emphasise the need for CISOs to be effective in their roles.  Figure 13: Effectiveness of the CISO role  Based on Gartner Research, only 12 % of CISOs excel in all categories as defined in the CISO  Effectiveness Index.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  17  3. INFORMATION SECURITY  INVESTMENTS FOR THE NIS  DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION  3.1 METHODOLOGY  This study is based on a dedicated market survey conducted among 947 organisations – with a  minimum of 35 per Member State – that were identified as OES/DSP under the NIS Directive.  The quantitative metrics in the survey have been analysed on the basis of median and average  approaches in order for the reader to appreciate both viewpoints.  Although the median value should be regarded as the typical value for an OES/DSP  within a specific sector or country, the average value will often be higher as it is affected  by large organisations (statistical outliers) that do not necessarily reflect the populated  and fragmented market of most of the sectors and countries that were analysed.  The specific market composition of each sector in terms of company size has also been  analysed by categorising the organisations in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs) or large enterprises, based on the EU definition9 (see Chapter 4).  By way of example:   the median value for information security spending amounts to EUR 2 million in 2020  (Section 3.2.2), which implies that a typical OES/DSP within the EU spends around  EUR 2 million in information security yearly;   contrasting this median value, the average information security spending for OES/DSP  in the EU amounts to EUR 10.4 million, but this number is skewed by large  organisations that possess significant budgets dedicated to information security.  With regard to the qualitative metrics in the study, the distribution of the organisations’ answers  has been calculated as a percentage, so as to balance the weight of each answer against the  others.  Finally, additional information and insights on security performance have been derived from the  initial data set by cross-analysing answers from multiple questions (Chapter 5).  9 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  18  3.2 INFORMATION SECURITY AND NIS SPENDING  Key findings  A typical OES/DSP spent on median EUR 30 million on IT in 2020, of which EUR 2 million was earmarked  for information security.  A typical OES/DSP in the EU earmarks on median 7.7 % of its IT investment for information security.  While the banking and energy sectors have the highest IT and information security spending in the EU,  digital infrastructure and cloud computing have the highest information security vs IT spending.  A typical OES/DSP in the EU spends around EUR 40 000 on implementing the requirements of the NIS  directive.  Governance, risk and compliance, network security and vulnerability management are the predominant  areas of investment for the implementation of the directive.  The most procured tools and services are network intrusion detection and prevention, security awareness  and training, vulnerability assessment tooling, security incident and event management, and risk  assessment and business impact analysis.  3.2.1 IT spending  Survey question: What was your organisation’s estimated IT budget/spending in euro for  2020 (including capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) for  hardware, software, internal personnel, contractors and outsourcing spending)?  Figure 14: IT spending  The median IT spending of a typical OES/DSP in the EU was EUR 30 million in 2020, while the  average value of IT spending was EUR 125 million over the same period. While these are  absolute values that have to be interpreted in light of the sector’s structure and company size, a  smaller budget does not necessarily imply a lower level of cybersecurity maturity.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  19  Figure 15: IT spending of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  NB: The map visualisations throughout the report depict data collected from the OES/DSP  surveyed from each Member State. Hence, data on investments refers to average among  surveyed OES/DPS and not Member State investments. In addition, when interpreting these  figures, the market fragmentation / average operator size in each Member State, as well as the  criteria for identifying OES/DSP in each Member State – including OES/DPS size – need to be  factored in.  The survey data indicates that median IT spending is highest (EUR 60 million) within the energy  and banking sectors (EUR 50 million), significantly exceeding IT spending in other sectors as  illustrated in Figure 16. Furthermore, online search engines and digital infrastructure have the  lowest IT spending across all sectors, with a median spending of EUR 1 million.  The map  visualisations  throughout the  report depict  data collected  from the  OES/DSP  surveyed from  each Member  State.

Figure 17: Information security spending  The survey data indicates that the median spending for information security of a typical  OES/DSP in the EU was EUR 2 million in 2020, while the average spending was  EUR 10.4 million.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  21  Figure 18: Information security spending of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  In a manner similar to the total IT spending, the banking sector (EUR 4 million) and the energy  sector (EUR 3 million) account for the highest median spending per sector. Moreover, the  information security spend of digital infrastructure and online search engine companies is the  lowest, amounting to a median spending below EUR 100 000.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  22  Figure 19: Information security spending by sector  3.2.3 Information security spending as a share of IT spending  In order to determine the importance of information security spending in a typical OES/DSP, the  relative share of information security spending against overall IT spending was calculated and is  depicted in Figure 20.  Figure 20: Information security spending as a share of IT spending  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  23  As per the median value, a typical OES/DSP in the EU earmarks 7.7 % of its IT investments for  information security, while the average value is 8.8 %.  Figure 21: Information security spending as a share of IT spending of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  Digital infrastructure has the highest information security vs IT spending (10 %), followed closely  by cloud computing (9 %) and online marketplaces (8.7 %). Drinking water supply and  distribution, energy and transport bring up the rear, with values of information security vs IT  spending lower than 7 %.  Even though the energy and banking sectors have a higher IT and Information security  spending in absolute figures, their respective shares of information security vs IT spending are  lower than most other sectors.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  24  Figure 22: Information security spending as a share of IT spending by sector  3.2.4 NIS Directive spending  Survey question: What was your organisation’s estimated budget dedicated to the NIS  Directive implementation (e.g. including CAPEX and OPEX for hardware, software,  infrastructure, business continuity, internal personnel, contractors and outsourcing  spending)?  Out of 947 respondents, 775 (approx. 82 %) organisations have implemented the NIS Directive,  while 635 (67 %) organisations require additional budget to implement all its requirements.  Furthermore, 172 (approx. 18 %) organisations have not yet implemented the NIS Directive.  Figure 23: Implementation of the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  25  Figure 24: Budget allocated to implementing the NIS Directive  As per the median value, a typical OES/DSP in the EU spends EUR 40 000 on implementing  the NIS Directive, while on average the spending amounts to EUR 98 000.  Figure 25: Budget allocated to implementing the NIS Directive for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  26  The survey results indicate that a typical OES/DSP from the energy sector has allocated the  highest budget to achieve implementation, with a median spending of EUR 66 000, closely  followed by organisations in the banking sector with a median spending of EUR 65 000 for  implementation. Drinking water supply and distribution, financial market infrastructures and  digital infrastructure have allocated the lowest budgets to achieve compliance, with a median  spending of just EUR 25 000.  Figure 26: Budget allocated to implementing the NIS Directive by sector  3.2.5 NIS spending as a share of information security spending  In order to determine the impact of NIS spending in a typical OES/DSP, we calculated the relative  share of NIS spending against overall information security spending, as illustrated in Figure 27.  Figure 27: NIS spending as a share of total information security spending  As per the median value, the typical spending on implementing the NIS directive within an  OES/DSP amounts to 5.1 % of their overall information security spending, while the average  value is 10.5 %.

Network security and vulnerability management has also seen investments from a large  number of organisations, with 357 of them investing in network security and 316 investing in  vulnerability management.  On the contrary, business continuity management has seen little investment in the context of  NIS implementation, with only 69 organisations identifying this security domain in their top three  domains.  Survey question: What are the top three security domains where your organisation  invested the most to implement the NIS Directive?  Figure 30: Security domains for implementing the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  29  3.2.7 Technologies and services procured for the NIS Directive  The technology and services associated with network intrusion detection and prevention  were the most procured in the context of NIS implementation, with 257 organisations reporting  procurements in this domain.  This domain – along with security awareness and training (222 responses), vulnerability  assessment tooling (221 responses), security incident and event management (219  responses) and risk assessment and business impact analysis (217 responses) – is one of  the five main technologies and services that were procured in the context of NIS  implementation.  Survey question: Which of the following technologies or services did you procure  because of the NIS directive implementation?  Figure 31: Technologies and services procured for implementing the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  30  3.3 INFORMATION SECURITY AND NIS STAFFING  Key findings  A typical OES/DSP employs on median 60 IT FTEs, of which seven are dedicated information security  FTEs.  Almost 50 % of the established OES/DSP within the EU hire contractors to support their information  security workforce.  Almost 50 % of the established OES/DSP within the EU hired new staff members in the context of  implementing the directive, with a median of four FTEs per sector.  A typical OES/DSP in the EU employs on median two dedicated FTEs for incident response.  3.3.1 IT FTEs  There are large discrepancies in the total number of IT FTEs in OES/DSP among the Member  States. Median values range from over 400 IT employees in Italy to 20 employees in Latvia or  Slovenia. Whereas these are total values – possibly reflecting the underlying sector structure  and company size – a lower number of FTEs does not necessarily imply a lower level of security  maturity. The data shows a disparity between the median and average values, which indicates  that most organisations employ a low number of FTEs while larger organisations engage a  substantial number of IT FTEs.  Survey question: What was your organisation's estimated number of IT FTEs for 2020  including internal staff and contractors?  Figure 32: IT FTEs  The survey data indicates that a typical OES/DSP in Italy and France has the highest number of  IT FTEs, with median values of 420 and 350 FTEs respectively.  However, these figures must be read with due regard for the structure of the sector and the size  of the organisations surveyed for each Member State. For instance, French OES/DSP have the  highest average number of employees.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  31  Figure 33: IT FTEs of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  As illustrated in Figure 34, there are large discrepancies in the number of IT FTEs across  sectors. For example, the banking sector has the largest median value of 200 FTEs, which is  15 % higher than the median value of the transport sector, which employs 167 IT FTEs on  median. However, online search engines and digital infrastructure have a significantly lower  median value of seven IT FTEs.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  32  Figure 34: IT FTEs by sector  3.3.2 Information security FTEs  Survey question: What was your organisation's estimated number of information security  FTEs for 2020 including internal staff and contractors?  Figure 35: Information security FTEs  As with the overall discrepancy of IT FTEs, the distribution of information security FTEs follows  a similar trend. With 45 FTEs, organisations from France have the highest median value in the  EU, followed by organisations from Italy and Germany, with 35 and 30 FTEs respectively.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  33  Figure 36: Information security FTEs for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  As illustrated in Figure 37, the banking sector has the highest number of information security  FTEs, with a median value of 17 FTEs in 2020, followed by the healthcare and transport  sectors, with 14 and 12 FTEs respectively. With two FTEs, the digital infrastructure and online  search engine sectors have the lowest median number of information security FTEs.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  34  Figure 37: Information security FTEs by sector  3.3.3 Share of contractors in information security FTEs  The survey data indicates that 357 (37.7 %) organisations have not hired any contractors in  support of their information security workforce, while 436 (46.04 %) organisations report having  contractors among their information security FTEs.  Survey question: Please indicate the percentage of information security FTEs that are  contractors.  Figure 38: Contractors in information security FTEs  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  35  Figure 39: Contractors in information security FTEs for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  The digital infrastructure and online search engine sectors use the most contractors, amounting  to 50 % of the overall information security workforce. For the other sectors, the median value  fluctuates between 20 % and 30 %.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  36  Figure 40: Contractors in information security FTEs by sector  3.3.4 Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs  In order to determine the importance of information security FTEs in a typical OES/DSP, the  relative share of these FTEs against the overall IT FTEs was calculated and is depicted in  Figure 41.  Figure 41: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs  As per the median value, the typical percentage of information security FTEs against the overall  IT FTEs amounts to 13 % for OES/DSP in the EU, with an average of 17 %.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  37  Figure 42: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  The online search engine sector has the highest information security to IT FTEs ratio, with a  median value of 33.3 %, while digital infrastructures follows closely with a median value of  28.6 %. The information security to IT FTEs ratio is lowest for the transport sector, with a  median value of 10 %.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  38  Figure 43: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs by sector  3.3.5 Specific hires for NIS implementation  While 49 % of the surveyed organisations did not hire any new staff in the context of their NIS  implementation, 32 % of organisations said they had used external contractors or third parties  for their implementation programmes.  Survey question: Did your organisation hire additional internal security staff (not  contractors) specifically to implement the NIS Directive?  Figure 44: Information security hires related to implementing the NIS Directive  None of the organisations answering for Malta and Latvia have hired information security FTEs  for implementing the NIS Directive.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  39  Figure 45: Information security hires related to implementing the NIS Directive for OES/DSP surveyed per  Member State  When analysing the survey data from a sector perspective, the healthcare sector has the  highest median value of five FTEs hired to ensure the implementation of the NIS Directive.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  40  Figure 46: Information security hires related to the implementing the NIS Directive by sector  3.3.6 FTEs dedicated to security incident response  Survey question: In 2020, how many FTEs (internal staff and/or contractors) are fully  dedicated to information security incident response activities in your organisation?  Figure 47: Information security FTEs for security incident response  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  41  Figure 48: Information security FTEs for security incident response for OES/DSP surveyed  per Member State  The banking sector has the highest median value of FTEs associated with incident  management (three FTEs), while the other sectors employ one or two dedicated FTEs.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  42  Figure 49: Information security FTEs for security incident response by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  43  3.4 INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS  Key findings  The estimated direct cost of a major security incident for a typical OES/DSP is EUR 100 000 on median.  The costs related to revenue losses and data recovery or business continuity management are the  predominant costs in the context of a major security incident.  Almost 50 % of surveyed OES/DSP indicate that the number of security incidents they are experiencing  remains stable.  In 2020, only 8.8 % of surveyed OES/DSP experienced a major security incident.  Almost 50 % of surveyed OES/DSP believe that the NIS implementation has strengthened their detection  capabilities, while 26 % believe that it has strengthened their ability to recover from incidents.  3.4.1 Cost of information security incidents  While 67.8 % of the 947 surveyed organisations declared that they had not experienced a  major security incident so far, 8.7 % agreed to share the costs related to their last major  security incident and 23.3 % refused to share this information.  Survey question: What are the estimated direct costs incurred by the last major  information security incident experienced by your organisation?  Figure 50: Has your organisation experienced a major security incident  For the 82 organisations that declared the costs associated with their latest major information  security incident, the direct cost of a security incident for an OES/DSP was EUR 100 000, while  the average cost was EUR 169 000.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  44  Figure 51: Estimated direct costs of a major cybersecurity incidents  The banking and healthcare sectors experience the highest costs associated with security  incidents, with median values of EUR 300 000 and EUR 213 000 respectively.  Figure 52: Estimated direct costs of a major cybersecurity incident by sector  3.4.2 Top components of incident costs  With 404 organisations reporting losses of revenue and 378 organisations reporting costs  related to data recovery / business continuity management, these components form the  principal direct costs related to a security incident.  Survey question: What are the top two components of the direct costs associated with  major information security incidents?  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  45  Figure 53: Top two components of direct cybersecurity incident costs  3.4.3 Trend in security incidents  The number of information security incidents has remained stable in almost half of the  organisations (49.2 %). Be that as it may, 39 % of organisations report that the number of  information security incidents has risen by over 10 %, while 7.18 % of organisations have  experienced an increase of over 30 %. Only 43 (4.5 %) organisations report that the number of  information security incidents has declined: 3.4 % of organisations reported a reduction of 10 %  or more and 1.1 % of organisations reported a reduction of 30 % or more.  Survey question: How do you evaluate the year-on-year evolution of the number of  information security incidents that your organisation is facing?  Figure 54: Trend in the number of information security incidents year-on-year  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  46  3.4.4 Spread of security incidents  Approximately 9 % of organisations have suffered a major security incident that impacted  external stakeholders – such as customers or partners – within their business ecosystem.  Survey question: In 2020, did your organisation suffer a major security incident  impacting other organisations in your ecosystem (customers, partners)?  Figure 55: Spread of information security incidents  A detailed breakdown per sector indicates that the risk of a major security incident is  comparable in the different verticals and varies between 5 and 15 %. Cloud computing is the  sector with the highest probability of security incidents – approximately 15 % – whereas the  banking sector experiences the lowest spread of security incidents.  Figure 56: Spread of information security incidents by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  47  3.4.5 Security incident response sourcing  59 % of organisations have internal incident response capabilities at their disposal, while around  20 % combine both internal and outsourced capabilities. Furthermore, 21 % of organisations  have completely outsourced these capabilities.  Survey question: What is your organisation's sourcing strategy for information security  incident response capabilities?  Figure 57: Security incident response sourcing  3.4.6 NIS impact on incident response  49 % of organisations believe that the implementation of the NIS Directive has directly  bolstered their detection capabilities and 26 % reported the strengthening of recovery  capabilities due to the implementation of the NIS Directive. Nonetheless, 14 % of  organisations did not observe any particular benefit after the implementation of the NIS Directive.  Survey question: How has the implementation of the NIS Directive helped your  organisation mitigate the impact of the information security incidents?  Figure 58: Impact of implementing the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  48  3.5 SECURITY ORGANISATION AND PERFORMANCE  Key findings  In 28 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the CIO or CTO is responsible for information security.  In over 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the HIS reports directly to the CEO, the BOD or the President.  More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP do not possess any form of cyber insurance, although around  25 % are planning to obtain coverage.  More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP certify their systems and processes (e.g. on the basis of the  International Organisation for Standardisation’s ISO 27001 certification).  The majority of the surveyed OES/DSP report that their information security controls meet industry  standards, with only 5 % reporting that they do not meet those standards.  3.5.1 Reporting line of information security  The Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are responsible for  information security in over 28 % of the surveyed organisations. Moreover, the CISO is the most  senior-level person responsible for information security in 22 % of the surveyed OES/DSP.  Survey question: What is the role in your organisation of the most senior-level person  dedicated exclusively to information security?  Figure 59: Head of information security  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  49  Figure 60: Head of information security by sector  As illustrated in Figure 61, the head of information security generally reports directly to the CEO  or Board of directors (BOD), with 55.86 % of organisations having a direct line of reporting from  the head of information security to the CEO.  Survey question: Who does the head of information security directly report to?  Figure 61: Reporting line of information security  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  50  Figure 62: Reporting line of information security by sector  3.5.2 Cyber insurance  Over 57 % of organisations have not subscribed to a cyber insurance solution. While  21.01 % of organisations have subscribed to a solution that encompasses both direct incurred  losses and third-party losses, 181 organisations only cover direct losses while 2.75 % of  organisations only cover third-party losses.  Furthermore, 23.23 % of organisations reported that they currently do not subscribe to any  cyber insurance solution, but are planning to implement one.  Survey question: Did your organisation subscribe to a dedicated cyber insurance  solution?  Figure 63: Cyber insurance subscriptions  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  51  Figure 64: Cyber insurance subscriptions by sector  3.5.3 Certification  A majority of organisations (51.1 %) certify their systems and processes, e.g. on the basis of  ISO 27001 certification. Furthermore, 17.5 % of organisations reported that they certify their  staff with certifications such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).  Survey question: Does the organisation have information security related certification for  processes, systems or staff?  Figure 65: Certifications  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  52  3.5.4 Performance of controls  68.2 % of organisations are convinced that their information security controls meet industry  standards. Moreover, 27.8 % of organisations believe their information security controls are  above (23.7 %) or far above (4.1 %) industry security standards. On the other hand, 38  organisations (almost 5 %) believe that their information security controls do not meet industry  standards.  Survey question: How would you evaluate the overall performance (effectiveness) of  your organisation's information security controls?  Figure 66: Overall performance (effectiveness) of your organisation’s information security controls  Figure 67: Overall performance (effectiveness) of your organisation’s IS controls by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  53  3.6 PERCEPTION OF THE IMPACT OF THE NIS DIRECTIVE  Key findings  Almost 50% of the surveyed OES/DSPs consider that the NIS Directive had a significant or very significant  impact on their security posture.  A majority of the organisations that have implemented the NIS Directive report a corresponding  positive impact on their security posture. Specifically, 9.8 % of organisations report that they  have experienced a very significant impact, while 39.1 % report a significant impact.  Survey question: Please evaluate the positive impact of the NIS directive on your  organisation’s security posture or maturity.

INFORMATION SECURITY  DATA FOR SMES AND LARGE  ENTERPRISES  In line with the EU definition of SMEs10  – based on revenues or employee count – the survey  results have been further refined by classifying all organisations within these categories.  This chapter illustrates the results of the survey on the basis of organisation category.  4.1 DEMOGRAPHICS OF SMES AND LARGE ENTERPRISES  4.1.1 Distribution of SMEs and large enterprises  The share of SMEs in the survey data amounts to approximatively 23 %, whereas large  enterprises compose 77 % of the data set.  Figure 70: Distribution of SMEs and Large Enterprises  10 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  56  4.1.2 SMEs vs large enterprises by sector  The surveyed organisations have varying compositions depending on their operating sector. For  instance, the online search engine and digital infrastructures sectors are composed mainly of  SMEs, whereas these verticals are less mature and thus more fragmented than other traditional  sectors.  Because of their mature and consolidated nature, the energy and banking sectors are mostly  composed of large enterprises.  As stated earlier in the report, the size of the organisations within a certain sector has a direct  influence on most of the collected data. For this reason, we have further normalised the  collected data.  Figure 71: Large enterprises vs SME by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  57  4.1.3 SMEs vs large enterprises by Member State  The OES/DSP sectors are highly consolidated in Italy (97.1 %), Germany (94.3 %) and France  (91.4 %). On the other hand, OES/DSP organisations include a high number of SMEs in Malta  (51.4 %), Cyprus (48.6 %) and Croatia (31.4 %).  Figure 72: Large Enterprises vs SME categorisation of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  58  4.2 INFORMATION SECURITY SPENDING FOR SMES AND LARGE ENTERPRISES  4.2.1 IT spending  A typical SME spends approximately EUR 1 million on IT-related investments, whereas large  enterprises spend around EUR 35 million.  Figure 73: IT spending – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.2.2 Information security spending  A typical SME spends approximately EUR 100 000 on information security, whereas large  enterprises spend around EUR 2 million.  Figure 74: Information security spending – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  59  4.2.3 Information security spending as a share of IT spending  A typical SME allocated approximately 8.6 % of its IT spending to information security, whereas  this figure stands at 7 % for large enterprises.  Figure 75: Information security spending as a share of IT spending – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.2.4 NIS budget  A typical SME earmarked approximately EUR 18 000 for implementing the NIS directive,  whereas large enterprises allocated around EUR 54 000.  Figure 76: NIS budget – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  60  4.3 INFORMATION SECURITY STAFFING FOR SMES AND LARGE ENTERPRISES  4.3.1 IT FTEs for SMEs vs large enterprises  Within the sectors that were identified by the NIS Directive, a typical SME employed four FTEs  whereas a large enterprise employed 120 dedicated IT FTEs.  Figure 77: IT FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.3.2 Information security FTEs for SMEs vs large enterprises  Within the sectors that were identified by the NIS directive, a typical SME employed one FTE,  whereas a large enterprise employed 12 dedicated information security FTEs.  Figure 78: Information security FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  61  4.3.3 Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs for SMEs vs large  enterprises  A typical SME allocated approximately 33 % of its IT FTEs to information security, whereas this  figure stands at 11 % for large enterprises.  Figure 79: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.3.4 Incident response FTEs for SMEs vs large enterprises  Within the sectors that were identified by the NIS Directive, a typical SME employed one FTE  whereas a large enterprise employed two dedicated FTEs for incident response.  Figure 80: Incident response FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  62  4.4 SECURITY PERFORMANCE FOR SMES VS LARGE ENTERPRISES  According to the data that was collected in the self-assessment, approximately 65 % of large  enterprises and 78 % of SMEs consider themselves to meet industry requirements.  We can see a clear discrepancy between SMEs and large enterprises with regards to their self-  perceived security performance: only around 10 % of SMEs perceive their information security  performance as at least ‘Above industry standards’, compared to 32.7 % of large enterprises.  On the other hand, approximately 12.3 % of the SMEs answered that their information security  performance is ‘Below’ or ‘Far below industry standards’, compared to only 2.1 % for the large  enterprises.  Figure 81: Security performance – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.5 CYBER INSURANCE FOR SMEs VS LARGE ENTERPRISES  The share of SMEs having subscribed to a cyber insurance policy (either for third-party losses  or direct losses incurred or both) is around 16 %, compared to 51 % of the large enterprises.  Figure 82: Cyber insurance – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  63  5. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS  FROM SELF-ASSESSMENT  By leveraging the data that was collected in this survey, we identified specific practices that  influence information security performance (based on a self-assessment of the interviewee).  Survey question: How would you evaluate the overall performance (effectiveness) of  your organisation's information security controls?  5.1 INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH SELF-ASSESSED SECURITY  MATURITY  In order to identify indicators of information security performance, we isolated and assessed the  responses from the organisations that consider their information security performance as ‘Far  above industry standards’ within the self-assessment.  Table 2: Correlation between best practices and security performance  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  64  5.2 INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW SELF-ASSESSED SECURITY  MATURITY  In a similar manner, we isolated and assessed the responses from the organisations that  consider their security maturity as ‘Below industry standard’ within the self-assessment to define  certain inadvisable practices.  Table 3: Correlation between inadvisable practices and cyber maturity  5.3 INFORMATION SECURITY SPENDING  A thorough analysis of the survey data showed that no distinctive manipulator of information  security or share of information security / IT spending could be found in the data set.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  65  6. CONCLUSIONS  This report offers interesting insights into how OES/DSP invest their cybersecurity budgets, both  in the context of implementing the NIS Directive, but also from a broader perspective.  Furthermore, it examines many additional aspects of cybersecurity for OES/DSP – including the  cost of incidents and its key components – and how cybersecurity is organised in terms of  reporting lines, cyber insurance products, certifications and more. Most importantly, this report  builds on the work done in the previous year by ENISA on the topic and expands the data set to  cover all 27 Member States.  A summary of the main findings and conclusions is presented below.  On a global level, information security budgets seem to be increasing, although information  security is still widely recognised as an exclusive IT discipline. Cloud access security brokers,  vulnerability assessments and web application firewalls are the market segments that are  expected to grow most over the next few years. Skills shortages persist as an issue for  information security staffing: skills in risk management, service management, incident response,  threat intelligence, data science / analysis and coding are all expected to be in growing demand  in the near future.  Global trends also indicate a shift of focus to the effectiveness of security controls and  capabilities – not just on the verification of their existence. CISO effectiveness across all  required domains should also be emphasised: it is estimated that by 2025, 40 % of boards of  directors will have a dedicated cybersecurity committee, up from less than 10 % today.  The median IT budget for OES/DSP in 2020 was EUR 30 million, of which EUR 2 million was  earmarked for information security. OES/DSP in the EU earmarked on median 7.7 % of their IT  investments for information security.  The NIS Directive has been implemented by 82 % of surveyed organisations, with 67 %  requiring an additional budget for its implementation. OES/DSP spent a median sum of  EUR 40 000 on implementing the NIS Directive, while average spending was EUR 98 000.  OES/DSP from the energy sector allocated the highest budget to achieve implementation, with  a median spending of EUR 66 000.  OES/DSP employ on median 60 IT FTEs, seven of whom are dedicated information security  FTEs. Almost 50 % of OES/DSP hired new staff in the context of the NIS Directive  implementation, with a median of four FTEs per sector.  The estimated direct cost of a major security incident is EUR 100 000 on median. The  primary cost factors are related to revenue losses and data recovery or business continuity  management. 9 % of the organisations have suffered a major security incident that impacted  external stakeholders. The banking and healthcare sectors experienced the highest cost  associated with security incidents, with median values of EUR 300 000 and EUR 213 000  respectively.  Almost 50 % of surveyed OES/DSP believe that implementing NIS has strengthened their  detection capabilities, while 26 % believe that it has strengthened their ability to recover  from incidents.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  66  In 28 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the CIO or the CTO is responsible for information security,  while in over 50 % of cases, the head of information security reports directly to the CEO, the  BOD or the President.  More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP do not possess any form of cyber insurance,  however around 25 % are planning to obtain coverage. At the same time, more than 50 % of  OES/DSP certify their systems and processes.  The majority of the surveyed OES/DSP report that their information security controls meet or  exceed industry standards, with only 5 % reporting that they do not meet these standards.  Almost 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP consider that the NIS Directive has had a  significant or very significant impact on their security posture.  The report also examines the relationship between the self-perceived cybersecurity maturity of  surveyed organisations and the different parameters covered in the document, such as NIS  investments, reporting lines for information security, cyber insurance and certifications. This is  an attempt to identify indications about which elements may be more closely associated with  OES/DSP cybersecurity maturity. The results indicate a strong correlation between a very  positive self-perception of cybersecurity maturity and the existence of cybersecurity  certifications for processes, people and products. Organisations that certify their staff and  systems and buy products with cybersecurity certifications are 36.36 % more likely to self-  assess their cybersecurity maturity as ‘Far above industry standards’. However, this is  simply a correlation of data and does not necessarily imply causation.  The data and accompanying analysis presented in this report will hopefully provide useful  evidence to support policy discussions around the NIS Directive and the ‘NIS 2’ proposal  currently under discussion, as well as contribute to further policy reflections.

B.1 MEDIAN AND AVERAGE DEFINITIONS  Median: the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample,  a population or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as ‘the middle  value’.  The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply  described as the ‘average’) is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or  small values, and therefore provides a better representation of a ‘typical’ value.  Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a ‘typical’ income is,  because income distribution can be very skewed.  Average or arithmetic mean: the arithmetic mean is the sum of all measurements divided by  the number of observations in the data set.  Table 11: Median and average definitions  Type Description Example Result  Arithmetic  mean  Sum of the values of a data set  divided by the number of values  (1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 9) / 7 4  Median  Middle value separating the  greater and lesser halves of a  data set  1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 3  B.2 CAGR DEFINITION  The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the annualised average rate of revenue growth  between 2 given years, assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate. The  CAGR between given years X and Z, where Z – X = N, is the number of years between the  2 given years, is calculated as follows.   CAGR, year X to year Z = [(value in year Z/value in year X) ^ (1/N)-1]   For example, the CAGR for 2006 to 2011 is calculated as: CAGR, 2006 to 2011 (X =  2006, Z = 2011, N = 5) = [(value in 2011/value in 2006) ^ (1/5)-1]  B.3 SME DEFINITION  The main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME are:   staff headcount,   either turnover or balance sheet total.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  76  Table 12: SME definitions  Company category Staff headcount Turnover or Balance sheet total  Medium-sized < 250 ≤ € 50 m ≤ € 43 m  Small < 50 ≤ € 10 m ≤ € 10 m  Micro < 10 ≤ € 2 m ≤ € 2 m  B.4 FINANCIALS   Operational expense is defined as the total expense associated with the business  units supported by the IT organisation. This includes items such as selling, general and  administrative expenses, cost of goods sold (or cost of revenue), research and  development, depreciation and depletion and amortisation expenses. For insurance,  this includes underwriting expenses, loss and loss-adjustment expenses. For banking  organisations, it includes interest expenses and noninterest expenses. For government  and non-profit organisations, it is represented by the enterprise operating budget.   Total IT spending is defined as total spending at the end of the 12-month budget  period for IT to support the enterprise. IT spending/budget can come from anywhere in  the enterprise that incurs IT costs and is not limited to the IT organisation. It includes  estimates by enterprises of decentralised IT spending and or ‘shadow IT’. It is  calculated on an annualised ‘cash flow view’ basis and therefore contains capital  spending and operational expenses, but not depreciation or amortisation.

NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  81  B.6 IT SECURITY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK  Figure 93: IT security analysis framework   Identity and access management is the discipline that enables the right individuals to  access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons. It comprises a  set of practices, processes and technology responsible for the management of digital  identities and their associated access to resources. Specific related activities are: user  account provisioning, password management, user access administration (e.g.  changes in roles, position or status), directory integration, single sign-on, active  directory, remote access services, strong or multi factor authentication / two-factor /  three-factor, hard and soft token-based authentication services, public key  infrastructure and federation-type services, privileged user management, identity and  access governance (including the processes for user access certification/re-  certification, attestation, application access audits, etc.) and cloud-based identity  services (e.g. IDaaS).   Network security comprises measures taken to protect a communication pathway  from unauthorised access to, and accidental or wilful interference with, regular  operations, and hence involves protecting computers and computer networks from  attack and infiltration. Network security provides network protection through the  restricting of network traffic, based on a set of policy-defined rules. Network security  provides protection at key ingress and egress points in the form of perimeters,  segments and zones, typically defined and enforced by firewalls/NGFWs/firewall  administration, wireless access firewalls/RASP, network intrusion detection and  prevention, virtual private networking concentrators, hardware security modules, proxy  servers, secure email and/or web gateways, unified threat management appliances,  network access control services and distributed denial of service protection and  prevention services.   Endpoint security is a set of capabilities and services provisioned across devices and  platforms to provide the required and expected level of protection against potential  compromise resulting from inappropriate configuration, use or attack(s). It covers the  security services, capabilities and associated management and support thereof used in  the protection of all endpoint devices such as desktops, servers, laptops and mobile  devices which users leverage to access corporate data and information. Specific  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  82  examples would typically include antivirus/anti-spyware/anti-malware software on PCs  and servers, mobile device management, device encryption and management, host  intrusion detection and prevention, hardware-based protection (e.g. personal firewalls),  advanced anti-malware and threat detection software and also any physical security  control in place for these assets (e.g. locks).   Data security ensures confidence in the ability of users, systems and business  processes to provide the required and expected level of protection from data  compromise or loss of data fidelity resulting from system compromise or failure, or  inappropriate user behaviour with regard to data in whatever stage of its lifecycle. It  focuses on confidentiality (to protect against unauthorised or inappropriate access),  integrity (to ensure data is not improperly changed or deleted), availability (to ensure  appropriate access to data for the right parties) and privacy (to assure personal  information is only used for the specific business purpose for which it was collected).  Typical data security protection capabilities include data discovery and classification,  encryption/decryption of data ‘at rest’, ‘in motion’ or ‘in use’ (including endpoint and  bulk storage data encryption/decryption), digital certificate lifecycle management for  digital signature-based services, privacy enforcement techniques (data masking),  database audit and protection techniques, data loss prevention services and data  destruction and removal and erasure-type services.   Vulnerability management is the process cycle for finding, assessing, remediating  and mitigating security weaknesses. It comprises the policy and scope definition,  proactive identification, remediation, mitigation and ongoing monitoring of security  vulnerabilities via dedicated vulnerability assessment and management products and  services. These services typically scan enterprise networks (IP ranges) and establish a  baseline and trending of vulnerability status of devices, applications and databases;  identify and report on the security configuration of IT assets; discover unmanaged  assets; support specific compliance reporting and control frameworks; support risk  assessment and remediation prioritisation; and support remediation by IT operations  groups which involves scanning (through resident agents on network-attached devices)  of all internal and external facing target applications or devices for vulnerabilities, to  determine if they are at latest available historic patch level. Service typically also  includes periodic penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, asset auto discovery,  generation of patch and vulnerability status compliance reports, vulnerability monitoring  and ticket raising.   Security analytics comprises the ability of the security program via technologies,  processes and people to identify, define, react and remediate against potential or  current or active attacks and the associated threat actors, that may result in system or  service compromise, breaches or data loss events. It is essentially a set of services  delivered by a security operations centre (SOC) or equivalent capability consisting of a  centralised focal point of security specialists where enterprise information systems  (websites, applications, databases, data centres and servers, networks, desktops and  other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended, and action plans devised to  counter any undesirable events detected. Typical security analytics services include  security incident and event log collection, monitoring and management (SIEM),  managed log retention and analysis, user behaviour analytics (UBA), threat intelligence  services, fraud detection and response services, digital forensics and cyber incident  response services.   Application security describes the use of software, hardware, staff and process  methods to provide through life application protection from threats. It therefore  comprises a set of measures built into the application development process to prevent  the unauthorised access, theft, modification or erasure of sensitive data through the  exploitation of applications. Specific examples include: the identification of security  flaws in application design, development, deployment, upgrade, or maintenance  through code assurance techniques such as black box analysis and testing, health  checks, the use of static and dynamic application testing techniques and application  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  83  security frameworks, and/or via data obfuscation, filtering and masking, secure coding  practices and software composition analysis (SCA), etc.   Governance, risk and compliance management generally comprises the set of  practices and processes, supported by a risk-aware culture and enabling technologies,  that improves decision-making and performance through an integrated view of how  well an organisation manages its unique set of risks.  – Security governance is thus defined as a number of ‘cross-functional’ security  activities which include the development and maintenance of security policies,  standards and procedures, the communication of business values, culture and  principles, security strategy and organisation, training and awareness,  documentation and guidance, communication plans, security service metrics,  audit and compliance oversight, financial management of security services,  security vendor management, security PMO etc. obligations. Governance costs  and staffing include the strategic leadership of security standards, policies and  practices, as typically represented by the CISO (or equivalent) and their  immediate office.  – Risk management is defined as the function dedicated to ensuring that adequate  controls are designed and implemented to mitigate the various risks associated  with IT assets (including data), infrastructure and processes. It includes activities  such as periodic and annual IT audits (non-regulatory), risk assessment /  monitoring, issue management and action tracking, and the development and  execution of remediation plans.  – Compliance management is the process of identifying, managing and reporting  compliance activities related to organisational, commercial and regulatory compliance  obligations. Compliance requirements can be derived from internal directives,  procedures and requirements, or from external laws, regulations, standards and  contractual agreements.  B.7 SECURITY ASSET TYPES   Hardware is defined as follows:  – All dedicated hardware assets utilised in support of the security operations, for  each category indicated (i.e. network security, endpoint security, etc.).  – Examples include firewalls, security gateways, security appliances, security  toolset platforms and ID tokens.  – Only annual asset costs that are directly or recognisably related to the defined in-  scope security functions are included. Costs of hardware assets whose prime  purpose is not security are not included. For example, there may be routers  deployed that have firewall, encryption or NIPS capabilities, but any  apportionment of their annual costs cannot be included unless a cost to  specifically enable a security function – such as a firewall ‘add-on’ enabler cost of  extra router hardware or software – can be identified.  – Hosting/facilities/occupancy costs for space dedicated to in-scope security  hardware, such as the apportioned annual costs of hosting security-related  devices, storage arrays and appliances in the data centre, including power / heat  management and raised floor. It also includes the annual cost of any  consumables related to the security activities.   Software is defined as follows:  – Annual licence and maintenance, along with costs associated with new  purchases and upgrades for all software dedicated to operating or managing the  security systems applications for each category of security expenditure.  – Examples include endpoint security suites, identity and access management,  security information and event management and content filtering.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  84  – Only software licence costs that are directly or recognisably related to the defined  in-scope security functions are included. Costs of software whose prime purpose  is not security are excluded.  – For example, there may be enterprise licences for operating systems, productivity  suite software or enterprise packages that have security capabilities (e.g.  BitLocker encryption in WinOS). No apportionment of their annual costs is  included unless a cost to specifically enable a security function can be identified.  An example would be an ‘add-on’ software charge for a security capability or a  specific module licence charge for security functionality (e.g. Oracle Identity  Manager).   Outsourcing is defined as follows:  – Outsourcing is the use of external service providers to effectively deliver IT-  enabled business process, application service and infrastructure solutions for  business outcomes. Outsourcing, which also includes utility services and cloud-  enabled outsourcing, helps clients to develop the right sourcing strategies and  vision, select the right IT service providers, structure the best possible contracts  and govern deals for sustainable win-win relationships with external providers.  Outsourcing can enable enterprises to reduce costs, accelerate time to market  and take advantage of external expertise, assets and/or intellectual property. This  includes:  – fees for third-party or outsourcing contracts primarily comprising services for  managing or monitoring security devices, systems or processes where the  services are provided on-site.  – managed service provider / cloud is defined as: remote subscription-based  monitoring and/or management of security devices such as firewalls,  intrusion detection and prevention functions via customer-premises-based or  network-based devices. It also includes remotely delivered specialist  managed security services such as threat intelligence, SIEM/SOC,  distributed denial of service, etc., and cloud-based security services such as  IDaaS.  – consulting, defined as: security advisory services that help organisations  analyse and improve the efficacy of business operations and technologies  strategies.   Personnel is defined as follows:  – Costs/FTEs include in-house and contract personnel supporting IT operational  infrastructure security, vulnerability management and security analytics,  application security and governance and risk and compliance management.

This report is a follow-up covering all  27 EU Member States and offering additional insights into the allocation of NIS budgets  of OES/DSP, the economic impact of cybersecurity incidents and the organisation of  cybersecurity in these operators. In addition, global cybersecurity market trends are presented  through Gartner security data and insights observed globally and in the EU, in order to provide a  better understanding of the relevant dynamics.  Data was collected through a survey of 947 organisations identified as OES/DSP across the  27 Member States. In this second edition of the report, besides covering all Member States,  additional and complementary questions were asked to the surveyed organisations.  Overall, 48.9 % of surveyed organisations acknowledge a very significant or significant  impact of the NIS Directive on their information security (IS). Other key findings of this  report are as follows.   Almost 50 % of the established OES/DSP within the EU believe that implementing the  NIS Directive has strengthened their detection capabilities, while 26 % believe that it  has strengthened their ability to recover from incidents.   67 % of OES/DSP required a dedicated budget for the NIS Directive implementation,  with a median value of EUR 40 000 or 5.1 % of their overall information security  budgets. Around 50 % of organisations required on median four additional full-time  employees (FTEs) for the implementation, either via recruitment or outsourcing.   The estimated direct cost of a major security incident is EUR 100 000 on median, with  the banking and healthcare sectors experiencing the highest such costs of  EUR 300 000 and EUR 213 000 respectively. The primary cost factors for this figure  include costs related to revenue losses and data recovery or business continuity  management. 9 % of organisations have suffered a major security incident that  impacted external stakeholders.   In 28 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief  Technology Officer (CTO) is responsible for information security while in over 50 % of  cases, the Head of Information Security reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer  (CEO), the Board of Directors (BOD) or the President.   More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP do not possess any form of cyber  insurance, but around 25 % are planning to obtain coverage.   More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP certify their systems and processes.   The majority of the surveyed OES/DSP report that their information security controls  meet or exceed industry standards, with only 5 % reporting that they do not meet those  standards.   The results indicate a strong correlation between a very positive self-perception of  cybersecurity maturity and the existence of cybersecurity certifications for processes,  people and products within an organisation.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investment  2 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/nis-investment https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive)3 represents  the first EU-wide legislation on cybersecurity, with the objective of achieving a high common  level of cybersecurity for all Member States. One of the three pillars of the NIS Directive is the  implementation of risk management and reporting obligations for Operators of Essential  Services (OES) and Digital Service Providers (DSP). Annex II and Annex III of the NIS Directive  identify the following categories of operators/sectors as OES and DSPs respectively:  Table 1: Categories of OES/DSP as defined in the NIS Directive  Categories of OES and DSPs  OES DSPs   Energy (electricity, oil and gas)   Transport (air, rail, water and road)   Banking   Financial market infrastructures   Health   Drinking water supply and distribution   Digital infrastructure   Online marketplace   Online search engine   Cloud computing service  The objective of this report is to document how operators within these sectors invest in  cybersecurity and comply with the objectives set forth in the NIS Directive, and to shed  some light on other aspects such as certification, cyber insurance and organisation of  information security in OES/DSP. In this context, this report could provide additional inputs for  ‘NIS 2’, a proposal for a directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across  the EU that is under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the European  Union.  NIS investment data for this report was collected from two sources.   Chapter 2 (Information security dynamics and outlook), consisting of high-level  insights into the EU cybersecurity market, is based on data drawn from Gartner’s  research databases, combined with additional analysis of the current market  dynamics and the latest forecasts.   Chapter 3 (Information security investments for implementing the directive) is based  on data from a dedicated market survey that focused on the directive and was  conducted on 947 organisations identified as OES/DSP in the EU.  In order to ensure a representative account of all 27 Member States, a minimum of 35  organisations were surveyed per Member State.  Additional information on the survey demographics is available in Annex A.  The target audience of this report is EU and national policymakers. The report may also  provide useful information to OES/DSP as a secondary audience.  3 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  7  2. INFORMATION SECURITY  DYNAMICS AND OUTLOOK  This chapter aims to provide a high-level outline of global information security trends and  outlooks. In order to provide actionable insights, it leverages data and metrics that were  collected and assessed by Gartner, independently from the dedicated survey at hand. The  specific sources of data for the following analysis include:   Gartner IT Key Metrics Data 2021: IT Security Measures4, Worldwide   Gartner Forecast: IT Security and Risk Management, Worldwide, 2020-2025, 2Q21  Update.5  It should be noted that the source of the data for Chapter 2 (Gartner databases) is different  to the source of the data for Chapter 3 (survey). Specifically:   the definitions of the industries referenced in Chapter 2 are not aligned with the  definitions of the OES/DSP sectors in Chapter 3 and set out by the NIS Directive;   the figures provided by Gartner in the IT Key Metrics data 2021 are financial figures  collected for the entire year 2020.  A detailed description of the relevant definitions is available in Annex B.  This data set is presented before the detailed data related to implementing the directive in order  to provide a high-level overview of the global market (including Member States) in terms of  information security investments and to highlight a few key statistics and trends. This broader  view serves as an introduction to the focused analysis presented in Chapter 3 for  OES/DSP in the Member States.  2.1 INFORMATION SECURITY BUDGETS  The data shows that tracking and the corresponding allocation of information security budgets is  still increasing within most organisations and earmarked predominantly for IT security.  Regardless of this positive trend, 38% of the surveyed organisations still did not possess a  distinct information security budget and 62% of these organisations did not effectively  communicate the costs associated with information security to the relevant business units and  process owners.  4 https://www.gartner.com/document/3993567?ref=solrAll&refval=291617539  5 https://www.gartner.com/document/code/752504?ref=authbody&refval=4004647  https://www.gartner.com/document/3993567?ref=solrAll&refval=291617539 https://www.gartner.com/document/code/752504?ref=authbody&refval=4004647  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  8  Figure 1: Overview of information security budgets (2020)  When evaluating the ownership of information security budgets (Figure 2) and the lines of  hierarchical reporting (Figure 3), it must be observed that information security is still widely  recognised as an exclusive IT discipline, without due consideration for the wider business  impact thereof.  Figure 2: Location of information security budgets (2020)  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  9  Figure 3: - Most senior level of reporting by IT security (2020)  2.2 INFORMATION SECURITY SPENDING DISTRIBUTION  Further insights into the specific types of investments can be derived from a breakdown of the  distribution of information security spending across functional security domains6. Following this  approach, Gartner identifies the following categories.   Vulnerability management and security analytics investments focus on establishing  proactive capabilities to minimise the impact of possible breaches once they occur.   Application security encompasses the design, development and operation of a  specific application. Furthermore, application security focuses on the configuration and  deployment of both the application and its supporting components – such as network,  operating system or database – with the objective of ensuring security.   Governance risk and compliance focuses on how organisations mitigate a specific  set of risks through developing strategies, policies, standards and awareness. It strives  to manage risks in an effective and transparent manner while ensuring that legal and  regulatory compliance requirements are met, and information security is embedded  throughout the organisation.   Operational infrastructure security – including network security, identity and access  management, endpoint security and data security – focuses on protecting the network,  the hosts and the data. Furthermore, it aims to guarantee secure and authorised  access to systems.  Relevant data clearly indicates that organisations worldwide dedicate most of their security  spending on the following three functional security domains:   vulnerability management and security analytics, with a share of 20 %;   governance, risk and compliance, with a share of 18 %;   network security, with a share of 16 %.  6 Annex B provides detailed definitions for the security domains referenced in Chapter 2.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  10  Figure 4: IT security spending distribution by functional area (2020)  As illustrated in Figure 5, the year-on-year evolution between 2019 and 2020 shows only marginal  changes in the overall distribution of IT security spending.  Figure 5: IT security spending distribution – year-on-year evolution by functional security domain  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  11  The distribution of IT spending between the different functional security domains has been  relatively stable over the last 5 years. However, spending varies significantly between different  industries, as illustrated in Figure 6.  Figure 6: IT security spending distribution by functional area by industry (2020)  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  12  In terms of IT assets, the main area of spending for information security is personnel (37 %),  followed by software (28 %) and hardware (13 %). The share of external services such as  advisory, outsourcing or cloud-based services is 22 %.  Figure 7: IT security spending distribution by asset class (2020)  Similarly to the distribution by functional security domains, the distribution of spending by asset  class remains relatively stable, despite a slight decrease (– 2 %) in hardware spending in 2020  compared to 2019.  Figure 8: IT security spending distribution – year-on-year evolution by asset class  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  13  2.3 INFORMATION SECURITY STAFFING  As IT continues to develop exponentially, the demand for available and qualified information  security professionals continues to grow. With competition steadily increasing, many  organisations are facing real issues in finding talented people with the necessary skill sets and  experience.  Figure 9: Global trends in information security staffing  In addition to the overall shortage of IT professionals, the increased focus on automation clearly  affects the security skills and qualifications that are in market demand. As such, various skills  that were in high demand during the previous years – such as manual penetration testing, tier  1/2 SOC7 analysis or technology management – are expected to decrease in importance. They  will be gradually replaced by skills in risk management, service management, incident response,  threat intelligence, data science and analysis or coding.  Figure 10: The information security skills landscape dynamics  7 Security Operations Centre  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  14  2.4 INFORMATION SECURITY MARKET OUTLOOK  In terms of market outlook, Gartner’s IT security forecast indicates which solution types are  expected to grow in the coming years. The main area of interest is cloud access security  brokers (33 %), closely followed by vulnerability assessments and web application firewalls at  25 %. Furthermore, access management, application security testing and encryption are  expected to benefit from a 23 % increase in market interest.  Figure 11: IT Security forecast — compound annual growth rate, 2020 – 2025 (%) by solution type  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  15  2.5 SECURITY PERFORMANCE  Despite multiple risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic – such as the new work  environment and environmental, social and governance concerns – information security controls  failure was listed as the top emerging risk within Gartner’s latest Emerging Risks Monitor  Report. To assess the maturity of an organisation, the mere existence of cybersecurity  framework (CSF) controls or tooling does not necessarily imply a high level of cybersecurity  maturity, their performance and effectiveness are more appropriate measures.  Figure 12: Cybersecurity controls – existence vs performance  2.6 FUTURE OF INFORMATION SECURITY  According to Gartner, it is estimated that8:   by 2022, 30 % of all security teams will have increased the number of employees  working remotely on a permanent basis.   by 2025, 40 % of boards of directors will have a dedicated cybersecurity committee  overseen by a qualified board member, up from less than 10% today.   by 2024, 60 % of Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) will establish critical  partnerships with key market-facing executives in sales, finance and marketing, up  from less than 20 % today.   by 2025, 50 % of asset-intensive organisations will converge their cyber, physical and  supply chain security teams under a single Chief Security Officer (CSO) role that  reports directly to the CEO.  8 Gartner Predicts 2021: Cybersecurity Program Management and IT Risk Management ID G00735901 January 2021  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  16  2.7 CISO EFFECTIVENESS  The operating environment of CISOs is becoming more complex. Distributed decision-making  has expanded the volume and variety of information risk decisions to support, while regulators  are approaching data privacy with greater scrutiny and executive teams and boards of directors  are starting to turn their sights toward information risk and its implications for strategic planning.  All of these changes emphasise the need for CISOs to be effective in their roles.  Figure 13: Effectiveness of the CISO role  Based on Gartner Research, only 12 % of CISOs excel in all categories as defined in the CISO  Effectiveness Index.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  17  3. INFORMATION SECURITY  INVESTMENTS FOR THE NIS  DIRECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION  3.1 METHODOLOGY  This study is based on a dedicated market survey conducted among 947 organisations – with a  minimum of 35 per Member State – that were identified as OES/DSP under the NIS Directive.  The quantitative metrics in the survey have been analysed on the basis of median and average  approaches in order for the reader to appreciate both viewpoints.  Although the median value should be regarded as the typical value for an OES/DSP  within a specific sector or country, the average value will often be higher as it is affected  by large organisations (statistical outliers) that do not necessarily reflect the populated  and fragmented market of most of the sectors and countries that were analysed.  The specific market composition of each sector in terms of company size has also been  analysed by categorising the organisations in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs) or large enterprises, based on the EU definition9 (see Chapter 4).  By way of example:   the median value for information security spending amounts to EUR 2 million in 2020  (Section 3.2.2), which implies that a typical OES/DSP within the EU spends around  EUR 2 million in information security yearly;   contrasting this median value, the average information security spending for OES/DSP  in the EU amounts to EUR 10.4 million, but this number is skewed by large  organisations that possess significant budgets dedicated to information security.  With regard to the qualitative metrics in the study, the distribution of the organisations’ answers  has been calculated as a percentage, so as to balance the weight of each answer against the  others.  Finally, additional information and insights on security performance have been derived from the  initial data set by cross-analysing answers from multiple questions (Chapter 5).  9 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  18  3.2 INFORMATION SECURITY AND NIS SPENDING  Key findings  A typical OES/DSP spent on median EUR 30 million on IT in 2020, of which EUR 2 million was earmarked  for information security.  A typical OES/DSP in the EU earmarks on median 7.7 % of its IT investment for information security.  While the banking and energy sectors have the highest IT and information security spending in the EU,  digital infrastructure and cloud computing have the highest information security vs IT spending.  A typical OES/DSP in the EU spends around EUR 40 000 on implementing the requirements of the NIS  directive.  Governance, risk and compliance, network security and vulnerability management are the predominant  areas of investment for the implementation of the directive.  The most procured tools and services are network intrusion detection and prevention, security awareness  and training, vulnerability assessment tooling, security incident and event management, and risk  assessment and business impact analysis.  3.2.1 IT spending  Survey question: What was your organisation’s estimated IT budget/spending in euro for  2020 (including capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) for  hardware, software, internal personnel, contractors and outsourcing spending)?  Figure 14: IT spending  The median IT spending of a typical OES/DSP in the EU was EUR 30 million in 2020, while the  average value of IT spending was EUR 125 million over the same period. While these are  absolute values that have to be interpreted in light of the sector’s structure and company size, a  smaller budget does not necessarily imply a lower level of cybersecurity maturity.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  19  Figure 15: IT spending of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  NB: The map visualisations throughout the report depict data collected from the OES/DSP  surveyed from each Member State. Hence, data on investments refers to average among  surveyed OES/DPS and not Member State investments. In addition, when interpreting these  figures, the market fragmentation / average operator size in each Member State, as well as the  criteria for identifying OES/DSP in each Member State – including OES/DPS size – need to be  factored in.  The survey data indicates that median IT spending is highest (EUR 60 million) within the energy  and banking sectors (EUR 50 million), significantly exceeding IT spending in other sectors as  illustrated in Figure 16. Furthermore, online search engines and digital infrastructure have the  lowest IT spending across all sectors, with a median spending of EUR 1 million.  The map  visualisations  throughout the  report depict  data collected  from the  OES/DSP  surveyed from  each Member  State.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  20  Figure 16: IT spending by sector  3.2.2 Information security spending  Survey question: What was your organisation’s estimated information security  budget/spending in euro for 2020 (including CAPEX and OPEX for hardware, software,  internal personnel, contractors and outsourcing spending)?  Figure 17: Information security spending  The survey data indicates that the median spending for information security of a typical  OES/DSP in the EU was EUR 2 million in 2020, while the average spending was  EUR 10.4 million.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  21  Figure 18: Information security spending of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  In a manner similar to the total IT spending, the banking sector (EUR 4 million) and the energy  sector (EUR 3 million) account for the highest median spending per sector. Moreover, the  information security spend of digital infrastructure and online search engine companies is the  lowest, amounting to a median spending below EUR 100 000.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  22  Figure 19: Information security spending by sector  3.2.3 Information security spending as a share of IT spending  In order to determine the importance of information security spending in a typical OES/DSP, the  relative share of information security spending against overall IT spending was calculated and is  depicted in Figure 20.  Figure 20: Information security spending as a share of IT spending  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  23  As per the median value, a typical OES/DSP in the EU earmarks 7.7 % of its IT investments for  information security, while the average value is 8.8 %.  Figure 21: Information security spending as a share of IT spending of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  Digital infrastructure has the highest information security vs IT spending (10 %), followed closely  by cloud computing (9 %) and online marketplaces (8.7 %). Drinking water supply and  distribution, energy and transport bring up the rear, with values of information security vs IT  spending lower than 7 %.  Even though the energy and banking sectors have a higher IT and Information security  spending in absolute figures, their respective shares of information security vs IT spending are  lower than most other sectors.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  24  Figure 22: Information security spending as a share of IT spending by sector  3.2.4 NIS Directive spending  Survey question: What was your organisation’s estimated budget dedicated to the NIS  Directive implementation (e.g. including CAPEX and OPEX for hardware, software,  infrastructure, business continuity, internal personnel, contractors and outsourcing  spending)?  Out of 947 respondents, 775 (approx. 82 %) organisations have implemented the NIS Directive,  while 635 (67 %) organisations require additional budget to implement all its requirements.  Furthermore, 172 (approx. 18 %) organisations have not yet implemented the NIS Directive.  Figure 23: Implementation of the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  25  Figure 24: Budget allocated to implementing the NIS Directive  As per the median value, a typical OES/DSP in the EU spends EUR 40 000 on implementing  the NIS Directive, while on average the spending amounts to EUR 98 000.  Figure 25: Budget allocated to implementing the NIS Directive for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  26  The survey results indicate that a typical OES/DSP from the energy sector has allocated the  highest budget to achieve implementation, with a median spending of EUR 66 000, closely  followed by organisations in the banking sector with a median spending of EUR 65 000 for  implementation. Drinking water supply and distribution, financial market infrastructures and  digital infrastructure have allocated the lowest budgets to achieve compliance, with a median  spending of just EUR 25 000.  Figure 26: Budget allocated to implementing the NIS Directive by sector  3.2.5 NIS spending as a share of information security spending  In order to determine the impact of NIS spending in a typical OES/DSP, we calculated the relative  share of NIS spending against overall information security spending, as illustrated in Figure 27.  Figure 27: NIS spending as a share of total information security spending  As per the median value, the typical spending on implementing the NIS directive within an  OES/DSP amounts to 5.1 % of their overall information security spending, while the average  value is 10.5 %.

Network security and vulnerability management has also seen investments from a large  number of organisations, with 357 of them investing in network security and 316 investing in  vulnerability management.  On the contrary, business continuity management has seen little investment in the context of  NIS implementation, with only 69 organisations identifying this security domain in their top three  domains.  Survey question: What are the top three security domains where your organisation  invested the most to implement the NIS Directive?  Figure 30: Security domains for implementing the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  29  3.2.7 Technologies and services procured for the NIS Directive  The technology and services associated with network intrusion detection and prevention  were the most procured in the context of NIS implementation, with 257 organisations reporting  procurements in this domain.  This domain – along with security awareness and training (222 responses), vulnerability  assessment tooling (221 responses), security incident and event management (219  responses) and risk assessment and business impact analysis (217 responses) – is one of  the five main technologies and services that were procured in the context of NIS  implementation.  Survey question: Which of the following technologies or services did you procure  because of the NIS directive implementation?  Figure 31: Technologies and services procured for implementing the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  30  3.3 INFORMATION SECURITY AND NIS STAFFING  Key findings  A typical OES/DSP employs on median 60 IT FTEs, of which seven are dedicated information security  FTEs.  Almost 50 % of the established OES/DSP within the EU hire contractors to support their information  security workforce.  Almost 50 % of the established OES/DSP within the EU hired new staff members in the context of  implementing the directive, with a median of four FTEs per sector.  A typical OES/DSP in the EU employs on median two dedicated FTEs for incident response.  3.3.1 IT FTEs  There are large discrepancies in the total number of IT FTEs in OES/DSP among the Member  States. Median values range from over 400 IT employees in Italy to 20 employees in Latvia or  Slovenia. Whereas these are total values – possibly reflecting the underlying sector structure  and company size – a lower number of FTEs does not necessarily imply a lower level of security  maturity. The data shows a disparity between the median and average values, which indicates  that most organisations employ a low number of FTEs while larger organisations engage a  substantial number of IT FTEs.  Survey question: What was your organisation's estimated number of IT FTEs for 2020  including internal staff and contractors?  Figure 32: IT FTEs  The survey data indicates that a typical OES/DSP in Italy and France has the highest number of  IT FTEs, with median values of 420 and 350 FTEs respectively.  However, these figures must be read with due regard for the structure of the sector and the size  of the organisations surveyed for each Member State. For instance, French OES/DSP have the  highest average number of employees.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  31  Figure 33: IT FTEs of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  As illustrated in Figure 34, there are large discrepancies in the number of IT FTEs across  sectors. For example, the banking sector has the largest median value of 200 FTEs, which is  15 % higher than the median value of the transport sector, which employs 167 IT FTEs on  median. However, online search engines and digital infrastructure have a significantly lower  median value of seven IT FTEs.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  32  Figure 34: IT FTEs by sector  3.3.2 Information security FTEs  Survey question: What was your organisation's estimated number of information security  FTEs for 2020 including internal staff and contractors?  Figure 35: Information security FTEs  As with the overall discrepancy of IT FTEs, the distribution of information security FTEs follows  a similar trend. With 45 FTEs, organisations from France have the highest median value in the  EU, followed by organisations from Italy and Germany, with 35 and 30 FTEs respectively.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  33  Figure 36: Information security FTEs for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  As illustrated in Figure 37, the banking sector has the highest number of information security  FTEs, with a median value of 17 FTEs in 2020, followed by the healthcare and transport  sectors, with 14 and 12 FTEs respectively. With two FTEs, the digital infrastructure and online  search engine sectors have the lowest median number of information security FTEs.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  34  Figure 37: Information security FTEs by sector  3.3.3 Share of contractors in information security FTEs  The survey data indicates that 357 (37.7 %) organisations have not hired any contractors in  support of their information security workforce, while 436 (46.04 %) organisations report having  contractors among their information security FTEs.  Survey question: Please indicate the percentage of information security FTEs that are  contractors.  Figure 38: Contractors in information security FTEs  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  35  Figure 39: Contractors in information security FTEs for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  The digital infrastructure and online search engine sectors use the most contractors, amounting  to 50 % of the overall information security workforce. For the other sectors, the median value  fluctuates between 20 % and 30 %.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  36  Figure 40: Contractors in information security FTEs by sector  3.3.4 Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs  In order to determine the importance of information security FTEs in a typical OES/DSP, the  relative share of these FTEs against the overall IT FTEs was calculated and is depicted in  Figure 41.  Figure 41: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs  As per the median value, the typical percentage of information security FTEs against the overall  IT FTEs amounts to 13 % for OES/DSP in the EU, with an average of 17 %.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  37  Figure 42: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs for OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  The online search engine sector has the highest information security to IT FTEs ratio, with a  median value of 33.3 %, while digital infrastructures follows closely with a median value of  28.6 %. The information security to IT FTEs ratio is lowest for the transport sector, with a  median value of 10 %.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  38  Figure 43: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs by sector  3.3.5 Specific hires for NIS implementation  While 49 % of the surveyed organisations did not hire any new staff in the context of their NIS  implementation, 32 % of organisations said they had used external contractors or third parties  for their implementation programmes.  Survey question: Did your organisation hire additional internal security staff (not  contractors) specifically to implement the NIS Directive?  Figure 44: Information security hires related to implementing the NIS Directive  None of the organisations answering for Malta and Latvia have hired information security FTEs  for implementing the NIS Directive.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  39  Figure 45: Information security hires related to implementing the NIS Directive for OES/DSP surveyed per  Member State  When analysing the survey data from a sector perspective, the healthcare sector has the  highest median value of five FTEs hired to ensure the implementation of the NIS Directive.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  40  Figure 46: Information security hires related to the implementing the NIS Directive by sector  3.3.6 FTEs dedicated to security incident response  Survey question: In 2020, how many FTEs (internal staff and/or contractors) are fully  dedicated to information security incident response activities in your organisation?  Figure 47: Information security FTEs for security incident response  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  41  Figure 48: Information security FTEs for security incident response for OES/DSP surveyed  per Member State  The banking sector has the highest median value of FTEs associated with incident  management (three FTEs), while the other sectors employ one or two dedicated FTEs.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  42  Figure 49: Information security FTEs for security incident response by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  43  3.4 INFORMATION SECURITY INCIDENTS  Key findings  The estimated direct cost of a major security incident for a typical OES/DSP is EUR 100 000 on median.  The costs related to revenue losses and data recovery or business continuity management are the  predominant costs in the context of a major security incident.  Almost 50 % of surveyed OES/DSP indicate that the number of security incidents they are experiencing  remains stable.  In 2020, only 8.8 % of surveyed OES/DSP experienced a major security incident.  Almost 50 % of surveyed OES/DSP believe that the NIS implementation has strengthened their detection  capabilities, while 26 % believe that it has strengthened their ability to recover from incidents.  3.4.1 Cost of information security incidents  While 67.8 % of the 947 surveyed organisations declared that they had not experienced a  major security incident so far, 8.7 % agreed to share the costs related to their last major  security incident and 23.3 % refused to share this information.  Survey question: What are the estimated direct costs incurred by the last major  information security incident experienced by your organisation?  Figure 50: Has your organisation experienced a major security incident  For the 82 organisations that declared the costs associated with their latest major information  security incident, the direct cost of a security incident for an OES/DSP was EUR 100 000, while  the average cost was EUR 169 000.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  44  Figure 51: Estimated direct costs of a major cybersecurity incidents  The banking and healthcare sectors experience the highest costs associated with security  incidents, with median values of EUR 300 000 and EUR 213 000 respectively.  Figure 52: Estimated direct costs of a major cybersecurity incident by sector  3.4.2 Top components of incident costs  With 404 organisations reporting losses of revenue and 378 organisations reporting costs  related to data recovery / business continuity management, these components form the  principal direct costs related to a security incident.  Survey question: What are the top two components of the direct costs associated with  major information security incidents?  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  45  Figure 53: Top two components of direct cybersecurity incident costs  3.4.3 Trend in security incidents  The number of information security incidents has remained stable in almost half of the  organisations (49.2 %). Be that as it may, 39 % of organisations report that the number of  information security incidents has risen by over 10 %, while 7.18 % of organisations have  experienced an increase of over 30 %. Only 43 (4.5 %) organisations report that the number of  information security incidents has declined: 3.4 % of organisations reported a reduction of 10 %  or more and 1.1 % of organisations reported a reduction of 30 % or more.  Survey question: How do you evaluate the year-on-year evolution of the number of  information security incidents that your organisation is facing?  Figure 54: Trend in the number of information security incidents year-on-year  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  46  3.4.4 Spread of security incidents  Approximately 9 % of organisations have suffered a major security incident that impacted  external stakeholders – such as customers or partners – within their business ecosystem.  Survey question: In 2020, did your organisation suffer a major security incident  impacting other organisations in your ecosystem (customers, partners)?  Figure 55: Spread of information security incidents  A detailed breakdown per sector indicates that the risk of a major security incident is  comparable in the different verticals and varies between 5 and 15 %. Cloud computing is the  sector with the highest probability of security incidents – approximately 15 % – whereas the  banking sector experiences the lowest spread of security incidents.  Figure 56: Spread of information security incidents by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  47  3.4.5 Security incident response sourcing  59 % of organisations have internal incident response capabilities at their disposal, while around  20 % combine both internal and outsourced capabilities. Furthermore, 21 % of organisations  have completely outsourced these capabilities.  Survey question: What is your organisation's sourcing strategy for information security  incident response capabilities?  Figure 57: Security incident response sourcing  3.4.6 NIS impact on incident response  49 % of organisations believe that the implementation of the NIS Directive has directly  bolstered their detection capabilities and 26 % reported the strengthening of recovery  capabilities due to the implementation of the NIS Directive. Nonetheless, 14 % of  organisations did not observe any particular benefit after the implementation of the NIS Directive.  Survey question: How has the implementation of the NIS Directive helped your  organisation mitigate the impact of the information security incidents?  Figure 58: Impact of implementing the NIS Directive  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  48  3.5 SECURITY ORGANISATION AND PERFORMANCE  Key findings  In 28 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the CIO or CTO is responsible for information security.  In over 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the HIS reports directly to the CEO, the BOD or the President.  More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP do not possess any form of cyber insurance, although around  25 % are planning to obtain coverage.  More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP certify their systems and processes (e.g. on the basis of the  International Organisation for Standardisation’s ISO 27001 certification).  The majority of the surveyed OES/DSP report that their information security controls meet industry  standards, with only 5 % reporting that they do not meet those standards.  3.5.1 Reporting line of information security  The Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are responsible for  information security in over 28 % of the surveyed organisations. Moreover, the CISO is the most  senior-level person responsible for information security in 22 % of the surveyed OES/DSP.  Survey question: What is the role in your organisation of the most senior-level person  dedicated exclusively to information security?  Figure 59: Head of information security  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  49  Figure 60: Head of information security by sector  As illustrated in Figure 61, the head of information security generally reports directly to the CEO  or Board of directors (BOD), with 55.86 % of organisations having a direct line of reporting from  the head of information security to the CEO.  Survey question: Who does the head of information security directly report to?  Figure 61: Reporting line of information security  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  50  Figure 62: Reporting line of information security by sector  3.5.2 Cyber insurance  Over 57 % of organisations have not subscribed to a cyber insurance solution. While  21.01 % of organisations have subscribed to a solution that encompasses both direct incurred  losses and third-party losses, 181 organisations only cover direct losses while 2.75 % of  organisations only cover third-party losses.  Furthermore, 23.23 % of organisations reported that they currently do not subscribe to any  cyber insurance solution, but are planning to implement one.  Survey question: Did your organisation subscribe to a dedicated cyber insurance  solution?  Figure 63: Cyber insurance subscriptions  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  51  Figure 64: Cyber insurance subscriptions by sector  3.5.3 Certification  A majority of organisations (51.1 %) certify their systems and processes, e.g. on the basis of  ISO 27001 certification. Furthermore, 17.5 % of organisations reported that they certify their  staff with certifications such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).  Survey question: Does the organisation have information security related certification for  processes, systems or staff?  Figure 65: Certifications  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  52  3.5.4 Performance of controls  68.2 % of organisations are convinced that their information security controls meet industry  standards. Moreover, 27.8 % of organisations believe their information security controls are  above (23.7 %) or far above (4.1 %) industry security standards. On the other hand, 38  organisations (almost 5 %) believe that their information security controls do not meet industry  standards.  Survey question: How would you evaluate the overall performance (effectiveness) of  your organisation's information security controls?  Figure 66: Overall performance (effectiveness) of your organisation’s information security controls  Figure 67: Overall performance (effectiveness) of your organisation’s IS controls by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  53  3.6 PERCEPTION OF THE IMPACT OF THE NIS DIRECTIVE  Key findings  Almost 50% of the surveyed OES/DSPs consider that the NIS Directive had a significant or very significant  impact on their security posture.  A majority of the organisations that have implemented the NIS Directive report a corresponding  positive impact on their security posture. Specifically, 9.8 % of organisations report that they  have experienced a very significant impact, while 39.1 % report a significant impact.  Survey question: Please evaluate the positive impact of the NIS directive on your  organisation’s security posture or maturity.

INFORMATION SECURITY  DATA FOR SMES AND LARGE  ENTERPRISES  In line with the EU definition of SMEs10  – based on revenues or employee count – the survey  results have been further refined by classifying all organisations within these categories.  This chapter illustrates the results of the survey on the basis of organisation category.  4.1 DEMOGRAPHICS OF SMES AND LARGE ENTERPRISES  4.1.1 Distribution of SMEs and large enterprises  The share of SMEs in the survey data amounts to approximatively 23 %, whereas large  enterprises compose 77 % of the data set.  Figure 70: Distribution of SMEs and Large Enterprises  10 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/sme-definition_en  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  56  4.1.2 SMEs vs large enterprises by sector  The surveyed organisations have varying compositions depending on their operating sector. For  instance, the online search engine and digital infrastructures sectors are composed mainly of  SMEs, whereas these verticals are less mature and thus more fragmented than other traditional  sectors.  Because of their mature and consolidated nature, the energy and banking sectors are mostly  composed of large enterprises.  As stated earlier in the report, the size of the organisations within a certain sector has a direct  influence on most of the collected data. For this reason, we have further normalised the  collected data.  Figure 71: Large enterprises vs SME by sector  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  57  4.1.3 SMEs vs large enterprises by Member State  The OES/DSP sectors are highly consolidated in Italy (97.1 %), Germany (94.3 %) and France  (91.4 %). On the other hand, OES/DSP organisations include a high number of SMEs in Malta  (51.4 %), Cyprus (48.6 %) and Croatia (31.4 %).  Figure 72: Large Enterprises vs SME categorisation of OES/DSP surveyed per Member State  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  58  4.2 INFORMATION SECURITY SPENDING FOR SMES AND LARGE ENTERPRISES  4.2.1 IT spending  A typical SME spends approximately EUR 1 million on IT-related investments, whereas large  enterprises spend around EUR 35 million.  Figure 73: IT spending – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.2.2 Information security spending  A typical SME spends approximately EUR 100 000 on information security, whereas large  enterprises spend around EUR 2 million.  Figure 74: Information security spending – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  59  4.2.3 Information security spending as a share of IT spending  A typical SME allocated approximately 8.6 % of its IT spending to information security, whereas  this figure stands at 7 % for large enterprises.  Figure 75: Information security spending as a share of IT spending – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.2.4 NIS budget  A typical SME earmarked approximately EUR 18 000 for implementing the NIS directive,  whereas large enterprises allocated around EUR 54 000.  Figure 76: NIS budget – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  60  4.3 INFORMATION SECURITY STAFFING FOR SMES AND LARGE ENTERPRISES  4.3.1 IT FTEs for SMEs vs large enterprises  Within the sectors that were identified by the NIS Directive, a typical SME employed four FTEs  whereas a large enterprise employed 120 dedicated IT FTEs.  Figure 77: IT FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.3.2 Information security FTEs for SMEs vs large enterprises  Within the sectors that were identified by the NIS directive, a typical SME employed one FTE,  whereas a large enterprise employed 12 dedicated information security FTEs.  Figure 78: Information security FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  61  4.3.3 Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs for SMEs vs large  enterprises  A typical SME allocated approximately 33 % of its IT FTEs to information security, whereas this  figure stands at 11 % for large enterprises.  Figure 79: Information security FTEs as a share of IT FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.3.4 Incident response FTEs for SMEs vs large enterprises  Within the sectors that were identified by the NIS Directive, a typical SME employed one FTE  whereas a large enterprise employed two dedicated FTEs for incident response.  Figure 80: Incident response FTEs – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  62  4.4 SECURITY PERFORMANCE FOR SMES VS LARGE ENTERPRISES  According to the data that was collected in the self-assessment, approximately 65 % of large  enterprises and 78 % of SMEs consider themselves to meet industry requirements.  We can see a clear discrepancy between SMEs and large enterprises with regards to their self-  perceived security performance: only around 10 % of SMEs perceive their information security  performance as at least ‘Above industry standards’, compared to 32.7 % of large enterprises.  On the other hand, approximately 12.3 % of the SMEs answered that their information security  performance is ‘Below’ or ‘Far below industry standards’, compared to only 2.1 % for the large  enterprises.  Figure 81: Security performance – SMEs vs large enterprises  4.5 CYBER INSURANCE FOR SMEs VS LARGE ENTERPRISES  The share of SMEs having subscribed to a cyber insurance policy (either for third-party losses  or direct losses incurred or both) is around 16 %, compared to 51 % of the large enterprises.  Figure 82: Cyber insurance – SMEs vs large enterprises  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  63  5. ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS  FROM SELF-ASSESSMENT  By leveraging the data that was collected in this survey, we identified specific practices that  influence information security performance (based on a self-assessment of the interviewee).  Survey question: How would you evaluate the overall performance (effectiveness) of  your organisation's information security controls?  5.1 INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH SELF-ASSESSED SECURITY  MATURITY  In order to identify indicators of information security performance, we isolated and assessed the  responses from the organisations that consider their information security performance as ‘Far  above industry standards’ within the self-assessment.  Table 2: Correlation between best practices and security performance  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  64  5.2 INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW SELF-ASSESSED SECURITY  MATURITY  In a similar manner, we isolated and assessed the responses from the organisations that  consider their security maturity as ‘Below industry standard’ within the self-assessment to define  certain inadvisable practices.  Table 3: Correlation between inadvisable practices and cyber maturity  5.3 INFORMATION SECURITY SPENDING  A thorough analysis of the survey data showed that no distinctive manipulator of information  security or share of information security / IT spending could be found in the data set.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  65  6. CONCLUSIONS  This report offers interesting insights into how OES/DSP invest their cybersecurity budgets, both  in the context of implementing the NIS Directive, but also from a broader perspective.  Furthermore, it examines many additional aspects of cybersecurity for OES/DSP – including the  cost of incidents and its key components – and how cybersecurity is organised in terms of  reporting lines, cyber insurance products, certifications and more. Most importantly, this report  builds on the work done in the previous year by ENISA on the topic and expands the data set to  cover all 27 Member States.  A summary of the main findings and conclusions is presented below.  On a global level, information security budgets seem to be increasing, although information  security is still widely recognised as an exclusive IT discipline. Cloud access security brokers,  vulnerability assessments and web application firewalls are the market segments that are  expected to grow most over the next few years. Skills shortages persist as an issue for  information security staffing: skills in risk management, service management, incident response,  threat intelligence, data science / analysis and coding are all expected to be in growing demand  in the near future.  Global trends also indicate a shift of focus to the effectiveness of security controls and  capabilities – not just on the verification of their existence. CISO effectiveness across all  required domains should also be emphasised: it is estimated that by 2025, 40 % of boards of  directors will have a dedicated cybersecurity committee, up from less than 10 % today.  The median IT budget for OES/DSP in 2020 was EUR 30 million, of which EUR 2 million was  earmarked for information security. OES/DSP in the EU earmarked on median 7.7 % of their IT  investments for information security.  The NIS Directive has been implemented by 82 % of surveyed organisations, with 67 %  requiring an additional budget for its implementation. OES/DSP spent a median sum of  EUR 40 000 on implementing the NIS Directive, while average spending was EUR 98 000.  OES/DSP from the energy sector allocated the highest budget to achieve implementation, with  a median spending of EUR 66 000.  OES/DSP employ on median 60 IT FTEs, seven of whom are dedicated information security  FTEs. Almost 50 % of OES/DSP hired new staff in the context of the NIS Directive  implementation, with a median of four FTEs per sector.  The estimated direct cost of a major security incident is EUR 100 000 on median. The  primary cost factors are related to revenue losses and data recovery or business continuity  management. 9 % of the organisations have suffered a major security incident that impacted  external stakeholders. The banking and healthcare sectors experienced the highest cost  associated with security incidents, with median values of EUR 300 000 and EUR 213 000  respectively.  Almost 50 % of surveyed OES/DSP believe that implementing NIS has strengthened their  detection capabilities, while 26 % believe that it has strengthened their ability to recover  from incidents.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  66  In 28 % of the surveyed OES/DSP, the CIO or the CTO is responsible for information security,  while in over 50 % of cases, the head of information security reports directly to the CEO, the  BOD or the President.  More than 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP do not possess any form of cyber insurance,  however around 25 % are planning to obtain coverage. At the same time, more than 50 % of  OES/DSP certify their systems and processes.  The majority of the surveyed OES/DSP report that their information security controls meet or  exceed industry standards, with only 5 % reporting that they do not meet these standards.  Almost 50 % of the surveyed OES/DSP consider that the NIS Directive has had a  significant or very significant impact on their security posture.  The report also examines the relationship between the self-perceived cybersecurity maturity of  surveyed organisations and the different parameters covered in the document, such as NIS  investments, reporting lines for information security, cyber insurance and certifications. This is  an attempt to identify indications about which elements may be more closely associated with  OES/DSP cybersecurity maturity. The results indicate a strong correlation between a very  positive self-perception of cybersecurity maturity and the existence of cybersecurity  certifications for processes, people and products. Organisations that certify their staff and  systems and buy products with cybersecurity certifications are 36.36 % more likely to self-  assess their cybersecurity maturity as ‘Far above industry standards’. However, this is  simply a correlation of data and does not necessarily imply causation.  The data and accompanying analysis presented in this report will hopefully provide useful  evidence to support policy discussions around the NIS Directive and the ‘NIS 2’ proposal  currently under discussion, as well as contribute to further policy reflections. Moreover, this  report builds on the work done in the previous year and provides an expanded scope and  additional streamlining of how the NIS investments data is presented, which can be used to  establish a historical tracking of this data over the next years.

B.1 MEDIAN AND AVERAGE DEFINITIONS  Median: the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample,  a population or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as ‘the middle  value’.  The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply  described as the ‘average’) is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or  small values, and therefore provides a better representation of a ‘typical’ value.  Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a ‘typical’ income is,  because income distribution can be very skewed.  Average or arithmetic mean: the arithmetic mean is the sum of all measurements divided by  the number of observations in the data set.  Table 11: Median and average definitions  Type Description Example Result  Arithmetic  mean  Sum of the values of a data set  divided by the number of values  (1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 9) / 7 4  Median  Middle value separating the  greater and lesser halves of a  data set  1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 3  B.2 CAGR DEFINITION  The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the annualised average rate of revenue growth  between 2 given years, assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate. The  CAGR between given years X and Z, where Z – X = N, is the number of years between the  2 given years, is calculated as follows.   CAGR, year X to year Z = [(value in year Z/value in year X) ^ (1/N)-1]   For example, the CAGR for 2006 to 2011 is calculated as: CAGR, 2006 to 2011 (X =  2006, Z = 2011, N = 5) = [(value in 2011/value in 2006) ^ (1/5)-1]  B.3 SME DEFINITION  The main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME are:   staff headcount,   either turnover or balance sheet total.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  76  Table 12: SME definitions  Company category Staff headcount Turnover or Balance sheet total  Medium-sized < 250 ≤ € 50 m ≤ € 43 m  Small < 50 ≤ € 10 m ≤ € 10 m  Micro < 10 ≤ € 2 m ≤ € 2 m  B.4 FINANCIALS   Operational expense is defined as the total expense associated with the business  units supported by the IT organisation. This includes items such as selling, general and  administrative expenses, cost of goods sold (or cost of revenue), research and  development, depreciation and depletion and amortisation expenses. For insurance,  this includes underwriting expenses, loss and loss-adjustment expenses. For banking  organisations, it includes interest expenses and noninterest expenses. For government  and non-profit organisations, it is represented by the enterprise operating budget.   Total IT spending is defined as total spending at the end of the 12-month budget  period for IT to support the enterprise. IT spending/budget can come from anywhere in  the enterprise that incurs IT costs and is not limited to the IT organisation. It includes  estimates by enterprises of decentralised IT spending and or ‘shadow IT’. It is  calculated on an annualised ‘cash flow view’ basis and therefore contains capital  spending and operational expenses, but not depreciation or amortisation.

NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  81  B.6 IT SECURITY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK  Figure 93: IT security analysis framework   Identity and access management is the discipline that enables the right individuals to  access the right resources at the right times and for the right reasons. It comprises a  set of practices, processes and technology responsible for the management of digital  identities and their associated access to resources. Specific related activities are: user  account provisioning, password management, user access administration (e.g.  changes in roles, position or status), directory integration, single sign-on, active  directory, remote access services, strong or multi factor authentication / two-factor /  three-factor, hard and soft token-based authentication services, public key  infrastructure and federation-type services, privileged user management, identity and  access governance (including the processes for user access certification/re-  certification, attestation, application access audits, etc.) and cloud-based identity  services (e.g. IDaaS).   Network security comprises measures taken to protect a communication pathway  from unauthorised access to, and accidental or wilful interference with, regular  operations, and hence involves protecting computers and computer networks from  attack and infiltration. Network security provides network protection through the  restricting of network traffic, based on a set of policy-defined rules. Network security  provides protection at key ingress and egress points in the form of perimeters,  segments and zones, typically defined and enforced by firewalls/NGFWs/firewall  administration, wireless access firewalls/RASP, network intrusion detection and  prevention, virtual private networking concentrators, hardware security modules, proxy  servers, secure email and/or web gateways, unified threat management appliances,  network access control services and distributed denial of service protection and  prevention services.   Endpoint security is a set of capabilities and services provisioned across devices and  platforms to provide the required and expected level of protection against potential  compromise resulting from inappropriate configuration, use or attack(s). It covers the  security services, capabilities and associated management and support thereof used in  the protection of all endpoint devices such as desktops, servers, laptops and mobile  devices which users leverage to access corporate data and information. Specific  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  82  examples would typically include antivirus/anti-spyware/anti-malware software on PCs  and servers, mobile device management, device encryption and management, host  intrusion detection and prevention, hardware-based protection (e.g. personal firewalls),  advanced anti-malware and threat detection software and also any physical security  control in place for these assets (e.g. locks).   Data security ensures confidence in the ability of users, systems and business  processes to provide the required and expected level of protection from data  compromise or loss of data fidelity resulting from system compromise or failure, or  inappropriate user behaviour with regard to data in whatever stage of its lifecycle. It  focuses on confidentiality (to protect against unauthorised or inappropriate access),  integrity (to ensure data is not improperly changed or deleted), availability (to ensure  appropriate access to data for the right parties) and privacy (to assure personal  information is only used for the specific business purpose for which it was collected).  Typical data security protection capabilities include data discovery and classification,  encryption/decryption of data ‘at rest’, ‘in motion’ or ‘in use’ (including endpoint and  bulk storage data encryption/decryption), digital certificate lifecycle management for  digital signature-based services, privacy enforcement techniques (data masking),  database audit and protection techniques, data loss prevention services and data  destruction and removal and erasure-type services.   Vulnerability management is the process cycle for finding, assessing, remediating  and mitigating security weaknesses. It comprises the policy and scope definition,  proactive identification, remediation, mitigation and ongoing monitoring of security  vulnerabilities via dedicated vulnerability assessment and management products and  services. These services typically scan enterprise networks (IP ranges) and establish a  baseline and trending of vulnerability status of devices, applications and databases;  identify and report on the security configuration of IT assets; discover unmanaged  assets; support specific compliance reporting and control frameworks; support risk  assessment and remediation prioritisation; and support remediation by IT operations  groups which involves scanning (through resident agents on network-attached devices)  of all internal and external facing target applications or devices for vulnerabilities, to  determine if they are at latest available historic patch level. Service typically also  includes periodic penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, asset auto discovery,  generation of patch and vulnerability status compliance reports, vulnerability monitoring  and ticket raising.   Security analytics comprises the ability of the security program via technologies,  processes and people to identify, define, react and remediate against potential or  current or active attacks and the associated threat actors, that may result in system or  service compromise, breaches or data loss events. It is essentially a set of services  delivered by a security operations centre (SOC) or equivalent capability consisting of a  centralised focal point of security specialists where enterprise information systems  (websites, applications, databases, data centres and servers, networks, desktops and  other endpoints) are monitored, assessed, and defended, and action plans devised to  counter any undesirable events detected. Typical security analytics services include  security incident and event log collection, monitoring and management (SIEM),  managed log retention and analysis, user behaviour analytics (UBA), threat intelligence  services, fraud detection and response services, digital forensics and cyber incident  response services.   Application security describes the use of software, hardware, staff and process  methods to provide through life application protection from threats. It therefore  comprises a set of measures built into the application development process to prevent  the unauthorised access, theft, modification or erasure of sensitive data through the  exploitation of applications. Specific examples include: the identification of security  flaws in application design, development, deployment, upgrade, or maintenance  through code assurance techniques such as black box analysis and testing, health  checks, the use of static and dynamic application testing techniques and application  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  83  security frameworks, and/or via data obfuscation, filtering and masking, secure coding  practices and software composition analysis (SCA), etc.   Governance, risk and compliance management generally comprises the set of  practices and processes, supported by a risk-aware culture and enabling technologies,  that improves decision-making and performance through an integrated view of how  well an organisation manages its unique set of risks.  – Security governance is thus defined as a number of ‘cross-functional’ security  activities which include the development and maintenance of security policies,  standards and procedures, the communication of business values, culture and  principles, security strategy and organisation, training and awareness,  documentation and guidance, communication plans, security service metrics,  audit and compliance oversight, financial management of security services,  security vendor management, security PMO etc. obligations. Governance costs  and staffing include the strategic leadership of security standards, policies and  practices, as typically represented by the CISO (or equivalent) and their  immediate office.  – Risk management is defined as the function dedicated to ensuring that adequate  controls are designed and implemented to mitigate the various risks associated  with IT assets (including data), infrastructure and processes. It includes activities  such as periodic and annual IT audits (non-regulatory), risk assessment /  monitoring, issue management and action tracking, and the development and  execution of remediation plans.  – Compliance management is the process of identifying, managing and reporting  compliance activities related to organisational, commercial and regulatory compliance  obligations. Compliance requirements can be derived from internal directives,  procedures and requirements, or from external laws, regulations, standards and  contractual agreements.  B.7 SECURITY ASSET TYPES   Hardware is defined as follows:  – All dedicated hardware assets utilised in support of the security operations, for  each category indicated (i.e. network security, endpoint security, etc.).  – Examples include firewalls, security gateways, security appliances, security  toolset platforms and ID tokens.  – Only annual asset costs that are directly or recognisably related to the defined in-  scope security functions are included. Costs of hardware assets whose prime  purpose is not security are not included. For example, there may be routers  deployed that have firewall, encryption or NIPS capabilities, but any  apportionment of their annual costs cannot be included unless a cost to  specifically enable a security function – such as a firewall ‘add-on’ enabler cost of  extra router hardware or software – can be identified.  – Hosting/facilities/occupancy costs for space dedicated to in-scope security  hardware, such as the apportioned annual costs of hosting security-related  devices, storage arrays and appliances in the data centre, including power / heat  management and raised floor. It also includes the annual cost of any  consumables related to the security activities.   Software is defined as follows:  – Annual licence and maintenance, along with costs associated with new  purchases and upgrades for all software dedicated to operating or managing the  security systems applications for each category of security expenditure.  – Examples include endpoint security suites, identity and access management,  security information and event management and content filtering.  NIS INVESTMENTS  November 2021  84  – Only software licence costs that are directly or recognisably related to the defined  in-scope security functions are included. Costs of software whose prime purpose  is not security are excluded.  – For example, there may be enterprise licences for operating systems, productivity  suite software or enterprise packages that have security capabilities (e.g.  BitLocker encryption in WinOS). No apportionment of their annual costs is  included unless a cost to specifically enable a security function can be identified.  An example would be an ‘add-on’ software charge for a security capability or a  specific module licence charge for security functionality (e.g. Oracle Identity  Manager).   Outsourcing is defined as follows:  – Outsourcing is the use of external service providers to effectively deliver IT-  enabled business process, application service and infrastructure solutions for  business outcomes. Outsourcing, which also includes utility services and cloud-  enabled outsourcing, helps clients to develop the right sourcing strategies and  vision, select the right IT service providers, structure the best possible contracts  and govern deals for sustainable win-win relationships with external providers.  Outsourcing can enable enterprises to reduce costs, accelerate time to market  and take advantage of external expertise, assets and/or intellectual property. This  includes:  – fees for third-party or outsourcing contracts primarily comprising services for  managing or monitoring security devices, systems or processes where the  services are provided on-site.  – managed service provider / cloud is defined as: remote subscription-based  monitoring and/or management of security devices such as firewalls,  intrusion detection and prevention functions via customer-premises-based or  network-based devices. It also includes remotely delivered specialist  managed security services such as threat intelligence, SIEM/SOC,  distributed denial of service, etc., and cloud-based security services such as  IDaaS.  – consulting, defined as: security advisory services that help organisations  analyse and improve the efficacy of business operations and technologies  strategies.   Personnel is defined as follows:  – Costs/FTEs include in-house and contract personnel supporting IT operational  infrastructure security, vulnerability management and security analytics,  application security and governance and risk and compliance management.

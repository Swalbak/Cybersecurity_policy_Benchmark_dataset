The Management Board received a copy of the 2018 Annual Activity Report produced  by the Executive Director of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 21 June 2019.  In analysing and assessing the AAR 2018, the Management Board makes the following  conclusions:    The AAR presents key results of the implementation of the ENISA Work programme  2018 and leads to conclusion that the Agency completed all deliverables agreed with  the Management Board in the Work Programme 2018.    ENISA produced 40 reports on different aspects of network and information security.  A relevant set of published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and events are listed  as part of the result achieved by the Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's  results exceeded the targets established in the Work Programme 2018, against the  framework of the ENISA Strategy 2016-2020.    At the same time, there was an increased focus on communicating ENISA’s work and  concepts to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission,  along with other EU agencies. In 2018 following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA  organised several events such as the Annual Privacy Forum, IoT Security Conference  and the Cyber Exercise.    Two major European projects were also supported by ENISA: the EU Cyber Security  Month — a specific month dedicated to activities on cybersecurity and security/ privacy awareness— and the EU Cybersecurity Challenge event — a competition  based on a series of technical challenges between teams of students from different  Member States.    Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work Programme 2018 and ENISA’s work  is well aligned with the overall European Union agenda for digital single market.  A coherent link is provided between activities planned in the Work Programme 2018  and the actual achievements reached in the reporting period.    The AAR also describes ENISA’s management of resources and the budget execution  of the EU subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were committed at a rate of 99.9 %.  The respective payment rate on expenditure appropriations was 89,25% in 2018.    The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2016 Discharge and control results. The  agency has three open recommendations from the Internal Audit Service in 2018. This  section also notes the main categories of deviation that led to exceptions reported. In  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 3  2018 the agency recorded 33 exceptions. 26 of them are under the materiality levels  and are minor administrative nature with no financial impact.  Of the seven remaining,  a posteriori commitments were reported.    The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate management of risks, high level of  transparency, data protection, business continuity, as well as efforts were undertaken  to improve overall efficiency in all activities.    The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration of assurance of the Executive  Director as well as additional information on human and financial resources, draft  annual accounts and financial reports, as well as performance information included  in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the achievements of ENISA in 2018. The  Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA could deliver work programme  2018 in spite of high staff turnover and under condition of limited budgetary resources.  The Management Board expresses its appreciation to the Executive Director and his staff  for their commitment and achievements throughout the year.  The Management Board notes that the Executive Director has no critical issues to report  which would affect the presentation of the annual accounts for the financial year 2018 to  the discharge authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management Board requests the Management  Board Secretariat to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to the European  Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, the Permanent Representations of  the Member States and the Court of Auditors.  41  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ENISA Management board assessment 2 A message from the Executive Director 8 Introduction 11  PART I  ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE 2018 WORK PROGRAMME 17  1.1  KEY RESULTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 — EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES 18 1.1.1 Objective 1.1.

ENISA delivered on the priorities set out in the work programme including  vital work in areas supporting the digital single market.  The year 2018 saw successful negotiations on the proposed Cybersecurity Act, including  the new mandate for ENISA, which will allow the agency to better serve the cybersecurity  needs of Europe. A political agreement on the Cybersecurity Act was reached in  December 2018 establishing a permanent mandate and reinforced role for ENISA. The  cybersecurity certification framework that was agreed will offer an opportunity for ENISA  to prepare candidate schemes.  Additionally, 2018 was also a year where the majority of EU Member States transposed  the directive on network and information systems directive (NISD), which ENISA  supported by contributing to the work of the Cooperation Group and developing the  computer security incident response teams (CSIRT) network. The successful outcome of  this implementation and that of the second payment services directive means that we are  enhancing Europe's cybersecurity but also increasing trust in the digital single market.  ENISA continued working on its annual flagship deliverables such as the cyber exercises,  the Annual Privacy Forum, the internet of things (IoT) security conference and the  cyberthreat landscape.  The CSIRTs network has also developed its midterm work  programme objectives. The ENISA inventory of incident response teams listed 383  teams in December 2018 compared to 342 at the end of previous year demonstrating a  continual growth of incident response capabilities in Europe. ENISA continues to support  EU Member States in developing a harmonised approach to supervision of security  requirements and cybersecurity breach reporting in the EU telecoms and electronic trust  services sectors.  ENISA fully achieved its 2018 objectives: it successfully completed the work programme  in a timely manner, within budget and in compliance with our legal framework, due  to the robust management of internal resources and implemented procedures. The  ‘introduction’ section contains a summary with highlights of ENISA activities during 2018.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 9  The agency has successfully reached its targets due to the commitment of its staff,  effective collaboration with its stakeholders and the valuable cooperation and direction  provided by the Management Board. I take this opportunity to thank the members of the  Management Board for their contributions and dedication during 2018.  As we look toward the future, there is no doubt that 2019 will be a challenging  year as the new Cybersecurity Act is adopted and ENISA will take on a new role in  cybersecurity certification.  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director, ENISA  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 111  THE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY  FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION  SECURITY IN BRIEF  ENISA was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC)  No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and the  Council. Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security introduced a small change  in the name, updated its objectives and extended its  mandate until 19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and  information security and cybersecurity in Europe.  ENISA supports the European Union and its Member  States in enhancing and strengthening their ability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond  to network and information security problems and  incidents. ENISA’s vision is to secure and enable  Europe’s information society and to use its unique  competencies to help to drive the cyber landscape  in Europe.  The agency works closely with members of both  the public and private sectors to deliver advice and  guidelines based on solid operational experience.  ENISA also supports the development of EU policies  and laws on matters relating to network and  information security (NIS), thereby contributing  to economic growth in the EU’s internal market.  Last but not least, ENISA coordinates the pan- European cybersecurity exercise, which is unique  in its scope and impact and brings together all of  the EU Member States every 2 years to test their  cooperation mechanisms while working in their own  operational environments.  THE YEAR IN BRIEF  The key achievements of 2018 are as follows.  ENISA produced 40 reports on different aspects of  network and information security. These include the  latest version of the ENISA threat landscape, guidelines  on assessing the security of digital service providers  (DSPs) and the compliance of operators of essential  services (OESs) with the security requirements set  out in the NISD. Additionally, ENISA reports focused  on an IoT security standards gap analysis, economics  of vulnerability disclosure and information and  communication technology (ICT) security certification  opportunities in the healthcare sector.  ENISA continued to strongly support the process  of assisting EU Member States in implementing  the NISD, the first piece of EU-wide legislation on  cybersecurity that provides legal measures to boost  the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  ENISA supported the organisation of the CSIRTs  network meetings in Greece, Bulgaria and Austria that  saw the participation of CSIRT representatives from  INTRODUCTION  12  all Member States, the European Commission and  the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU  institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU).  Following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA  organised several high-profile events such as the  fifth Network and Information Security Summer  School 2018 and a conference preparing for the  EU cybersecurity certification framework. Other  events included the ENISA industry event and the  Annual Privacy Forum. ENISA also hosted a number  of important thematic workshops and sessions,  gathering together experts in the field to discuss  cybersecurity topics.  Two major European projects were also supported by  ENISA: the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) a  specific month dedicated to activities on cybersecurity  and privacy awareness, and the European Cyber  Security Challenge (ECSC) event (a competition based  on a series of technical challenges between teams of  students and school pupils from different Member  States). The final stage of the ECSC 2018 took place  in London. More than 200 people representing 17  countries competed at this year's final.  The pan-European cybersecurity exercise, Cyber  Europe 2018, was successfully organised and  executed. Focusing on the aviation sector, it involved  close to 1 000 cybersecurity professionals from 30  EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA)  countries and over 300 organisations. In addition,  ENISA participated in the 2018 European Union  Hybrid Exercise, a multilayer exercise testing EU crisis  management mechanisms against hybrid threats,  including cyberthreats.  During 2018, the NISD was effectively implemented  across the EU. Throughout the year, ENISA supported  and contributed to the work of the Cooperation  Group and was instrumental in developing the CSIRTs  network. In the context of the Cooperation Group,  the agency supported notably the good practices on  interdependencies between OES and DSP information  security audit frameworks for OESs and incident  reporting under the NISD.  ENISA issued a number of ‘cybersecurity info  notes’ analysing various incidents over the year.  These information notes provided an overview of  significant incidents by establishing the context to  the materialised cyberthreats, thus complementing  the ENISA threat landscape report 2018. During 2018,  ENISA worked on a capability maturity framework for  cyberthreat intelligence, which will help its users to  understand their requirements and take informed  decisions on the desired maturity level.  Finally, the year ended with political agreement on  the Cybersecurity Act, which establishes a permanent  mandate for the agency and significantly expands the  scope of its activities.  While not being exhaustive, these achievements  amply illustrate the variety of ways in which the  agency contributes to a stronger and more secure EU.  ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES  AND OBJECTIVES  In 2018, the agency delivered against its annual work  programme, and all outputs and deliverables met or  exceeded the key performance indicators set (see  Part I for more details). Notable achievements are  mentioned hereunder, along with examples of how  the agency reached its goals.  ENISA continued to deliver on the priorities of its  strategy, including work in areas supporting the  digital single market (and on specific technologies  such as the IoT), finance, privacy and trust. ENISA  further contributed to the implementation of the  NISD concerning baseline security measures for  OES sectors and DSP, as well as supporting the  implementation of the second payment services  directive (PSD2). The agency also supported the  Member States and the European Commission in the  NISD transposition.  Key achievements include the following.    In the context of the NISD, the agency built on the  work from previous years and produced a number  of deliverables supporting the respective working  streams established within the Cooperation  Group, including incident notification, baseline  security measures, the identification of OES (see  performance indicator for outputs O.2.2.2 and  O.2.2.6) and eElection security.    In supporting the implementation of the NISD,  ENISA strengthened its engagement with  stakeholders in specific OES sectors (e.g. air  transport, finance and healthcare) to better  understand and document examples of sectorial  specificities vis-à-vis the sectorial requirements.  Relevant input was provided to the Cooperation  Group (horizontal and sectorial standards) to  enhance its specific knowledge of these sectors  (see performance indicator for output O.2.2.6).    For the second time ENISA, together with the  National Security Authority of Slovakia, organised  a conference on critical information infrastructure  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 13  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  protection with the aim to bring together the  needs of security professionals, public authorities,  and the relevant industries for a constructive  dialogue. More than 100 experts from private as  well public sectors participated.    As part of its activities to develop good practices  and recommendations for IoT security, ENISA  organised together with the European Union  Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation  (Europol) the second IoT security conference  that was attended by over 350 participants and  achieved significant visibility in the community.  Additionally, more than 40 IoT stakeholders and  experts were involved in the relevant study,  including the ENISA IoT Security and Industry  4.0 Cyber Security Experts Groups and the  European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (see  performance indicator for output O.1.1.1).    Supporting the finance sector ENISA has developed  good practices for implementation of the PSD2.  For this study, more than 15 Member States as  well as more than 10 private financial institutions  were engaged in providing feedback. ENISA  organised the Financial Institutes - Information  Sharing and Analysis Centre (FI-ISAC) meeting  in Athens, where more than 35 participants  discussed the latest developments in cyber-related  issues in the sector.    ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies (NCSSs) by developing an  evaluation tool and by further updating the ENISA  NCSS map. ENISA, building on previous years’  work, assisted the Member States in deploying  existing good practices in related areas and  offering targeted and focused assistance with  specific NCSS objectives. The evaluation tool was  created with the aim of helping Member States  evaluate their NCSSs in an easy, quick and user- friendly manner. Its objective was to help Member  States create second or third versions of their  NCSSs by evaluating their strategic objectives. The  tool functions by providing questions on specific  key performance indicators for each strategic  objective and then generating advice and ideas for  improving cybersecurity at a national level. More  than 20 Member States participated in ENISA’s  activities regarding this output (see performance  indicator for output O.3.1.2).    In 2018, the CSIRTs network reviewed, updated and  adopted its mid-term work programme objectives  and key performance indicators, the terms of  reference and rules of procedures, and formally  handed its first report to the Cooperation Group.    ENISA supported the operational readiness of  the CSIRTs network through well-established and  secure tools and communication.    The ENISA inventory of incident response teams  listed 383 teams in December 2018 against 342 the  end of the previous year. This steady increase in  the number of teams clearly indicates a growth in  incident response capabilities across Europe.    The 2018 edition of the Cyber Europe exercise was  the largest and most complex of its kind. Cyber  Europe 2018 was very successful, proving once  again the vast experience of ENISA in organising  operational as well as tabletop exercises. This  is also manifested in the numerous requests  that ENISA receives from both EU bodies and  national authorities to provide its support in the  organisation and conducting of exercises.    The ECSC held in London in October 2018 as  part of the ECSM was a major success. In less  than 5 years ECSC has been transformed from a  competition between five countries into a well- defined international event with the participation  of teams from 17 countries. ENISA plays a key role,  being responsible for the competition’s governance  model as well as gameplay, content, etc.    ENISA supported the European incident response  community in building a common language and  terminology for exchanging information in the  event of incidents, attacks or disruptions. The  Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working  Group was formally recognised as a working  group under the Task Force on Security Incident  Response Teams (TF-CSIRT) — the European  CSIRT community — and the first version of the  taxonomy was released on GitHub.    The agency continued supporting the Commission  and the Member States towards the establishment  of an EU cybersecurity certification framework  for products, services and processes. While  closely following the legislative process of the  Cybersecurity Act proposal, ENISA undertook  a study, in support of the Commission and EU  Member States that are participating in the Senior  Officials Group Information Systems Security  Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOG-IS MRA),  exploring aspects of a possible transposition of the  existing SOG-IS MRA to the new EU framework.  14    ENISA contributed asset models and a threat  and risk assessment to the network and  information system Cooperation Group (NIS CG)  Compendium on cybersecurity of election technology  (CG Publication 03/2018), which later became  part of the Commission’s recommendation to  Member States on the security and fairness of the  upcoming European Parliament elections.  KEY CONCLUSIONS ON FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL  ENISA’s staff conducted its 2018 activities in  compliance with the applicable legal and financial  framework, working in an open and transparent  manner and meeting the expected high level of  professional and ethical standards.  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control principles,  based on international best practices, aimed to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  The financial regulation requires that the organisational  structure and the internal control systems used for the  implementation of the budget are set up in accordance  with these principles. ENISA has assessed the internal  control systems during the reporting year and has  concluded that the internal control principles are  implemented and function as intended.  In addition, ENISA has systematically examined  the available control results and indicators as well  as the observations and recommendations issued  by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) of the European  Commission and the European Court of Auditors (ECA).  These elements have been assessed to determine  their impact on the management team's assurance as  regards the achievement of control objectives.  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that, overall, suitable controls are in  place and working as intended; risks are being  appropriately monitored and mitigated; and  necessary improvements and reinforcements are  being implemented.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 15  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 17  This Annual activity report 2018 follows the structure of  the 2018 ENISA work programme to assist the reader in  understanding the achievements of the year. The 2018  work programme was aligned with the structure of the  ENISA strategy document 1, which was created with  the aim of supporting ENISA’s executive director and  Management Board in the production and adoption of  consistent multiannual and annual work programmes 2.  This strategy defines five strategic objectives that form  the basis of future multiannual plans 3.  These strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, along with inputs from the Member States  and relevant communities, including the private  sector. They state that ENISA, in cooperation with  and in support of the Member States and the EU  institutions, will carry out the following tasks.  #Expertise: anticipate and support Europe in  facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  1 ENISA strategy 2018-2020, available at: https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  2 In accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of  the European Parliament and of the Council concerning ENISA.  3 In order to achieve the multiannual strategic objectives laid  out in this document, the multiannual work programme  provides prioritised mid-term operational objectives to  be achieved by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Specific  annual activities (outputs) are identified in the annual work  programme, using a recursive approach in order to achieve  the mid-term operational objectives and, in the long term, the  strategic objectives.  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the  evolutions of the digital environment.  #Policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the  EU institutions and Member States in developing and  implementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  #Capacity: support Europe in maintaining state- of-the-art network and information security  capacities, by assisting the EU institutions and  Member States in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community: foster the emerging European  network and information security community,  by reinforcing cooperation at EU level among  EU institutions, Member States and relevant NIS  stakeholders, including the private sector.  #Enabling: reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging  more efficiently with its stakeholders, including the  EU institutions and Member States, as well as at  international level.  In the following sections the results of the  implementation of the 2018 work programme are  presented for each of the abovementioned activities.  After the description of the specific results for each  activity and output, the achievements are presented  in tables against indicators and the detailed results  for each output.  PART I ACHIEVEMENTS  IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE 2018 WORK  PROGRAMME  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  18  1.1 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 —  EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING  NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY  CHALLENGES  1.1.1 Objective 1.1. Improving the  expertise related to network and  information security  1.1.1.1 Output O.1.1.1. Good practices for security  of the internet of things (priority 1)  IoT is at the core of operations for many essential  service operators as defined in the NISD, especially  considering recent initiatives concerning smart  infrastructure, Industry 4.0 4, 5G 5, smart grids 6, etc. IoT  security should thus be considered in this context 7.  The agency identified and analysed existing security  practices and standards in the area of IoT security  for critical infrastructure and smart infrastructure,  taking into consideration existing national expertise  and practices. ENISA compared these practices and  standards and developed good practices for IoT  security, with a particular focus on the impact on  end users.  In this endeavour the agency took into account  existing EU policy and regulatory initiatives (the NISD,  the communication ‘Internet of things — An action  plan for Europe’, the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation (AIOTI)  8 and the 5G Infrastructure Public– Private Partnership 9).  The agency developed targeted IoT case studies  to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by defining  appropriate attack scenarios, and provided relevant  recommendations and good practices. Moreover, it  defined IoT security requirements to ensure ‘security  for safety’.  4 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth- industrial-revolution  5 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/towards-5g  6 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-  consumers/smart-grids-and-meters  7 Nevertheless, non-critical operators, who might also be  involved in IoT activities, face no regulation and may have  little incentive to invest in securing their systems. Considering  the particularities of IoT, security should be seen as a primary  concern even for the latter operators.  8 More information on the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti  9 More information on the 5G Infrastructure Pubic–Private  Partnership (5G PPP) is available at: https://5g-ppp.eu/  The agency also validated the results of the study  (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and  EU initiatives (e.g. the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation) and interacted with all important IoT  stakeholders from the public sector, such as the  Directorate-General for Communications Networks,  Content and Technology and the Joint Research  Centre and, and from the private sector, including  critical information infrastructure providers,  integrators and manufacturers.  This work built on the previous work of ENISA  in the areas of IoT, intelligent cars, smart cities,  smart hospitals and smart airports (2015-2016  work programme).  1.1.2 Objective 1.2. Network and  information security threat landscape  and analysis  1.1.2.1 Output O.1.2.1. Annual European Union  Agency for Network and Information Security  threat landscape (priority 1)  The ENISA Threat Landscape report 2018 provides  an overview of the top 15 cyberthreats identified  throughout the year. It includes both tactical and  strategic information about each cyberthreat,  including points of interest, trends, involved threat  agents, attack vectors and mitigation controls.  The report is produced based on information  collection of open source material, such as annual  incident reports, consolidated threat reports  of vendors, articles, blogs, etc. Based on this  information, an analysis and consolidation effort  is being performed. It results to an extensive  description of each cyberthreat. ENISA shared  the references of all relevant material collected  throughout the year. Interested stakeholders may use  this information to find technical details related to  each assessed cyberthreat.  The visualisation and quick availability of threat  information was set as priority in 2018. For this  reason, the ENISA threat landscape (ETL) has been  made available by means of an end user (web-based)  application that provides the entire ETL information  online (https://etl.enisa.europa.eu). In this manner,  ETL users are in a position to selectively access ENISA  threat information in an efficient manner.  In 2018, ENISA continued its cooperation efforts  with CERT-EU in the area of threat landscaping. This  was carried out through information exchanges,  use of CERT-EU services and organisation of  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth-industrial-revolution https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth-industrial-revolution https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/towards-5g https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://5g-ppp.eu/ https://etl.enisa.europa.eu  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 19  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  common meetings and events. By carrying out  this work, synergies with related experts (i.e. the  ETL Stakeholder Group) and vendors (through  memorandums of understanding) were maintained  and expanded.  1.1.2.2 Output O.1.2.2. Restricted and public  info notes on network and information security  (priority 1)  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events  and developments through info notes. The general  info notes produced in 2018 covered significant  developments, events and announcements in the  field of cybersecurity.  ENISA provided balanced and  neutral information regarding events, issues, points  of action, mitigation measures, summaries, related  practices, etc. Hence, the objective of this work was to  provide regular updates containing a neutral overview  of the state of play regarding an incident.  1.1.2.3 Output O.1.2.3. Support incident reporting  activities in the European Union  For the seventh year, ENISA published its annual  report on significant security incidents in the  European electronic communications sector, which  are reported to ENISA and the European Commission  under Article 13a of the framework directive (Directive  2009/140/EC) by the national regulatory authority  (NRA) of each of the 28 EU Member States and two  EFTA countries.  The report published in 2018 covers the incidents that  occurred in 2017 and gives an aggregate analysis of  the incident reports about severe outages across the  EU. Some key findings from the 169 major incidents  reported include the fact that mobile telephony and  mobile internet are most affected; system failures  is the dominant root cause; and outages caused by  natural phenomena increased from 5% in previous  years to almost 20%, with extreme weather appearing  to be the primary cause.  ENISA supports a group of experts from the NRA,  called the ENISA Article 13a Expert Group. ENISA  organised three Article  13a meetings during the  year, which were attended by most of the EU NRAs  – typically 20-25 countries attend. The agency also  develops and maintains an online incident-reporting  tool for the NRAs to facilitate annual summary  reporting about incidents.  Under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation 10, every  year ENISA publishes an aggregate overview of the  incidents reported to national supervisory bodies  under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, and  subsequently to ENISA as part of annual summary  reporting. The Annual report trust services security  incidents 2018 therefore marks the second full year of  annual reporting about significant security incidents  in the EU's trust services sector.  10 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and  of the Council on electronic identification and trust services  for electronic transactions in the internal market  20  In order to facilitate the process of incident  notifications, ENISA manages an expert group on  the matter called the ‘ENISA Article 19 Expert Group’  and composed of the supervisory authorities from a  number of Member States. The group meets twice a  year to debate incidents and incident reporting, along  with other topics.  ENISA also kicked off the work on incident reporting  under the NISD, which came into force in 2018. ENISA  developed, in close collaboration with the NIS CG, two  guidelines for NISD incident reporting, one each for  OESs and DSPs. ENISA also developed templates used  by the Member States in the first round of annual  summary reporting about significant incidents, to  the NIS CG.  1.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and  development, innovation  1.1.3.1 Output O.1.3.1. Guidelines for European  standardisation in the field of information and  communications technology security (priority 1)  This activity provided a preliminary analysis of the IoT- related landscape of standards aiming at pinpointing  potential areas of improvement in securing the IoT.  Elements of a holistic approach towards IoT security  can be found in a series of standards; however,  further work is needed to achieve an overarching  approach that protects the entire IoT ecosystem. In  parallel, ENISA elaborated further on the thematic  area of privacy-oriented standards, considering the  developments at legislative, policy and standardisation  level. Through a respective study, the agency explored  how the standards-developing world is responding  to the fast-changing, demanding realm of privacy by  mapping existing available standards and initiatives in  the area and provided insights into the ‘state-of-the- art’ of privacy standards in the information security  context through a relevant gap analysis.  In carrying out this work, ENISA consulted with  representatives from academia, industry and  standards organisations (e.g. the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),  the European Committee for Standardization,  the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardization) while also co-organising a well- attended conference and actively participating in  renowned standardisation conferences (e.g. ETSI  Security Week).  1.1.3.2 Output O.1.3.2 Priorities for European  Union research and development (priority 1)  Based on desk research and interviews with more  than 20 experts from academia, government and  private sectors, ENISA depicted the threats to  European society and the societal changes brought  by innovation in the digitally connected world. This  work was summarised in the report ‘Analysis of the  European R & D priorities in cybersecurity’ and was also  presented at the Research Working Group annual  meeting of the European Cyber Security Organisation  in order to support their work.  In addition, ENISA published a specific report on  the economics of vulnerability disclosure, which  highlighted the economic factors, incentives and  motivations that influence the behaviour of all  those involved in vulnerability disclosure, as well as  two case studies of recently disclosed high-profile  vulnerabilities.  During 2018, the agency offered support to the  National Public Authority Representatives Committee  by providing a secretariat function.  Moreover, ENISA participated in dissemination  meetings of some European Research funded  cybersecurity projects in order to identify the further  research efforts needed for making Europe “a global  leader in cybersecurity by 2025”, as stated at the  Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017.   1.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response  to Article 14 requests under  expertise activity  1.1.4.1 Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests  under expertise activity (priority 1)  The national research institute of Poland requested  ENISA’s support in setting up their certification  framework, in line with the projected European one.  For this purpose, a workshop in Warsaw was held,  where representatives of all Polish stakeholders in  the area of certification were present. The workshop  provided for opportunity to discuss all burning  issues and laid the foundations for potential future  collaboration in this area.

Supporting European  Union policy development  ENISA provided high-quality information, data and  advice to support policymaking in the Commission  and Member States.  In the area of policy development the agency  collaborated with public- and private-sector  stakeholders to develop insights, reach consensuses  and provide recommendations in areas that further  develop its policy. Examples of such cooperation took  place in the domains of information technology (IT)  security certification and the digital single market.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 23  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  1.2.1.1 Output O.2.1.1 Support the policy  discussions in the area of certification of products  and services (priority 1)  As a first step towards sketching a point of reference  for policy-makers tackling the issue of cybersecurity  and establishing a relevant framework for policy  development, a study was produced to provide an  overview of representative application domains  of autonomous agents to complement relevant  initiatives at EU level by providing insights and  considerations, relating to both security and privacy.  The agency continued supporting the Commission  and the Member States towards the creation of  an EU cybersecurity certification framework for  products, services and processes. While closely  following the legislative process of the Cybersecurity  Act proposal, ENISA undertook a study, in support  of the Commission and EU Member States that are  participating in SOG-IS MRA, exploring aspects of a  possible transposition of the existing SOG-IS MRA  to the new EU framework. In parallel, emerging  application areas such as the healthcare sector were  analysed with a view to identifying and providing a  preliminary mapping of the aspects to be considered.  ENISA continued to stimulate dialogue with  standards developing organisations (ETSI, etc.), ICT  certification stakeholders (test labs, certification  and accreditation bodies, SOG-IS, the Common  Criteria Recognition Arrangement, etc.) and ICT  security products through the organisation of  two conferences on the broad thematic area of  cybersecurity certification framework.  1.2.1.2 Output O.2.1.2 Towards a framework for  policy development in cybersecurity (priority 1)  ENISA focused on providing an overview of  representative application domains of autonomous  agents and attempts to complement relevant  initiatives at EU level by providing insights and  considerations relating to both security and  privacy. In parallel to this activity, the agency also  touched upon privacy enhancing technologies  (PETs) and explored the notion of an online  platform where emerging technologies could be  maintained and evaluated. Lastly, a workshop with  a specific focus on the research and academic  community was conducted, in order to explore the  further evolution of this platform in the context of  privacy and security.  1.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting European  Union policy implementation  1.2.2.1 Output O.2.2.1 Recommendations  supporting implementation of the eIDAS  regulation (priority 1)  ENISA supported public and private bodies in  implementing the eIDAS regulation by addressing  technological aspects and building blocks for  trust services.  Specifically, ENISA developed a report on the global  acceptance of eIDAS audits, continued its work on  the assessment of eIDAS-related standards in order  to assist the European Commission in updating  the related implementing acts and organised the  fourth edition of the Trust Services Forum. These  were directed at all the stakeholders involved: trust  service providers, supervisory bodies and conformity  assessment bodies. More than 20 experts in the  area of trust services were involved in preparing and  validating the reports. The reports were disseminated  through different communication channels, including  the European Commission’s distribution channels, the  Article 19 ENISA Expert Group mailing list and ENISA  contacts from the Trust Services Forum. The findings  of the reports were presented in several different  workshops and conferences, including the Trust  Services Forum, the Article 19 ENISA Expert Group,  ETSI Security Week, World e-ID and the trust services  providers compliance info day on eIDAS, ETSI and  Certification Authority Browser Forum requirements.  Moreover, the fourth edition of the Trust Services  Forum received a high number of registrations and  was attended by over 130 participants that actively  contributed in the discussions and the panels.  1.2.2.2 Supporting the implementation of the  network and information systems directive  (priority 1)  ENISA is an active member of the NIS CG, the official  group for strategic collaboration and providing  guidance to Member States on the implementation  of the NISD.  ENISA supported, together with the Cooperation  Group, the development of a guideline and templates  for the implementation of Article 5(4), for Member  States to use when identifying OESs, notifying the  Commission about their identification of OESs, and in  notification of cross-border dependencies.  ENISA supported the development of templates  and tools for incident notification by taking stock  24  of incident notification templates and notification  methods in use across the EU, showing the different  approaches, commonalities and divergences. This  analysis has been circulated inside the NIS CG but  has not been published because in 2018 the situation  was uncertain as many Member States had not yet  transposed the NISD.  ENISA published a report on good practices regarding  interdependencies between OESs and DSPs with a  view to supporting OESs in their risk assessments.  In relation to the latter, an important element of  the risk to be assessed is the dependencies of the  services offered on other services of either OES  or DSPs. These dependencies might be national  or cross-border in nature. The report proposes  a four-phase interdependency identification and  assessment approach to the OESs, DSPs and  national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as  a set of recommendations to effectively address  interdependencies in their risk assessments.  The agency has involved the NIS CG as well as 19  stakeholders from the OES community to take  stock of the existing practices. The report has  been validated in a workshop, which took place in  Bratislava with more than 100 attendees representing  both the private and the public sectors.  ENISA is actively supporting the NIS CG and plays a  key role in all the NIS CG work streams, by drafting  guidelines and contributing to Member State  initiatives. For instance, ENISA contributed asset  models and a threat and risk assessment to the NIS  CG Compendium on cybersecurity of election technology  (CG Publication 03/2018), which later became part  of the Commission recommendation to Member  States about security and fairness of the upcoming  European Parliament elections. This compendium  is a broad set of guidelines that are based on the  experiences and best practices across the Member  States, and contains practical and workable  measures that can be taken by cyber security  organisations and election management bodies as  well as those advising or overseeing them to secure  the technology involved in elections.  ENISA also organised two NISD related workshops.  ENISA co-organised, jointly with NSU Slovakia  a cybersecurity workshop involving both OESs  and sectorial authorities on critical information  infrastructure protection (CIIP) and the NISD.  ENISA also organised the fourth eHealth Security  conference in cooperation with the Dutch Ministry of  Health, Welfare and Sport. The conference was hosted  by the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam.  1.2.2.3 Output O.2.2.3. Baseline security  recommendations for the operator of essential  services sectors and digital service providers  (priority 1)  ENISA, building on its expertise in security  requirements developed for DSPs and OESs,  worked closely with Member States and the private  sector to identify effective practices and security  maturity frameworks that would constitute the  basis for guidelines for Member States to assess  the compliance of DSPs and OESs with security  requirements set by the NISD. In this light, ENISA  published a report with guidelines on the use of  information security audit and self-assessment  frameworks. On the whole, this report aims to  provide guidance to the NCAs in auditing in line with  the security requirements of the NISD. The report  presents a complete set of options for NCAs to  meet these provisions. The agency worked in close  collaboration with the NIS CG and with experts from  the private sector to develop this report.  1.2.2.4 Output O.2.2.4 Supporting the payment  services directive implementation (priority 1)  The main goal of the PSD2 is to promote competition  and innovation in financial services and to protect  the security of payment services users. The PSD2  focuses on the use of technology in financial services,  introducing new technological requirements and  measures to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity,  availability, and authenticity of user information.  The main objective of this study is to identify the  good practices introduced by Member States in the  implementation of the PSD2. In particular, the aim  is to analyse the adaptation of the PSD2 guidelines  in the field of security, such as measures for  operational and security risks, and the notification  of major incidents. The study also provides a parallel  between the incident reporting mechanism and the  NISD incident notifications. Additionally, the security  measures identified in the PSD2 are mapped to the  security measures identified in the NISD.  1.2.2.5 Output O.2.2.5. Contribute to European  Union policy in the area of privacy and data  protection (priority 2)  Technical measures in the field of data protection  have been a key part of the involvement of ENISA  in this policy area in an effort to support the  implementation of the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR). In particular, in 2018 the agency,  on the basis of previous relevant work, elaborated on  the state-of-the-art with regard to security measures  for the protection of personal data (in correlation  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 25  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  with Article 32 GDPR). Moreover, the agency provided  two sets of guidelines related to the technical  implementation of GDPR in the areas of data  pseudonymisation and the notion of data protection  by default. In this sixth edition, the Annual Privacy  Forum was used to bring together key communities  across research, policy and industry to disseminate  work in this area. Cooperation activities with the  European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  national data protection authorities were continued  and further enhanced. In this context, two workshops  were also organised in the field of security measures  and data protection by design, in collaboration with  the data protection authorities of Italy and Greece.  1.2.2.6 Output O.2.2.6. Network and information  systems directive transposition (priority 1)  The European Commission developed an online  map to display the NISD transposition status in the  Member States. In order to avoid duplication of  efforts, ENISA  NISD tool does not display the NISD  transposition status but it facilitates the concept of a  ‘one-stop shop’ for the NISD.  Through this tool, ENISA is supporting the Member  States and the private sector by providing information  about the Member States’ relevant laws, their  adopted NCSSs and the appointed NCAs for both  OESs and DSPs.  The NISD tool is an interactive online tool and its  functionality includes:    links to the relevant national laws and regulations  in each Member State, as well links to documents  explaining OES identification, security measures  and incident notification requirements, etc.;    links to ENISA's relevant sectorial work or sub  sectorial work;    lists of the relevant NCAs for each sector (both for  OESs and DSPs);    hyperlinks to the webpages of these competent  authorities.  In addition, the tool also links to the ENISA NCSS map,  the European Commission’s NISD map, and ENISA's  CSIRTs network web page.  Moreover, for this output ENISA organised the first  Transport Cybersecurity Conference in cooperation  with the European Commission (Directorate-General  for Mobility and Transport), the European Aviation  Safety Agency, the European Union Agency for  Railways and the European Maritime Safety Agency.  This conference, which took place at the premises  of the European Maritime Safety Agency, brought  together public bodies and stakeholders from all  transport modes to look at the European regulatory  environment (NISD, Cybersecurity Act), its relevance  for the sector including in light of past incidents, and  to explore synergies among transport modes.  In addition, ENISA wrote technical guidelines on  the implementation of Article 5(7) together with the  Commission. The objective of the document is to provide  the Member States with non-binding technical guidelines  on how to implement Article 5(7) with a view to:  a)  avoiding unnecessary divergence or  inconsistencies when submitting information to  the Commission;  b) simplifying the submission process; and  c)  maximising the value of the information received  by the Commission as a means of the directive  implementation assessment.  1.2.3 Objective 2.3. Response to Article  14 requests under policy activity  1.2.3.1 Output O.2.3.1. Response to requests  under policy activity (priority 1)  The 2018 outcomes of the Article 14 requests under  policy activity are as follows.    In 2017, ENISA received a request from the  Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and  Food Safety to support the eHealth Network’s  activities on cybersecurity for healthcare, which  are carried out within the joint action on eHealth  (health programme 2017). In 2018, ENISA actively  participated in Task 7.3, ‘Data and system security’,  of work package 7, which addresses the issues on  ‘Implementation challenges and impact’.    ENISA received a request from the Directorate- General for Internal Market, Industry,  Entrepreneurship and SMEs to support the  implementation of the IT security requirements  introduced by the two new regulations on medical  devices, 2017/745 (medical device regulation) and  2017/746. In 2018, ENISA provided expertise to the  medical device regulation Cybersecurity Task Force  established by the Commission and is supporting  the Directorate-General for Internal Market,  Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs with respect  to the technical coordination of the project.    The Cooperation Group on cross-border  dependencies aims to establish voluntary  guidelines or recommendations that would help  26  Member States and their competent authorities  to assess and mitigate the cross-border  dependencies affecting their essential services.

Assist Member  States’ capacity building  1.3.1.1 Output O.3.1.1. Update and provide  technical training for Member State and European  Union bodies (priority 1)  In 2018 most of the activities in this area were aimed  at maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and training for CSIRT and other  operational personnel. The agency supported the  development of Member States’ national incident  response preparedness by providing good practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building,  with a focus on CSIRT training and services to improve  the CSIRT teams’ skills.  More specifically, the agency provided an update  of the technical training material, which is highly  regarded. The updated technical training material  is on network forensics and provides a new set of  materials that includes both; a thorough theoretical  introduction and three sectorial use cases that are  part of the hands-on section of the training material.  The scenarios allow the training to be delivered in a  modular way, tailored to the needs of the Member  State CSIRTs and their constituency. This was done  in order to reinforce Member State CSIRT skills  and expertise to efficiently manage cybersecurity  events. In this output, special emphasis was put on  supporting Member State CSIRTs and EU bodies with  concrete advice (like good practice material) and  concrete action (like CSIRT training). ENISA delivered,  upon request, direct support by providing tailored  technical training on incident management.  In 2018, ENISA further enhanced its methodology,  seminars and training on: (a) cyber crisis management  and (b) the organisation and management of  exercises. This activity included the development  of material and infrastructure for onsite and online  training on these subjects. In addition, this activity  covered the delivery of these training programmes  upon request.  As part of its continuous effort, ENISA maintains and  regularly updates its training material. In 2018, ENISA  also created new training material for the financial  sector. The training includes a case study based on  malware attacking a mobile banking application. The  new material is now part of the updated training  portfolio of the agency.  Finally, ENISA continued to support TRANSITS training  delivery, with three courses being successfully  delivered. TRANSITS provides trainings for both new  and experienced CSIRT personnel and to date has  directly trained more than 500 professionals in the  European region.  1.3.1.2 Output O.3.1.2. Support European  Union Member States in the development and  assessment of national cybersecurity strategies  In 2018 ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of NCSS by developing a  tool for evaluating NCSSs and by further updating the  ENISA NCSS map. ENISA, building on previous years’  work, assisted Member States in deploying existing  good practices in the related areas and offer targeted  and focused assistance on specific NCSS objectives.  The evaluation tool was created with the aim of  helping Member States evaluate their NCSSs in an  easy, quick and user-friendly manner. The objective  of the tool was to help Member States create second  or third versions of their NCSS by evaluating their  strategic objective. The tool’s functionality provides  questions on specific KPIs for each strategic objectives  and depending on the answers, the tool generates  advice and ideas for improving cybersecurity at  a national level.  In 2018, ENISA published a new version of the  online NCSS map. New features were included on  the map. At first, the EFTA countries were displayed  giving an overview of their strategic documents and  objectives. The list of all Member States’ strategic  objectives were enriched with more examples, giving  a clear outline of the status of each country. A new  field of past versions has been added in the map,  providing a complete overview of each country’s  strategies from past years.  ENISA also supported Switzerland by providing input  for a book developed by Deutor and Springer Verlag  that deals with best practice in cyber security for  states, companies, the IT industry, law enforcement,  the EU, international organisations and academia.  In addition, ENISA organised the sixth NCSS workshop  in cooperation with the Finnish Communications  Regulatory Authority. This conference focused on  the development, implementation and evaluation of  NCSSs and the creation of national, European and  sectorial ISACs.  30  Representatives from both the public and private  sector discussed about NCSSs, and shared best  practices for the creation and running of ISACs.  1.3.1.3 Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU Member  States in their incident response development  (Priority 1)  ENISA’s inventory of incident response teams listed  383 teams in December 2018, an increase of 41 teams  in 1 year. The steady increase in teams clearly indicates  the growth of incident response capabilities in Europe.  For almost 15 years, ENISA has been supporting  Member States and CSIRT communities in building and  advancing their CSIRT capabilities, and ENISA continues  to receive spontaneous requests from new teams all  over Europe to be included in its inventory.  In 2018, ENISA concentrated its efforts on assisting  Member States with their incident response  capabilities by providing a state-of-the-art overview  of the CSIRT landscape and development in Europe.  This study helps ENISA identify and draw conclusions  about the recent and current evolution of CSIRTs  and incident response capabilities in Europe towards  2025. Building on the existing knowledge gathered  in the European CSIRT inventory, this study aims to  delve deeper into the ‘blind spots’ that may exist in  this mapping. The study also points to interesting  trends and identifies important issues, for example  that more hardware vulnerabilities are being  discovered in the components that are at the basis  of our digital society and that the majority of these  components are developed and manufactured  outside of the EU. In close cooperation with the  NISD CSIRTs network, the agency supports the  development of Member States’ national incident  response capabilities by providing recommendations  on key dimensions of NIS capability building with  a focus on the development and efficient functioning  of national and sectorial CSIRTs.  The main objectives of this output in 2018 was to  help Member States and ENISA’s other incident  response stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies, and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy  their incident response capabilities and services  in order to meet the ever-growing challenges in  securing their networks. Another objective of this  output was to further develop and apply ENISA  recommendations for the CSIRT baseline capabilities  and maturity assessment framework. ENISA has  continued supporting cross-border CSIRT community  projects and tool development, as well as the global  dialogue about common definitions and the maturity  framework in the incident response domain.  1.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support European  Union institutions’ capacity building  1.3.2.1 Output O.3.2.1 Representation of the  European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security on the Steering Board of  CERT EU and representation of the EU agencies  using the CERT EU service (priority 1)  In 2018, the operations of CERT-EU were placed on  a formal legal basis by way of a draft arrangement  among a number of EU institutions. A Management  Board was created to supervise the activities of CERT- EU, and a number of EU bodies and institutions are  represented on it.  CERT-EU was set up to provide CERT services to the  EU bodies and institutions. ENISA is appointed to  CERT EU’s Steering Board to represent itself and a list  of EU agencies that may use their services.  In this context ENISA has been participating in the  Steering Board of CERT-EU and liaising with the EU  agencies on operational issues related to CERT-EU’s  activities in order to ensure that the viewpoints of  the EU agencies are adequately represented. The  cooperation with CERT-EU and role of coordination  between the EU agencies and CERT-EU has been  working very well and some important discussions  were held in 2018. The needs of the EU decentralised  agencies and ENISA are represented in the decision  taken by the Steering Board.  The growing need for IT  security professionals is widely acknowledged;  Europe has to make  an effort to attract  and retain talent in  cybersecurity and to  create solid and powerful  education, entrepreneur  and business structures  relating to cybersecurity.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 31  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  ENISA will continue to represent the views on the  evolution of services required by EU agencies in the  CERT-EU Steering Board.  1.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist in improving  private sector capacity building and  general awareness  1.3.3.1 Output O.3.3.1, Cybersecurity challenges  (priority 1)  The growing need for IT security professionals is  widely acknowledged; Europe has to make an effort  to attract and retain talent in cybersecurity and, at  the same time, create solid and powerful education,  entrepreneur and business structures relating to  cybersecurity which will allow us to develop the  needed capabilities to prevent, react to and protect  citizens against cyberthreats. In order to promote  this capacity building on NIS among the emerging  young generation of cybersecurity experts in Member  States, ENISA will continue to promote and advise the  Member States on national cybersecurity challenge  competitions being held in 2019.  The agency will also continue its annual ECSC. Its  support to national and European activities will be  aimed at schoolchildren and university students, as  well as young talent and security practitioners from  the industry. The goal will be to increase interest and  future opportunities in NIS for these communities by  promoting excellence in the form of competitions.  In order to do so, ENISA is attracting a large number  of participants from different Member States for the  final European competition.  At the same time, ENISA is supporting additional  activities in order to measure and increase the  impact of the cyber competitions at both national  and European level and is participating in different  Commission events and initiatives to promote young  participants and put them on the spotlight.  1.3.3.2 Output O.3.3.2. European Cyber Security  Month deployment (priority 1)  ECSM continued its efforts to educate people in and  raise awareness of cybersecurity best practices. The  campaign outperformed expectations, as evidenced  by the increased number of participants and activities,  and the increased engagement year-on-year. In 2018  ENISA focused on reaching the general public via  social media, specifically during the week 2 theme  ‘Get Cyber Skilled’ for which it collaborated with  the European Schoolnet and the SaferInternet4EU  campaign of the European Commission.  1.3.4 Objective 3.4.

Cyber crisis  cooperation  1.4.1.1 Output O.4.1.1 — Cyber Europe 2018  (priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA organised two pan-European exercises:  Cyber Europe 2018 and CyberSOPEx 2018.  CYBER EUROPE 2018  Cyber Europe 2018 was the fifth pan-European cyber  crisis exercise organised by ENISA. The exercise  engaged around 900 participants, from the public  authorities and private companies, mainly in the  aviation sector, from all 28 EU Member States as well  as two EFTA countries, Norway and Switzerland.  The exercise simulated an intense realistic crisis  caused by a large-number of cybersecurity incidents  (over 600) that occurred during the 2 days, 6-7 June  2018. The exercise was built on three main pillars:  a.  the sound use of business continuity and crisis  management plans within an organisation  b.  national-level cooperation and use of  contingency plans  c.  cross-country cooperation and information  exchange  In addition, the exercise gave the opportunity for the  technical teams to test their skills in cybersecurity  with a vast variety of technical challenges, including  malware analysis, forensics, mobile malware,  advanced persistent threats, network attacks, IoT  device infection, etc.  The exercise brought up the importance of cooperation  between those involved in simulated cybersecurity  incidents (victims and authorities), security providers  and national authorities. It proved to participants that  only through information exchange and collaboration,  Sectorial representation in Cyber Europe 2018  Academia and research  Defence/ military  ICT  Other  Public/ Government  Transport–aviation  Hardware/ software industry  Information security  Internet and digital services  Security sompanies  Telecommunications  7 %  29 %  32 %  4 %  20 %  50 %  5 %  25 %  6 %  14 %  8 %  Sectorial Participation ICT Participation  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 35  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  is it possible to respond to such extreme situations  with a large number of simultaneous incidents.  We have witnessed a large number of instances  of public–private and private–private cooperation.  Participants had to follow existing business processes,  agreements, communication protocols and regulations  to effectively mitigate the situations presented to  them. Nevertheless, the level of preparedness varied  significantly between participants, the information flow  sometimes felt to be unidirectional and structured  private-public cooperation procedures were immature  or non-existent. The NISD identifies many of the  associated shortcomings and proposes measures to  improve the situation.  EU-level cooperation has undoubtedly improved  over the past years. In particular, technical-level  cooperation has proven mature and effective. The  introduction of the CSIRTs Network as defined in  the NISD has provided EU Member States with an  effective formal structure to exchange technical  information but also to collaborate in order to resolve  complex, large-scale incidents. The exercise proved  that at this level the EU is well equipped to respond.  Some minor gaps were identified and have already  been tackled by those involved. On the other hand,  operational-level cooperation was exercised to a  lesser extent. It is not so obvious how these levels  will interact in real-life, and furthermore how they  will implement the strategic vision of political leaders.  Future exercises will try to test these aspects as well.  Finally, the technical aspects of the exercise provided  an excellent opportunity for the cybersecurity teams  to enhance their capabilities and expertise to deal with  a variety of cybersecurity challenges. The operational  capacity as well as the technical skills in all participating  organisation proved to be at the highest level.  Participating teams from non-cybersecurity private  companies in the aviation sector analysed the majority  of incidents successfully, and proved that their skillset  is certainly very high. The only shortcoming in some  cases was not the lack of skills but the actual number  of available resources for IT security.  CYBERSOPEX 2018  In 2018, ENISA organised the CyberSOPEx pan- European exercise having as target audience solely  the members of the CSIRTs network. This was the  first time ever that the CSIRTs network took part in  an extremely useful activity, with the aim of maturing  technical-level cooperation in the European Union.  The high-level objective of this exercise was to  improve the CSIRTs network’s overall ability to  cooperate, focusing on testing the network’s standard  operating procedures, as well as the supporting  collaboration tools and infrastructures.  As planned, the exercise raised awareness of the  cooperation procedures among the members of the  CSIRTs network, trained participants in using the  cooperation infrastructures, such as communication  and information sharing, and finally contributed  to identifying the elements that can improve  cooperation and ultimately enhance trust within the  CSIRTs network.  1.4.1.2 Output O.4.1.2 — Lessons learnt and advice  related to cyber crisis cooperation (priority 1)  ENISA continued with the next phase of  development of the Open Cyber Situational  Awareness Machine (OpenCSAM) that aims at  supporting the ‘blueprint awareness’ and ‘reporting’  pillars. The specifications and a tender for the next  phase have been prepared based on feedback  received by relevant stakeholders from EU  institutions, the private sector and academia, who  beta-tested the first version of OpenCSAM.  1.4.1.3 Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities  for cyber exercise planning and cyber crisis  management (priority 1)  ENISA aims to develop, maintain and enhance  its ability to support all activities related to cyber  exercises. This ability includes the possession of  internal knowledge and expertise on the topic as well  as the supporting tools and infrastructures. The latter,  collectively called ENISA’s cyber exercise platform  (CEP), is of paramount importance in order be able  organise multiple complex and large-scale exercises  in a tractable manner.  Initial versions of CEP were conceptualised and  developed by ENISA as early as 2014. CEP aims to  host a number of services that ENISA offers to the  Member States and EU institutions, such as exercise  organisation and management, technical exercises,  competitions and training, etc.  In 2018, ENISA improved the existing infrastructure.  In particular, the efforts focused on:  (a)  Building new functionality, most notably the  Exercise Universe (see below);  (b)  Improving the design of the infrastructure;  (c)  Boosting the scalability features and  responsiveness performance;  36  (d)  Enhancing the user interface and user  experience; and  (e)  Safeguarding the cybersecurity of the  infrastructure.  The ENISA Exercise Universe, part of CEP, is a unique  type of cyber range. It is a set of IT systems and  applications that mimic real-world infrastructures in  an interactive way. These include mainstream media,  social media, corporate and governmental websites,  directories, repositories, etc. The Universe supports a  single-sign-on capability, allowing the user to browse  through the applications and services during an  exercise in the same way as they would in equivalent  real-life infrastructures. The Universe was tested  during ENISA’s organised exercises (see previous  section) and has received positive reviews, along with  feedback for further improvements in the future.  Finally, new content, challenges and material have  been developed in order to keep up the interest  of the stakeholders and make CEP a central tool in  cybersecurity exercising for all stakeholders.  1.4.2 Objective 4.2.

European Union computer  security incident response teams network  secretariat and support for European Union  computer security incident response teams  network community building (priority 1)  ENISA continued its support to the Commission  and Member States in the implementation of the  NISD, in particular in the area of CSIRTs as defined in  Article 12, which establishes the CSIRTs network. As  part of this activity, ENISA established the secretariat  of the CSIRTs network and actively supported  cooperation among the CSIRTs. The agency organised  meetings of the CSIRTs network, stimulated  discussion by proposing discussion topics, and hosted  a variety of tools in support of active cooperation.  It also provided its expertise and advice both to the  Commission and Member States, either in the form  of guidance or in response to specific requests. The  agency also supported this cooperation by developing  and providing guidance and good practices in the  area of operational community efforts, such as on  information exchange and secure communication, at  the request of the members of the CSIRTs network.  In particular, the agency was proactive in stimulating  discussions within the CSIRTs network. The aim was  to provide content to support discussions on policy  and technical initiatives according to the CSIRTs  network’s own work programme (2017-2022). In  2018, the CSIRTs network reviewed, updated and  adopted the mid-term objectives and goals of the  work programme, as well as the terms of reference  and rules of procedures, and formally handed its first  report to the Cooperation Group.  In addition, ENISA took an active role in supporting  CSIRTs in the CSIRTs network in activities relevant to  the Connecting Europe Facility work programme.  Trust is an important asset for CSIRT operations  and so ENISA continued the improvement of trust  levels in the network by providing trust-building  exercises and events in coordination with the CSIRTs  network’s governance. The agency continued to  improve, develop and secure the CSIRTs network  infrastructure for enabling a smoother operational  and collaboration environment (CSIRTs network  portal and other communication means), advancing  swift and effective operational cooperation in the EU.  1.4.2.2 Output O.4.2.2. Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between computer  security incident response teams and law  enforcement agencies (priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA broadened its scope of cooperation  between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Agencies  (LEAs), to also include the judiciary. Conclusions  were drawn in the areas of legal shortcomings and  trainings. Moreover, tools can be further leveraged by  all groups concerned. In addition, ENISA continued its  effort to support the EU-wide objectives on the fight  against cybercrime by liaising with its CSIRT and law  enforcement stakeholders in the EU by co-organising  its annual workshop with Europol and the European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3).  1.4.3 Objective 4.3. Response to Article  14 requests under community activity  1.4.3.1 Output O.4.3.1 — Response to requests  under community activity (priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA supported the European Union Agency  for the Operational Management of Large-Scale IT  Systems in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice  (eu-LISA) in its efforts to better enhance its proficiency  in cybersecurity and business continuity. In particular,  ENISA provided its expertise in exercise organisation  and scenario development, as well as offering  the fully-developed ENISA CEP to eu-LISA in order  organise a preparedness exercise for one of the vital  IT systems of the European Union.

ENISA consults with the Cooperation  Group for the guidelines on the  NISD, thus all the Member States  have deployed, to a certain extent,  these documents in all NIS sectors.  Furthermore, the NCAs have  incorporated the provisions of these  non-binding guidelines into their  national approaches to different  NISD requirements, e.g. incident  reporting, security measures for  OESs and security assessments,  thus making the OESs and the DSPs  in each Member State deploy the  ENISA guidelines.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 39  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  1.5 KEY RESULTS IN THE  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 5 —  ENABLING: REINFORCE THE EUROPEAN  UNION AGENCY FOR NETWORK AND  INFORMATION SECURITY’S IMPACT  Activity 5 covers the following two main objectives.   Management and compliance.   Engagement with stakeholders.  1.5.1 Objective 5.1. Management and  compliance  1.5.1.1 Management  The Executive Director is responsible for the overall  management of the agency.  To support the policy, legal and strategy activities of  the agency, a Policy Office unit was established. The  tasks covered by this unit include policy advice, legal  advice and coordination of the work programme.  During 2018, policy and legal advice extended to all  aspects of the agency’s work and included advice  in relation to both the operational and resources  departments of the agency.  In 2018 the Management Board Secretariat  continued to support the Management Board and  the Executive Board in their functions by providing  administrative assistance.  In relation to the Management Board, one ordinary  meeting and three informal meetings were organised  during 2018.  The Management Board portal was  maintained as well. Four meetings of the Executive  Board were held.  1.5.1.2 Data protection compliance tasks and data  protection officer  As of December 2018, Regulation 2018/1725 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data by the EU institutions,  offices and agencies12 is applicable to ENISA,  replacing the previous data protection regulation  (Regulation (EC) No 45/2001). Regulation 2018/1725  12  Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the  free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC)  No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC https://eur-lex. europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725  sets out the main tasks of the data protection officer  (DPO) as follows 13:    to inform and advise ENISA of its obligations  pursuant to Regulation 2018/1725 and to other EU  data protection provisions;    to ensure in an independent manner the internal  application of Regulation 2018/1725; to monitor  compliance with this Regulation, with other  applicable EU law containing data protection  provisions and with the policies of ENISA in  relation to the protection of personal data,  including the assignment of responsibilities, the  raising of awareness and training of staff involved  in processing operations, and the related audits;    to ensure that data subjects are informed of their  rights and obligations pursuant to Regulation  2018/1725;    to provide advice where requested as regards the  necessity for a notification or a communication of  a personal data breach pursuant to Articles 34 and  35 of Regulation 2018/1725;    to provide advice where requested as regards  the data protection impact assessment and  monitor its performance pursuant to Article 39 of  Regulation 2018/1725 and to consult the EDPS in  case of doubt as to the need for a data protection  impact assessment;    to provide advice where requested as regards the  need for prior consultation of the EDPS pursuant  to Article 40 of Regulation 2018/1725; to consult  the EDPS in case of doubt as to the need for a  prior consultation;    to respond to requests from the EDPS; within the  sphere of the DPO’s competence, to cooperate and  consult with the EDPS at the latter’s request or on  the DPO’s own initiative;    to ensure that the rights and freedoms of  data subjects are not adversely affected by  processing operations.  During 2018 one of the main tasks of the DPO was  to support ENISA’s transition from the previous data  protection framework to Regulation 2018/1725. To  this end, several actions were undertaken, including  guidance on the creation and maintenance of records  13  See articles 43 to 45 of Regulation 2018/1725 for a more  detailed description regarding the designation, position and  tasks of the DPO.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019  40  of data processing activities across the agency, a new  central register for the maintenance of these records,  internal policies for specific data processing activities,  guidance on the update of ENISA’s web services, etc. A  data protection training course was delivered by EDPS  in quarter 1 for all ENISA staff, followed up by specific  data protection presentations of the ENISA DPO later  in the year. The DPO and deputy DPO closely followed  the activities of the EDPS and the EU institutions’  network of DPOs and participated in relevant  meetings, discussions and information exchange.  1.5.1.3 Information Security Officer  The information security officer (ISO) coordinates  the information security management system on  behalf of the authorising officer. In particular, the  ISO advises the Corporate Service unit in developing  and implementing information security policies,  standards, guidelines and baselines that seek to  secure the confidentiality, integrity and authentication  of the agency’s information systems. The ISO is  instrumental in incident handling and incident  response, and in security-event monitoring. The ISO  also leads the security training for the agency’s staff  and provides security guidance on all IT projects,  including the evaluation and recommendation of  technical controls.  In 2018 the ISO undertook several activities in order  to enhance the security posture of the agency:    an updated risk assessment with a focus on  business continuity.    regular vulnerability scans of ENISA important  portals and assets.    awareness raising for ENISA staff    updated policies.    continuous monitoring.  Throughout 2018, several technical activities were  carried out in relation to information security, in  particular updating of security and information, the  creation of an and event management platform with  enhanced logging capabilities, and updating of the  incident repository was brought up to date. Another  comprehensive security posture assessment was  carried out with a focus on business continuity.  1.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement with  stakeholders and strong international activities  Under this objective are grouped some of the  tasks and activities of the agencies carried out in  collaboration with stakeholders.    National Liaison Officers’ (NLOs’) Network.    Permanent Stakeholders Group    Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities.    Outreach and image building activities.  National Liaison Officers Network  NLOs are key to the agency’s daily work. They are the  liaison between ENISA and the community of network  and information security experts and relevant  organisations in their respective Member State acting  as 'ambassadors' and ‘facilitators’ of ENISA’s work.  In 2018, ENISA enhanced its cooperation with the  NLO Network as the first point of contact for ENISA in  the Member States by implementing the ‘guidelines  on missions, principles and functioning of the NLO  network’ that were adopted at the Management  Board meeting of October 2017.  The annual NLO meeting took place in January 2018,  to better align the NLO activities to the ENISA Work  Programme, studies and events from early on.  Particular emphasis was placed on ENISA outputs,  expert groups and procurement for 2018 in view of  The current Permanent  Stakeholders Group is composed of three  nominated members who represent NRAs, DPAs  and law enforcement  authorities (Europol,the Office of  the Body of European  Regulators for Electronic  Communications and one  advisory body, the European Data  Protection Board).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 41  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  the enhanced role for NLOs decided at Management  Board level.  The agency maintained, and shared with the NLO  Network, information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities.  Information was sent to the members  of the NLO Network at regular intervals on upcoming  ENISA project-related tenders, vacancy notices, events  organised or contributed to by ENISA, etc.  Permanent Stakeholders Group  The Permanent Stakeholders Group was  established by the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013). The Management Board, acting  on a proposal by the Executive Director, sets up a  Permanent Stakeholders Group for a term of office  of 2.5 years.  The current Permanent Stakeholders Group is  composed of three nominated members who  represent NRAs, DPAs and law enforcement authorities  (Europol,the Office of the Body of European Regulators  for Electronic Communications and one advisory body,  the European Data Protection Board). The remaining  members are appointed ad personam, from Industry,  Academia and Consumer Organisations amounting to  34 members from all over the European Union. These  members constitute a multidisciplinary group and are  selected upon the basis of their own specific expertise  and personal merits.  The role of the Permanent Stakeholders Group is to  advise the Executive Director on the development  of the agency’s work programme and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders  on all related issues. For this purpose two annual  meetings were held in 2018, one in March and one  in November.  Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities  In 2018 ENISA sought to improve its focus on key  activities and engage with the highest possible  number of stakeholders. This includes the  institutional stakeholders (e.g. EU Institutions) and  other various groups such as national authorities,  academia, industry, citizens, etc.  The agency continued to develop various communica- tion tools and channels, including the website, with a  strong emphasis on social media and news.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the  Policy Office and Public Affairs Team, which will seek  the appropriate level of outreach activities to take  ENISA’s work to all interested parties and to provide  added value to the European Union.  Outreach and image-building activities  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for  all stakeholders. It is essential that EU citizens can  trust ENISA’s work.  Cybersecurity threats are increasing all over the world,  and Europe is no exception. With this in mind, ENISA’s  profile needs to be continuously strengthened.  The dissemination of the agency work is essential in  creating an NIS culture across the various actors in  Europe. ENISA is aware of this fact, and will aim to  reach all stakeholders who require information about  the work developed by the agency.  Several activities that will strengthen cybersecurity  awareness across Europe are planned in different  Member States, fulfilling ENISA’s mandate, mission  and strategy.  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 43ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 43  This section explains how ENISA delivered the  achievements described in the previous section. It is  divided into two subsections: 1) financial management  and internal control and 2) declaration of assurance.  2.1 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND  INTERNAL CONTROL  2.1.1 Financial management  2.1.1.1 Budget execution of European Union  subsidy (current year 2018 - C1 funds)  The excellent budget execution can be translated into  the following figures: the expenditure appropriations  for ENISA’s 2018 budget of EUR 10 786 374 were  committed at a rate of 99.9 % as at 31 December 2018.  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven ability of the agency to use the entrusted  funds efficiently in order to implement its annual  work programme and to manage its operational and  administrative expenditure.  The respective payment rate on expenditure  appropriations was 89.29 % in 2018. This payment  rate is high and demonstrates that the agency’s  ability to finalise its annual activities and to execute  the relevant payments within the year of reference  was maintained. The procurement planning, which  was moved forward to the end of the preceding year  (2017) and enabled the agency to launch projects  related to the work programme in early 2018,  contributed significantly to the improvement of the  payment rate of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.1.2 Amending budgets and budgetary  transfers  The following table summarises the impact of  budgetary transfers applied to the approved budget  distribution in the 2018 budget (C1).

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 45ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 45  PART II. Organisational management and internal control  2.1.2 Controls  2.1.2.1 Internal Controls  Risk management  The agency has implemented an organisational  structure and internal control systems suited to  the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which  it operates.  The analysis of the register of exception and of  the ex-post report combined with the result of the  independent auditors (ECA and IAS) provide adequate  and sufficient assurance as to the completeness and  reliability of the information reported.  Control effectiveness as regards legality  and regularity  The agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multiannual  character of programmes, as well as the nature and  complexity of the related financial transactions. To  mitigate the risks of errors, the agency implements  ex-ante verification to all its financial transactions.  In line with internal control standard (ICS) 8  (‘processes and procedures’), the agency has  produced the ex post control report for the financial  year 2017. The recommendations issued in the report  were addressed during the year to prevent future  reoccurrence of these exceptions.  Compliance and effectiveness of internal  control standards  ENISA has adopted a set of ICSs, based on  international good practices, that aim to ensure the  achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  In 2010 the Management Board of the agency  adopted a set of 16 ICSs laying down the minimum  requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the agency, as  deemed appropriate.  The agency is planning to adopt the new internal  control framework in 2019.  Ex-post audit control and exception  In 2018, ENISA performed ex-post controls as part  of the internal control framework, for the financial  year 2017. A total of 269 financial transactions  were selected and checked, representing 13,82 %  of all of the agency’s financial transactions and  69,70 % of the agency’s 2017 budget. As a result, five  recommendations were issued.  Four of them are observations on administrative  procedures for which corrective measures have  already been taken. The last observation is related to  the late payment of the rent subsidy by the Hellenic  Authorities, which created a delay of payment from  the agency to its landlord.  In 2018 the agency recorded 33 exceptions of which  26 are under the materiality levels and are of minor  administrative nature with no financial impact.  The seven remaining, exceptions were due to a  posteriori commitments. Reminders have been  communicated to the respective project managers on  the legality of carry forward commitments. Controls  for the 2019 carry forward will be reinforced by  increasing the sample check.  Moreover, the ECA is in charge of the annual audit of  the agency, which concludes with the publication of  an annual report in accordance with the provisions  of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union. For several consecutive years,  the ECA’s reports have confirmed improvement in  the agency’s overall internal control environment and  performance.  Compliance regarding transparency,  accountability and integrity  The agency is committed to constantly being vigilant  and improving openness and transparency, with the  goal of helping EU citizens and any other stakeholders  understand how the agency is managed and being held  accountable. With this objective ENISA publishes a wide  range of documents and other relevant information on  its website (https://www.enisa.europa.eu).  In accordance with the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013), the Management Board is the  governing body of the agency. It is composed of  representatives of the EU Member States and the  European Commission. Its main role is to ensure  that the agency carries out its tasks in accordance  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  4646  with its operational and strategic objectives, as  adopted by the agency’s annual and multiannual  work programme. It also supervises all budgetary and  administrative matters.  To ensure transparency on the decisions adopted,  the internal rules of procedures for the Management  Board, the list of its representatives and alternates,  the minutes of meetings and adopted decisions  (including annual and multiannual work programmes)  are published on ENISA’s website.  The Management Board also has the responsibility  of appointing the executive director, who is  responsible for implementing the decisions adopted  by the Management Board and for the day-to-day  administration of the agency.  To ensure the transparency and accountability of  the executive function, the executive director has  the duty, among others, to provide an annual activity  report addressed to the Management Board in order  to assess ENISA’s activities. The Management Board  then, in turn, has to analyse and assess this report.  Once approved, and no later than 30 June of the year  following the year under review, the annual activity  report, which outlines the achievements for the year  and the resources used, is formally adopted and  communicated to the relevant stakeholders (namely  the European Parliament, the European Council, the  European Commission and the ECA). Once approved  it is made publicly available through ENISA’s website.  For further financial transparency, the annual  accounts (including the budgetary execution report)  and the annual adopted budget are also disclosed on  the website.  The executive director, representing the agency,  is accountable to the European Parliament for the  execution of the annual budget. The executive  director must provide to the European Parliament  all the information necessary for the discharge  procedure. The discharge procedure is a tool for  the Members of the European Parliament to check  how and to what end public funds have been spent.  The European Parliament can then decide to grant,  postpone or refuse a discharge for a specific year.  To help the European Parliament in the discharge  procedure, independent reviews of the agency take  place. On an annual basis, the ECA gives assurance  on the reliability of the annual financial statements  and on the legality and regularity of the transactions  conducted by the agency for the year under review.  The IAS conducts periodic audits on specific topics,  which are selected based on a risk assessment.  The results and follow-ups of these audits must be  included in the annual activity report (see previous  sections). Complementing the external and internal  audits, independent evaluations are carried out to  assess the performance and the long-term impact of  the agency’s operations.  To avoid situations that might impair its  independence or impartiality, the agency has  implemented a comprehensive set of rules on  preventing and managing conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, ENISA’s Management Board, Permanent  Stakeholder’s Group, Executive Director and officials  seconded by Member States on a temporary basis  need to make a declaration of commitments and a  declaration of any interests that might be considered  to be prejudicial to their independence. These  declarations are made in writing.  ENISA has adopted an anti-fraud strategy and  action plan. It achieved a significant result in terms  of awareness-raising by preparing and delivering  internal training on fraud prevention to its entire  staff. Periodic training is planned to ensure that staff  are continuously reminded of fraud prevention. As of  2018 fraud awareness training is included in yearly  ethics and integrity training, which is compulsory for  all staff.  In addition to the staff regulations, the agency is  developing a code of conduct for all staff that offers  comprehensive information and advice on a variety of  issues, ranging from ethics to compliance with legal  obligations. The aim is to ensure that all employees  share the values of ENISA as an open, accessible and  transparent organisation. Furthermore, in accordance  with the code of good administrative behaviour  issued by the European Ombudsman, ENISA aims a  2-week deadline to answer requests from citizens.  2.1.2.2 Audit observations and recommendations  This section discloses and assesses the observations,  opinions and conclusions published by auditors in  their reports as well as the limited conclusion of the  Internal Auditor on the state of internal control, which  could have a material impact on the achievement  of the internal control objectives, and therefore on  assurance, together with any management measures  taken in response to the audit recommendations.  Internal Audit Service  The IAS audit report on stakeholders’ involvement in  deliverables was issued in June 2018. Five non-critical  audit findings and related recommendations were  identified during this audit. ENISA has set up a specific  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 47ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 47  PART II. Organisational management and internal control  task force to ensure the adequate implementation  of the action plan agreed with the IAS. As of the  end of 2018, two recommendations have been  closed, while processes and procedures still need  to be revised and updated to address the three  remaining recommendations.  European Court of Auditors  Issued in 2018, the ECA report on the 2017 annual  accounts does not contain any critical audit findings.  Follow-up of audit plans, audits and  recommendations  The agency will continue to improve its internal  systems and remain vigilant with regard to possible  risks of its activity within the internal legal and  financial framework, in order to strive for the current  situation of non-compliance issues attested by the IAS  and the ECA.  Follow-up of observations from the discharge  authority  2016 discharge  Regarding the European Parliament decision  of 18 April 2018, the Executive Director of the  agency was granted discharge in respect of the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the  financial year 2016. The closure of the accounts  of the agency for the financial year 2016 was  also approved 14.  Measures implemented in response to the  observations of the discharge authority  The table above presents a summary of the main  observations and comments by the discharge  authority on the implementation of the 2016 budget  and the measures taken by ENISA.  14 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/ getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P8-TA-2018- 0153&format=XML&language=EN  Main observations by the discharge  authority  ENISA’s replies and measures  Inclusion of a standard chapter on transparency,  accountability and integrity in 2016 annual report.  As from the 2017 annual activity report a standard  chapter on transparency, accountability and integrity is  included (see previous section).  Considerable delay in the payment of rent for the offices  in Athens by the Greek authorities.  Regarding the payments from the Hellenic Authorities,  improvements have been made from the second  semester of 2018.  Difficulty in recruiting, attracting and retaining suitably  qualified staff  The agency has implemented social measures (e.g. a  schooling programme) to improve attractiveness and  retain qualified staff.  Absence of publication on the website of the CVs and  declarations of interests of the agency’s Management  Board and Executive Board members.  Declarations of interest, declarations of commitment  and CVs of ENISA Management Board representatives  can be found here:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/mb2019  Notes that a whistleblowing policy is being discussed  between the EU’s decentralised agencies and that a  common policy and guidelines will be adopted in 2018;  calls on the agency to report to the discharge authority  on the implementation of that policy  The whistleblowing policy was adopted by the agency’s  Management Board in August 2018  Points out that the agency has not yet provided any  specific initiative to improve transparency in its contacts  with lobbyists and stakeholders; calls on the agency  to enact a proactive lobby transparency policy without  further delay and to report to the discharge authority on  any measures taken addressing this issue; notes from  the agency's reply that they are in the process of writing  a policy addressing the issue  The agency will adopt in 2019 specific processes to  improve transparency in its contacts with lobbyists and  stakeholders  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019  4848  2.1.3 Assessment of the effectiveness of the  internal control systems  ENISA has adopted an internal control framework  based on international good practice, aimed at  ensuring the achievement of policy and operational  objectives. In addition, as regards financial  management, compliance with the internal control  framework is a compulsory requirement.  ENISA has put in place the organisational structure  and the internal control systems suited to the  achievement of the policy and internal control  objectives, in accordance with the standards and  having due regard to the risks associated with the  environment in which it operates.  Based on the most relevant key indicators and  control results, ENISA has assessed the effectiveness,  efficiency and economy of the control system  and reached a positive conclusion on the cost- effectiveness of controls.  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that, overall, suitable controls are in  place and working as intended; risks are being  appropriately monitored and mitigated; and  necessary improvements and reinforcements are  being implemented.  2.2 DECLARATION OF ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view 15.  state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in this report have  been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, and  that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of  the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year  of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the agency.  Heraklion, 30. 6. 2019  [signed]  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director  15  True and fair in this context means a reliable, complete and accurate view on the state of ENISA’s affairs.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 49ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 49  PART II. Organisational management and internal control  2.2.1 Review of the elements supporting  assurance  The risk framework is used as a common means  of classifying and communicating risk across the  agency. It provides a common understanding and  language regarding risk, along with a structure for the  assessment, reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk  framework defines the categories, subcategories and  business risks applicable at the organisational level  for ENISA as a whole. It includes:    risk categories and subcategories;    risks specific to each category (business risks);    risk definition.  The agency’s operations are channelled through  the following activity areas that belong to  administrative functions.    Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with ENISA’s programming document in terms of  operational and administrative activities.    Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be insourced  by the agency. External agents are appointed  either through a procurement procedure or  through a call for expressions of interest for  funding related to the shared organisation of  events. Alternatively, in the case of working group  members, they may be chosen by means of a  selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its  administrative activities, the agency has carried out  the activities presented in the table below.  2.2.2 Human resources management  As at 31 December 2018, 74 statutory staff were  employed by the agency (44 temporary agents (TAs),  27 contract agents (CAs) and three seconded national  experts (SNEs))  . Despite the great efforts made  in the selection procedures the agency’s attraction  and retention capability is still suffering from a low  country coefficient factor and the fact that contract  agent posts are not financially competitive in the  cybersecurity job market.  In relation to schooling in Athens, where no European  Schools are based, several service-level agreements  have been concluded with each of the private schools  being used by the children of ENISA staff members.  Several children of staff members at ENISA Heraklion  attended the European School in Heraklion in 2018,  which offers education at nursery, primary and  secondary levels. ENISA has a service-level agreement  with the Commission’s Directorate-General for  Human Resources and Security for the provision  of these services. In total five pupils attended the  European School in Heraklion and 49 pupils attended  crèche and schools in Athens.  The organisational chart, establishment plan and  statistics for ENISA staff are included in Annex A.1.  5050  Nr Systemic process Activity Performance indicator  1  Follow up on auditor’s comments  and recommendations regarding  administrative practices  and procedures as they are  implemented in line with financial  regulation, implementing rules  and the Staff Regulations.

The Management Board received a copy of the 2018 Annual Activity Report produced  by the Executive Director of ENISA in his quality of Authorising Officer for the  implementation of the annual budget on 21 June 2019.  In analysing and assessing the AAR 2018, the Management Board makes the following  conclusions:    The AAR presents key results of the implementation of the ENISA Work programme  2018 and leads to conclusion that the Agency completed all deliverables agreed with  the Management Board in the Work Programme 2018.    ENISA produced 40 reports on different aspects of network and information security.  A relevant set of published reports, papers, workshops, meetings and events are listed  as part of the result achieved by the Agency. Impact indicators show that the Agency's  results exceeded the targets established in the Work Programme 2018, against the  framework of the ENISA Strategy 2016-2020.    At the same time, there was an increased focus on communicating ENISA’s work and  concepts to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission,  along with other EU agencies. In 2018 following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA  organised several events such as the Annual Privacy Forum, IoT Security Conference  and the Cyber Exercise.    Two major European projects were also supported by ENISA: the EU Cyber Security  Month — a specific month dedicated to activities on cybersecurity and security/ privacy awareness— and the EU Cybersecurity Challenge event — a competition  based on a series of technical challenges between teams of students from different  Member States.    Overall, the AAR is in line with the ENISA Work Programme 2018 and ENISA’s work  is well aligned with the overall European Union agenda for digital single market.  A coherent link is provided between activities planned in the Work Programme 2018  and the actual achievements reached in the reporting period.    The AAR also describes ENISA’s management of resources and the budget execution  of the EU subsidy. The expenditure appropriations were committed at a rate of 99.9 %.  The respective payment rate on expenditure appropriations was 89,25% in 2018.    The AAR also provides a follow up of the 2016 Discharge and control results. The  agency has three open recommendations from the Internal Audit Service in 2018. This  section also notes the main categories of deviation that led to exceptions reported. In  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 3  2018 the agency recorded 33 exceptions. 26 of them are under the materiality levels  and are minor administrative nature with no financial impact.  Of the seven remaining,  a posteriori commitments were reported.    The AAR leads to conclusions that the adequate management of risks, high level of  transparency, data protection, business continuity, as well as efforts were undertaken  to improve overall efficiency in all activities.    The annexes complete the AAR with a declaration of assurance of the Executive  Director as well as additional information on human and financial resources, draft  annual accounts and financial reports, as well as performance information included  in evaluations.  Overall, the Management Board takes note of the achievements of ENISA in 2018. The  Management Board notes with satisfaction that ENISA could deliver work programme  2018 in spite of high staff turnover and under condition of limited budgetary resources.  The Management Board expresses its appreciation to the Executive Director and his staff  for their commitment and achievements throughout the year.  The Management Board notes that the Executive Director has no critical issues to report  which would affect the presentation of the annual accounts for the financial year 2018 to  the discharge authority.  In light of the above assessment, the Management Board requests the Management  Board Secretariat to forward the AAR, together with this assessment, to the European  Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, the Permanent Representations of  the Member States and the Court of Auditors.  41  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ENISA Management board assessment 2 A message from the Executive Director 8 Introduction 11  PART I  ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE 2018 WORK PROGRAMME 17  1.1  KEY RESULTS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 1 — EXPERTISE: ANTICIPATE AND SUPPORT  EUROPE IN FACING EMERGING NETWORK AND INFORMATION SECURITY CHALLENGES 18 1.1.1 Objective 1.1.

ENISA delivered on the priorities set out in the work programme including  vital work in areas supporting the digital single market.  The year 2018 saw successful negotiations on the proposed Cybersecurity Act, including  the new mandate for ENISA, which will allow the agency to better serve the cybersecurity  needs of Europe. A political agreement on the Cybersecurity Act was reached in  December 2018 establishing a permanent mandate and reinforced role for ENISA. The  cybersecurity certification framework that was agreed will offer an opportunity for ENISA  to prepare candidate schemes.  Additionally, 2018 was also a year where the majority of EU Member States transposed  the directive on network and information systems directive (NISD), which ENISA  supported by contributing to the work of the Cooperation Group and developing the  computer security incident response teams (CSIRT) network. The successful outcome of  this implementation and that of the second payment services directive means that we are  enhancing Europe's cybersecurity but also increasing trust in the digital single market.  ENISA continued working on its annual flagship deliverables such as the cyber exercises,  the Annual Privacy Forum, the internet of things (IoT) security conference and the  cyberthreat landscape.  The CSIRTs network has also developed its midterm work  programme objectives. The ENISA inventory of incident response teams listed 383  teams in December 2018 compared to 342 at the end of previous year demonstrating a  continual growth of incident response capabilities in Europe. ENISA continues to support  EU Member States in developing a harmonised approach to supervision of security  requirements and cybersecurity breach reporting in the EU telecoms and electronic trust  services sectors.  ENISA fully achieved its 2018 objectives: it successfully completed the work programme  in a timely manner, within budget and in compliance with our legal framework, due  to the robust management of internal resources and implemented procedures. The  ‘introduction’ section contains a summary with highlights of ENISA activities during 2018.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 9  The agency has successfully reached its targets due to the commitment of its staff,  effective collaboration with its stakeholders and the valuable cooperation and direction  provided by the Management Board. I take this opportunity to thank the members of the  Management Board for their contributions and dedication during 2018.  As we look toward the future, there is no doubt that 2019 will be a challenging  year as the new Cybersecurity Act is adopted and ENISA will take on a new role in  cybersecurity certification.  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director, ENISA  1  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 111  THE EUROPEAN UNION AGENCY  FOR NETWORK AND INFORMATION  SECURITY IN BRIEF  ENISA was established in 2004 by Regulation (EC)  No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and the  Council. Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European  Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013  concerning the European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security introduced a small change  in the name, updated its objectives and extended its  mandate until 19 June 2020.  ENISA is a centre of expertise for network and  information security and cybersecurity in Europe.  ENISA supports the European Union and its Member  States in enhancing and strengthening their ability  and preparedness to prevent, detect and respond  to network and information security problems and  incidents. ENISA’s vision is to secure and enable  Europe’s information society and to use its unique  competencies to help to drive the cyber landscape  in Europe.  The agency works closely with members of both  the public and private sectors to deliver advice and  guidelines based on solid operational experience.  ENISA also supports the development of EU policies  and laws on matters relating to network and  information security (NIS), thereby contributing  to economic growth in the EU’s internal market.  Last but not least, ENISA coordinates the pan- European cybersecurity exercise, which is unique  in its scope and impact and brings together all of  the EU Member States every 2 years to test their  cooperation mechanisms while working in their own  operational environments.  THE YEAR IN BRIEF  The key achievements of 2018 are as follows.  ENISA produced 40 reports on different aspects of  network and information security. These include the  latest version of the ENISA threat landscape, guidelines  on assessing the security of digital service providers  (DSPs) and the compliance of operators of essential  services (OESs) with the security requirements set  out in the NISD. Additionally, ENISA reports focused  on an IoT security standards gap analysis, economics  of vulnerability disclosure and information and  communication technology (ICT) security certification  opportunities in the healthcare sector.  ENISA continued to strongly support the process  of assisting EU Member States in implementing  the NISD, the first piece of EU-wide legislation on  cybersecurity that provides legal measures to boost  the overall level of cybersecurity in the EU.  ENISA supported the organisation of the CSIRTs  network meetings in Greece, Bulgaria and Austria that  saw the participation of CSIRT representatives from  INTRODUCTION  12  all Member States, the European Commission and  the Computer Emergency Response Team for the EU  institutions, bodies and agencies (CERT-EU).  Following on from last year’s tradition, ENISA  organised several high-profile events such as the  fifth Network and Information Security Summer  School 2018 and a conference preparing for the  EU cybersecurity certification framework. Other  events included the ENISA industry event and the  Annual Privacy Forum. ENISA also hosted a number  of important thematic workshops and sessions,  gathering together experts in the field to discuss  cybersecurity topics.  Two major European projects were also supported by  ENISA: the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) a  specific month dedicated to activities on cybersecurity  and privacy awareness, and the European Cyber  Security Challenge (ECSC) event (a competition based  on a series of technical challenges between teams of  students and school pupils from different Member  States). The final stage of the ECSC 2018 took place  in London. More than 200 people representing 17  countries competed at this year's final.  The pan-European cybersecurity exercise, Cyber  Europe 2018, was successfully organised and  executed. Focusing on the aviation sector, it involved  close to 1 000 cybersecurity professionals from 30  EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA)  countries and over 300 organisations. In addition,  ENISA participated in the 2018 European Union  Hybrid Exercise, a multilayer exercise testing EU crisis  management mechanisms against hybrid threats,  including cyberthreats.  During 2018, the NISD was effectively implemented  across the EU. Throughout the year, ENISA supported  and contributed to the work of the Cooperation  Group and was instrumental in developing the CSIRTs  network. In the context of the Cooperation Group,  the agency supported notably the good practices on  interdependencies between OES and DSP information  security audit frameworks for OESs and incident  reporting under the NISD.  ENISA issued a number of ‘cybersecurity info  notes’ analysing various incidents over the year.  These information notes provided an overview of  significant incidents by establishing the context to  the materialised cyberthreats, thus complementing  the ENISA threat landscape report 2018. During 2018,  ENISA worked on a capability maturity framework for  cyberthreat intelligence, which will help its users to  understand their requirements and take informed  decisions on the desired maturity level.  Finally, the year ended with political agreement on  the Cybersecurity Act, which establishes a permanent  mandate for the agency and significantly expands the  scope of its activities.  While not being exhaustive, these achievements  amply illustrate the variety of ways in which the  agency contributes to a stronger and more secure EU.  ACHIEVEMENT OF STRATEGIC PRIORITIES  AND OBJECTIVES  In 2018, the agency delivered against its annual work  programme, and all outputs and deliverables met or  exceeded the key performance indicators set (see  Part I for more details). Notable achievements are  mentioned hereunder, along with examples of how  the agency reached its goals.  ENISA continued to deliver on the priorities of its  strategy, including work in areas supporting the  digital single market (and on specific technologies  such as the IoT), finance, privacy and trust. ENISA  further contributed to the implementation of the  NISD concerning baseline security measures for  OES sectors and DSP, as well as supporting the  implementation of the second payment services  directive (PSD2). The agency also supported the  Member States and the European Commission in the  NISD transposition.  Key achievements include the following.    In the context of the NISD, the agency built on the  work from previous years and produced a number  of deliverables supporting the respective working  streams established within the Cooperation  Group, including incident notification, baseline  security measures, the identification of OES (see  performance indicator for outputs O.2.2.2 and  O.2.2.6) and eElection security.    In supporting the implementation of the NISD,  ENISA strengthened its engagement with  stakeholders in specific OES sectors (e.g. air  transport, finance and healthcare) to better  understand and document examples of sectorial  specificities vis-à-vis the sectorial requirements.  Relevant input was provided to the Cooperation  Group (horizontal and sectorial standards) to  enhance its specific knowledge of these sectors  (see performance indicator for output O.2.2.6).    For the second time ENISA, together with the  National Security Authority of Slovakia, organised  a conference on critical information infrastructure  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 13  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  protection with the aim to bring together the  needs of security professionals, public authorities,  and the relevant industries for a constructive  dialogue. More than 100 experts from private as  well public sectors participated.    As part of its activities to develop good practices  and recommendations for IoT security, ENISA  organised together with the European Union  Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation  (Europol) the second IoT security conference  that was attended by over 350 participants and  achieved significant visibility in the community.  Additionally, more than 40 IoT stakeholders and  experts were involved in the relevant study,  including the ENISA IoT Security and Industry  4.0 Cyber Security Experts Groups and the  European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (see  performance indicator for output O.1.1.1).    Supporting the finance sector ENISA has developed  good practices for implementation of the PSD2.  For this study, more than 15 Member States as  well as more than 10 private financial institutions  were engaged in providing feedback. ENISA  organised the Financial Institutes - Information  Sharing and Analysis Centre (FI-ISAC) meeting  in Athens, where more than 35 participants  discussed the latest developments in cyber-related  issues in the sector.    ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of national  cybersecurity strategies (NCSSs) by developing an  evaluation tool and by further updating the ENISA  NCSS map. ENISA, building on previous years’  work, assisted the Member States in deploying  existing good practices in related areas and  offering targeted and focused assistance with  specific NCSS objectives. The evaluation tool was  created with the aim of helping Member States  evaluate their NCSSs in an easy, quick and user- friendly manner. Its objective was to help Member  States create second or third versions of their  NCSSs by evaluating their strategic objectives. The  tool functions by providing questions on specific  key performance indicators for each strategic  objective and then generating advice and ideas for  improving cybersecurity at a national level. More  than 20 Member States participated in ENISA’s  activities regarding this output (see performance  indicator for output O.3.1.2).    In 2018, the CSIRTs network reviewed, updated and  adopted its mid-term work programme objectives  and key performance indicators, the terms of  reference and rules of procedures, and formally  handed its first report to the Cooperation Group.    ENISA supported the operational readiness of  the CSIRTs network through well-established and  secure tools and communication.    The ENISA inventory of incident response teams  listed 383 teams in December 2018 against 342 the  end of the previous year. This steady increase in  the number of teams clearly indicates a growth in  incident response capabilities across Europe.    The 2018 edition of the Cyber Europe exercise was  the largest and most complex of its kind. Cyber  Europe 2018 was very successful, proving once  again the vast experience of ENISA in organising  operational as well as tabletop exercises. This  is also manifested in the numerous requests  that ENISA receives from both EU bodies and  national authorities to provide its support in the  organisation and conducting of exercises.    The ECSC held in London in October 2018 as  part of the ECSM was a major success. In less  than 5 years ECSC has been transformed from a  competition between five countries into a well- defined international event with the participation  of teams from 17 countries. ENISA plays a key role,  being responsible for the competition’s governance  model as well as gameplay, content, etc.    ENISA supported the European incident response  community in building a common language and  terminology for exchanging information in the  event of incidents, attacks or disruptions. The  Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working  Group was formally recognised as a working  group under the Task Force on Security Incident  Response Teams (TF-CSIRT) — the European  CSIRT community — and the first version of the  taxonomy was released on GitHub.    The agency continued supporting the Commission  and the Member States towards the establishment  of an EU cybersecurity certification framework  for products, services and processes. While  closely following the legislative process of the  Cybersecurity Act proposal, ENISA undertook  a study, in support of the Commission and EU  Member States that are participating in the Senior  Officials Group Information Systems Security  Mutual Recognition Agreement (SOG-IS MRA),  exploring aspects of a possible transposition of the  existing SOG-IS MRA to the new EU framework.  14    ENISA contributed asset models and a threat  and risk assessment to the network and  information system Cooperation Group (NIS CG)  Compendium on cybersecurity of election technology  (CG Publication 03/2018), which later became  part of the Commission’s recommendation to  Member States on the security and fairness of the  upcoming European Parliament elections.  KEY CONCLUSIONS ON FINANCIAL  MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL  ENISA’s staff conducted its 2018 activities in  compliance with the applicable legal and financial  framework, working in an open and transparent  manner and meeting the expected high level of  professional and ethical standards.  ENISA has adopted a set of internal control principles,  based on international best practices, aimed to ensure  the achievement of policy and operational objectives.  The financial regulation requires that the organisational  structure and the internal control systems used for the  implementation of the budget are set up in accordance  with these principles. ENISA has assessed the internal  control systems during the reporting year and has  concluded that the internal control principles are  implemented and function as intended.  In addition, ENISA has systematically examined  the available control results and indicators as well  as the observations and recommendations issued  by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) of the European  Commission and the European Court of Auditors (ECA).  These elements have been assessed to determine  their impact on the management team's assurance as  regards the achievement of control objectives.  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that, overall, suitable controls are in  place and working as intended; risks are being  appropriately monitored and mitigated; and  necessary improvements and reinforcements are  being implemented.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 15  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  I  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 17  This Annual activity report 2018 follows the structure of  the 2018 ENISA work programme to assist the reader in  understanding the achievements of the year. The 2018  work programme was aligned with the structure of the  ENISA strategy document 1, which was created with  the aim of supporting ENISA’s executive director and  Management Board in the production and adoption of  consistent multiannual and annual work programmes 2.  This strategy defines five strategic objectives that form  the basis of future multiannual plans 3.  These strategic objectives are derived from the ENISA  regulation, along with inputs from the Member States  and relevant communities, including the private  sector. They state that ENISA, in cooperation with  and in support of the Member States and the EU  institutions, will carry out the following tasks.  #Expertise: anticipate and support Europe in  facing emerging network and information security  challenges, by collating, analysing and making  available information and expertise on key NIS issues  1 ENISA strategy 2018-2020, available at: https://www.enisa. europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-strategy  2 In accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of  the European Parliament and of the Council concerning ENISA.  3 In order to achieve the multiannual strategic objectives laid  out in this document, the multiannual work programme  provides prioritised mid-term operational objectives to  be achieved by ENISA within a period of 3 years. Specific  annual activities (outputs) are identified in the annual work  programme, using a recursive approach in order to achieve  the mid-term operational objectives and, in the long term, the  strategic objectives.  potentially impacting the EU taking into account the  evolutions of the digital environment.  #Policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority, by assisting the  EU institutions and Member States in developing and  implementing EU policies and law related to NIS.  #Capacity: support Europe in maintaining state- of-the-art network and information security  capacities, by assisting the EU institutions and  Member States in reinforcing their NIS capacities.  #Community: foster the emerging European  network and information security community,  by reinforcing cooperation at EU level among  EU institutions, Member States and relevant NIS  stakeholders, including the private sector.  #Enabling: reinforce ENISA’s impact, by improving  the management of its resources and engaging  more efficiently with its stakeholders, including the  EU institutions and Member States, as well as at  international level.  In the following sections the results of the  implementation of the 2018 work programme are  presented for each of the abovementioned activities.  After the description of the specific results for each  activity and output, the achievements are presented  in tables against indicators and the detailed results  for each output.

Improving the  expertise related to network and  information security  1.1.1.1 Output O.1.1.1. Good practices for security  of the internet of things (priority 1)  IoT is at the core of operations for many essential  service operators as defined in the NISD, especially  considering recent initiatives concerning smart  infrastructure, Industry 4.0 4, 5G 5, smart grids 6, etc. IoT  security should thus be considered in this context 7.  The agency identified and analysed existing security  practices and standards in the area of IoT security  for critical infrastructure and smart infrastructure,  taking into consideration existing national expertise  and practices. ENISA compared these practices and  standards and developed good practices for IoT  security, with a particular focus on the impact on  end users.  In this endeavour the agency took into account  existing EU policy and regulatory initiatives (the NISD,  the communication ‘Internet of things — An action  plan for Europe’, the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation (AIOTI)  8 and the 5G Infrastructure Public– Private Partnership 9).  The agency developed targeted IoT case studies  to identify risks and vulnerabilities, by defining  appropriate attack scenarios, and provided relevant  recommendations and good practices. Moreover, it  defined IoT security requirements to ensure ‘security  for safety’.  4 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth- industrial-revolution  5 See https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/towards-5g  6 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-  consumers/smart-grids-and-meters  7 Nevertheless, non-critical operators, who might also be  involved in IoT activities, face no regulation and may have  little incentive to invest in securing their systems. Considering  the particularities of IoT, security should be seen as a primary  concern even for the latter operators.  8 More information on the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single- market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti  9 More information on the 5G Infrastructure Pubic–Private  Partnership (5G PPP) is available at: https://5g-ppp.eu/  The agency also validated the results of the study  (e.g. via joint workshops) with relevant national and  EU initiatives (e.g. the Alliance for Internet of Things  Innovation) and interacted with all important IoT  stakeholders from the public sector, such as the  Directorate-General for Communications Networks,  Content and Technology and the Joint Research  Centre and, and from the private sector, including  critical information infrastructure providers,  integrators and manufacturers.  This work built on the previous work of ENISA  in the areas of IoT, intelligent cars, smart cities,  smart hospitals and smart airports (2015-2016  work programme).  1.1.2 Objective 1.2. Network and  information security threat landscape  and analysis  1.1.2.1 Output O.1.2.1. Annual European Union  Agency for Network and Information Security  threat landscape (priority 1)  The ENISA Threat Landscape report 2018 provides  an overview of the top 15 cyberthreats identified  throughout the year. It includes both tactical and  strategic information about each cyberthreat,  including points of interest, trends, involved threat  agents, attack vectors and mitigation controls.  The report is produced based on information  collection of open source material, such as annual  incident reports, consolidated threat reports  of vendors, articles, blogs, etc. Based on this  information, an analysis and consolidation effort  is being performed. It results to an extensive  description of each cyberthreat. ENISA shared  the references of all relevant material collected  throughout the year. Interested stakeholders may use  this information to find technical details related to  each assessed cyberthreat.  The visualisation and quick availability of threat  information was set as priority in 2018. For this  reason, the ENISA threat landscape (ETL) has been  made available by means of an end user (web-based)  application that provides the entire ETL information  online (https://etl.enisa.europa.eu). In this manner,  ETL users are in a position to selectively access ENISA  threat information in an efficient manner.  In 2018, ENISA continued its cooperation efforts  with CERT-EU in the area of threat landscaping. This  was carried out through information exchanges,  use of CERT-EU services and organisation of  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth-industrial-revolution https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/fourth-industrial-revolution https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/towards-5g https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/smart-grids-and-meters https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/alliance-internet-things-innovation-aioti https://5g-ppp.eu/ https://etl.enisa.europa.eu  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 19  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  common meetings and events. By carrying out  this work, synergies with related experts (i.e. the  ETL Stakeholder Group) and vendors (through  memorandums of understanding) were maintained  and expanded.  1.1.2.2 Output O.1.2.2. Restricted and public  info notes on network and information security  (priority 1)  ENISA provides guidance on important NIS events  and developments through info notes. The general  info notes produced in 2018 covered significant  developments, events and announcements in the  field of cybersecurity.  ENISA provided balanced and  neutral information regarding events, issues, points  of action, mitigation measures, summaries, related  practices, etc. Hence, the objective of this work was to  provide regular updates containing a neutral overview  of the state of play regarding an incident.  1.1.2.3 Output O.1.2.3. Support incident reporting  activities in the European Union  For the seventh year, ENISA published its annual  report on significant security incidents in the  European electronic communications sector, which  are reported to ENISA and the European Commission  under Article 13a of the framework directive (Directive  2009/140/EC) by the national regulatory authority  (NRA) of each of the 28 EU Member States and two  EFTA countries.  The report published in 2018 covers the incidents that  occurred in 2017 and gives an aggregate analysis of  the incident reports about severe outages across the  EU. Some key findings from the 169 major incidents  reported include the fact that mobile telephony and  mobile internet are most affected; system failures  is the dominant root cause; and outages caused by  natural phenomena increased from 5% in previous  years to almost 20%, with extreme weather appearing  to be the primary cause.  ENISA supports a group of experts from the NRA,  called the ENISA Article 13a Expert Group. ENISA  organised three Article  13a meetings during the  year, which were attended by most of the EU NRAs  – typically 20-25 countries attend. The agency also  develops and maintains an online incident-reporting  tool for the NRAs to facilitate annual summary  reporting about incidents.  Under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation 10, every  year ENISA publishes an aggregate overview of the  incidents reported to national supervisory bodies  under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation, and  subsequently to ENISA as part of annual summary  reporting. The Annual report trust services security  incidents 2018 therefore marks the second full year of  annual reporting about significant security incidents  in the EU's trust services sector.  10 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and  of the Council on electronic identification and trust services  for electronic transactions in the internal market  20  In order to facilitate the process of incident  notifications, ENISA manages an expert group on  the matter called the ‘ENISA Article 19 Expert Group’  and composed of the supervisory authorities from a  number of Member States. The group meets twice a  year to debate incidents and incident reporting, along  with other topics.  ENISA also kicked off the work on incident reporting  under the NISD, which came into force in 2018. ENISA  developed, in close collaboration with the NIS CG, two  guidelines for NISD incident reporting, one each for  OESs and DSPs. ENISA also developed templates used  by the Member States in the first round of annual  summary reporting about significant incidents, to  the NIS CG.  1.1.3 Objective 1.3. Research and  development, innovation  1.1.3.1 Output O.1.3.1. Guidelines for European  standardisation in the field of information and  communications technology security (priority 1)  This activity provided a preliminary analysis of the IoT- related landscape of standards aiming at pinpointing  potential areas of improvement in securing the IoT.  Elements of a holistic approach towards IoT security  can be found in a series of standards; however,  further work is needed to achieve an overarching  approach that protects the entire IoT ecosystem. In  parallel, ENISA elaborated further on the thematic  area of privacy-oriented standards, considering the  developments at legislative, policy and standardisation  level. Through a respective study, the agency explored  how the standards-developing world is responding  to the fast-changing, demanding realm of privacy by  mapping existing available standards and initiatives in  the area and provided insights into the ‘state-of-the- art’ of privacy standards in the information security  context through a relevant gap analysis.  In carrying out this work, ENISA consulted with  representatives from academia, industry and  standards organisations (e.g. the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI),  the European Committee for Standardization,  the European Committee for Electrotechnical  Standardization) while also co-organising a well- attended conference and actively participating in  renowned standardisation conferences (e.g. ETSI  Security Week).  1.1.3.2 Output O.1.3.2 Priorities for European  Union research and development (priority 1)  Based on desk research and interviews with more  than 20 experts from academia, government and  private sectors, ENISA depicted the threats to  European society and the societal changes brought  by innovation in the digitally connected world. This  work was summarised in the report ‘Analysis of the  European R & D priorities in cybersecurity’ and was also  presented at the Research Working Group annual  meeting of the European Cyber Security Organisation  in order to support their work.  In addition, ENISA published a specific report on  the economics of vulnerability disclosure, which  highlighted the economic factors, incentives and  motivations that influence the behaviour of all  those involved in vulnerability disclosure, as well as  two case studies of recently disclosed high-profile  vulnerabilities.  During 2018, the agency offered support to the  National Public Authority Representatives Committee  by providing a secretariat function.  Moreover, ENISA participated in dissemination  meetings of some European Research funded  cybersecurity projects in order to identify the further  research efforts needed for making Europe “a global  leader in cybersecurity by 2025”, as stated at the  Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017.   1.1.4 Objective 1.4. Response  to Article 14 requests under  expertise activity  1.1.4.1 Output O.1.4.1 — Response to requests  under expertise activity (priority 1)  The national research institute of Poland requested  ENISA’s support in setting up their certification  framework, in line with the projected European one.  For this purpose, a workshop in Warsaw was held,  where representatives of all Polish stakeholders in  the area of certification were present. The workshop  provided for opportunity to discuss all burning  issues and laid the foundations for potential future  collaboration in this area.

Supporting European  Union policy development  ENISA provided high-quality information, data and  advice to support policymaking in the Commission  and Member States.  In the area of policy development the agency  collaborated with public- and private-sector  stakeholders to develop insights, reach consensuses  and provide recommendations in areas that further  develop its policy. Examples of such cooperation took  place in the domains of information technology (IT)  security certification and the digital single market.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 23  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  1.2.1.1 Output O.2.1.1 Support the policy  discussions in the area of certification of products  and services (priority 1)  As a first step towards sketching a point of reference  for policy-makers tackling the issue of cybersecurity  and establishing a relevant framework for policy  development, a study was produced to provide an  overview of representative application domains  of autonomous agents to complement relevant  initiatives at EU level by providing insights and  considerations, relating to both security and privacy.  The agency continued supporting the Commission  and the Member States towards the creation of  an EU cybersecurity certification framework for  products, services and processes. While closely  following the legislative process of the Cybersecurity  Act proposal, ENISA undertook a study, in support  of the Commission and EU Member States that are  participating in SOG-IS MRA, exploring aspects of a  possible transposition of the existing SOG-IS MRA  to the new EU framework. In parallel, emerging  application areas such as the healthcare sector were  analysed with a view to identifying and providing a  preliminary mapping of the aspects to be considered.  ENISA continued to stimulate dialogue with  standards developing organisations (ETSI, etc.), ICT  certification stakeholders (test labs, certification  and accreditation bodies, SOG-IS, the Common  Criteria Recognition Arrangement, etc.) and ICT  security products through the organisation of  two conferences on the broad thematic area of  cybersecurity certification framework.  1.2.1.2 Output O.2.1.2 Towards a framework for  policy development in cybersecurity (priority 1)  ENISA focused on providing an overview of  representative application domains of autonomous  agents and attempts to complement relevant  initiatives at EU level by providing insights and  considerations relating to both security and  privacy. In parallel to this activity, the agency also  touched upon privacy enhancing technologies  (PETs) and explored the notion of an online  platform where emerging technologies could be  maintained and evaluated. Lastly, a workshop with  a specific focus on the research and academic  community was conducted, in order to explore the  further evolution of this platform in the context of  privacy and security.  1.2.2 Objective 2.2. Supporting European  Union policy implementation  1.2.2.1 Output O.2.2.1 Recommendations  supporting implementation of the eIDAS  regulation (priority 1)  ENISA supported public and private bodies in  implementing the eIDAS regulation by addressing  technological aspects and building blocks for  trust services.  Specifically, ENISA developed a report on the global  acceptance of eIDAS audits, continued its work on  the assessment of eIDAS-related standards in order  to assist the European Commission in updating  the related implementing acts and organised the  fourth edition of the Trust Services Forum. These  were directed at all the stakeholders involved: trust  service providers, supervisory bodies and conformity  assessment bodies. More than 20 experts in the  area of trust services were involved in preparing and  validating the reports. The reports were disseminated  through different communication channels, including  the European Commission’s distribution channels, the  Article 19 ENISA Expert Group mailing list and ENISA  contacts from the Trust Services Forum. The findings  of the reports were presented in several different  workshops and conferences, including the Trust  Services Forum, the Article 19 ENISA Expert Group,  ETSI Security Week, World e-ID and the trust services  providers compliance info day on eIDAS, ETSI and  Certification Authority Browser Forum requirements.  Moreover, the fourth edition of the Trust Services  Forum received a high number of registrations and  was attended by over 130 participants that actively  contributed in the discussions and the panels.  1.2.2.2 Supporting the implementation of the  network and information systems directive  (priority 1)  ENISA is an active member of the NIS CG, the official  group for strategic collaboration and providing  guidance to Member States on the implementation  of the NISD.  ENISA supported, together with the Cooperation  Group, the development of a guideline and templates  for the implementation of Article 5(4), for Member  States to use when identifying OESs, notifying the  Commission about their identification of OESs, and in  notification of cross-border dependencies.  ENISA supported the development of templates  and tools for incident notification by taking stock  24  of incident notification templates and notification  methods in use across the EU, showing the different  approaches, commonalities and divergences. This  analysis has been circulated inside the NIS CG but  has not been published because in 2018 the situation  was uncertain as many Member States had not yet  transposed the NISD.  ENISA published a report on good practices regarding  interdependencies between OESs and DSPs with a  view to supporting OESs in their risk assessments.  In relation to the latter, an important element of  the risk to be assessed is the dependencies of the  services offered on other services of either OES  or DSPs. These dependencies might be national  or cross-border in nature. The report proposes  a four-phase interdependency identification and  assessment approach to the OESs, DSPs and  national competent authorities (NCAs) as well as  a set of recommendations to effectively address  interdependencies in their risk assessments.  The agency has involved the NIS CG as well as 19  stakeholders from the OES community to take  stock of the existing practices. The report has  been validated in a workshop, which took place in  Bratislava with more than 100 attendees representing  both the private and the public sectors.  ENISA is actively supporting the NIS CG and plays a  key role in all the NIS CG work streams, by drafting  guidelines and contributing to Member State  initiatives. For instance, ENISA contributed asset  models and a threat and risk assessment to the NIS  CG Compendium on cybersecurity of election technology  (CG Publication 03/2018), which later became part  of the Commission recommendation to Member  States about security and fairness of the upcoming  European Parliament elections. This compendium  is a broad set of guidelines that are based on the  experiences and best practices across the Member  States, and contains practical and workable  measures that can be taken by cyber security  organisations and election management bodies as  well as those advising or overseeing them to secure  the technology involved in elections.  ENISA also organised two NISD related workshops.  ENISA co-organised, jointly with NSU Slovakia  a cybersecurity workshop involving both OESs  and sectorial authorities on critical information  infrastructure protection (CIIP) and the NISD.  ENISA also organised the fourth eHealth Security  conference in cooperation with the Dutch Ministry of  Health, Welfare and Sport. The conference was hosted  by the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam.  1.2.2.3 Output O.2.2.3. Baseline security  recommendations for the operator of essential  services sectors and digital service providers  (priority 1)  ENISA, building on its expertise in security  requirements developed for DSPs and OESs,  worked closely with Member States and the private  sector to identify effective practices and security  maturity frameworks that would constitute the  basis for guidelines for Member States to assess  the compliance of DSPs and OESs with security  requirements set by the NISD. In this light, ENISA  published a report with guidelines on the use of  information security audit and self-assessment  frameworks. On the whole, this report aims to  provide guidance to the NCAs in auditing in line with  the security requirements of the NISD. The report  presents a complete set of options for NCAs to  meet these provisions. The agency worked in close  collaboration with the NIS CG and with experts from  the private sector to develop this report.  1.2.2.4 Output O.2.2.4 Supporting the payment  services directive implementation (priority 1)  The main goal of the PSD2 is to promote competition  and innovation in financial services and to protect  the security of payment services users. The PSD2  focuses on the use of technology in financial services,  introducing new technological requirements and  measures to guarantee the confidentiality, integrity,  availability, and authenticity of user information.  The main objective of this study is to identify the  good practices introduced by Member States in the  implementation of the PSD2. In particular, the aim  is to analyse the adaptation of the PSD2 guidelines  in the field of security, such as measures for  operational and security risks, and the notification  of major incidents. The study also provides a parallel  between the incident reporting mechanism and the  NISD incident notifications. Additionally, the security  measures identified in the PSD2 are mapped to the  security measures identified in the NISD.  1.2.2.5 Output O.2.2.5. Contribute to European  Union policy in the area of privacy and data  protection (priority 2)  Technical measures in the field of data protection  have been a key part of the involvement of ENISA  in this policy area in an effort to support the  implementation of the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR). In particular, in 2018 the agency,  on the basis of previous relevant work, elaborated on  the state-of-the-art with regard to security measures  for the protection of personal data (in correlation  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 25  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  with Article 32 GDPR). Moreover, the agency provided  two sets of guidelines related to the technical  implementation of GDPR in the areas of data  pseudonymisation and the notion of data protection  by default. In this sixth edition, the Annual Privacy  Forum was used to bring together key communities  across research, policy and industry to disseminate  work in this area. Cooperation activities with the  European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) and  national data protection authorities were continued  and further enhanced. In this context, two workshops  were also organised in the field of security measures  and data protection by design, in collaboration with  the data protection authorities of Italy and Greece.  1.2.2.6 Output O.2.2.6. Network and information  systems directive transposition (priority 1)  The European Commission developed an online  map to display the NISD transposition status in the  Member States. In order to avoid duplication of  efforts, ENISA  NISD tool does not display the NISD  transposition status but it facilitates the concept of a  ‘one-stop shop’ for the NISD.  Through this tool, ENISA is supporting the Member  States and the private sector by providing information  about the Member States’ relevant laws, their  adopted NCSSs and the appointed NCAs for both  OESs and DSPs.  The NISD tool is an interactive online tool and its  functionality includes:    links to the relevant national laws and regulations  in each Member State, as well links to documents  explaining OES identification, security measures  and incident notification requirements, etc.;    links to ENISA's relevant sectorial work or sub  sectorial work;    lists of the relevant NCAs for each sector (both for  OESs and DSPs);    hyperlinks to the webpages of these competent  authorities.  In addition, the tool also links to the ENISA NCSS map,  the European Commission’s NISD map, and ENISA's  CSIRTs network web page.  Moreover, for this output ENISA organised the first  Transport Cybersecurity Conference in cooperation  with the European Commission (Directorate-General  for Mobility and Transport), the European Aviation  Safety Agency, the European Union Agency for  Railways and the European Maritime Safety Agency.  This conference, which took place at the premises  of the European Maritime Safety Agency, brought  together public bodies and stakeholders from all  transport modes to look at the European regulatory  environment (NISD, Cybersecurity Act), its relevance  for the sector including in light of past incidents, and  to explore synergies among transport modes.  In addition, ENISA wrote technical guidelines on  the implementation of Article 5(7) together with the  Commission. The objective of the document is to provide  the Member States with non-binding technical guidelines  on how to implement Article 5(7) with a view to:  a)  avoiding unnecessary divergence or  inconsistencies when submitting information to  the Commission;  b) simplifying the submission process; and  c)  maximising the value of the information received  by the Commission as a means of the directive  implementation assessment.  1.2.3 Objective 2.3. Response to Article  14 requests under policy activity  1.2.3.1 Output O.2.3.1. Response to requests  under policy activity (priority 1)  The 2018 outcomes of the Article 14 requests under  policy activity are as follows.    In 2017, ENISA received a request from the  Commission’s Directorate-General for Health and  Food Safety to support the eHealth Network’s  activities on cybersecurity for healthcare, which  are carried out within the joint action on eHealth  (health programme 2017). In 2018, ENISA actively  participated in Task 7.3, ‘Data and system security’,  of work package 7, which addresses the issues on  ‘Implementation challenges and impact’.    ENISA received a request from the Directorate- General for Internal Market, Industry,  Entrepreneurship and SMEs to support the  implementation of the IT security requirements  introduced by the two new regulations on medical  devices, 2017/745 (medical device regulation) and  2017/746. In 2018, ENISA provided expertise to the  medical device regulation Cybersecurity Task Force  established by the Commission and is supporting  the Directorate-General for Internal Market,  Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs with respect  to the technical coordination of the project.    The Cooperation Group on cross-border  dependencies aims to establish voluntary  guidelines or recommendations that would help  26  Member States and their competent authorities  to assess and mitigate the cross-border  dependencies affecting their essential services.  ENISA provided a stocktake of the political and  regulatory frameworks of the EU relevant for  this work stream.    ENISA received a request from the Directorate- General for Energy to create a sector-specific  subgroup of the NIS CG, to establish a  cybersecurity guidance document for the energy  sector (tackling its specificities) and to provide  more formal support for the European Energy  Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (EE ISAC).    The National Cyber Security Authority of Greece  requested support for national operators of  essential services to raise their security awareness  and guide them through the adoption of best  practices in the NIS area.    The European Union Agency for Railways  requested support in NISD implementation  for the rail sector, especially support in the  development of a sectorial information sharing  and analysis centre (ISAC) for infrastructure  managers and railway undertakings, as well  as capacity building (organising training and  awareness-raising sessions).    The Austrian Presidency requested support on  creating an institutional map on cybersecurity  capabilities in Member States.    Austria requested help in drafting a reference  document on approaches in identifying OESs in  different Member States.    The Bulgarian Presidency requested support  in the preparation of a reference document on  a common taxonomy for large scale incidents and  crise that will include the preparation of a template  for situational reports describing the technical  causes and impacts of cybersecurity incidents.    The National Cyber Security Authority of Greece  requested the help of ENISA in support of identifying  good practices for the identification of OESs.    The European Central Bank requested support  in developing the EUROSystem red team  testing framework.    The European Union Aviation Safety Agency  requested support in developing the objectives of  the European Centre for Cybersecurity in Aviation,  in raising cybersecurity awareness and in the  sectorial implementation of the NISD.    A request was received from Poland on NISD  implementation, specifically concerning OESs  including examples of the approach to the  essential services definitions (with thresholds)  and identification of OESs, sectorial criteria and  thresholds for the incidents having significant  disruptive effect.    ENISA received a request from Cyprus and  delivered direct support to the Cypriot national  CSIRT by providing tailored technical training in the  areas of incident management, malware analysis  and memory forensics.  1.2.4 General results: achievement of performance indicators for Activity 2  Summary of outputs in Activity 2 — policy: promote network and information  security as an EU policy priority Outputs Performance indicator Achieved results  Objective 2.1.

Assist Member  States’ capacity building  1.3.1.1 Output O.3.1.1. Update and provide  technical training for Member State and European  Union bodies (priority 1)  In 2018 most of the activities in this area were aimed  at maintaining and extending the collection of good  practice guidelines and training for CSIRT and other  operational personnel. The agency supported the  development of Member States’ national incident  response preparedness by providing good practice  guidance on key elements of NIS capacity building,  with a focus on CSIRT training and services to improve  the CSIRT teams’ skills.  More specifically, the agency provided an update  of the technical training material, which is highly  regarded. The updated technical training material  is on network forensics and provides a new set of  materials that includes both; a thorough theoretical  introduction and three sectorial use cases that are  part of the hands-on section of the training material.  The scenarios allow the training to be delivered in a  modular way, tailored to the needs of the Member  State CSIRTs and their constituency. This was done  in order to reinforce Member State CSIRT skills  and expertise to efficiently manage cybersecurity  events. In this output, special emphasis was put on  supporting Member State CSIRTs and EU bodies with  concrete advice (like good practice material) and  concrete action (like CSIRT training). ENISA delivered,  upon request, direct support by providing tailored  technical training on incident management.  In 2018, ENISA further enhanced its methodology,  seminars and training on: (a) cyber crisis management  and (b) the organisation and management of  exercises. This activity included the development  of material and infrastructure for onsite and online  training on these subjects. In addition, this activity  covered the delivery of these training programmes  upon request.  As part of its continuous effort, ENISA maintains and  regularly updates its training material. In 2018, ENISA  also created new training material for the financial  sector. The training includes a case study based on  malware attacking a mobile banking application. The  new material is now part of the updated training  portfolio of the agency.  Finally, ENISA continued to support TRANSITS training  delivery, with three courses being successfully  delivered. TRANSITS provides trainings for both new  and experienced CSIRT personnel and to date has  directly trained more than 500 professionals in the  European region.  1.3.1.2 Output O.3.1.2. Support European  Union Member States in the development and  assessment of national cybersecurity strategies  In 2018 ENISA supported the Member States in the  development and assessment of NCSS by developing a  tool for evaluating NCSSs and by further updating the  ENISA NCSS map. ENISA, building on previous years’  work, assisted Member States in deploying existing  good practices in the related areas and offer targeted  and focused assistance on specific NCSS objectives.  The evaluation tool was created with the aim of  helping Member States evaluate their NCSSs in an  easy, quick and user-friendly manner. The objective  of the tool was to help Member States create second  or third versions of their NCSS by evaluating their  strategic objective. The tool’s functionality provides  questions on specific KPIs for each strategic objectives  and depending on the answers, the tool generates  advice and ideas for improving cybersecurity at  a national level.  In 2018, ENISA published a new version of the  online NCSS map. New features were included on  the map. At first, the EFTA countries were displayed  giving an overview of their strategic documents and  objectives. The list of all Member States’ strategic  objectives were enriched with more examples, giving  a clear outline of the status of each country. A new  field of past versions has been added in the map,  providing a complete overview of each country’s  strategies from past years.  ENISA also supported Switzerland by providing input  for a book developed by Deutor and Springer Verlag  that deals with best practice in cyber security for  states, companies, the IT industry, law enforcement,  the EU, international organisations and academia.  In addition, ENISA organised the sixth NCSS workshop  in cooperation with the Finnish Communications  Regulatory Authority. This conference focused on  the development, implementation and evaluation of  NCSSs and the creation of national, European and  sectorial ISACs.  30  Representatives from both the public and private  sector discussed about NCSSs, and shared best  practices for the creation and running of ISACs.  1.3.1.3 Output O.3.1.3 — Support EU Member  States in their incident response development  (Priority 1)  ENISA’s inventory of incident response teams listed  383 teams in December 2018, an increase of 41 teams  in 1 year. The steady increase in teams clearly indicates  the growth of incident response capabilities in Europe.  For almost 15 years, ENISA has been supporting  Member States and CSIRT communities in building and  advancing their CSIRT capabilities, and ENISA continues  to receive spontaneous requests from new teams all  over Europe to be included in its inventory.  In 2018, ENISA concentrated its efforts on assisting  Member States with their incident response  capabilities by providing a state-of-the-art overview  of the CSIRT landscape and development in Europe.  This study helps ENISA identify and draw conclusions  about the recent and current evolution of CSIRTs  and incident response capabilities in Europe towards  2025. Building on the existing knowledge gathered  in the European CSIRT inventory, this study aims to  delve deeper into the ‘blind spots’ that may exist in  this mapping. The study also points to interesting  trends and identifies important issues, for example  that more hardware vulnerabilities are being  discovered in the components that are at the basis  of our digital society and that the majority of these  components are developed and manufactured  outside of the EU. In close cooperation with the  NISD CSIRTs network, the agency supports the  development of Member States’ national incident  response capabilities by providing recommendations  on key dimensions of NIS capability building with  a focus on the development and efficient functioning  of national and sectorial CSIRTs.  The main objectives of this output in 2018 was to  help Member States and ENISA’s other incident  response stakeholders, such as the EU institutions,  bodies, and agencies, to develop, extend and deploy  their incident response capabilities and services  in order to meet the ever-growing challenges in  securing their networks. Another objective of this  output was to further develop and apply ENISA  recommendations for the CSIRT baseline capabilities  and maturity assessment framework. ENISA has  continued supporting cross-border CSIRT community  projects and tool development, as well as the global  dialogue about common definitions and the maturity  framework in the incident response domain.  1.3.2 Objective 3.2. Support European  Union institutions’ capacity building  1.3.2.1 Output O.3.2.1 Representation of the  European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security on the Steering Board of  CERT EU and representation of the EU agencies  using the CERT EU service (priority 1)  In 2018, the operations of CERT-EU were placed on  a formal legal basis by way of a draft arrangement  among a number of EU institutions. A Management  Board was created to supervise the activities of CERT- EU, and a number of EU bodies and institutions are  represented on it.  CERT-EU was set up to provide CERT services to the  EU bodies and institutions. ENISA is appointed to  CERT EU’s Steering Board to represent itself and a list  of EU agencies that may use their services.  In this context ENISA has been participating in the  Steering Board of CERT-EU and liaising with the EU  agencies on operational issues related to CERT-EU’s  activities in order to ensure that the viewpoints of  the EU agencies are adequately represented. The  cooperation with CERT-EU and role of coordination  between the EU agencies and CERT-EU has been  working very well and some important discussions  were held in 2018. The needs of the EU decentralised  agencies and ENISA are represented in the decision  taken by the Steering Board.  The growing need for IT  security professionals is widely acknowledged;  Europe has to make  an effort to attract  and retain talent in  cybersecurity and to  create solid and powerful  education, entrepreneur  and business structures  relating to cybersecurity.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 31  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  ENISA will continue to represent the views on the  evolution of services required by EU agencies in the  CERT-EU Steering Board.  1.3.3 Objective 3.3. Assist in improving  private sector capacity building and  general awareness  1.3.3.1 Output O.3.3.1, Cybersecurity challenges  (priority 1)  The growing need for IT security professionals is  widely acknowledged; Europe has to make an effort  to attract and retain talent in cybersecurity and, at  the same time, create solid and powerful education,  entrepreneur and business structures relating to  cybersecurity which will allow us to develop the  needed capabilities to prevent, react to and protect  citizens against cyberthreats. In order to promote  this capacity building on NIS among the emerging  young generation of cybersecurity experts in Member  States, ENISA will continue to promote and advise the  Member States on national cybersecurity challenge  competitions being held in 2019.  The agency will also continue its annual ECSC. Its  support to national and European activities will be  aimed at schoolchildren and university students, as  well as young talent and security practitioners from  the industry. The goal will be to increase interest and  future opportunities in NIS for these communities by  promoting excellence in the form of competitions.  In order to do so, ENISA is attracting a large number  of participants from different Member States for the  final European competition.  At the same time, ENISA is supporting additional  activities in order to measure and increase the  impact of the cyber competitions at both national  and European level and is participating in different  Commission events and initiatives to promote young  participants and put them on the spotlight.  1.3.3.2 Output O.3.3.2. European Cyber Security  Month deployment (priority 1)  ECSM continued its efforts to educate people in and  raise awareness of cybersecurity best practices. The  campaign outperformed expectations, as evidenced  by the increased number of participants and activities,  and the increased engagement year-on-year. In 2018  ENISA focused on reaching the general public via  social media, specifically during the week 2 theme  ‘Get Cyber Skilled’ for which it collaborated with  the European Schoolnet and the SaferInternet4EU  campaign of the European Commission.  1.3.4 Objective 3.4.

Cyber crisis  cooperation  1.4.1.1 Output O.4.1.1 — Cyber Europe 2018  (priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA organised two pan-European exercises:  Cyber Europe 2018 and CyberSOPEx 2018.  CYBER EUROPE 2018  Cyber Europe 2018 was the fifth pan-European cyber  crisis exercise organised by ENISA. The exercise  engaged around 900 participants, from the public  authorities and private companies, mainly in the  aviation sector, from all 28 EU Member States as well  as two EFTA countries, Norway and Switzerland.  The exercise simulated an intense realistic crisis  caused by a large-number of cybersecurity incidents  (over 600) that occurred during the 2 days, 6-7 June  2018. The exercise was built on three main pillars:  a.  the sound use of business continuity and crisis  management plans within an organisation  b.  national-level cooperation and use of  contingency plans  c.  cross-country cooperation and information  exchange  In addition, the exercise gave the opportunity for the  technical teams to test their skills in cybersecurity  with a vast variety of technical challenges, including  malware analysis, forensics, mobile malware,  advanced persistent threats, network attacks, IoT  device infection, etc.  The exercise brought up the importance of cooperation  between those involved in simulated cybersecurity  incidents (victims and authorities), security providers  and national authorities. It proved to participants that  only through information exchange and collaboration,  Sectorial representation in Cyber Europe 2018  Academia and research  Defence/ military  ICT  Other  Public/ Government  Transport–aviation  Hardware/ software industry  Information security  Internet and digital services  Security sompanies  Telecommunications  7 %  29 %  32 %  4 %  20 %  50 %  5 %  25 %  6 %  14 %  8 %  Sectorial Participation ICT Participation  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 35  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  is it possible to respond to such extreme situations  with a large number of simultaneous incidents.  We have witnessed a large number of instances  of public–private and private–private cooperation.  Participants had to follow existing business processes,  agreements, communication protocols and regulations  to effectively mitigate the situations presented to  them. Nevertheless, the level of preparedness varied  significantly between participants, the information flow  sometimes felt to be unidirectional and structured  private-public cooperation procedures were immature  or non-existent. The NISD identifies many of the  associated shortcomings and proposes measures to  improve the situation.  EU-level cooperation has undoubtedly improved  over the past years. In particular, technical-level  cooperation has proven mature and effective. The  introduction of the CSIRTs Network as defined in  the NISD has provided EU Member States with an  effective formal structure to exchange technical  information but also to collaborate in order to resolve  complex, large-scale incidents. The exercise proved  that at this level the EU is well equipped to respond.  Some minor gaps were identified and have already  been tackled by those involved. On the other hand,  operational-level cooperation was exercised to a  lesser extent. It is not so obvious how these levels  will interact in real-life, and furthermore how they  will implement the strategic vision of political leaders.  Future exercises will try to test these aspects as well.  Finally, the technical aspects of the exercise provided  an excellent opportunity for the cybersecurity teams  to enhance their capabilities and expertise to deal with  a variety of cybersecurity challenges. The operational  capacity as well as the technical skills in all participating  organisation proved to be at the highest level.  Participating teams from non-cybersecurity private  companies in the aviation sector analysed the majority  of incidents successfully, and proved that their skillset  is certainly very high. The only shortcoming in some  cases was not the lack of skills but the actual number  of available resources for IT security.  CYBERSOPEX 2018  In 2018, ENISA organised the CyberSOPEx pan- European exercise having as target audience solely  the members of the CSIRTs network. This was the  first time ever that the CSIRTs network took part in  an extremely useful activity, with the aim of maturing  technical-level cooperation in the European Union.  The high-level objective of this exercise was to  improve the CSIRTs network’s overall ability to  cooperate, focusing on testing the network’s standard  operating procedures, as well as the supporting  collaboration tools and infrastructures.  As planned, the exercise raised awareness of the  cooperation procedures among the members of the  CSIRTs network, trained participants in using the  cooperation infrastructures, such as communication  and information sharing, and finally contributed  to identifying the elements that can improve  cooperation and ultimately enhance trust within the  CSIRTs network.  1.4.1.2 Output O.4.1.2 — Lessons learnt and advice  related to cyber crisis cooperation (priority 1)  ENISA continued with the next phase of  development of the Open Cyber Situational  Awareness Machine (OpenCSAM) that aims at  supporting the ‘blueprint awareness’ and ‘reporting’  pillars. The specifications and a tender for the next  phase have been prepared based on feedback  received by relevant stakeholders from EU  institutions, the private sector and academia, who  beta-tested the first version of OpenCSAM.  1.4.1.3 Output O.4.1.3 — Support activities  for cyber exercise planning and cyber crisis  management (priority 1)  ENISA aims to develop, maintain and enhance  its ability to support all activities related to cyber  exercises. This ability includes the possession of  internal knowledge and expertise on the topic as well  as the supporting tools and infrastructures. The latter,  collectively called ENISA’s cyber exercise platform  (CEP), is of paramount importance in order be able  organise multiple complex and large-scale exercises  in a tractable manner.  Initial versions of CEP were conceptualised and  developed by ENISA as early as 2014. CEP aims to  host a number of services that ENISA offers to the  Member States and EU institutions, such as exercise  organisation and management, technical exercises,  competitions and training, etc.  In 2018, ENISA improved the existing infrastructure.  In particular, the efforts focused on:  (a)  Building new functionality, most notably the  Exercise Universe (see below);  (b)  Improving the design of the infrastructure;  (c)  Boosting the scalability features and  responsiveness performance;  36  (d)  Enhancing the user interface and user  experience; and  (e)  Safeguarding the cybersecurity of the  infrastructure.  The ENISA Exercise Universe, part of CEP, is a unique  type of cyber range. It is a set of IT systems and  applications that mimic real-world infrastructures in  an interactive way. These include mainstream media,  social media, corporate and governmental websites,  directories, repositories, etc. The Universe supports a  single-sign-on capability, allowing the user to browse  through the applications and services during an  exercise in the same way as they would in equivalent  real-life infrastructures. The Universe was tested  during ENISA’s organised exercises (see previous  section) and has received positive reviews, along with  feedback for further improvements in the future.  Finally, new content, challenges and material have  been developed in order to keep up the interest  of the stakeholders and make CEP a central tool in  cybersecurity exercising for all stakeholders.  1.4.2 Objective 4.2.

European Union computer  security incident response teams network  secretariat and support for European Union  computer security incident response teams  network community building (priority 1)  ENISA continued its support to the Commission  and Member States in the implementation of the  NISD, in particular in the area of CSIRTs as defined in  Article 12, which establishes the CSIRTs network. As  part of this activity, ENISA established the secretariat  of the CSIRTs network and actively supported  cooperation among the CSIRTs. The agency organised  meetings of the CSIRTs network, stimulated  discussion by proposing discussion topics, and hosted  a variety of tools in support of active cooperation.  It also provided its expertise and advice both to the  Commission and Member States, either in the form  of guidance or in response to specific requests. The  agency also supported this cooperation by developing  and providing guidance and good practices in the  area of operational community efforts, such as on  information exchange and secure communication, at  the request of the members of the CSIRTs network.  In particular, the agency was proactive in stimulating  discussions within the CSIRTs network. The aim was  to provide content to support discussions on policy  and technical initiatives according to the CSIRTs  network’s own work programme (2017-2022). In  2018, the CSIRTs network reviewed, updated and  adopted the mid-term objectives and goals of the  work programme, as well as the terms of reference  and rules of procedures, and formally handed its first  report to the Cooperation Group.  In addition, ENISA took an active role in supporting  CSIRTs in the CSIRTs network in activities relevant to  the Connecting Europe Facility work programme.  Trust is an important asset for CSIRT operations  and so ENISA continued the improvement of trust  levels in the network by providing trust-building  exercises and events in coordination with the CSIRTs  network’s governance. The agency continued to  improve, develop and secure the CSIRTs network  infrastructure for enabling a smoother operational  and collaboration environment (CSIRTs network  portal and other communication means), advancing  swift and effective operational cooperation in the EU.  1.4.2.2 Output O.4.2.2. Support the fight against  cybercrime and collaboration between computer  security incident response teams and law  enforcement agencies (priority 1)  In 2018 ENISA broadened its scope of cooperation  between CSIRTs and Law Enforcement Agencies  (LEAs), to also include the judiciary. Conclusions  were drawn in the areas of legal shortcomings and  trainings. Moreover, tools can be further leveraged by  all groups concerned. In addition, ENISA continued its  effort to support the EU-wide objectives on the fight  against cybercrime by liaising with its CSIRT and law  enforcement stakeholders in the EU by co-organising  its annual workshop with Europol and the European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3).  1.4.3 Objective 4.3.

To support the policy, legal and strategy activities of  the agency, a Policy Office unit was established. The  tasks covered by this unit include policy advice, legal  advice and coordination of the work programme.  During 2018, policy and legal advice extended to all  aspects of the agency’s work and included advice  in relation to both the operational and resources  departments of the agency.  In 2018 the Management Board Secretariat  continued to support the Management Board and  the Executive Board in their functions by providing  administrative assistance.  In relation to the Management Board, one ordinary  meeting and three informal meetings were organised  during 2018.  The Management Board portal was  maintained as well. Four meetings of the Executive  Board were held.  1.5.1.2 Data protection compliance tasks and data  protection officer  As of December 2018, Regulation 2018/1725 on the  protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data by the EU institutions,  offices and agencies12 is applicable to ENISA,  replacing the previous data protection regulation  (Regulation (EC) No 45/2001). Regulation 2018/1725  12  Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and  of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the  Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the  free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC)  No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC https://eur-lex. europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1725  sets out the main tasks of the data protection officer  (DPO) as follows 13:    to inform and advise ENISA of its obligations  pursuant to Regulation 2018/1725 and to other EU  data protection provisions;    to ensure in an independent manner the internal  application of Regulation 2018/1725; to monitor  compliance with this Regulation, with other  applicable EU law containing data protection  provisions and with the policies of ENISA in  relation to the protection of personal data,  including the assignment of responsibilities, the  raising of awareness and training of staff involved  in processing operations, and the related audits;    to ensure that data subjects are informed of their  rights and obligations pursuant to Regulation  2018/1725;    to provide advice where requested as regards the  necessity for a notification or a communication of  a personal data breach pursuant to Articles 34 and  35 of Regulation 2018/1725;    to provide advice where requested as regards  the data protection impact assessment and  monitor its performance pursuant to Article 39 of  Regulation 2018/1725 and to consult the EDPS in  case of doubt as to the need for a data protection  impact assessment;    to provide advice where requested as regards the  need for prior consultation of the EDPS pursuant  to Article 40 of Regulation 2018/1725; to consult  the EDPS in case of doubt as to the need for a  prior consultation;    to respond to requests from the EDPS; within the  sphere of the DPO’s competence, to cooperate and  consult with the EDPS at the latter’s request or on  the DPO’s own initiative;    to ensure that the rights and freedoms of  data subjects are not adversely affected by  processing operations.  During 2018 one of the main tasks of the DPO was  to support ENISA’s transition from the previous data  protection framework to Regulation 2018/1725. To  this end, several actions were undertaken, including  guidance on the creation and maintenance of records  13  See articles 43 to 45 of Regulation 2018/1725 for a more  detailed description regarding the designation, position and  tasks of the DPO.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019  40  of data processing activities across the agency, a new  central register for the maintenance of these records,  internal policies for specific data processing activities,  guidance on the update of ENISA’s web services, etc. A  data protection training course was delivered by EDPS  in quarter 1 for all ENISA staff, followed up by specific  data protection presentations of the ENISA DPO later  in the year. The DPO and deputy DPO closely followed  the activities of the EDPS and the EU institutions’  network of DPOs and participated in relevant  meetings, discussions and information exchange.  1.5.1.3 Information Security Officer  The information security officer (ISO) coordinates  the information security management system on  behalf of the authorising officer. In particular, the  ISO advises the Corporate Service unit in developing  and implementing information security policies,  standards, guidelines and baselines that seek to  secure the confidentiality, integrity and authentication  of the agency’s information systems. The ISO is  instrumental in incident handling and incident  response, and in security-event monitoring. The ISO  also leads the security training for the agency’s staff  and provides security guidance on all IT projects,  including the evaluation and recommendation of  technical controls.  In 2018 the ISO undertook several activities in order  to enhance the security posture of the agency:    an updated risk assessment with a focus on  business continuity.    regular vulnerability scans of ENISA important  portals and assets.    awareness raising for ENISA staff    updated policies.    continuous monitoring.  Throughout 2018, several technical activities were  carried out in relation to information security, in  particular updating of security and information, the  creation of an and event management platform with  enhanced logging capabilities, and updating of the  incident repository was brought up to date. Another  comprehensive security posture assessment was  carried out with a focus on business continuity.  1.5.2 Objective 5.2. Engagement with  stakeholders and strong international activities  Under this objective are grouped some of the  tasks and activities of the agencies carried out in  collaboration with stakeholders.    National Liaison Officers’ (NLOs’) Network.    Permanent Stakeholders Group    Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities.    Outreach and image building activities.  National Liaison Officers Network  NLOs are key to the agency’s daily work. They are the  liaison between ENISA and the community of network  and information security experts and relevant  organisations in their respective Member State acting  as 'ambassadors' and ‘facilitators’ of ENISA’s work.  In 2018, ENISA enhanced its cooperation with the  NLO Network as the first point of contact for ENISA in  the Member States by implementing the ‘guidelines  on missions, principles and functioning of the NLO  network’ that were adopted at the Management  Board meeting of October 2017.  The annual NLO meeting took place in January 2018,  to better align the NLO activities to the ENISA Work  Programme, studies and events from early on.  Particular emphasis was placed on ENISA outputs,  expert groups and procurement for 2018 in view of  The current Permanent  Stakeholders Group is composed of three  nominated members who represent NRAs, DPAs  and law enforcement  authorities (Europol,the Office of  the Body of European  Regulators for Electronic  Communications and one  advisory body, the European Data  Protection Board).  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 41  PART I. Achievements in the implementation of the 2018 work programme  the enhanced role for NLOs decided at Management  Board level.  The agency maintained, and shared with the NLO  Network, information on all relevant ENISA projects  and activities.  Information was sent to the members  of the NLO Network at regular intervals on upcoming  ENISA project-related tenders, vacancy notices, events  organised or contributed to by ENISA, etc.  Permanent Stakeholders Group  The Permanent Stakeholders Group was  established by the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013). The Management Board, acting  on a proposal by the Executive Director, sets up a  Permanent Stakeholders Group for a term of office  of 2.5 years.  The current Permanent Stakeholders Group is  composed of three nominated members who  represent NRAs, DPAs and law enforcement authorities  (Europol,the Office of the Body of European Regulators  for Electronic Communications and one advisory body,  the European Data Protection Board). The remaining  members are appointed ad personam, from Industry,  Academia and Consumer Organisations amounting to  34 members from all over the European Union. These  members constitute a multidisciplinary group and are  selected upon the basis of their own specific expertise  and personal merits.  The role of the Permanent Stakeholders Group is to  advise the Executive Director on the development  of the agency’s work programme and on ensuring  communication with the relevant stakeholders  on all related issues. For this purpose two annual  meetings were held in 2018, one in March and one  in November.  Stakeholders’ communication and  dissemination activities  In 2018 ENISA sought to improve its focus on key  activities and engage with the highest possible  number of stakeholders. This includes the  institutional stakeholders (e.g. EU Institutions) and  other various groups such as national authorities,  academia, industry, citizens, etc.  The agency continued to develop various communica- tion tools and channels, including the website, with a  strong emphasis on social media and news.  Dissemination activities are the responsibility of the  Policy Office and Public Affairs Team, which will seek  the appropriate level of outreach activities to take  ENISA’s work to all interested parties and to provide  added value to the European Union.  Outreach and image-building activities  ENISA´s image of quality and trust is paramount for  all stakeholders. It is essential that EU citizens can  trust ENISA’s work.  Cybersecurity threats are increasing all over the world,  and Europe is no exception. With this in mind, ENISA’s  profile needs to be continuously strengthened.  The dissemination of the agency work is essential in  creating an NIS culture across the various actors in  Europe. ENISA is aware of this fact, and will aim to  reach all stakeholders who require information about  the work developed by the agency.  Several activities that will strengthen cybersecurity  awareness across Europe are planned in different  Member States, fulfilling ENISA’s mandate, mission  and strategy.  II  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 43ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 43  This section explains how ENISA delivered the  achievements described in the previous section. It is  divided into two subsections: 1) financial management  and internal control and 2) declaration of assurance.  2.1 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND  INTERNAL CONTROL  2.1.1 Financial management  2.1.1.1 Budget execution of European Union  subsidy (current year 2018 - C1 funds)  The excellent budget execution can be translated into  the following figures: the expenditure appropriations  for ENISA’s 2018 budget of EUR 10 786 374 were  committed at a rate of 99.9 % as at 31 December 2018.  The overall performance demonstrates the already  proven ability of the agency to use the entrusted  funds efficiently in order to implement its annual  work programme and to manage its operational and  administrative expenditure.  The respective payment rate on expenditure  appropriations was 89.29 % in 2018. This payment  rate is high and demonstrates that the agency’s  ability to finalise its annual activities and to execute  the relevant payments within the year of reference  was maintained. The procurement planning, which  was moved forward to the end of the preceding year  (2017) and enabled the agency to launch projects  related to the work programme in early 2018,  contributed significantly to the improvement of the  payment rate of appropriations of the year (C1).  2.1.1.2 Amending budgets and budgetary  transfers  The following table summarises the impact of  budgetary transfers applied to the approved budget  distribution in the 2018 budget (C1).

ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 45ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 45  PART II. Organisational management and internal control  2.1.2 Controls  2.1.2.1 Internal Controls  Risk management  The agency has implemented an organisational  structure and internal control systems suited to  the achievement of policy and control objectives, in  accordance with the standards and having due regard  to the risks associated with the environment in which  it operates.  The analysis of the register of exception and of  the ex-post report combined with the result of the  independent auditors (ECA and IAS) provide adequate  and sufficient assurance as to the completeness and  reliability of the information reported.  Control effectiveness as regards legality  and regularity  The agency has set up internal control processes to  ensure the management of risks related to the legality  and regularity of underlying transactions. These  control processes take into account the multiannual  character of programmes, as well as the nature and  complexity of the related financial transactions. To  mitigate the risks of errors, the agency implements  ex-ante verification to all its financial transactions.  In line with internal control standard (ICS) 8  (‘processes and procedures’), the agency has  produced the ex post control report for the financial  year 2017. The recommendations issued in the report  were addressed during the year to prevent future  reoccurrence of these exceptions.  Compliance and effectiveness of internal  control standards  ENISA has adopted a set of ICSs, based on  international good practices, that aim to ensure the  achievement of policy and operational objectives.  As regards financial management, compliance with  these standards is compulsory.  In 2010 the Management Board of the agency  adopted a set of 16 ICSs laying down the minimum  requirements with which its internal control systems  need to comply. Previously developed internal  procedures were grouped together, prioritised and  implemented in the daily workflows of the agency, as  deemed appropriate.  The agency is planning to adopt the new internal  control framework in 2019.  Ex-post audit control and exception  In 2018, ENISA performed ex-post controls as part  of the internal control framework, for the financial  year 2017. A total of 269 financial transactions  were selected and checked, representing 13,82 %  of all of the agency’s financial transactions and  69,70 % of the agency’s 2017 budget. As a result, five  recommendations were issued.  Four of them are observations on administrative  procedures for which corrective measures have  already been taken. The last observation is related to  the late payment of the rent subsidy by the Hellenic  Authorities, which created a delay of payment from  the agency to its landlord.  In 2018 the agency recorded 33 exceptions of which  26 are under the materiality levels and are of minor  administrative nature with no financial impact.  The seven remaining, exceptions were due to a  posteriori commitments. Reminders have been  communicated to the respective project managers on  the legality of carry forward commitments. Controls  for the 2019 carry forward will be reinforced by  increasing the sample check.  Moreover, the ECA is in charge of the annual audit of  the agency, which concludes with the publication of  an annual report in accordance with the provisions  of Article 287(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of  the European Union. For several consecutive years,  the ECA’s reports have confirmed improvement in  the agency’s overall internal control environment and  performance.  Compliance regarding transparency,  accountability and integrity  The agency is committed to constantly being vigilant  and improving openness and transparency, with the  goal of helping EU citizens and any other stakeholders  understand how the agency is managed and being held  accountable. With this objective ENISA publishes a wide  range of documents and other relevant information on  its website (https://www.enisa.europa.eu).  In accordance with the ENISA regulation (Regulation  (EU) No 526/2013), the Management Board is the  governing body of the agency. It is composed of  representatives of the EU Member States and the  European Commission. Its main role is to ensure  that the agency carries out its tasks in accordance  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/  4646  with its operational and strategic objectives, as  adopted by the agency’s annual and multiannual  work programme. It also supervises all budgetary and  administrative matters.  To ensure transparency on the decisions adopted,  the internal rules of procedures for the Management  Board, the list of its representatives and alternates,  the minutes of meetings and adopted decisions  (including annual and multiannual work programmes)  are published on ENISA’s website.  The Management Board also has the responsibility  of appointing the executive director, who is  responsible for implementing the decisions adopted  by the Management Board and for the day-to-day  administration of the agency.  To ensure the transparency and accountability of  the executive function, the executive director has  the duty, among others, to provide an annual activity  report addressed to the Management Board in order  to assess ENISA’s activities. The Management Board  then, in turn, has to analyse and assess this report.  Once approved, and no later than 30 June of the year  following the year under review, the annual activity  report, which outlines the achievements for the year  and the resources used, is formally adopted and  communicated to the relevant stakeholders (namely  the European Parliament, the European Council, the  European Commission and the ECA). Once approved  it is made publicly available through ENISA’s website.  For further financial transparency, the annual  accounts (including the budgetary execution report)  and the annual adopted budget are also disclosed on  the website.  The executive director, representing the agency,  is accountable to the European Parliament for the  execution of the annual budget. The executive  director must provide to the European Parliament  all the information necessary for the discharge  procedure. The discharge procedure is a tool for  the Members of the European Parliament to check  how and to what end public funds have been spent.  The European Parliament can then decide to grant,  postpone or refuse a discharge for a specific year.  To help the European Parliament in the discharge  procedure, independent reviews of the agency take  place. On an annual basis, the ECA gives assurance  on the reliability of the annual financial statements  and on the legality and regularity of the transactions  conducted by the agency for the year under review.  The IAS conducts periodic audits on specific topics,  which are selected based on a risk assessment.  The results and follow-ups of these audits must be  included in the annual activity report (see previous  sections). Complementing the external and internal  audits, independent evaluations are carried out to  assess the performance and the long-term impact of  the agency’s operations.  To avoid situations that might impair its  independence or impartiality, the agency has  implemented a comprehensive set of rules on  preventing and managing conflicts of interest.  Accordingly, ENISA’s Management Board, Permanent  Stakeholder’s Group, Executive Director and officials  seconded by Member States on a temporary basis  need to make a declaration of commitments and a  declaration of any interests that might be considered  to be prejudicial to their independence. These  declarations are made in writing.  ENISA has adopted an anti-fraud strategy and  action plan. It achieved a significant result in terms  of awareness-raising by preparing and delivering  internal training on fraud prevention to its entire  staff. Periodic training is planned to ensure that staff  are continuously reminded of fraud prevention. As of  2018 fraud awareness training is included in yearly  ethics and integrity training, which is compulsory for  all staff.  In addition to the staff regulations, the agency is  developing a code of conduct for all staff that offers  comprehensive information and advice on a variety of  issues, ranging from ethics to compliance with legal  obligations. The aim is to ensure that all employees  share the values of ENISA as an open, accessible and  transparent organisation. Furthermore, in accordance  with the code of good administrative behaviour  issued by the European Ombudsman, ENISA aims a  2-week deadline to answer requests from citizens.  2.1.2.2 Audit observations and recommendations  This section discloses and assesses the observations,  opinions and conclusions published by auditors in  their reports as well as the limited conclusion of the  Internal Auditor on the state of internal control, which  could have a material impact on the achievement  of the internal control objectives, and therefore on  assurance, together with any management measures  taken in response to the audit recommendations.  Internal Audit Service  The IAS audit report on stakeholders’ involvement in  deliverables was issued in June 2018. Five non-critical  audit findings and related recommendations were  identified during this audit. ENISA has set up a specific  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 47ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 47  PART II. Organisational management and internal control  task force to ensure the adequate implementation  of the action plan agreed with the IAS. As of the  end of 2018, two recommendations have been  closed, while processes and procedures still need  to be revised and updated to address the three  remaining recommendations.  European Court of Auditors  Issued in 2018, the ECA report on the 2017 annual  accounts does not contain any critical audit findings.  Follow-up of audit plans, audits and  recommendations  The agency will continue to improve its internal  systems and remain vigilant with regard to possible  risks of its activity within the internal legal and  financial framework, in order to strive for the current  situation of non-compliance issues attested by the IAS  and the ECA.  Follow-up of observations from the discharge  authority  2016 discharge  Regarding the European Parliament decision  of 18 April 2018, the Executive Director of the  agency was granted discharge in respect of the  implementation of the agency’s budget for the  financial year 2016. The closure of the accounts  of the agency for the financial year 2016 was  also approved 14.  Measures implemented in response to the  observations of the discharge authority  The table above presents a summary of the main  observations and comments by the discharge  authority on the implementation of the 2016 budget  and the measures taken by ENISA.  14 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/ getDoc.do?type=TA&reference=P8-TA-2018- 0153&format=XML&language=EN  Main observations by the discharge  authority  ENISA’s replies and measures  Inclusion of a standard chapter on transparency,  accountability and integrity in 2016 annual report.

Considerable delay in the payment of rent for the offices  in Athens by the Greek authorities.  Regarding the payments from the Hellenic Authorities,  improvements have been made from the second  semester of 2018.  Difficulty in recruiting, attracting and retaining suitably  qualified staff  The agency has implemented social measures (e.g. a  schooling programme) to improve attractiveness and  retain qualified staff.  Absence of publication on the website of the CVs and  declarations of interests of the agency’s Management  Board and Executive Board members.  Declarations of interest, declarations of commitment  and CVs of ENISA Management Board representatives  can be found here:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure- organization/management-board/mb2019  Notes that a whistleblowing policy is being discussed  between the EU’s decentralised agencies and that a  common policy and guidelines will be adopted in 2018;  calls on the agency to report to the discharge authority  on the implementation of that policy  The whistleblowing policy was adopted by the agency’s  Management Board in August 2018  Points out that the agency has not yet provided any  specific initiative to improve transparency in its contacts  with lobbyists and stakeholders; calls on the agency  to enact a proactive lobby transparency policy without  further delay and to report to the discharge authority on  any measures taken addressing this issue; notes from  the agency's reply that they are in the process of writing  a policy addressing the issue  The agency will adopt in 2019 specific processes to  improve transparency in its contacts with lobbyists and  stakeholders  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization/management-board/mb2019  4848  2.1.3 Assessment of the effectiveness of the  internal control systems  ENISA has adopted an internal control framework  based on international good practice, aimed at  ensuring the achievement of policy and operational  objectives. In addition, as regards financial  management, compliance with the internal control  framework is a compulsory requirement.  ENISA has put in place the organisational structure  and the internal control systems suited to the  achievement of the policy and internal control  objectives, in accordance with the standards and  having due regard to the risks associated with the  environment in which it operates.  Based on the most relevant key indicators and  control results, ENISA has assessed the effectiveness,  efficiency and economy of the control system  and reached a positive conclusion on the cost- effectiveness of controls.  In conclusion, management has reasonable  assurance that, overall, suitable controls are in  place and working as intended; risks are being  appropriately monitored and mitigated; and  necessary improvements and reinforcements are  being implemented.  2.2 DECLARATION OF ASSURANCE  I, the undersigned,  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security,  in my capacity as authorising officer,  declare that the information contained in this report gives a true and fair view 15.  state that I have reasonable assurance that the resources assigned to the activities described in this report have  been used for their intended purpose and in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, and  that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of  the underlying transactions.  This reasonable assurance is based on my own judgement and on the information at my disposal, such as the  results of the self-assessment, ex post controls, the work of the internal audit capability, the observations of the  Internal Audit Service and the lessons learnt from the reports of the Court of Auditors for years prior to the year  of this declaration.  I confirm that I am not aware of anything not reported here that could harm the interests of the agency.  Heraklion, 30. 6. 2019  [signed]  Udo Helmbrecht  Executive Director  15  True and fair in this context means a reliable, complete and accurate view on the state of ENISA’s affairs.  ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2018 49ANNUAL ACTIVITY REPORT 2016 49  PART II. Organisational management and internal control  2.2.1 Review of the elements supporting  assurance  The risk framework is used as a common means  of classifying and communicating risk across the  agency. It provides a common understanding and  language regarding risk, along with a structure for the  assessment, reporting and monitoring of risk. The risk  framework defines the categories, subcategories and  business risks applicable at the organisational level  for ENISA as a whole. It includes:    risk categories and subcategories;    risks specific to each category (business risks);    risk definition.  The agency’s operations are channelled through  the following activity areas that belong to  administrative functions.    Own resources (staff) that carry out tasks in line  with ENISA’s programming document in terms of  operational and administrative activities.    Contractors that support operational activities and  other support activities that cannot be insourced  by the agency. External agents are appointed  either through a procurement procedure or  through a call for expressions of interest for  funding related to the shared organisation of  events. Alternatively, in the case of working group  members, they may be chosen by means of a  selection procedure.  To mitigate compliance risks with regard to its  administrative activities, the agency has carried out  the activities presented in the table below.  2.2.2 Human resources management  As at 31 December 2018, 74 statutory staff were  employed by the agency (44 temporary agents (TAs),  27 contract agents (CAs) and three seconded national  experts (SNEs))  . Despite the great efforts made  in the selection procedures the agency’s attraction  and retention capability is still suffering from a low  country coefficient factor and the fact that contract  agent posts are not financially competitive in the  cybersecurity job market.  In relation to schooling in Athens, where no European  Schools are based, several service-level agreements  have been concluded with each of the private schools  being used by the children of ENISA staff members.  Several children of staff members at ENISA Heraklion  attended the European School in Heraklion in 2018,  which offers education at nursery, primary and  secondary levels. ENISA has a service-level agreement  with the Commission’s Directorate-General for  Human Resources and Security for the provision  of these services. In total five pupils attended the  European School in Heraklion and 49 pupils attended  crèche and schools in Athens.  The organisational chart, establishment plan and  statistics for ENISA staff are included in Annex A.1.  5050  Nr Systemic process Activity Performance indicator  1  Follow up on auditor’s comments  and recommendations regarding  administrative practices  and procedures as they are  implemented in line with financial  regulation, implementing rules  and the Staff Regulations.

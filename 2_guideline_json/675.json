The online world offers the  convenience and ease of buying goods or paying for  services through payments via your computer, tablet or  mobile phone.  However, the use of online payments is not without its  risks. Every year, the finance sector reports losses in the  billions. According to the UK National Audit Office (1),  individuals lost £10 Billion in 2016, which translates to  almost 2 million cyber-related fraud incidents. If current  trends continue, online fraud may overtake plastic fraud  by the year 2020.  Based on a report from Worldpay (2), the EU will  continue to be amongst the leaders regarding the use of  digital wallets and conducting mobile payments in the  next three years. According to the report, digital wallets,  like PayPal and AliPay, are still considered to being the  norm for online purchases and their use will continue to  grow making them the number one payment choice for  online purchases in the next three years as meanwhile  the use of credit and debit cards will decrease.  In 2015 and 2016, the practices of the Society for  Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication  (SWIFT) came under SWIFT members’ scrutiny as they  allowed for too much discretion on the use of the end  equipment, which was thought to be a vulnerability.  Allegedly, a Central bank in Asia that used the SWIFT  network was involved in one of the major cyber-attacks,  which led to the loss of 81 million dollars (4). The SWIFT  November 2018  FINANCIAL  FRAUD IN THE  DIGITAL SPACE  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  network allows banks to process international transfers  each day and is considered to be the backbone of  international money movement. An organized crime  organization was able to obtain a bank employee’s  SWIFT logon, which they then used to take advantage  of previously cancelled or rejected payment requests.  They were able to alter the amounts and destinations  on the transfer requests and reissue them. As a result,  the crime organization was able to withdraw money  from specific bank branches at specific timing from the  other side of the world as well as launder it in gambling  establishments across the border.  In another attack early in August 2018, US $13.5 million  were stolen from India's Cosmos Bank (5). It was an  attack that has exposed limitations in the measures  banks use to defend against targeted cyber threats.  The attack was a more advanced, well planned, and  highly coordinated operation that focused on the bank’s  infrastructure, effectively bypassing the four main  OPINION PAPERS 1  OPINION PAPERS 2  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  layers of defence. As a result, the details sent from the  payment switch to authorize transactions were never  forwarded to the core banking system, so the checks  on card number, card status, PIN, etc. have never been  performed. Instead, the request was handled by the  malicious proxy deployed by the attackers sending fake  responses and authorizing transactions.  A similar attack was carried out against British Airways  in August 2018 (6), when credit card data was stolen  by injecting code directly onto the company’s website,  which is also used by the mobile app. Through the  injected code, credit card data was transmitted to a  website controlled by the criminals.  Stolen or compromised data usually is found in the Dark  Web where it is usually offered for sale in  Dark Web  marketplaces alongside other illegal content. Latest  exploits, drugs and stolen sensitive data (credit cards,  identities) are some of the most common items that can  be found there.  The Dark Web exists in the Internet, but requires  specific software to access it, e.g. The Onion Router  (ToR) or Invisible Internet Project (I2P). The idea behind  this type of network is that access is anonymous and  untraceable, although reports exists that government  agencies were able to find a way to trace and find  people using such services.  Hacking groups and hacking services can also be found  in the Dark Web. They offer different services like  network penetrations and/or denial of service attacks on  behalf of someone who is willing to pay.  In the Dark Web payments are usually conducted  via cryptocurrencies, mainly because these types of  payments only require a unique identifier from both  sides. This unique identifier is not officially associated  with any identity which makes payments difficult to  attribute to a specific person or organization.  CHALLENGES IN RESPONDING  TO ONLINE FRAUD In this article, online fraud is considered to be any  fraudulent activity done through any Internet related  means. Some key fraudulent schemes are using email,  websites or online communication messengers (e.g.  WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger) to conduct fraudulent  transactions or to trick victims into giving away their  personal information. In most cases, the criminals are  looking for bank logins, credit card data, or personal  data that can be used to impersonate a victim. There  are a wide range of challenges that the financial system  needs to tackle to protect against online fraud. They can  be split into technical and legal challenges.  2.1 TECHNICAL CHALLENGES  Phishing and social engineering  These schemes target the user by phishing emails and  social engineering exploiting different communication  channels (e.g. phone, email, SMS) and data about the  user available in the public domain (e.g. social media  sites, search engines). The data sought by attackers  using social engineering are often credit card data  and personal data that the user knows about. Stolen  credit/debit card or prepaid card details, can be either  monetized (e.g. sold in underground market forums like  the Dark Web) or used for fraudulent payments. Stolen  personal data of the user can be used for impersonation  attacks and for identity theft.  Malware  Malware is any piece of software or code that has a  malicious intent. Once again, in 2017 malware is the  most frequently encountered cyber threat, according  to the latest ENISA Threat Landscape (3). Also based  on that report, businesses have experienced far  more threats in 2017 than they had in 2016. Financial  malware still relies on web-based attacks. Most of the  known financial malware (i.e. Zeus, SpyEye, Carbanak,  and many others) take advantage of browser exploits  such as the latest one called Disdain or utilize man-in- the-browser techniques.  Uploading malware to Poinf-of-Sale (PoS) or automated  teller machines (ATMs) (e.g. Carbanak, Malum PoS)  exploits security weaknesses such as use of insecure  access to PoS or ATM devices. Once the malware is  installed on the terminal, the attacker can remotely steal  payment data that transact through the card readers  and conduct fraud.  OPINION PAPERS 3  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  Mobile devices threats  Mobile devices have become the norm today for  making online payments. Most of the threats affecting  these devices are very similar to a desktop computer  or a laptop, but due to its size, mobile devices offer  additional opportunities for an attacker.  Mobile devices usually  do not offer the same protection  as desktop PCs as they  rarely run an antivirus software, a  firewall, etc. With the introduction of new  mobile payment  services , they will  be a more interesting target for  attackers. Abusing a lost or stolen device to make online  transactions is a very common threat. Another could be,  installing malware on the device to tamper with or gain  access to mobile application for online transactions.  Payment systems compromise  Payment Service Providers (PSPs) offer terminals for  payments as well as aggregated payment services for  merchants by processing data from different channels,  including face-to-face (card present) payments, online  payments and mobile/contactless payments. PSP  payment gateways represent an interesting target for  attackers that seek to compromise the payment data  in transit from the merchants to the different acquiring  banks. Attackers might seek to compromise software  vulnerabilities, the payment gateways hosted at the  payment service providers for instance by exploiting  unauthorized access to payment gateways and  weaknesses in enforcement of internal payment service  providers’ security controls and measures.  Network Attacks  Denial of Service and/or Distributed Denial of Service  (DoS/DDoS) attacks targeting the availability of any  internet-exposed services hosted by payment network  organization (banks, payment service providers, etc…)  can affect online payment services. These attacks might  affect transactions that require real time access by  payment applications to the payment services. They may  also block the legitimate access for the consumers to  their bank accounts, and thwart online payments.  Man-In-The-Middle (MiTM) attacks against the POS and  ATM terminals are enabled by weaknesses regarding  the end-to-end encryption between the terminal and  the server. If encryption is not properly configured or  non-existent, information could be stolen and used  for abuse later. Attackers can also attempt to exploit  network security weaknesses such as a lack of firewalls  to protect the internal network or vulnerabilities in POS/ ATM software and misconfigurations (e.g. not enforcing  minimum privileges to access terminals and servers).  The complexity of the financial ecosystem makes it  difficult to recognize new attack vectors, as well as  attacks involving the abuse of connectivity between  multiple organizations in the system.  Third party trust  Cloud services are an on-demand service model for IT  provision often based on virtualization and distributed  computing technologies. More and more financial  institutions are moving their systems into the cloud. The  benefits of the cloud are very clear to the institutions –  cost savings, flexibility and resilience, are just some of  the key advantages.  With cloud services, the security model changes.  Although the liability stays with the financial institution,  some of the security controls are with the cloud  provider and this brings additional security challenges.  One of the key challenges that we have seen in cloud  adoption is isolation failure, which means that there is  no proper access to the resources. Another challenge  is the customer management interfaces of public cloud  providers, which are Internet accessible and mediate  access to larger sets of resources (than traditional  hosting providers) and therefore pose an increased risk  especially when combined with remote access and web  browser vulnerabilities.  2.2 LEGAL AND POLICY CHALLENGES  It is often argued that law follows technology. Finance is  another area where this mantra holds true. In the rush  to deliver business models that cut costs, appear more  convenient and flexible, the opportunity for financial  fraud in the digital world increases. The deployment  of new digital technologies continues to challenge law  makers and regulators. A mobile phone being used as  a digital wallet for transactions of cryptocurrencies will  pose a challenge for most lawyers and law enforcement  officials working in the digital ecosystem.  While the financial industry seeks to capitalise on the  use of digital technology and users follow as unwitting  or unwilling participants, some basic questions remain  unanswered from the end user perspective. The end user  has been pushed to using online platforms and mobile  apps that pose a challenge even to the most literate  computer user. But what happens when something goes  wrong and money is mislaid, lost or stolen? Is there any  insurance to cover the loss? And who is liable? Is it the  app manufacturer, the financial institution that promoted  these technologies, the security consultants who should  ensure that the technology is secure or the innocent end  users who will be accused of negligence and may thus  not be in a good position to defend themselves?  OPINION PAPERS 4  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  The concept of a zero-day software vulnerability is  mentioned scarcely and even more rarely understood  by many stakeholders in the digital financial transaction  process. What this means is that the exploit may allow  the confiscation of passwords, control of end user  computers or mobiles at a time where there is no  defence. Money can be moved to any part of the world  in under a second.  This type of issue is rarely communicated to end users.  While nobody is interested in undermining the need to  use digital financial services, the risks need to be fully  understood and addressed by all parties in an open and  transparent way across all Member States in Europe.  It is submitted that only when this type of challenge  is addressed that the necessary confidence of all  stakeholders will be achieved and legislators and  regulators have a clear role to deliver in this area.  EU’S RESPONSE TO ONLINE FRAUD  The European Union has recognized online fraud as a  major challenge and has produced numerous policy  initiatives to address the problem:    Directive (EU) 2015/849 on preventing the use  of the financial system for money laundering or  terrorist financing (4th Anti-Money Laundering  Directive)    Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in  the internal market (PSD2)    Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free movement of such  data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data  Protection Regulation)    Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on security of network  and information systems (the NIS Directive)    Proposal for Directive 2017/0226 on combating  fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means  of payment and replacing Council Framework  Decision 2001/413/JHA  The 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which amends  the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive was published  in the Official Journal of the European Union on 19 June  2018. The Member States must transpose this Directive  by 10 January 2020. The new revisions will include  virtual currencies, digital wallets and crypto currency  exchanges in its supervision. This inclusion is based  on the increasing use of crypto currencies by criminal  organizations in cases like ransomware (Petya, NotPetya)  and money laundering.  The EU institutions have shown a growing interest in  the security of electronic payments. This interest has  materialised in the Directive 2015/2366/EU (17) on  payment services in the internal market (PSD2).  In response to the start of the application of the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the processing  of personal data, the European Banking Authority has  published guidelines that aim at incident notifications, as  well as guidelines on security measures for operational  and security risks of payment services under Directive  (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2).  The Digital Single Market Strategy further acknowledges  the importance of a secure and trustworthy cyberspace.  In order to support the needs of cybersecurity, the  European Parliament and the Council approved the NIS  Directive concerning measures for a high common level  of security of network and information systems across  the Union. The NIS Directive defines common security  measures in terms of incident reporting and security  measures for the Operators of Essential Services (OESs)  and Digital Service Providers (DSPs). The NIS Directive  came into force on August 2016.  The proposal for the Directive on combating fraud  (2017/0226) is considered a major milestone as its idea  is to strengthen the Digital Single Market Strategy and  stop the organized cyber criminals in the EU. Its main  objective is preparation for new technology cyber-crimes  and cross-border cooperation.  The European Commission is pursuing the  implementation of the European Cybersecurity Strategy,  which, in combination with the European Agenda on  security, provides a strategic framework for initiatives  on cybersecurity and cybercrime. The European Union  works on different initiatives supporting and ensuring  cybersecurity, from enhancing the capabilities of the  Member States to supporting international cooperation  on cybersecurity and cybercrime. The following main EU  bodies specialized in these topics are:    The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security – ENISA    The European Cybercrime Centre within Europol – EC3  OPINION PAPERS 5  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  ENISA was established in 2004 to bring a high level  of network and information security to the European  Union. The Agency works closely together with Member  States and the private sector to offer advice and  solutions on cyber security related issues. In September  2017, the European Commission launched the cyber  security package, an important milestone for ENISA, as it  contained proposals on the new mandate of ENISA, and  on the EU cybersecurity certification framework within  the Cybersecurity Act.  Besides these activities, 2018 is a year in which ENISA  continued to invest in its core activities related to the  NIS directive, the recently adopted GDPR Directive,  eIDAS, European Cyber Security Month, European Cyber  Security Challenge, Internet of Things, eHealth, etc.  ENISA aims to strengthen cyber security in three main  areas: expertise, policy and capacity. Amongst the key  tasks of the agency are identifying the cyber threat  landscape and Computer Security Incident Response  Teams (CSIRT) cooperation. Although, cooperation is  on a more global level and related to many sectors, the  financial sector is one of the key sectors involved in the  information sharing.  ENISA was also one of the founding members of the  European Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and  Analysis Centre (FI-ISAC). The European FI-ISAC, is an  independent organisation, that was founded in 2008 to  facilitate the information exchange, e.g. between CSIRTs,  banks and law enforcement. The institution has signed  a Memorandum of Understanding with Europol EC3 to  improve co-operation between the European banking  community and European Law Enforcement Agencies.  Europol set up the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  in 2013 to strengthen the law enforcement response to  cybercrime in the EU. Since then, it has been involved in  many cyber-crime operations, one of the latest lead to  arresting a criminal organization which was responsible  for losses of EUR 1 billion. In March 2018, Europol’s  EC3 was involved in arresting the people behind  the Carbanak malware that was targeting financial  institutions. With the help of the cybersecurity group  of the European Banking Federation, EC3 was able to  identify related cyber incidents and trace financial flows.  OPINION PAPERS 6  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  THE WAY FORWARD  In general, it can be concluded that online or digital  access brings ease of use to the consumers, but it  also creates more requirements towards the industry  with regard to securing the online services. An  effective risks management program is of paramount  importance. Identification of new threats and modus  operandi needs to be included in the regular risk  management programme.  Based on the trends from ENISA’s latest threat landscape  report, the complexity of attacks and sophistication of  malicious actions in cyberspace will continue to increase.  This will require more collaboration between institutions  in the ecosystem to be able to respond to an ever- changing environment.  It is also safe to assume that most of the fraudulent  activity will move to the digital world and will require  additional measures to combat the threats. This also  requires developing the needed skill set, both for the  business side and for the regulatory side. Policy makers  need to create proper conditions that will lead to better  education in the area of cybersecurity. It will also require  the adoption of new technical and procedural measures  to understand emerging trends in malware, attack and  malicious infrastructure tactics and adapt defences  accordingly. Potential use of machine learning and  artificial intelligence methods may be something to be  desired in the future.  Recent developments in lawful interventions in cyber- space show the need to regulate various critical  elements of the threat landscape such as state support  of vulnerability discovery and utilization. These issues  will require the development of practices regarding  procedural, technical and legal aspects.  Governance Structure  In the cybersecurity strategy of the European Union,  the EU reaffirms the importance of all stakeholders in  the current Internet governance model and supports  the multi-stakeholder governance approach. Indeed,  the multi-stakeholder approach is fundamental to the  development of successful standards, particularly in the  area of Cybersecurity where public-sector requirements  are implemented to a large extent by private sector  service providers.  The European Commission has created the Cyber  Security contractual Public-Private Partnership (cPPP).  The aim of the partnership is to drive the cooperation  between public and private actors in the research and  innovation process in order to allow people in Europe to  access innovative and trustworthy European solutions  (ICT products, services and software).  Incident Reporting  In order to gain an overview of the EU risk situation and  on potential threat scenarios, the EU is dependent on  the input from national competent authorities. Only  with comprehensive data, the EU will be able to gain  knowledge on current dangers to the sector.  ENISA plays a significant role in this process by  providing support in the execution of aligned reporting  schemes at EU level. With the help of ENISA a consistent  implementation of incident reporting would make it  easier for the different Member States. Monitoring of  IT-infrastructure can be conducted by the institutions  themselves or, in cases of smaller institutions with  limited financial resources, by third parties. If needed,  institutions should be supported in the development of  the capacities for monitoring and incident reporting by  public agencies.  Mandatory security incident reporting should also  include obligations for competent authorities to report  back to the affected institutions and inform them about  security threats and other related issues. This will create  additional incentives for institutions to cooperate with  the government on incident reporting and ensures  that vulnerable institutions are informed quickly about  potential threats.  Trusted Information sharing  The identification of new threats and attack vectors is  something that the community needs to be able to share  and act upon in an efficient and effective manner. Being  able to quickly deploy new protection mechanisms, or  identify new attack patterns is something that will help  the community in limiting the losses.  An information sharing platform is something that  the EU commission has identified as something very  valuable. As a result, the CSIRT network, created by  the NIS directive, will use a common platform for  information exchange between Member states.  OPINION PAPERS 7  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  Risk management programme  An effective risk management programme that focuses  on mitigation of online payment application risks and  identifies measures including detection of possible  data compromise and fraud should be in place. To  this end, all players in the chain should have a reliable  and accurate fraud monitoring system, which reliably  detects transactions outside the customer’s baseline.  They should also be able to effectively prevent further  payments from a compromised online payment account.  To prove that adequate security measures are taken,  regular testing on critical points of the network should  be done. This should also be supplemented by the use  of a proper threat intelligence to follow the modus  operandi of the organized criminals. As the system is  very complex and involves many players, it should be  properly scoped and executed with minimal disruption  of the system.

More and more financial  institutions are moving their systems into the cloud. The  benefits of the cloud are very clear to the institutions –  cost savings, flexibility and resilience, are just some of  the key advantages.  With cloud services, the security model changes.  Although the liability stays with the financial institution,  some of the security controls are with the cloud  provider and this brings additional security challenges.  One of the key challenges that we have seen in cloud  adoption is isolation failure, which means that there is  no proper access to the resources. Another challenge  is the customer management interfaces of public cloud  providers, which are Internet accessible and mediate  access to larger sets of resources (than traditional  hosting providers) and therefore pose an increased risk  especially when combined with remote access and web  browser vulnerabilities.  2.2 LEGAL AND POLICY CHALLENGES  It is often argued that law follows technology. Finance is  another area where this mantra holds true. In the rush  to deliver business models that cut costs, appear more  convenient and flexible, the opportunity for financial  fraud in the digital world increases. The deployment  of new digital technologies continues to challenge law  makers and regulators. A mobile phone being used as  a digital wallet for transactions of cryptocurrencies will  pose a challenge for most lawyers and law enforcement  officials working in the digital ecosystem.  While the financial industry seeks to capitalise on the  use of digital technology and users follow as unwitting  or unwilling participants, some basic questions remain  unanswered from the end user perspective. The end user  has been pushed to using online platforms and mobile  apps that pose a challenge even to the most literate  computer user. But what happens when something goes  wrong and money is mislaid, lost or stolen? Is there any  insurance to cover the loss? And who is liable? Is it the  app manufacturer, the financial institution that promoted  these technologies, the security consultants who should  ensure that the technology is secure or the innocent end  users who will be accused of negligence and may thus  not be in a good position to defend themselves?  OPINION PAPERS 4  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  The concept of a zero-day software vulnerability is  mentioned scarcely and even more rarely understood  by many stakeholders in the digital financial transaction  process. What this means is that the exploit may allow  the confiscation of passwords, control of end user  computers or mobiles at a time where there is no  defence. Money can be moved to any part of the world  in under a second.  This type of issue is rarely communicated to end users.  While nobody is interested in undermining the need to  use digital financial services, the risks need to be fully  understood and addressed by all parties in an open and  transparent way across all Member States in Europe.  It is submitted that only when this type of challenge  is addressed that the necessary confidence of all  stakeholders will be achieved and legislators and  regulators have a clear role to deliver in this area.  EU’S RESPONSE TO ONLINE FRAUD  The European Union has recognized online fraud as a  major challenge and has produced numerous policy  initiatives to address the problem:    Directive (EU) 2015/849 on preventing the use  of the financial system for money laundering or  terrorist financing (4th Anti-Money Laundering  Directive)    Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on payment services in  the internal market (PSD2)    Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of  natural persons with regard to the processing of  personal data and on the free movement of such  data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data  Protection Regulation)    Directive (EU) 2016/1148 on security of network  and information systems (the NIS Directive)    Proposal for Directive 2017/0226 on combating  fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means  of payment and replacing Council Framework  Decision 2001/413/JHA  The 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which amends  the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive was published  in the Official Journal of the European Union on 19 June  2018. The Member States must transpose this Directive  by 10 January 2020. The new revisions will include  virtual currencies, digital wallets and crypto currency  exchanges in its supervision. This inclusion is based  on the increasing use of crypto currencies by criminal  organizations in cases like ransomware (Petya, NotPetya)  and money laundering.  The EU institutions have shown a growing interest in  the security of electronic payments. This interest has  materialised in the Directive 2015/2366/EU (17) on  payment services in the internal market (PSD2).  In response to the start of the application of the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the processing  of personal data, the European Banking Authority has  published guidelines that aim at incident notifications, as  well as guidelines on security measures for operational  and security risks of payment services under Directive  (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2).  The Digital Single Market Strategy further acknowledges  the importance of a secure and trustworthy cyberspace.  In order to support the needs of cybersecurity, the  European Parliament and the Council approved the NIS  Directive concerning measures for a high common level  of security of network and information systems across  the Union. The NIS Directive defines common security  measures in terms of incident reporting and security  measures for the Operators of Essential Services (OESs)  and Digital Service Providers (DSPs). The NIS Directive  came into force on August 2016.  The proposal for the Directive on combating fraud  (2017/0226) is considered a major milestone as its idea  is to strengthen the Digital Single Market Strategy and  stop the organized cyber criminals in the EU. Its main  objective is preparation for new technology cyber-crimes  and cross-border cooperation.  The European Commission is pursuing the  implementation of the European Cybersecurity Strategy,  which, in combination with the European Agenda on  security, provides a strategic framework for initiatives  on cybersecurity and cybercrime. The European Union  works on different initiatives supporting and ensuring  cybersecurity, from enhancing the capabilities of the  Member States to supporting international cooperation  on cybersecurity and cybercrime. The following main EU  bodies specialized in these topics are:    The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security – ENISA    The European Cybercrime Centre within Europol – EC3  OPINION PAPERS 5  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  ENISA was established in 2004 to bring a high level  of network and information security to the European  Union. The Agency works closely together with Member  States and the private sector to offer advice and  solutions on cyber security related issues. In September  2017, the European Commission launched the cyber  security package, an important milestone for ENISA, as it  contained proposals on the new mandate of ENISA, and  on the EU cybersecurity certification framework within  the Cybersecurity Act.  Besides these activities, 2018 is a year in which ENISA  continued to invest in its core activities related to the  NIS directive, the recently adopted GDPR Directive,  eIDAS, European Cyber Security Month, European Cyber  Security Challenge, Internet of Things, eHealth, etc.  ENISA aims to strengthen cyber security in three main  areas: expertise, policy and capacity. Amongst the key  tasks of the agency are identifying the cyber threat  landscape and Computer Security Incident Response  Teams (CSIRT) cooperation. Although, cooperation is  on a more global level and related to many sectors, the  financial sector is one of the key sectors involved in the  information sharing.  ENISA was also one of the founding members of the  European Financial Institutes – Information Sharing and  Analysis Centre (FI-ISAC). The European FI-ISAC, is an  independent organisation, that was founded in 2008 to  facilitate the information exchange, e.g. between CSIRTs,  banks and law enforcement. The institution has signed  a Memorandum of Understanding with Europol EC3 to  improve co-operation between the European banking  community and European Law Enforcement Agencies.  Europol set up the European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)  in 2013 to strengthen the law enforcement response to  cybercrime in the EU. Since then, it has been involved in  many cyber-crime operations, one of the latest lead to  arresting a criminal organization which was responsible  for losses of EUR 1 billion. In March 2018, Europol’s  EC3 was involved in arresting the people behind  the Carbanak malware that was targeting financial  institutions. With the help of the cybersecurity group  of the European Banking Federation, EC3 was able to  identify related cyber incidents and trace financial flows.  OPINION PAPERS 6  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  THE WAY FORWARD  In general, it can be concluded that online or digital  access brings ease of use to the consumers, but it  also creates more requirements towards the industry  with regard to securing the online services. An  effective risks management program is of paramount  importance. Identification of new threats and modus  operandi needs to be included in the regular risk  management programme.  Based on the trends from ENISA’s latest threat landscape  report, the complexity of attacks and sophistication of  malicious actions in cyberspace will continue to increase.  This will require more collaboration between institutions  in the ecosystem to be able to respond to an ever- changing environment.  It is also safe to assume that most of the fraudulent  activity will move to the digital world and will require  additional measures to combat the threats. This also  requires developing the needed skill set, both for the  business side and for the regulatory side. Policy makers  need to create proper conditions that will lead to better  education in the area of cybersecurity. It will also require  the adoption of new technical and procedural measures  to understand emerging trends in malware, attack and  malicious infrastructure tactics and adapt defences  accordingly. Potential use of machine learning and  artificial intelligence methods may be something to be  desired in the future.  Recent developments in lawful interventions in cyber- space show the need to regulate various critical  elements of the threat landscape such as state support  of vulnerability discovery and utilization. These issues  will require the development of practices regarding  procedural, technical and legal aspects.  Governance Structure  In the cybersecurity strategy of the European Union,  the EU reaffirms the importance of all stakeholders in  the current Internet governance model and supports  the multi-stakeholder governance approach. Indeed,  the multi-stakeholder approach is fundamental to the  development of successful standards, particularly in the  area of Cybersecurity where public-sector requirements  are implemented to a large extent by private sector  service providers.  The European Commission has created the Cyber  Security contractual Public-Private Partnership (cPPP).  The aim of the partnership is to drive the cooperation  between public and private actors in the research and  innovation process in order to allow people in Europe to  access innovative and trustworthy European solutions  (ICT products, services and software).  Incident Reporting  In order to gain an overview of the EU risk situation and  on potential threat scenarios, the EU is dependent on  the input from national competent authorities. Only  with comprehensive data, the EU will be able to gain  knowledge on current dangers to the sector.  ENISA plays a significant role in this process by  providing support in the execution of aligned reporting  schemes at EU level. With the help of ENISA a consistent  implementation of incident reporting would make it  easier for the different Member States. Monitoring of  IT-infrastructure can be conducted by the institutions  themselves or, in cases of smaller institutions with  limited financial resources, by third parties. If needed,  institutions should be supported in the development of  the capacities for monitoring and incident reporting by  public agencies.  Mandatory security incident reporting should also  include obligations for competent authorities to report  back to the affected institutions and inform them about  security threats and other related issues. This will create  additional incentives for institutions to cooperate with  the government on incident reporting and ensures  that vulnerable institutions are informed quickly about  potential threats.  Trusted Information sharing  The identification of new threats and attack vectors is  something that the community needs to be able to share  and act upon in an efficient and effective manner. Being  able to quickly deploy new protection mechanisms, or  identify new attack patterns is something that will help  the community in limiting the losses.  An information sharing platform is something that  the EU commission has identified as something very  valuable. As a result, the CSIRT network, created by  the NIS directive, will use a common platform for  information exchange between Member states.  OPINION PAPERS 7  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  Risk management programme  An effective risk management programme that focuses  on mitigation of online payment application risks and  identifies measures including detection of possible  data compromise and fraud should be in place. To  this end, all players in the chain should have a reliable  and accurate fraud monitoring system, which reliably  detects transactions outside the customer’s baseline.  They should also be able to effectively prevent further  payments from a compromised online payment account.  To prove that adequate security measures are taken,  regular testing on critical points of the network should  be done. This should also be supplemented by the use  of a proper threat intelligence to follow the modus  operandi of the organized criminals. As the system is  very complex and involves many players, it should be  properly scoped and executed with minimal disruption  of the system.

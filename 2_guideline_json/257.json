This 5G revolution will also expand the attack surface for cyberthreats thus  necessitating the introduction of the principles of security-by-design from the early stages of the  design and deployment of 5G networks.  Towards this technological revolution, the European Commission and the Member States, with  the support of ENISA, developed a single EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on Cybersecurity in  5G Networks, following on the European Commission’s Recommendation on the cybersecurity  of 5G networks. Subsequently, the NIS Cooperation Group published the EU toolbox of risk  mitigating measures.  The objectives of this toolbox are to identify a possible common set of measures that are  capable of mitigating the main cybersecurity risks of 5G networks that were identified in the EU  report on coordinated risk assessment, and to provide guidance for the selection of measures  that should be prioritised in mitigation plans at national and at Union level. One of the technical  measures, TM04, calls on relevant authorities in EU Member States to ensure that Mobile  Network Operators follow security best practices for network function virtualisation (NFV).  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) has made a huge impact in a very short time since the  use of virtualisation technologies brings various benefits such as agility, flexibility and cost  efficiency. At the same time, the introduction of NFV in 5G networks also introduces new  challenges and risks. NFV changes the network security environment due to resource pools  based on cloud computing and open network architecture.  Thanks to the agility and the Orchestration and Management (O&M) efficiency of NFV networks,  attacked networks can potentially be abandoned and resources recycled, enabling disasters to  be quickly isolated, a response that’s impossible in traditional networks. Network functions,  network links, and even entire networks can be rapidly redeployed, enabling fast recovery from  disasters. At the same time, though, security challenges have become more diverse.  In this report the relevant challenges, vulnerabilities and attacks pertaining to NFV within  the 5G network are explored and security controls and best practices are put forward to  address these challenges, taking into account the particularities of this highly complex,  heterogeneous and volatile environment.  Accordingly, this ENISA study provides the following main information:  • The 5G NFV security framework,  • Potential 5G NFV deployment models,  • Main stakeholders involved in the 5G NFV ecosystem with their roles and  responsibilities,  • Challenges, vulnerabilities, assets and attack taxonomies for 5G NFV,  • Best practices to improve the cybersecurity posture of 5G NFV,  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  6  • Full mapping of challenges, vulnerabilities, assets, attack scenarios and best practices,  • NFV Standardisation, Open-Source and initiatives from academia and industry.  Specifically, in this report sixty security challenges grouped into 7 categories have been  identified and explored. These drive the report to the next steps: vulnerabilities, attack  scenarios, their impact on the 5G NFV assets and 55 best practices classified under Technical,  Policy and Organisational categories.  The main challenges explored in this report have shown that:  • Resource virtualisation: the virtualisation layer provides unified computing resources  based on generalised hardware to the layers above and is the basis of all cloud-native  and virtualised network functions and service software. If the virtualisation layer is  breached, all network functions come under direct attack with disastrous  consequences.  • Resource sharing: a single physical server may run several different tenants' virtual  resources (e.g. virtual machines (VMs ) or containers), and a single tenant's virtual  resource might be distributed across several physical servers. Multi-tenancy resource  sharing and the breaking of physical boundaries introduce the risks of data leaks, data  residue and attacks.  • Use of open source: there will be increasing use of open-source software. This  introduces a new set of security challenges in terms of keeping a consistent and  coherent approach to security-by-design and the prevention of deliberate security  flaws.  • Multi-vendor environment: in such an environment is it difficult to coordinate security  policies and determine responsibility for security problems and requires more effective  network security monitoring capabilities.  • Supply chain: introduces risks such as malicious software and hardware, counterfeit  components, poor designs, manufacturing processes and maintenance procedures.  This may result in negative consequences, such as data and intellectual property theft,  loss of confidence in the integrity of the 5G network, or exploitation to cause system  and network failure.  • Lawful Interception (LI) functionality: placing LI functions within the virtualised  environment exposes them to a variety of security and visibility risks.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Fifth Generation (5G) networks aim at providing value-added services with advanced  performance such as low-latency communications, high reliability, high data rates and capacity  to support an increasing number of connected devices. 5G aims to provide a flexible platform to  integrate vertical industries and a wide range of services and applications such as autonomous  driving, robotics, augmented and virtual reality, remote healthcare, and more.  For such services and use cases, security technology and architecture must be natively  integrated into the overall hybrid and virtual architecture to appropriate internal and external  security services. Previous iterations, such as GSM/CMDA (2G) and HSPA/eVDO (3G,) were  designed to connect people to people predominantly through voice and text, while LTE/LTE-A  (4G) was designed to connect people to the Internet. 5G expands upon this evolution through  ubiquitous connectivity of things to people, services, the Internet and things.  To meet the requirements for scale, throughput, latency, and reliability, 5G architecture has  adopted Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and software-Defined Networking (SDN) to  streamline network and service deployment, operations and management. Operators, service  providers and other verticals (e.g. Connected Cars, IOT, eHealth, Industry 4.0) can leverage  SDN/NFV to provide flexible and cost-effective service without compromising the end user’s  quality of service (QoS).  NFV and SDN open the door to flexible networks and rapid creation of services. This both offers  opportunities for security and introduces additional security challenges and complexities in  some cases.  With the rapid proliferation of 5G networks, operators have started the deployment of NFV.  While several standardisation bodies (e.g. ETSI, 3GPP, NGMN and GSMA) have started  looking into the many security issues introduced by NFV, additional work is needed with greater  involvement of the security community including vendors, operators, universities and regulators.  This report will focus on various security challenges and opportunities introduced by NFV in 5G.  We will present current security challenges, vulnerabilities and attacks pertaining to NFV within  the 5G network and put forward security controls and best practices to address these  challenges taking into account the particularities of this highly complex, heterogeneous and  volatile environment.  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This ENISA study aims at underlining and analysing the security challenges related to 5G NFV.  The main objectives are to identify challenges and best practices to ensure the security of 5G  NFV, while mapping the relevant security challenges, vulnerabilities, attacks scenarios, assets  and best practices.  Note: ‘5G NFV’ in this report means the ‘NFV as applicable to 5G’.  This study indicates how challenges and vulnerabilities can be exploited through cyberthreats  and how this exploitation can be mitigated through security controls and best practices.  The following objectives have been set:  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  8  • identify 5G NFV sensitive assets,  • identify potential and main cyber challenges, vulnerabilities and attack scenarios  targeting 5G NFV,  • map identified challenges, vulnerabilities and attack scenarios to assets,  • identify relevant security measures and best practices, and map them to the security  challenges.  Identified challenges, vulnerabilities, attack scenarios and best practices are consolidated from  various publicly available resources including:  • main 5G standardisation documents and telecommunication best practices (3GPP,  ETSI, NIST, FFT, FCC and GSMA),  • EU-funded research projects (5GPPP),  • industrial white papers,  • research articles,  • guidance and recommendations for organisations such as CIS and CSA,  • interviews and contributions from 5G security experts and Member States  1.2 SCOPE  Towards this technological revolution, the European Commission and the Member States (MS),  with the support of ENISA, developed a single EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on  Cybersecurity in 5G Networks1, following on the European Commission’s Recommendation on  the cybersecurity of 5G networks2 (published on 26 March, 2019).  This coordinated risk assessment is based on individual national risk assessments and  identifies the main threats and threat actors, the most sensitive assets, the main vulnerabilities  and the main risks.  To complement this report and as a further input for the toolbox, ENISA carried out a dedicated  threat landscape mapping, consisting of a detailed analysis of certain technical aspects, in  particular the identification of network assets and of threats affecting these.  Subsequently, on 29 January 2020, the NIS Cooperation Group published the EU toolbox of risk  mitigating measures3. The objectives of this toolbox are to identify a possible common set of  measures that are capable of mitigating the main cybersecurity risks of 5G networks as have  been identified in the EU coordinated risk assessment report, and to provide guidance for the  selection of measures, which should be prioritised in mitigation plans at national and at Union  level.  The toolbox identifies two groups of measures MS can take: strategic and technical measures.  In addition, it identifies a number of supporting actions that can assist, enable or support the  implementation of strategic and technical measures.  One of the technical measures, TM04, calls on relevant authorities in EU Member States to  ensure that mobile network operators follow best practices in security for network function  virtualisation (NFV). To support implementation of this technical measure, the Toolbox also  defines the supporting action SA01, calling for reviews or the development of guidelines and  best practices on network security, and identifying ENISA and the relevant authorities in MSs as  relevant actors for these regards. NFV Security in 5G is one of the key issues that needs to be  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security  2 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  9  addressed comprehensively in order to take advantage of the business opportunities arising  from 5G Networks.  This ENISA study outlines best practices for the security of 5G NFV. It is building on several  previous ENISA studies on 5G45 and virtualisation6 and mainly focuses on 5G NFV.  The purpose of the report is to explain the security challenges associated with NFV in 5G and  make practical best practices and recommendations for addressing those challenges when  planning for, implementing and maintaining NFV.  Within NFV, a Network Function is implemented in a virtualised form of NF or cloud Native NF.  In this report the term ‘VNF’ Virtual Network Function is used to designate both virtualised NF  and cloud Native NF. The VNF is defined in this report as a software implementation of a  Network Function, capable of running on the Cloud Infrastructure. VNFs are built from one or  more VNF components (VNFC) and, in most cases, the VNFC is hosted on a single VM or  container.  Virtualised NF and Cloud Native NF are similar in that they both virtualise network functions to  build an agile 5G NFV infrastructure. Both use an underlying physical server to readily expand  and adapt whenever and wherever the user needs to deploy network capabilities. The  difference mainly lies in how those network functions are abstracted from the underlying  physical server infrastructure.  • Virtualised NF uses a hypervisor to provide a single layer of abstraction that enables  networking and network security functions to run as dedicated appliances (e.g. routers,  firewalls, etc.) in the form of virtual machines (VMs), which can quickly be deployed on  generic hardware.  • Cloud native NF reduces each discrete network and network security function into a  microservice, packaged in its own container, and deployed on generic hardware  resources on a cloud platform.  Consequently, some aspects of NFV may vary among technologies (e.g. VM, container), but the  most security challenges and best practices in this report are intended to apply to most or all  NFV technologies, unless otherwise specified.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The main purpose of this report is to provide knowledge and information on 5G NFV challenges  and best practices to the relevant community. This information may be useful to a variety of  target groups.  • Non-technical stakeholders such as policy-makers, regulators and law  enforcement: this target group may find this report useful for understanding the  emerging challenges, vulnerabilities, threats and respective practices and measures  for mitigation.  • Experts working in the telecommunication sector, such as operators, vendors,  and service providers: this target group may find this report useful for carrying out  detailed threat analyses and risk assessments in accordance with their particular  needs and mandate (e.g. to protect a specific number of components based on asset  impact analysis, respond to specific vulnerabilities with customised mitigation  measures among others).  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  10  • Businesses, consultants and product developers: this target group can draw  valuable conclusions from the developed analysis and material for their offerings  (products, services). This can take the form of demonstrating how vulnerabilities have  been eliminated by using developed defences, use of the material within customer  projects, or use of the material as a benchmark for defining cybersecurity protection  policies for such infrastructures (e.g. for the development of verticals). Moreover, the  developed material can be used in developing security audits for 5G NFV  infrastructures.  • Experts in research and innovation: the material presented provides a detailed view  of security issues for 5G NFV. This target group may use this material as a basis for  gap analysis, as material to evaluate the impact of research and as a source for  innovative actions with regard to its further development and implementation. Finally,  this target group may use this material as a useful resource for numerous academic  activities, such as teaching, research, support of scholars, etc.  1.4 METHODOLOGY  ENISA has developed this study by following a four-step methodological approach.

NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  12  2. 5G NFV SECURITY  FRAMEWORK  2.1 5G END-TO-END ARCHITECTURE  Figure 2 presents an NFV/SDN-enabled 5G architecture. It illustrates the various components  from the core to the far edge. As defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the  5G network is a Service-Based Architecture (SBA) which is a set of interconnected network  functions (NFs) that deliver the control plane functionality and common data repositories of a 5G  network [1], [2], [3], [4].  Supporting an SBA brings new requirements for the control, coordination and orchestration of  disaggregated network functions that are distributed across the network. These network  functions are virtualised or containerised microservices that can support the 5G core, the Radio  Access Network (RAN), and the MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing).  Cloud RAN (CRAN), Virtualised RAN (VRAN) and Open RAN (ORAN) are all concepts that  have emerged in the last few years to run baseband functions on commodity server hardware,  based on the principles of Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV). The MEC takes advantage of  the existing NFV infrastructure to provide services characterised by low latency, proximity,  location awareness, high bandwidth and real-time insight into radio network information.  In order to support CRAN/ORAN/VRAN and MEC, operators will deploy small datacentres at the  edge. These infrastructures will make it possible to deploy applications and VNFs at the edge  without investing additional resources. The MEC (edge) platform at each datacentre will allow  third party applications to activate traffic offloading at the edge while also enabling access to  other information provided by the operator.  The core network is the central part of the 5G infrastructure. It enables all functions related to  multi-access technologies. Its main purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged). The target of SDN is to use programmable software-driven devices  to control the behaviour of the infrastructure. With SDN, user services can be delivered faster,  and the efficiency of network resources increases. SDN is based on three principles:  1. decoupling of control from traffic forwarding and processing,  2. logically centralised control,  3. programmability of network services.  A fully virtualised 5G network could bring significant benefits of harmonisation: one single  uniform hardware platform across the core network, RAN and edge. This could simplify the  management of the complete network, reducing operations and maintenance costs.  The following two sections give more details on the co-dependent technologies of NFV and  SDN. Where NFV is in charge of dynamically creating and managing the network functions and  provisioning various network services, SDN provides the capabilities to manage and orchestrate  the virtual networks among these services. While both SDN and NFV make networking  architectures more flexible and dynamic, they perform different roles.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  13  2.1.1 Service based architecture  Compared to previous generations the 3GPP 5G system architecture is service based (SBA)  (Figure 3) [2], [3], [4]. That means wherever suitable the architectural elements are defined as  network functions that offer their services via interfaces of a common framework to any network  functions that are permitted to make use of these provided services. The SBA specifies flat peer  to peer relationships between Network Functions (NFs) via the HTTP/2-based Service Based  Interface (SBI). Network Repository Functions (NRF) allow every network function to discover  the services offered by other network functions.  This architectural model, which further adopts principles like modularity, reusability and self- containment of network functions, is chosen to enable deployments to take advantage of the  latest virtualisation and software technologies [5]. Instead of specifying network entities, a more  modular design is achieved by specifying a set of NFs which allows stronger decoupling  between logical and physical architecture, facilitating the virtualisation of the different NFs  running on generic computer hardware. Furthermore, NFs can be physically implemented in  different ways (e.g. all of them in a single physical node, distributed across multiple nodes or  running on a cloud platform).  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  14  With the split of control plane and user plane, NFs responsible of the control plane are different  from those responsible of the user plane allowing independent scalability and evolution (e.g.  allocating more capacity to the control plane without affecting the user plane). Moreover, it  allows flexible deployments, e.g. centralised location for control plane or distributed (remote)  location for user plane.  2.1.2 5G Network Functions  The 5G core is a mesh of interconnected services as shown in Figure 3. In addition, the 5G  system architecture introduces several security-related 5G network functions [2], [3], [4], [6] as  shown in Figure 4. Table 1 gives a brief explanation of each network function.  Table 1: 5G network functions  Network Function Description  User Plane  User Plane Function  (UPF)  The User Plane Function deals with the user plane communication in the 5GC, acting as a gateway between  the RAN and the external Data Network (DN) (e.g. Internet). The main functionalities are: packet routing and  forwarding, downlink packet buffering and downlink data notification triggering, QoS handling and traffic  measurements.  Control Plane  Access and Mobility  Management Function  (AMF)  The Access and Mobility Management Function is a control plane function in charge of handling the control  signalling between the UE and the 5GC. The main functionalities are: registration management, connection  management to establish the control plane signalling with the UE, mobility management (e.g. idle mode UE  reachability), control and execution of paging and support of infra-system and inter-system mobility.  Session Management  Function (SMF)  The Session Management Function is a control plane function in charge of the following main functionalities:  session establishment, modification and release, UE IP address allocation and management, control of  policy enforcement and QoS and configuration of traffic steering at UPF to route traffic to proper destination.  Policy Control Function  (PCF)  The Policy Control Function provides policy rules (e.g. authorised QoS for each service data flow) to the  network functions in charge of enforcing them (e.g. SMF).  Application Function  (AF)  The Application Function allows interacting with the applications making use of the network. This can be  used for applications that require dynamic policy control, e.g. for dynamically modifying the bit rate to be  provided. Based on interactions with these applications, policy requirements are provided to the PCF.  Unified Data  Management (UDM)  The function of Unified Data Management is to provide the handling of user identification, subscription  management, access authorisation based on subscription data (e.g. roaming restrictions), and generation of  authentication credentials. It uses subscription data that may be stored in the UDR (Unified Data Repository).  Network Exposure  Function (NEF)  The Network Exposure Function is used to expose services of the 5G core towards other networks (e.g. third  party providers, verticals, etc.). This allows the fast creation of new services making use of the 5G core.  Network Repository  Function (NRF)  The Network Repository, with the profile of the available NF instances (id, PLMN ID, network slice identifiers,  capacity information, etc.) and their supported services, allows an NF to discover the services offered by the  other NFs of the core network. This provides a lot of flexibility for defining the interactions between NFs and  allows that any NF can directly interact with another one.  Security-related Network Function  Authentication Server  Function (AUSF)  The AUSF provides the UE authentication service. AUSF shall handle authentication requests for both,  3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The AUSF shall provide SUPI to the VPLMN (core network or serving  network) only after authentication confirmation if authentication request with SUCI was sent by VPLMN. The  AUSF shall inform the UDM that a successful or unsuccessful authentication of a subscriber has occurred.  Authentication  Credential Repository  and Processing  Function (ARPF)  The ARPF is a functional element of the UDM (Unified Data Management), responsible for generating 5G HE  AV (5G Home Environment Authentication Vectors) based on the subscriber’s shared secret key. It selects  an authentication method based on subscriber identity and configured policy and computes the  authentication data and keying materials.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  15  Network Function Description  Inter-PLMN UP Security  (IPUPS)  The 5G System architecture introduces Inter-PLMN UP Security (IPUPS) at the perimeter of the PLMN for  protecting user plane messages. The IPUPS is a functionality of the UPF that enforces GTP-U security on  the N9 interface between UPFs of the visited and home PLMNs.  Security Context  Management Function  (SCMF)  The SCMF retrieves the key from the SEAF, which is used to derive further keys.  Subscription Identifier  De-concealing Function  (SIDF)  The SIDF is a functional element of the UDM (Unified Data Management), responsible for decrypting a SUCI  (Subscription Concealed Identifier) to reveal the subscriber’s SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier).  Security Anchor  Function (SEAF)  The SEAF forms, as an outcome of the primary authentication, the unified, common anchor key KSEAF for  all the access scenarios. The unified anchor key KSEAF can be used by the UE and the serving network to  protect the subsequent communication7.  Security Edge  Protection Proxy  (SEPP)  The 5G System architecture introduces a Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) as an entity sitting at the  perimeter of the PLMN for protecting control plane messages. The SEPP enforces inter-PLMN security on  the N32 interface. The SEPP shall act as a non-transparent proxy node.  Security Policy Control  Function (SPCF) The SPCF provides policies related to the security of network functions such as AMF, SMF and UE.  Network Slice Selection  Function (NSSF)  The NSSF supports the selection of the Network Slice instance(s) serving a UE. It offers services to the AMF  and NSSF in a different PLMN via the Nnssf service-based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [3] and 3GPP TS  23.502 [4]).

Within the scope of the  3GPP 5G system architecture a network slice refers to the set of 3GPP defined features and  functionalities that together form a complete Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) for providing  services to UEs.  Network slicing allows for controlled composition of a PLMN from the specified network  functions with their specific, provided services that are required for a specific usage scenario.  Each PLMNs is customised by instantiating only the features, capabilities and services required  to satisfy the subset of the served users/UEs or related business customer needs [5]. With 5G,  NFs can be individually instantiated for each network slice and placed where appropriate. In this  way, multiple network slices can be created, each one composed of a collection of control plane  and user plane NFs customised to the needs of the slice. For example, one network slice can  include the NFs to support mobile broadband services with full mobility support, and another  one to support non-mobile, latency-critical industry applications.  2.1.4 Support of multi-access edge computing (MEC)  MEC uses the wireless access network to provide services and cloud computing functions  required by telecom users, and to construct a carrier class service environment with high  performance, low latency and high bandwidth to improve the communication experience of  mobile users.  Edge computing is an evolution of cloud computing that brings application hosting from  centralised datacentres down to the network edge, close to the consumers and the data  generated by applications. The main advantages are the computation offloading, distributed  content delivery and caching, and low latency services.  In order to profit from the advantages provided by edge computing in 5G, the technology needs  to support connecting the 5G core to a local area data network (LADN) where the applications  are implemented and the UPF must be able to perform the local routing of certain traffic to the  LADN.  In terms of physical deployment of MEC hosts, there are multiple options available based on  various operational, performance or security related requirements. The following list gives an  outline of some of the feasible options for the physical location of MEC:  1. MEC and the local UPF collocated with the base station,  2. MEC collocated with a transmission node, possibly with a local UPF,  3. MEC and the local UPF collocated with a network aggregation point,  4. MEC collocated with the core network functions (i.e. in the same datacentre).  The options presented above show that MEC can be flexibly deployed in different locations from  near the base station to the central data network. Common for all deployments is the UPF which  is deployed and used to steer the traffic towards the targeted MEC applications and towards the  network.  2.2 NFV ARCHITECTURE  The virtualisation of network elements, NFV, is a concept that virtualises the main elements of a  network. In this sense, instead of having a dedicated hardware element to provide a function of  the network, software running on general hardware is used. In this way, entire classes of  network node functions can be set up as building blocks that can be connected to create overall  telecommunications networks. Examples of the virtualised functions that can be provided  include virtualised load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection devices, WAN accelerators,  routers, access control and billing.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  17  As a standard specification, ETSI focuses on high-level architecture, development guidelines,  and interoperability enabled by open interfaces. ETSI describes the high-level NFV functional  architectural framework and the design of virtualised network functions and of the supporting  infrastructure. It identifies three main working domains in NFV:  1. Virtualised network function is the software implementation of a network function which  can run over the NFVI.  2. NFV infrastructure (NFVI) includes the diversity of physical resources and how these  can be virtualised. NFVI supports the execution of the VNFs.  3. NFV management and orchestration (MANO) covers the orchestration and lifecycle  management of physical and/or software resources that support the virtualisation of the  infrastructure, and the lifecycle management of VNFs.  The initial release of the ETSI NFV specification was predominantly dependent on hypervisor- based virtual machines (VMs) for virtualisation. Most of the specifications in ETSI NFV continue  serving that purpose when being applied to the cloud native NFV. Nevertheless, an adaption is  needed in some areas because of the differences between the VM based and cloud native  solutions. Thus, the ETSI NFV group has published containerised VNF specifications enabling  containerised VNFs to be managed in an NFV framework.  The ETSI NFV group has published ETSI GS NFV-IFA 0409, which specifies the requirements  for service interfaces and is an object model for operating system (OS) container management  and orchestration. These specifications provide a baseline for the integration of OS container  management and orchestration into the NFV framework.  ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 also specifies requirements on the list of services to be offered by  architectural elements providing the Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) and  Container Image Registry (CIR) functions described in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 02910 and on the  interfaces for exposing these services to NFV-MANO and other consuming entities.  The CISM is responsible for maintaining the containerised workloads and manages the OS  container, computation storage, network resources and their configuration. The CIR is  responsible for storing and maintaining information on OS container software images.  ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 is supplemented by the NFV Release 4 specifications ETSI GS NFV-IFA  01011 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 01112. These provide enhancements for the specification of the  management and orchestration functional requirements, and extensions to the VNF package  and VNF descriptor specifications respectively.  The considerably high level NFV architecture for 5G is in line with the ETSI NFV reference  architecture [7], the NFV-MANO architectural framework [8], the ETSI NFV Adaptation to the  Cloud Native Architecture [9] [10], and the ENISA 5G threat landscape [6] (section 3.7) (Figure  5). Table 2 describes the main NFV [7] and MANO [8] components of this architecture. In Figure  5, the main NFV components covering both VM-based and cloud native (container based) are  highlighted.  In this report, it is assumed that the VIM supports the CISM to be able to manage both VMs and  containers virtualisation technologies. As explained in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029, there are multiple  options to integrate the CISM within the NFV MANO. Only option #1 (CISM embedded in the  VIM) is highlighted for reasons of simplicity since the aim is to give a big picture of the NFV  9 https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20040v4.2.1%20-%20GS%20- %20OS%20Container%20MANO%20service%20interfaces.pdf  10 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-IFA/001_099/029/03.03.01_60/gr_NFV-IFA029v030301p.pdf  11 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/010/04.01.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA010v040101p.pdf  12 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/011/04.02.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA011v040201p.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20040v4.2.1%20-%20GS%20-%20OS%20Container%20MANO%20service%20interfaces.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20040v4.2.1%20-%20GS%20-%20OS%20Container%20MANO%20service%20interfaces.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-IFA/001_099/029/03.03.01_60/gr_NFV-IFA029v030301p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/010/04.01.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA010v040101p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/011/04.02.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA011v040201p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  18  architecture without going into the details of all these options already explained in ETSI GR  NFV-IFA 029.  More details about the 5G NFV architecture can be found in [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],  [14], [15], [16]. More details about the different MANO solutions are given in Annexes H and I.  Table 2: NFV and MANO main components  Security-related  Network Function Description  NFV (Network Functions Virtualisation)  Common components  between VM-based and  cloud native NFV  (network functions  virtualisation)  • NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): The NFVI consists of all the hardware and software components that are  contained within the environment in which VNFs are deployed. It provides virtualised computing,  storage, and networking. One of the advantages of NFV is that the NFV-Infrastructure can be located  across several physical locations, allowing operators to typically place their centres at the most  convenient locations. The network providing connectivity between these locations is part of the NFV- Infrastructure.  • Operations Support System/Business Support System (OSS/BSS):  includes the collection of  applications that a service provider uses to operate its business. While OSS deals with network  management, fault management, configuration management and service management, BSS deals with  customer management, product management, order management and billing.  • Element Management System (EMS): is responsible for the configuration, fault management,  accounting and collection of performance measurement results for the network functions provided by  the VNF. An example of management function is fault, configuration, accounting, performance and  security management (FCAPS).  • Hardware Resources: in NFV, the physical hardware resources include computing, storage and  networks that provide processing, storage and connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer  (Host OS, Hypervisor, CIS).  • Virtualised Network Function (VNF): an implementation of an NF that can be deployed on a network  function virtualisation infrastructure (NFVI). VNFs are built from one or more VNF components (VNFC)  and, in most cases, the VNFC is hosted on a single VM or container.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  19  Security-related  Network Function Description  • Virtualised Network Function Component (VNFC): is an internal component of a VNF that provides  a VNF provider with a defined sub-set of that VNF's functionality. Its main characteristic is that a single  instance of this component maps 1:1 against a single instance of an atomic deployable unit. An  instance of an atomic deployable unit is represented by a single VM for hypervisor-based virtualisation  or represented by one or a set of OS containers for CIS (Container Infrastructure Service) based  virtualisation.  • Virtualisation layer: it consists of two sub layers: a host OS and hypervisor (for VMs) and CIS (for  containers).  Cloud native  components within NFV  • Container Infrastructure Service (CIS): the cloud-native equivalent of hypervisor is container  infrastructure service (CIS), which provides all the runtime infrastructural dependencies for one or more  container virtualisation technologies. It can run on top of a bare metal or hypervisor-based virtualisation.  It is used to create, destroy and manage containers on top of an operating system.  • Container: is a virtualisation container using a shared operating system (OS) kernel of its host.  Containers can host a VNF component (VNFC) for instance.  VM-based components  within NFV  • Hypervisor: is a piece of software which partitions the underlying physical resources and creates  virtual machines, and isolates the VMs from each other. It is running either directly on top of the  hardware (bare metal hypervisor type 1) or running on top of a hosting operating system (hosted  hypervisor type 2). The abstraction of resources comprises all those entities inside a computer or  server which are accessible, such as processor, memory/storage, NICs. The hypervisor enables the  portability of VMs to different Hardware.  • Virtual Machine (VM): has all the ingredients (processor, memory/storage, interfaces/ports) of a  physical computer or server and is generated by a hypervisor, which partitions the underlying physical  resources and allocates them to VMs. Virtual machines can host a VNF component (VNFC) for  instance.  NFV MANO (Management and Orchestration)  Common components  between VM-based and  cloud native NFV MANO  • Network Function Virtualisation Orchestrator (NFVO): is responsible for coordinating the VNFM and  VIM according to the requirements of the OSS/BSS to orchestrate a specific service such as a firewall  or to detect intrusions. It implements resource and service orchestration in the network. NFVO is split  up into resource orchestrator (RO) and network service orchestrator (NSO).  • First, RO collects the current information regarding possible physical and virtual resources of NFVI  through the VIM. Second, NSO applies a complete lifecycle management of multiple network services.  In this way, NFVO keeps updating the information about the available VNFs running on top of NFVI. As  a result, NFVO can initiate multiple network services. As part of the lifecycle management, NFVO can  also terminate a network service whenever a service request is no longer being received for that  specific service.  • In several solutions, NFVO and VNFM are integrated into MANO. Open Source MANO (OSM)13, Open  Networking Automation Platform (ONAP)14, OpenBaton15, Cloudify16, SONATA17, and Katana Slice  Manager18 are considered as the leading integrated solutions for MANO. Note that OSM can also  perform management and orchestration tasks on PNFs.  • VNF Manager (VNFM): is responsible for managing the lifecycle of VNFs. VNFM operations include:  o instantiation of VNFs  o scaling of VNFs  o updating and/or upgrading  o VNFs Termination of VNFs.  VM-based components  within NFV MANO  • Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM): is the management system for NFVI. It is responsible for  controlling and managing the interaction of a VNF with the underlying computing, storage and  networking resources and their virtualisation. It performs resource management tasks such as inventory  of hypervisors, allocation of VMs onto hypervisors or increasing resources to VMs. Moreover, it  performs operations on the visibility of the NFVI, analysis of data on the performance of the  13 Open Source MANO (OSM), “OSM Open Source NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) software stack aligned  with ETSI NFV,” April 2021, https://osm.etsi.org  14 ONAP, “ONAP Open Networking Automation Platform,” April 2021, https://www.onap.org/  15 OpenBaton, “OpenBaton An extensible and customizable NFV MANO-compliant framework,” April 2021,  http://openbaton.org  16 Cloudify, “Cloudify Multi Cloud Orchestration,” April 2021, https://cloudify.co/  17 SONATA, “Sonata agile development. testing and orchestration of services in 5g virtualized networks,” April 2021,  https://www.sonata-nfv.eu  18 Katana Wiki Home, “MediaNetworks Laboratory,” April 2021, https://github.com/medianetlab/katana-slice_manager/wiki  https://osm.etsi.org/ https://www.onap.org/ http://openbaton.org/ https://cloudify.co/ https://www.sonata-nfv.eu/ https://github.com/medianetlab/katana-slice_manager/wiki  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  20  Security-related  Network Function Description  infrastructure and collection of information for capacity planning, monitoring and optimisation.  Consequently, VIM can supervise the allocation of NFVI resources to the available VNFs. OpenStack19  and OpenVIM20 (for VNFs) are possible solutions for VIM.  Cloud native  components within NFV  MANO  • Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM): is a functional block that manages one or  more container infrastructure services. The CISM provides mechanisms for lifecycle management of  the managed container infrastructure objects, which are hosting application components as services or  functions. It is a cloud-native equivalent of virtualised infrastructure manager (VIM).  • CISM is responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage and network resources,  as well as scheduling the microservice containers in the cloud. CISM also collects performance  measurements in the infrastructure including container level and makes the data available for other  functional blocks for monitoring purposes. Other responsibilities of CISM include virtual networking  control and management, as well as the southbound integration with various network controllers to  achieve the physical network control and management capabilities.  • Kubernetes21 (for cloud native NFs) is a possible solution for CISM. Multiple options can be envisioned  for mapping the CISM functionality to NFV-MANO as outlined in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 and ETSI GS  NFV-IFA 040. Each option has it is pros and cons. Such options include:  o Option#1: CISM embedded in the VIM,  o Option#2: CISM distributed across VNFM and VIM,  o Option#3: CISM as a stand-alone functional block,  o Option#4: CISM-only replacing VIM and VNFM,  o Option#5: CISM embedded into VNF with support for shared container service,  o Option#6: CISM embedded into VNF without support for shared container service.  Other  NFV Security Managers  (SM)  NFV SM is a function that applies security policy to a virtualised network based on both predefined default  policy and active analysis of information provided through security monitoring. It is responsible for enforcing  security policy for VNFs and for instructing NFV-MANO to take VNF specific or system wide security actions  [17], [18]. The security manager is a logical subcomponent of a CSP's overall network security management  and monitoring systems. A CSP security management platform may require one or more security managers  (SMs) depending on the security isolation and role separation required between different trust domains. In  cooperation with MANO blocks dedicated to managing the virtualised network, the policy driven SM is  specialised to manage the security on a network service over its entire lifecycle. It covers the following  functionalities:  • Security Policy Planning designs and optimises security policies for specific targets of protection  (e.g. network services);  • Security Policy Enforcement & Validation automates the deployment and supports the lifecycle  management of security functions as defined in the design phase, then configures security  policies on the security functions. In addition, during the lifetime of a network service, the  validation and re-configuration or remediation of associated security policies is supported, also in  an automated manner.  2.3 NFV WITH SDN ROLES  Besides the NFV technology, management and deployment of 5G technology is simplified by  the adoption of complementary technologies enabling flexible usage of deployed hardware and  fast provisioning of new functions and services, namely the SDN.  The core similarity between software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions  virtualisation (NFV) is that they both use network abstraction. SDN seeks to separate network  control functions from network forwarding functions, while NFV seeks to abstract network  forwarding and other networking functions from the hardware on which it runs.  19 OpenStack, “OpenStack The Most Widely Deployed Open Source Cloud Software in the World,” April 2021,  https://www.openstack.org/  20 OpenVIM, “Telefónica NFV reference lab,” April 2021, https://github.com/nfvlabs/openvim  21 Kubernetes, “Kubernetes Production-Grade Container Orchestration,” April 2021, https://kubernetes.io  https://www.openstack.org/ https://github.com/nfvlabs/openvim https://kubernetes.io/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  21  Thus, both depend heavily on virtualisation to enable network design and infrastructure to be  abstracted in software and then implemented by underlying software across hardware platforms  and devices [19].  When SDN executes on an NFV infrastructure, SDN forwards data packets from one network  device to another. At the same time, SDN's networking control functions for routing, policy  definition and applications run in a VM or container somewhere on the network. Thus, NFV  provides basic networking functions, while SDN controls and orchestrates them for specific  uses. SDN further allows configuration and behaviour to be programmatically defined and  modified [19].  SDN and NFV differ in how they separate functions and abstract resources. SDN abstracts  physical networking resources – switches, routers and so on – and moves decision making to a  virtual network control plane. In this approach, the control plane decides where to send traffic,  while the hardware continues to direct and handle the traffic. NFV aims to virtualise all physical  network resources beneath a hypervisor, which allows the network to grow without the addition  of more devices [19]. While both SDN and NFV make networking architectures more flexible  and dynamic, they perform different roles in defining those architectures and the infrastructure  they support [19].  A whole overview of the NFV/SDN architecture is shown Figure 6. This architecture takes into  account SDN and NFV technologies. On one hand, the framework presents a layered structure:  infrastructure, control and application layers, in the same way as SDN architecture. Moreover, it  takes advantage of the NFV concept to allow the easy implementation and management of  network functions, without the need to increase the hardware devices [20], [21].  Figure 6: Integrating SDN Controller into the reference NFV architecture  The SDN controller centralises the control plane functionalities and provides an abstract view of  all the connectivity-related components it manages. The SDN Controller sets up and manages  the underlying networking resources to provide the required connectivity for communicating the  VNFs. Managed by the VIM, this controller may change infrastructure behaviour on-demand  according to VIM specifications, adapted from the requests of tenants.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  22  In the infrastructure layer, we have the current mobile infrastructure of the network operator  providing support to a wide range of wireless and cellular technologies such as WiFi, LTE,  UTMS, GSM, among others. On top of the hardware layer, there is a virtualisation layer to  enable the virtualisation of hardware devices. The resources could be in different locations and  datacentres and this takes three components into account:  • networking: these devices incorporate mobile technologies and OpenFlow protocol;  • storage: this element can include object storage or block storage (Swift and Cinder  OpenStack) or another novel technique;  • computing: this includes high volume servers.  The control layer is in charge of monitoring, analysis, management and orchestration of devices.  It consists of four modules: monitoring, analyser, network OS and NFV MANO.  • Monitoring Module: this module is able to provide the complete low-level overview of  the managed systems by means of gathering metrics coming from different network  devices.  • Analyser Module: this module could give a deep analysis of the data in order to  determine the behaviour that suits the network. This module also can infer the  recommended behaviour of the network. The techniques used in the analysis can  include data mining, learning algorithms and pattern recognition, among others.  • Network OS: this uses the OpenFlow or similar protocols to send instructions to the  infrastructure layer elements. Its functionality is similar to an operating system (OS) in  computing.  • NFV MANO: this module determines and organises the actions to be executed in the  system, the orchestration, the management of the resources and the control functions.  SDN/NFV control layer can adapt the network resources depending on the actual situation of  the network and dynamically respond to failures or degradation of network performance. On the  top of the architecture is located the application layer, which consists of two basic modules:  • Communication Interface: this module enables an open API for programmers to  facilitate the development of new services.  • Network Functions: this module presents a scalable structure to create customised  network functions or control applications.  2.4 5G NFV STAKEHOLDERS  Table 3 illustrates the actors that hold stakes in the 5G NFV markets, forming different clusters  who would be active in 5G ecosystems.  First, the stakeholders from the traditional 5G industry are those who provide connectivity  solutions, equipment, SW and cloud providers. They are the actors who take part in developing,  delivering and providing 5G services. Second, policy makers and standard setting organisations  have defined 5G as we know it today. Third, vertical industries are important stakeholders  providing different services to third parties. [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] were used as references for  the development of this chapter.  The 5G NFV network architecture implies the introduction of new processes, activities and  operations thus defining new technical roles (e.g. administrators, integrators) and  responsibilities involved in the operation, administration and maintenance of the 5G NFV. The  operation, administration and maintenance of 5G NFV infrastructure requires much effort and  particular skill profiles need to be employed. Listings of the roles, responsibilities and the  corresponding technical processes and activities are provided in Annex A. Each role can belong  to multiple stakeholders.

Regulators and Policymakers Government regulators or regulatory agencies include bodies such as the Federal Communications  Commission (US), European Commission (EU), etc.  Standardisation Bodies These include international associations, alliances with a geographical, thematic or sectorial focus,  such as the International Telecommunication Union, GSMA, 3GPP, etc.  Vertical Markets These provide various services to third parties that exploit resources (network and cloud)  specifically from operators and cloud service providers.  End Users or Subscribers  These users have a subscription and can therefore access virtualised services. When they access a  service, they directly or indirectly generate a data flow within the control plan, then the user plan.  Their communications are transported by the user plan.  2.5 NFV SECURITY OPPORTUNITIES  Despite potential challenges due to the use of recent technologies such as NFV and SDN in 5G  networks, these same technologies also open new opportunities. The main opportunities for  NFV to improve the 5G security and trustworthiness are provided in Table 4 ([22], [27]).  Table 4: NFV security opportunities  NFV security  opportunities Description  Increased automation  This is provided by the management and orchestration (MANO) layer. NFV MANO provides the opportunity  to automate the creation, reconfiguration and scaling in and out of network functions, and to do it in real time  on the fly, based on workload needs. The automation feature provided by NFV MANO allows the security  controls and mitigations to be automated. For instance, the logging of security events, monitoring, detection,  prevention, verification of integrity, patch management and others can be instantiated and provided as a  service to network functions and applications.  Security zoning and  segmentation  In the 5G network, multi-tenancy drives the need for the logical separation of virtual resources among  tenants. Through orchestration, certain VNFs can be deployed on separate VMs or containers and compute  nodes, and they can be further segregated by using separate networks. In addition, the use of security zones  allows VNFs to be deployed on or migrated to hosts that satisfy security-pertinent criteria such as location  and level of hardening (for example, some hosts may employ the trusted computing technology).  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  25  NFV security  opportunities Description  Distributed security  services  The NFV allows for the dynamic distribution not only of the instantiated VNFs throughout the virtualised  infrastructure at the edge, at the core or at the RAN, but also for security. 5G network services are deployed  across multiple administrative domains. NFV admins can instantiate new monitoring instances, reconfigure  or modify the existing ones at the right location in the network according to available resources or security  contexts.  Patch management  NFV eases the deployment of security updates. An upgraded instance of the VNF can be launched and  tested while the previous instance remains active. Services and customers can then be migrated to the  upgraded instance over a period of time (shorter or longer as dictated by operational needs). The older  instance with the un-patched security flaw can be retired once the process is complete.  Incident response  NFV opens up the possibility to automate and improve the incident response. This automated incident  response provides rapid and flexible re-configuration of virtual resources. In addition, it eases the  decommissioning and re-commissioning of VNFs. If a VNF is compromised (for example, through  unauthorised access via a back door), an uncompromised version can be instantiated to replace it and the  compromised version can be decommissioned and a copy of it made for forensic analysis.  Programmability Programmability offers the flexibility and dynamicity needed to have adaptable security mechanisms such as  logging, policy monitoring, and verification mechanisms.  Centralised control and  traffic steering  In SDN, forwarding elements are directly connected to and controlled by controller software (e.g. Ryu23 or  OpenDaylight24). This centralisation of the control plane enables a defence system to rapidly respond to  network changes from a central controller through updating the forwarding rules of the entire network  infrastructure, e.g. suspicious traffic can be dynamically detected and re-directed to security appliances.  Network slicing  Network slicing is released by virtualisation using SDN, NFV and cloud computing technologies. The E2E  multi-domain and multi-tenancy support in 5G network slicing promises to enable vertical industries with a  diverse set of performance, service and security requirements. Network slicing will give operators capabilities  of creating different level of services for different verticals, enabling them to customise their operations.  2.6 NFV KEY TECHNOLOGIES  This section presents an overview on different virtualisation, containerisation and MANO  technologies [28] currently being used in 5G to run and orchestrate multiple VNFs at the core,  edge and RAN. It examines the differences between using virtual machines (VMs) vs containers  vs unikernel vs cloud native microservices in the context of 5G.  2.6.1 Virtualisation  2.6.1.1 Hypervisor  Hypervisor-based virtualisation provides isolated environments on top of a shared pool of  resources [29], [30]. Hypervisor is a software layer that abstracts the underlying physical  resources and provides virtual machines with the full functionalities of a real system. Moreover,  a hypervisor is responsible for resource allocation to the VM as well as being responsible for  monitoring and managing VMs through coordination with the primary OS of the underlying  hardware.  There are two types of hypervisors known as Type 1 and Type 2.  • Based on Type I – Bare Metal Hypervisor: a type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the  host machine's physical hardware, and it's referred to as a bare-metal or native  hypervisor. The type I hypervisor doesn't have to load an underlying OS. It does not  need any host OS because the communication to hardware resources is direct with full  visibility of hardware resources [30].  • Based on Type II - Hosted Hypervisor: a type 2 hypervisor is typically installed on  top of an existing OS. It is sometimes called a hosted hypervisor because it relies on  23 https://ryu-sdn.org  24 https://www.opendaylight.org  https://ryu-sdn.org/ https://www.opendaylight.org/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  26  the host machine's pre-existing OS to manage calls to CPU, memory, storage and  network resources.  The bare-metal hypervisors (type I) are a more secure option. Unlike the hosted hypervisor,  they do not depend on the underlying OS. Table 5 summarises the features of Type I and Type  II hypervisors [31].  Table 5: Features of type I and type II hypervisors  Criteria Type I Type II  AKA Bare metal Hosted  Definition Runs directly on server hardware Runs on top of the supported OS  Scalability Better scalability Not so much, because of its reliance on the underlying OS  System  independence  Has direct access to hardware along with VMs, its  hosts  Is not allowed to directly access the host hardware and its  resources  Performance Provides better hardware resource utilisation Provides less hardware resource utilisation.  Security More secure as it is a hardware-based hypervisor  Less secure as it is a software-based hypervisor. Any  problem in the OS may affect the entire system including  the protected hypervisor.  Setup or installation In many such hypervisors, setup is hard and  hardware support is needed.  In many such hypervisors, setup is easy as there is already  an OS.  Examples VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, Xen  Hypervisor, Oracle VM, Citrix Hypervisor  Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Pro and  VMware Fusion, QEMU, Parallels Desktop, KVM25  2.6.1.2 Virtual machines  A VM is a type of virtualisation that splits bare metal servers into multiple independent instances  with separate operating systems inside. The operating system, applications and services are all  bundled into a single image that is accessed via a hypervisor, built on virtualised hardware.  Such virtualisation allows us to move away from the approach of running one application or  service per physical server and achieve better utilisation of capacity. The sizing of the VM will  depend on the resources available and the characteristics of the application that is going to be  executed on this machine. Within the VM, it is possible to run different OS depending on the  necessities or requirements of the application running on top of it.  A VM consists of several files that are stored on a storage device. The key files are the  configuration file, virtual disk file, NVRAM setting file and log file [28]. Some of the most  interesting functions that VMs enable are Snapshots26, Migration27 and Failover28 [32].  2.6.2 Cloud native  25 Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) has qualities of both a hosted and a bare-metal virtualisation hypervisor. It can turn  the Linux kernel itself into a hypervisor so the VMs have direct access to the physical hardware.  26 Snapshots: A snapshot is a state of a VM, and generally its storage devices, at an exact point in time. A snapshot  enables the VM's state at the time of the snapshot to be restored later, effectively undoing any changes that occurred  afterwards. This capability is useful as a backup technique, for example, prior to performing a risky operation.  27 Migration: The snapshots can be moved to another host machine with its own hypervisor; when the VM is temporarily  stopped, snapshotted, moved, and then resumed on the new host, this is known as migration. If the older snapshots are  kept in synchronisation regularly, this operation can be quite fast, and allow the VM to provide uninterrupted service while  its prior physical host is, for example, taken down for physical maintenance.  28 Failover: Similar to the migration mechanism, failover allows the VM to continue operations if the host fails. Generally, it  occurs if the migration has stopped working. However, in this case, the VM continues operation from the last-known  coherent state, rather than the current state, based on whatever materials the backup server was last provided with.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  27  Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that fully exploits the benefits  of the cloud computing model. Applications are cloud-native network functions. 5G NFs, as a  cloud native NF, is designed using the following important cloud-native principles.  2.6.2.1 Containerisation  OS-level virtualisation represents the containerisation model, which envisages that only the  applications and their dependencies are integrated into a container. Each container shares the  host OS kernel operating on bare metal, as well as its binaries and libraries so the applications  run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another29.  As a result, containers are exceptionally lightweight and fast to start. Containers allow for more  efficient implementation of microservices principles due to their elasticity and ease of  provisioning. Containers are more commonly adopted by cloud-native applications, as each  service component becomes a separate element in a microservices architecture.  Many types of containerisation technologies are available, for instance:  • Docker containers: this is a popular open-source project based on Linux containers.  Docker is written in GO and developed by Dotcloud. Docker is basically a container  engine (ETSI CIS) which uses the Linux kernel features like namespaces and control  groups to create containers on top of an operating system and automates application  deployment on the container.  • Java containers: these types of software packages enable standalone functioning of  Java applications or parts of them. Examples: Springboot, Jetty, Tomcat.  • LXD containers: represent Linux containers software technology that is very similar to  various Linux distributions. These are integrated with the OpenNebula EDGE platform.  • OpenVZ containers30: Open Virtuozzo is a dedicated container-based virtualisation  technology specially created for Linux operating systems.  • RKT containers: rocket containers and RKT container engine were developed by  CoreOS for the majority of Linux distributions in a cloud-native environment. This type  of container is composed of a pod (like in the Kubernetes model and concept) with one  or more applications inside.  • Hyper-V containers: they constitute a different type of container because they create their  own copy of the Windows OS kernel and are completely isolated, having incorporated both  kernel space and user modes. They can be easily associated with a VM.  2.6.2.2 Microservices  A 5G NF, as a cloud native NF, is composed of cloud-native network functions components that  combine to enable 5G-specific features. The basic components of a cloud native NF are  microservices, which can be executed independently in separate containers, be deployed  independently, and be re-composed when creating a new cloud native NF. These microservice- based cloud native NFs are highly scalable and can enable the deployment of new features  quickly.  A microservices architecture develops a single application as a suite of small services, each of  which run their own process and communicate with lightweight mechanisms. Applications  designed from the beginning as a microservice may have the innovation needed for the new  telecom service environment.  The microservices architecture requires a high degree of orchestration. Moreover, consideration  must be given to whether decomposing into a microservice can actually be counterproductive.  29 https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container  30 https://openvz.org/  https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container https://openvz.org/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  28  Because microservicing supports cloud-native architecture, it can create problems with latency,  which is the death knell for 5G applications and services.  While mobile operators stand to benefit tremendously from fully deployed 5G networks, the  reality is that there are a number of foundational issues that must be addressed to ensure those  networks provide the speed, latency and reliability that 5G applications demand.  As is generally true in technology, a hybrid approach to developing VM, container and  microservices technologies is likely the best pragmatic path forward for operators31. By  combining the main principles ‘containerisation’ and ‘microservices’ operators can build a 5G  network with cloud-native network functions.  2.6.3 Hybrid virtualisation and containerisation  With the development of cloud native technology, the telco infrastructure is on a path to  leveraging the container-based architecture. But until then, solutions will incorporate a mixture  of VMs and containers. In virtualised legacy networks like the EPC and 5G Non-Standalone  (NSA) core, network functions that create real-time services and manage the user plane traffic  typically run on VMs, which is appropriate for supporting services that do not have strict latency  requirements or network configurations. Meanwhile, operators use containers for broadband  services that need scalability or services that are not susceptible to failures. Therefore, to  support interworking with existing networks, the 5G network requires virtualisation and cloud  native technology that can support both VMs and containers at the same time. Typical VMs,  containers and hybrid architectures are depicted in Figure 7.  31 https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190411/5g/cloud-native-5g-reader-forum  https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190411/5g/cloud-native-5g-reader-forum  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  29  2.6.4 Unikernels  Unikernel is an alternative to both VMs and containers for lightweight virtualisation of resources.  It can embed only one application and a limited set of its dependencies which, differently from  containers, also includes the libraries for hardware resource management [33]. It emerged due  to the idea that the majority of the functions running either in the cloud or at the edge do not  require many of the services inherent to OSs, and thus those services can be excluded.  Unikernels are single-purpose appliances that are specialised at compile time into standalone  kernels32. They are constructed with the minimal necessary libraries, modularly, compiled  together with the application code into an image (no division between kernel and user spaces)  that can be run on top of a hypervisor or directly on a hardware layer. Different library OSs (e.g.  IncludeOS, UKL, MirageOS, OSv, Rumprun, runtime.js) can be used to develop unikernels, with  slightly different security profiles, programming languages (some of them aiming to avoid  programming directly in C), and legacy compatibility.  Among other advantages, unikernels improve security over other virtualisation paradigms since  (i) they have no other functions or ports apart from the specific application they were built for,  thus the attack surface is minimal, and (ii) they achieve a degree of isolation similar to VMs and  much higher than containers, since the latter share a common kernel. Besides, due to their  specialisation, unikernels come with the benefit of faster boot times and lower image sizes than  containers, as well as a similar degree of memory consumption when running.  Still, unikernels have some drawbacks that come mainly from their immaturity. The most critical  one is related to the high development times as (i) kernel functionalities have to be carefully  selected and configured for the specific application, (ii) there is a lack of tools designed for  debugging unikernels, and (iii) to be updated they have to be shut down, updated, recompiled  and instantiated, a set of operations that is not possible to run on the fly.  The nature of unikernels33 make them suitable for deploying stateless, high-response, low-  latency VNFs located at Edge nodes. General algorithms (e.g. compression, encryption, data  32 A. Madhavapeddy et al., ‘Unikernels: Library Operating Systems for the Cloud’, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 48, no. 4. 2013, pp. 461–72.  33 http://unikernel.org/projects/  http://unikernel.org/projects/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  30  aggregation) and specific functions for vehicular edge computing (VEC), edge computing for  smart cities and augmented reality (AR)34 are use cases in which unikernels can be of utility.  The UNICORE project35, which aims at providing a toolchain for facilitating the development of  secure, portable, scalable, lightweight and high performance unikernels, foresees their potential  application in 5G-RAN, vCPE and serverless computing, among other fields. As current  virtualised infrastructure managers (VIMs) support unikernels, some H2020 5G-PPP projects  (such as 5G-MEDIA36, 5GCity37, Superfluidity38, 5G-Complete39, etc.) are using them jointly  with VMs and containers within their 5G deployments, being leveraged in tandem with  conforming services thus benefiting from their respective advantages.  2.6.5 VMs vs containers vs unikernels  Operators have been deploying VNFs for several years to replace hardware-based appliances.  Operators deploy network functions virtualisation (NFV) in one of three ways: on virtual  machines (VMs) with hypervisors; in containers; or using a hybrid approach. VMs have their  own operating system (OS), while containers share an OS. As such, containers are more  efficient because they don’t require multiple operating systems per host.  However, containers present several challenges for telecom-grade environments. The first  challenge is that sharing the OS creates the potential for applications and their containers to  interfere with each other or create resource contention. For mobile operators in particular, this  approach creates difficulties in both the control and data planes for a 5G environment, where  latency, efficiency, security and a high level of distribution are needed.  Unikernels, as a third option, primarily target the drawbacks of legacy VMs by compressing the  kernel and shared libraries to the bare minimum while maintaining compatibility with the  traditional cloud virtualisation stacks (hypervisors, controllers, MANO). Differently from  containers, which have a shared kernel, each unikernel has its own kernel. This allows better  isolation than containers. Table 6 provides a comparison of virtualisation technologies. In  addition, Figure 8 illustrates the main differences between the architecture of VMs, containers  and unikernels [33].

Such shared resources may expose security risks on  several different levels and the severity of the risk may depend on the nature of such tenants.  Below are the main NFV deployment models with varying risks that may be considered in a  virtualised environment. Main references used to develop this section are: [32], [23], [34], [35].  2.7.1 Single operator environment  The same operator owns, operates and controls completely the VNFs, the virtualisation layer  and the hardware and the premises in which they are located (see Figure 9). In this model, the  operator is only exposed to its own network elements and functions. In this model, the operator  must cater for most of the risks, since it has to implement security measures to protect the  different layer of NFV including VNFs, virtual resources, and physical infrastructure.  The operator must also implement robust Identity, credential and access management policies  to protect its assets and prevent attacks such as man-in-the-middle, whereby an attacker (e.g. a  malicious or compromised tenant) can illegitimately access the offered service. Malicious  insiders in the operator’s system administration represent a further risk of compromising the  operator’s reputation and exposing security risks to the tenant, which may receive compromised  services that may violate its data.  In this model, the tenant has no control over the infrastructure. Tenant data are stored within the  operator infrastructure and, thus, it is of paramount importance that strong security measures  necessary to protect these data are applied. Such measures include the prevention of data loss  and strong isolation when data belonging to different tenants share the same server (or  resources). Data breaches can also happen when a malicious tenant violates someone’s data.  With this model, consumers usually access the services offered through web browsers, thus the  operator must not overlook vulnerabilities in the software offered and in the protocols used (e.g.  HTTP) in order to protect its network from attacks. A typical category of attack is the abuse and  nefarious use of services performed, for example, by a consumer who executes a malware  injection or DoS attack on the operator’s server, profiting from the services offered.  Figure 9: Single operator environment model  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  32  2.7.2 Operator hosting virtual network operators  This is based on the single operator environment model. In this model, the network operator  hosts other virtual network operators within the same facility. It would probably isolate each  virtual operator on separate hardware. However, in theory, the VMs or containers of different  virtual network operators could run alongside each other over the same virtualisation layer (see  Figure 10). In this model, the operator is exposed to its own network elements and functions, as  well as the network elements and functions of the other virtual operators.  Figure 10: Operator hosting virtual network operators model  2.7.3 Third party hosting  A third-party cloud provider operates the computer hardware, infrastructure network and the  virtualisation layer on which VNFs are running. The premises, including cable chambers, patch  panels, etc., are physically secured by the third-party cloud provider. There are three scenarios  in this model (see Figure 11):  • scenario 1 – separate cloud for a single operator: in this scenario, the platform runs the  VNFs of a single operator;  • scenario 2 – community cloud for multiple operators: in this scenario, the platform runs  the VNFs of multiple operators;  • scenario 3 – public cloud for operators and other service providers: in this scenario, the  platform runs operator’s VNFs or other non-network related services.  In all scenarios, the operators are always accountable and responsible for the protection of  VNFs and data. In all scenarios, the operator is exposed to its own network elements and  functions as well as to the third-party hosting service that may not be accountable and that may  be able to transparently gather information emitted from the network infrastructure.  In scenario 2, the operator may also be exposed to network traffic from other operators. In  scenario 3, the operator may also be exposed to network traffic from other operators as well as  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  33  traffic from other services that may have lesser security and/or integrity requirements than the  operator.  In this model, the operator must avoid software VNF vulnerabilities to prevent an attacker from  making a nefarious use of services. For its part, the cloud provider must avoid software flaws in  the operating system, in the virtual resources and servers offered to the operator(s) while  guaranteeing them access to the platform through secure APIs to prevent malware Injections.  Due to weak isolation among resources of the platform assigned to different VNFs belonging to  diverse operators or to the non-network services of other service providers, attacks such as side  channel or VM or container data theft may occur. At the same time, applications or non-network  related services from other service providers that are not necessarily all trusted may run on the  same platform in different VMs or containers, so the operator can be damaged by an attacker  that manages to exploit a lack of isolation between a vulnerable VM or container and other VMs  or containers or the host machine, thus having illegitimate access to other VNFs belonging to  other operators or the cloud provider’s platform.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  34  2.7.4 Operator hosting third party service providers  In this model, the operator leaves to the service provider the task of deploying its own  applications, thus executing arbitrary software on the operator infrastructure (see Figure 12). In  this case the operator is in charge of protecting its assets, which include data and servers  underlying virtual resources offered as MEC services.  For the operator, potential threats can be caused in the following situations: (i) elevated  privileges are given to a service provider on storage access (data breach risks), (ii) the service  provider is able to control the infrastructure offered by the operator through insecure APIs  (insecure APIs risks) and execute arbitrary code (higher risk of hijacking of the elements of the  infrastructure by malicious service providers), and (iii) a service provider could run malicious  code through the operating system of its VM, thus penetrating the operator’s infrastructure, or  could, intentionally or accidentally, fail in updating its VM, thus exposing it to attacks.  2.7.5 Summary  The different deployment models described above are summarised in Table 7. It shows the  actor(s) involved on the management and operation at each layer of the NFV system for each  deployment model. The column ‘Location’ states the location where the infrastructure is  deployed. The column ‘Cloud Type’ identifies which NFV deployment scenarios are similar to  the common deployment models used in cloud computing. The right-most column ‘Suitable for’  also provides the suitability of each deployment model for the core, MEC and/or RAN.

This initial step will guide us to identify the best practices and provide  recommendations.  3.1 ASSETS  To address NFV challenges in a 5G ecosystem, it is essential to identify the assets of such a  complex ecosystem. The main asset categories introduced in this report are inspired from the  ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks [6] (December 2020), [36] (November 2019) and  derived from the 5G NFV architecture described at the beginning of this report. These main  categories include components and entities from network products, management and  orchestration, data, processes and environment. A complete diagram of the asset mind maps is  present in Annex B.  Figure 13: 5G NFV asset categories  An assessment of the asset categories in maintaining security-related protection properties in  terms of CIA (confidentiality, integrity and availability) for each category is provided in Annex A.  The critical asset categories of 5G NFV to be protected are as follows (see Figure 13).  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  37  • The NFV network components category includes NFV components network planes,  functions, and elements. These divide into multiple asset groups such as core  functions, virtualisation infrastructure, network function virtualisation (NFV), physical  infrastructure, security, software-defined networking (SDN), Multi-Edge Computing  (MEC), among others.  • The NFV MANO network components category includes the management of network  functions (NFVO, VIM, VNFM), network slicing, operations support system,  network/element (EMS/NMS) and SDN Controller. MANO is the most vital part of the  5G infrastructure since it is responsible for controlling the entire set of network  functions, their virtualisation and the entire related software lifecycle.  • The NFV Data category includes users, applications, VNFs, NS, system, network,  SDN, configuration and security-related data.  • The NFV processes and environment category includes processes and facilities  related to MNOs and vendors.  3.2 SECURITY CHALLENGES  While NFV opens the door for flexible networks and rapid service creation, these offer both  security opportunities while also introducing additional security challenges and complexities.  The 5G networks would essentially promote the use of NFV technologies. NFV, like many new  technologies, presents new security challenges and these extend many of the security  challenges applicable to NFV to 5G networks. Thus, it is important to address the security  challenges appropriately and to focus on instilling stronger security and privacy settings in 5G  NFV systems.  In this chapter, we identify and describe the security challenges that the 5G NFV may face.  Documents used as references for the development of this chapter are provided in Annex G.  The challenges have been grouped into categories to make them more understandable. The  resulting list consists of seven categories (see Figure 14).  Figure 14: Categories of security challenges  Each category is provided in one section. Each section starts with an overview of the challenge  category followed by a table describing the associated challenges. A high-level mapping table  showing the relationship at the category level between challenge categories, vulnerabilities,  attacks, affected assets and best practices is provided in section 4.4. A detailed mapping is  provided in Annex F.  3.2.1 Virtualisation or containerisation  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  38  Cloud, virtualisation, containerisation, edge computing and SDN play additional roles in the era  of 5G. The scale, elasticity, agility, responsiveness and rich software functionality required for  5G applications and microservices can only be achieved in the cloud. Today NFV is carried out  on VMs and containers, and they’ll continue to be utilised in a 5G environment.  As with any new technology, the benefits may also present potential security challenges if  proper security measures are not considered. NFV enables network slicing by replacing network  functions on appliances such as routers, load balancers and firewalls with instances of  virtualised software that run on commodity hardware.  Virtual network functions and/or cloud-native network functions are used to run these functions  as packaged software which also means a much wider attack area. Moreover, SDNs enable  programmable network controls and abstract the underlying infrastructure from the apps and  network services. Centralised and controllable, SDNs provide the agility required to adapt to the  evolving needs of 5G microservices. However, SDNs are susceptible to attacks such as  forwarding device attacks, control pane threats, API vulnerabilities, counterfeit traffic flows and  more.  In the edge and far edge, operators are introducing VNFs which causes a new set of security  challenges. VMs or containers may require elevated privileges to support certain network  functions that could cause security vulnerabilities for the host system as well as peer VMs or  containers. Due to the unique characteristic of the NFV environment, different network functions  can be created and terminated dynamically on different and distributed entities.  The NFV approach allows for the dynamic distribution of the instantiated VNFs throughout the  virtualised infrastructure at the edge, at the core or at the operator’s datacentre. In the same  way, monitoring can also be distributed and take place at different locations in the operator’s  network covering different parts of the network. Dynamic distribution of NFV architectures pose  major security challenges that need to be considered.  A unique aspect of co-residency in NFV is that, in an NFV stack, co-residency can happen  between more layers, such as between VNFs and the virtualisation layer or between the  virtualisation layer and physical hosts. The co-residency of VNFs on the same physical host can  occur due to placement or migration, which is known to lead to side-channel or resource  depletion attacks due to the shared physical resources such as CPU, memory, or cache. The  co-residency of VNFs on the host can also occur when different tenants employ the same host  to run similar network functions, such as virtual firewall or virtual IDS. The fact that multiple  tenants are sharing both virtual and physical resources in the same NFV stack poses additional  security challenges. Table 8 illustrates the main security challenges raised by the virtualisation  or containerisation technologies.  Table 8: Main security challenges facing ‘virtualisation or containerisation’  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH-V1  Challenges  within the  runtime  software  Virtualisation of network functions will increase the network’s vulnerability to attackers due to the increased  reliance on software. A NFV software component may contain potential software vulnerabilities or it can be a  malware itself. In virtualised implementations all VNFs are implemented using a common software platform  such as OpenStack, Kubernetes.  While vendors may produce tweaked variants, the code core will be largely identical. Similarly, host OS,  hypervisor, CIS and VNFs software will be identical or from a limited set of variants. What this means is that  if an attacker is able to identify a software vulnerability in one VNF, that vulnerability will likely exist in many  other VNFs making the attackers job much easier and increases the risk of a cascading security failure in  the network. If network security functions (e.g. SEPP) use the same software core or are in the same  virtualisation layer trust domain as the functions they are protecting, the risk increases further if a software  vulnerability occurs.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  39  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  Note: the term ‘trust domain’ is defined by ETSI in [17]. It is a collection of entities that share a set of security  policies. In NFV networks, multiple trust domains should be considered by CSPs during the deployment  phase where a CSP wishes to achieve security role and management separation, security isolation,  separation between sensitive and non-sensitive components, etc.  CH-V2  Flexibility and  openness of  service  environment  Virtualisation technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualisation  (NFV) are thriving in anticipation of 5G networks. However, they too come with new security concerns.  Because of their open, flexible, programmable nature, SDN and NFV open a new avenue of security threats.  The promised flexibility and openness of service environments via VNFs raises security concerns since data  and NFV software are not directly controlled by the more risk-aware enterprises due to the risk of  introspection by a malicious actor with total control on the execution environment entailing memory, storage  and processing elements.  CH-V3  Challenges  within the  hypervisor  Hypervisor security mean ensuring that virtualised network elements are protected from exfiltration and VM- based attacks that come from east-west and north-south traffic.  The most important software in a NFV is the hypervisor. Any security vulnerability in the hypervisor and  associated infrastructure and management software or tools puts VNFs at risk.  The hypervisor is fully aware of the current state of each guest OS it controls. Hypervisor introspection can  enable the ability to view, inject, and/or modify information on the operational status associated with NFV  through direct or indirect methods. Access to status information can result in the ability to arbitrarily read  and/or write the contents of memory, storage, key storage and other NFV operational aspects.  CH-V4 Time  manipulation  The virtualisation infrastructure provides a flexible environment for hosting several applications and  telecommunication services. Precise and secure timing services and time-stamping of events are critical to  many of those services (e.g. mobile wireless) and applications (e.g. high frequency trading, financial  transactions, banking systems, billing, etc.). The virtualisation infrastructure itself requires timing and  synchronisation for fault management (through logging of events) and security management (through  identity and access management).  A fundamental problem with all virtualised implementations is that VNFs have trouble accurately telling the  time and generating entropy. Unlike a PNF which can easily be designed to have direct access to a physical  clock, a VNF’s view of time is only virtual.  If an attacker or, in some scenarios, a malicious VM or container on the same host is able to manipulate the  virtual CPU clock then is it possible to affect management or service functions such as manipulating  cryptographic algorithms, key generation or other processes which are highly time dependent or may also  impact the synchronisation between UEs and the network. Such manipulation may involve stretching the  shape of clock cycles rather than simply increasing or decreasing their frequency. ETSI GR NFV-SEC 01640  (draft specification - work in progress) provides more detailed discussion on timing issues with virtualised  environments.  CH-V5 Entropy  generation  Entropy is used across VNFs. When VNFs do not have access to high quality entropy it can negatively affect  security due to weak cryptographic keys.  The key point of cryptography is cryptographic algorithms and keys. The random number generator is used  to generate seeds and keys randomly in many cryptographic operations. The strength and security of keys  depends on their randomness. For this reason it is essential to use keys, for instance, to encrypt and decrypt  information, and the security of these keys is closely related to the quality of entropy. If not enough quality  entropy is available predictable keys may be produced, which are susceptible to a breach.  For these reasons, a reliable source of entropy ensuring strong and random key generation is required to be  used by the cryptographic operations (e.g. encryption).  CH-V6 Encrypted data  processing  In a virtualised environment it is necessary to explicitly consider the risk to cryptographic processing of data  within a VNF where a fully hardened HSM or HMEE (hardware mediated execution environment) is not used  to perform the cryptographic function.  Most software manipulating data with cryptographic operations will perform modification actions on  encrypted data by first unencrypting the data either in general memory (less than ideal) or CPU cache  (better but vulnerabilities exist). Following the necessary processing, the data will be encrypted again.  Within existing SA3 specifications, while some specialist operations are performed in tamper resistant  hardware (e.g. UICC), the bulk of cryptographic processing (e.g. user plane protection) will be performed  using general X86 (or similar) servers within the core network.  In a virtualised environment there are various ways in which unencrypted data can be captured: through the  virtualisation layer, server management hardware, modification of VNF images, instantiating a parallel VM or  container on the same physical CPU, or any number of other options. The risks of being able to capture  encrypted data in an unencrypted form due to the processing of that data, increases significantly. If that  processing is highly sensitive (e.g. AUC (authentication centre) or LI functions) then the risk may not be  40 https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Drafts/SEC016_Location_Locstamp_Timestamp/NFV-SEC016v007.zip  https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Drafts/SEC016_Location_Locstamp_Timestamp/NFV-SEC016v007.zip  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  40  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  acceptable. Placing entire VMs into HMEE(s) is unlikely to be needed as it is more appropriate to place  specific sub-functions, processes or containers into a HMEE which current CPU based HMEE(s) can  support. However, in most cases this support is not currently OS kernel native.  CH-V7  Challenges  within IP layer  vs application  layer  In a PNF implementation there are significant differences (pros and cons) between using security protocols  such as IPSec designed to protect IP traffic over 3GPP reference points and over the top end to end  application layer security (typically using TLS). Both are good at providing protection again a physical  attacker trying to attack a physical cable or optical fibre but their characteristics vary in terms of where the  encryption terminates in relation to where the data is processed or stored. TLS is considered to terminate  closer to the point where a function processes or manages data, whereas IPSec may terminate at a PNF  closer to the edge of the network.  In flat virtualised deployments with a common virtualisation layer and resources, there is very little difference  between IPSec and TLS with neither offering, by default, protection from virtualisation layer (host OS,  hypervisor, CIS) attacks. In this scenario, both IPSec and TLS tunnels terminate in arbitrary memory  locations which will be in the same accessible range as the plain text data they are intended to protect.  Unless the IPSec or TLS tunnels transverse a physical network linked externally to the datacentres, the  threats they mitigate can largely become irrelevant. Using HMEEs massively improves security (see ETSI  TS NFVSEC 01241). However, it is clearly impractical for all TLS or IPSec endpoints for all control plane or  user plane traffic to be terminated in HMEEs.  CH-V8  Default  deployment or  configuration  If a new, or a modification of, an existing VNF is deployed or instantiated into the production environment  where it is connected to traffic and signalling interfaces, there is a risk that the VNF may become  compromised before the element management EMS) has successfully configured the interface security  controls. This may be caused by default or due to minimal security controls existing in the VNFD (virtual  network function descriptor) or image.  A common VNFD instance or image may be used to deploy multiple images of the same VNF. It is probable  that each VNFD image will contain the same default security credentials and configuration. Between  deployment and configuration these default security credentials may increase the exposure of the NFV  elements to compromise, due to, for example, the same guest ‘root’ password, crypto private keys, and  TLS/IPsec certificates.  CH-V9 Network traffic  exposure  Existing monitoring systems need to be adapted and correctly controlled since they were meant mostly for  physical and not virtual systems and boundaries, and do not allow fine‐grained analysis adapted to the  needs of SDN/NFV based 5G network management. The lack of visibility and controls on internal virtual  networks that are created, coupled with the heterogeneity of devices used, make many performance  assessment applications ineffective. For instance, existing security monitoring applications cannot monitor  virtual connections in 5G network elements.  Increased virtualisation introduces challenges for network monitoring. Due to the virtualised architecture of  5G networks and deployment of network functions closer to the radio access network or network access  edge, it will be more difficult to detect and recognise the types of traffic inside and between VNFs crossing  these networks and mitigate against any new threats. This could lead to difficulty in diagnosing network  performance issues or failure to spot attackers.  Traffic routed through a virtualised network may not be completely accessible for physical firewall controls or  visible to traditional security inspections as previously applied on physical networks.  CH- V10  Security logs  troubleshooting  failure  NFV should be able to determine the source of attacks and recover, and protect against that source in the  future. It should be verified that every security event is logged. NFV components may generate a huge  number of logs on the virtualisation platform, therefore log analysis and event correlation in NFV will quickly  become a ‘big data’ issue. Tools also are needed that can address all the forensics and compliance  requirements.  Compromised VNFs can generate a huge number of logs on the virtualisation platform, making it difficult to  analyse logs from other VNFs, especially when the initial entries in the log files are deleted. There is also a  risk when the infrastructure logs are leaked, as this consequently enables cross relating logs from one VNF  operator to another in order to extract sensitive information.  CH- V11  Container  acceleration  capabilities  Container acceleration capabilities, such as container caching, present security challenges as otherwise  encrypted VM equivalent image artefacts may be available in their unencrypted form in the cache to allow for  fast container re-instantiation.  The fast cycle times of containers also make traditional security monitoring and policy enforcement more  challenging as network security enforcement decision engines cannot so easily make real-time decisions on  access permission as is possible for longer lifetime VMs.  Techniques using both containers and VMs provide some mitigation (e.g. running all containers for a specific  VNF with a large VM, or using VMs for VNF security sensitive components such as TLS end points). Using  this approach, however, restricts the flexibility of containers and introduces additional complexity or cost.  41 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/012/03.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec012v030101p.pdf  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/012/03.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec012v030101p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  41  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V12  Container  isolation failure  From a security and isolation perspective, in the container deployment scenario the VM hypervisor is  replaced by a CIS which manages the life-cycle of a container within a given group of containers (e.g. pod or  cluster). However, the CIS does not provide equivalent VM security memory isolation or breakout protection.  The container application usually runs on ‘bare metal’ with no OS equivalent to the guest OS used in VM  based implementations.  The newer generation of NFV implementations have chosen to deploy NF as a group of containers due,  especially, to the benefits associated with containers and aspects of their deployment over traditional VM  deployment. Such deployments can be highly flexible by allowing the operators to deploy multiple NFs as a  collection of small microservices on the same physical machines and/or even deploy NF containers within  VMs. Containers co-hosted on the same physical machine as tenants share the same kernel and OS  resources. This allows for a potential risk that a rogue container could escape the confinement of the  container and have an impact on other co-hosted containers.  There are multiple ways for attackers to escape isolation in the container. There have been reports that a  number of CVEs have documented known vulnerabilities that have been identified in the past. One way to  escape containers is to exploit vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel enforces container  isolation by employing namespaces and cgroups. However, if attackers gain kernel level privileges through  privilege escalation, they can circumvent isolation as reported in CVEs (e.g. CVE-2019-5736, CVE-2020- 15257and CVE-2021-31440). There are CVEs that have reported vulnerabilities in container runtimes that  allow container breakouts.  CH- V13  Sensitive data  in NF container  images  There are scenarios which benefit from including configuration and secrets, such as passwords or  credentials, in NF container images. For example, containers need to be able to connect to other containers  within the deployment as well as with external entities. All these connections need to be authenticated and  secured. One way of achieving this is to provide the requisite secrets or keys to the containers which allow  them to authenticate and be authenticated and secure the communication channel. A common but in-secure  means of providing secrets to the containers is by packaging the secrets or the keys with the image itself.  But there is the risk that the same can be extracted, read or manipulated before the container is deployed  and the secret used.  With a long supply chain, container images are vulnerable to outside scrutiny. With container images  containing secrets or keys, this becomes a serious threat vector. Adversaries can extract them by obtaining  a copy of the image and they can be potentially shared with third parties for illicit gain.  • Secrets embedded within a container image can be stolen  • Secrets embedded within a container image can be modified  CH- V14  Core network  functions in the  MEC  Multi-access edge computing (MEC) transforms the way data is processed and stored by moving some core  network functions closer to the end user at the network edge, rather than relying on a central location that  may be hundreds of miles away. The introduction of untrusted 5G components into the MEC could expose  core network elements to risks introduced by software and hardware vulnerabilities, counterfeit components  and component flaws caused by poor manufacturing processes or maintenance procedures.  The presence of system components, such as hypervisors, CISs, operating systems and applications in the  MEC, may provide malicious actors with additional attack vectors to intercept, manipulate and destroy critical  data. Untrusted components or malware inserted within the MEC may impact user privacy by providing  malicious actors the capability to clone devices and impersonate end-users to make calls, send texts, and  use data. Malicious actors can use untrusted components or malware to gain access to the MEC and end- user components, leveraging them to gain access to the wider radio access network (RAN).  CH- V15  Wide  geographical  distribution of  MEC  infrastructures  As MEC Infrastructures can span a wide geographical distribution and be located in challenging  environments, maintaining a uniform datacentre level of physical security is a significant challenge. A  potential flaw in the physical security of any MEC hardware may result in physical attack on the  infrastructure. Physical security and environmental vulnerabilities of MEC hosts may arise due to improper  physical and environmental security of edge computing facilities, improper security monitoring of edge  computing facilities, etc.  CH- V16  Insecure  API/improper  authentication  of MEC  components  APIs are a well-known subject of multiple attack types, as they are exposed to external access. The  common API framework CAPIF is used by 3GPP as the standardised means to support providing and  accessing APIs (and ETSI MEC is fully aligned with CAPIF). From a software development point of view,  compliance with CAPIF should be ensured during API design and implementation phases. Further, the  vulnerabilities in the service-based interface (SBI) of MEC components can include improper transport layer  protection of data transferred over internal interfaces and improper verification of identity and access control  to authorised MEC applications.  CH- V17  Insufficient/impr oper Monitoring  Mechanisms of  MEC  components  Since MEC is based on virtualised infrastructure, it needs to include real-time security management based  on NFV specifications (see ETSI GS NFV-SEC 013) [38]. Especially when deploying MEC in NFV  environments, MEC should be considered as part of a whole system real-time security monitoring and  management strategy. Insufficient or improper monitoring mechanisms of MEC components can result from  insufficient logging of security events for MEC App and MEC host.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  42  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V18  Centralisation  of the SDN  control  platforms  SDN centralises the network control platforms and enables programmability in communication networks.  These two disruptive features, however, create opportunities for cracking and hacking the network. For  example, the centralised control will be a favourable choice for DoS attacks and exposing the critical  application programming interfaces (APIs) to unintended software can bring the whole network down [39].  The SDN controller modifies flow rules in the data path, hence the controller traffic can be easily identified.  This makes the controller a visible entity in the network rendering it a favourite choice for DoS attacks. The  centralisation of network control can also make the controller a bottleneck for the whole network due to  saturation attacks as presented in [40],[41].  CH- V19  Malicious SDN  applications  Since most network functions can be implemented as SDN applications, malicious applications if granted  access can spread havoc across a network and constrict bandwidth and negatively affect operations.  CH- V20  Common SDN  interfaces  Before 5G networks, mobile networks had dedicated communication channels based on GTP (GPRS  tunnelling protocol) and IPsec tunnels. A significant level of expertise is required to attack communication  interfaces, such as X2, S1, S6, S7, which are used only in mobile networks. However, SDN-based 5G  networks will not have such dedicated interfaces but rather common SDN interfaces. The openness of these  interfaces will increase the possible set of attackers.  The communication in SDN based 5G mobile networks can be categorised into three communication  channels, i.e. data channel, control channel and inter-controller channel [42]. In current SDN system, these  channels are protected by using TLS (transport layer security) sessions [43]. However, TLS sessions are  highly vulnerable to IP layer attacks [44], SDN scanner attacks [45] and lack strong authentication  mechanisms [46].  CH- V21  Isolation failure  between VNFs  The execution of diverse VNFs over the same NFV infrastructure sharing computing resources (e.g. CPU,  memory) and networking (e.g. vSwitches, physical NICs) can create security issues, if VNFs are not properly  isolated from other VNFs, from the virtualisation platform, from the host and from the network infrastructure.  Security measures enforcing the isolation shall be implemented in a hypervisor hosting multiple VMs or a  CIS hosting multiple containers with different security levels, for example, between VNFs supporting lawful  interception (LI) with non-critical VNFs.  There are various approaches to isolating VNFs, ranging from using physically separate hardware to using  separate VMs or containers.  There are several security threats if VNFs are not appropriately isolated, and resources are not shared  effectively. These include the noisy neighbour problem and potential side-channel attacks.  Note:  • Noisy neighbour is a term commonly used to describe situations in NFV infrastructure where an  application experiences degradation in performance due to the fact that some of the resources it needs  are occupied by other applications in the same cloud node. These situations cannot be easily identified  using straightforward approaches, which calls for the use of sophisticated methods for the  management of NFV infrastructure.  • Side channel attacks occur when an attacker is capable of gathering actionable information about  cryptographic secrets by observing the implementation of a platform (for example, power consumption,  run time, etcetera) and use that information to induce faults or modify the cache. Side channel attacks  do not necessarily require detailed information on the platform or system being attacked. Many side  channel attacks rely on statistical analysis of platform metadata that is typically exchanged (or  available) in the clear. NFV platform is susceptible to side channel attacks just like regular (non-virtual)  platforms.  CH- V22  Memory  introspection  In a virtual environment while the virtualisation layer plays a role in preventing one VM or container from  accessing the memory of another (except through declared VM or container shared memory locations), the  virtualisation layer is also able to inspect any memory which is directly under its control.  The virtualisation layer access to memory or other VM or container resources cannot be detected by VM or  container or 3GPP security mechanisms. Encrypting memory provides some resistance but if the keys used  to encrypt the memory are also under hypervisor or CIS control (including hypervisor or CIS resource  controlled TPM / HSMs) then this does not prevent introspection.  In addition to reading memory, the hypervisor or CIS is also in many cases able to write directly to memory,  bypassing normal memory access controls and security within the VM or container. This allows an attacker  with access to the hypervisor or CIS to change data within a VNF at run-time or indeed change the operation  of the VNF itself.  Container based NFV environments are subject to similar memory introspection risks, with the container (or  cluster) management engine providing similar functionality to the hypervisor in VM based implementations.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  43  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V23  Trusted  domains  segmentation  5G network functions can be grouped into different trust domains which have varying security requirements.  For example, trust in functions which contain long-term cryptographic keys might require different levels of  trust to functions which only hold session keys or those which do not contain cryptographic values at all.  However, this classification is too simplistic. Nearly all 3GPP NFs will contain some sensitive private  information for billing purposes or cryptographic material. Applying the same security policies to NFs in  different trust domains could lead to reduced security and/or reduced functionality.  Security domains based on grouping whole NFs may not be sufficient. In some scenarios (e.g. LI), sub- functions of NFs (e.g. LI POIs) may need to belong to different trust domains to the rest of the NF  functionality.  The definition of appropriate segregation and security policies for NFs in different trust domains requires the  establishment of trust domains for 3GPP NFs. It is up to 3GPP to define what a sensitive function or sub- function is and how they must be handled to protect privacy or security sensitive data, within a virtualised  environment.  While 3GPP TS 33.50142 provides some consideration for 5G network functions, CSPs are also in the  process of virtualising IMS or 3G/4G networks, for which similar consideration has not yet been given.  CH- V24  Access to  storage  resources  NFV environments run on server hardware (blade). In some use cases, there may be a need for using local  storage. The common deployment is to use a SAN. The deployment of SANs within the NFV environments  may have various risks, including copying an image or removing the local storage device to gain access and  obtain sensitive information.  A compromised VM or container can launch an attack on the SAN to obtain access to a storage area  containing critical images and data  The availability of the SAN is essential in a virtualised environment and any DoS attacks would affect the  entire NFV.  CH- V25  Sharing of  private keys  between VNFs  and  confidentiality  of sensitive  data  In the 5G core network, NF communications are secured using TLS, according to the profiles in TS 33.210.  ECDSA and RSA are used to authenticate these communications. Therefore, a VNF must contain private  keys to authenticate these exchanges. These keys need to be provisioned to VMs or containers securely on  first boot or need to be stored securely on the image in some fashion.  A decision also needs to be made as to whether two NF instances may share the same key pair, for  example if the second instance is to be deployed in case the first fails.  Certain VNFs will hold sensitive data, which should not be available to other VNFs or which should only be  made available in a specific set of circumstances. For example, the 3GPP TS 33.501 includes the  requirement that long-term keys shall never leave the secure environment of the UDM/ARPF.  To have the same level of confidence in the confidentiality of sensitive data when stored in a VNF as when it  is stored on physically separated hardware, it is necessary to consider new threat vectors. For example, the  long-term keys in a virtual UDM/ARPF could be stolen by an attacker with root access to the virtualisation  layer. Alternatively, cache side-channel attacks might allow the operator of a VNF sharing resources to  recover data.  CH- V26  Availability of  network  functions  One of the advantages of virtualisation is that a network can scale and transform to meet demand. In  general, it is likely that the availability of required VNFs is less of a concern than in a physical deployment.  However, virtualisation does introduce new availability risks. For example, shared resources might be  monopolised by a neighbouring VM or container (the noisy neighbour problem).  Many VNFs are essential for the 5G core network to function. For example, if a UDM/ARPF is not available  then a user cannot complete primary authentication. Similarly, if an AMF is not available then a connection  cannot be managed. Therefore, it is important that the VNF is guaranteed to be available in the same way as  a physical network function would be.  CH- V27  Software  catalogue  image  exposure  Virtualised networks define convenient software onboarding APIs and use central software catalogues to  hold the VNF images prior to instantiation. There has been significant resistance in ETSI ISG NFV and  open-source communities to mandate full mandatory integrity checking of software images at both the  overall package and sub-component (artefact) level. Current implementations offer minimal if any mandatory  signing and where they do, this is based purely on vendor signatures. Therefore, in theory at least, any  image from the same vendor would pass verification checks if loaded into the wrong CSP software  catalogue.  Furthermore, the software catalogues with or without integrity protection provide a standardised description  of the VNFs, their resource requirements, their configuration and ultimately the compiled executables that  make up the VNF. If an attacker can access the catalogue then they will be able to gain directly a lot of  information which can then be used to attack running instances of the VNF. Where those VNFs contain  cryptographic functions or sensitive information, this increases the risk further.  42 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  44  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  Based on current virtualisation standards in ETSI and Open Source, the protection of the confidentiality of  whole images or artefacts during run-time, on-boarding, storage, and instantiation is not supported, although  for LI purposes this was recommended in ETSI TS NFV-SEC 011.  CH- V28  Multi-vendors  integration  At the integration and deployment stage of the NFV, the major challenges are related to interoperability  between different vendors and how to integrate the software components, hardware, and security solutions  of multiple vendors into a stable and efficient system, and how to assign SLA agreements between different  components.  Hardware, the virtualisation layer, VNFs and control solutions for cloud resources may be provided by  different vendors, increasing the risk of security holes due to mismatched assumptions and expectations.  Security solutions within NFV could be provided by different vendors, which may be complex to manage and  monitor, resulting in the operator not using these security solutions.  CH- V29  Multi-tenants  Co-residency  As an NFV stack is multi-tenant in nature, placing and migrating a VNF can be a challenging task for the  provider due to the issue of co-residency. It is well known that co-residency may lead to various security  issues, such as side-channel attacks, and additionally the tenant may have specific requirements in terms of  (the lack of) co-residency. Co-residency may occur in an NFV environment when a VNF is first placed or  when an existing VNF is migrated. The tenant requirements may specify that certain VNFs are to be placed  on a dedicated host or a VM or container needs to have an auto-scaling feature such that its need for more  space can be quickly fulfilled. In terms of security, co-resident VNFs may belong to tenants with conflicting  interests, and the co-residency may enable an insider attack with increased privileges and connectivity not  available to regular attackers.  The co-residency of VNFs on the same VM or container can also occur when different tenants employ the  same VM or container to run similar network functions, such as a virtual firewall or virtual IDS.  Lack of multi-tenant controls in an operator’s NFV infrastructure or MANO, where multiple tenants are  supported, increases the opportunity for the compromise of a VNF and the underlying NFV infrastructure  (e.g. supporting network, host OS, hypervisor, CIS, storage, hardware IO, compute and memory).  CH- V30  Elastic nature  of NFVI- migration of  VNFs  Due to the dispersion of VMs or containers that belong to a VNF across racks and datacentres within the  NFVI PoP in the core, MEC and RAN, and due to the migration of VMs or containers for optimisation or  maintenance purposes, the physical perimeters of the network functions become blurred and ‘fluid’ making it  practically impossible to manually define and manage security zones. If a VM or container is migrated to  another cluster where the security level is different or security measures are lacking, the VNFs may be  exposed to untrusted network traffic.  5G involves the active use of mobile edge computing technology (MEC). These can be corporate  applications running on service providers’ networks: intelligent services, financial services, multimedia, etc. It  should be noted that in this case, a 5G provider’s networks are integrated into the corporate infrastructure.  This gives the attacker new opportunities for entering corporate networks, as the MEC equipment is placed  outside the protected perimeter of an organisation.  CH- V31  Geographical  location  Using NFV, the violation of regulatory policies and laws becomes possible by moving one VNF from a legal  location to another illegal location. The consequences of violating regulatory policies can be a complete  banning of the service and/or the imposition of a financial penalty, which may be the original intention of the  attacker in order to harm the service provider.  For some VNFs (or subcomponents) it is necessary to know exactly where a VNF is (or at least in which  datacentre it resides).  By default, cloud hosting environments do not by nature provide an attestable guarantee of physical location  of a host or VNF. It is possible to indirectly attest location through host IDs but it is also possible to move a  host from one location to another. 3GPP functions such as AUC, UDM or LI functions need to be attestable  within the boundaries of a specific physical location (ETSI TR NFV-SEC 016 discusses some of these  issues).  Furthermore, if functions such as SEPP are supposed to be the physical boundary of a network then it may  be necessary to be able to constrain them, and the SDN routing to them, to specific physical locations.  CH- V32  Data life cycle  and location  In virtualised environments, it is necessary to consider where data has been and whether that data is  sensitive as regards privacy. If a VNF moves from one host to another or is terminated, and the previous  resources are allocated to another VNF without being fully cleared, this risks compromising privacy sensitive  data or keys.  OSs are not unknown to proliferate temp files, which in a PNF is much easier to contain (ignoring PNFs with  external storage). In a VNF, if storage or memory is not fully erased before reuse there is a significant risk of  data loss between VNFs. By extension, software is not unknown to crash or experience abnormal behaviour,  increasing the risk of data remaining in undesirable locations.  If a VNF cannot securely attest what host it is running on then high security functions could be deployed on  vulnerable hosts.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  45  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V33  VNF host  spanning  VNFs are large complex lumps of functionality which span multiple physical hardware hosts in a virtualised  implementation. In a virtualised environment, access to the interconnections between servers making up a  single VNF can be gained much more easily.  While there is a risk of an attacker gaining physical access to the interconnections between servers making  up a single PNF, this generally requires physical access to the hardware. In a virtualised environment,  however, access can be gained much more easily as the servers making up a function are more likely to be  physically distributed and the SDN v-switch would allow an attacker to fork IP packets flowing much more  easily between remote hosts Such forking is very difficult to detect or prevent from within a VNF unless  specific mitigation during design is taken to minimise the risk.  While TLS automatically applied by the NFV or SDN layer between VMs or containers reduces threats from  external attackers, it is much less effective against attackers who have (or have gained) access to NFV  MANO, etc.  CH- V34  Dynamic nature  of network  functions  One of the main persistent challenges to the use of NFV in mobile networks is the dynamic nature of VNFs  that leads to configuration errors and thus security lapses.  For instance, using NFV, virtual networking components (e.g. virtual routers and virtual networks) can be  easily created. Quick and dynamic service decisions can result in human error when a virtual router is  created and used to interconnect virtual networks without the use of any firewall. Compared to physical  network appliance deployments, the dynamicity of virtual network appliances and its connectivity can lead to  improper separation between the network and its subnets.  3.2.2 Orchestration and management  The MANO layer is considered as the brains of all operations for the creation, configuration,  provision and monitoring of network services and their related components. In contrast, it can  be seen as a single point of failure and an attractive target for attack, as any compromised  operations may lead to the failure of an entire system.  The main function of MANO is to control the connectivity between VNFs, create the  relationships between VNFs and virtual infrastructure resources, maintain a sequence of  network forwarding paths, and address all the service chaining processes. However, a lack of  consistency on how to manage and orchestrate the network services can incur security  challenges. Table 9 illustrates the main security challenges raised by the orchestration and  management of the 5G NFV.  Table 9: Main security challenges facing 'orchestration and management’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- OM1  MANO single point of  failure  MANO is the control node of an NFV. It controls all VNFs and indirectly (via the virtualisation layer) it  can access all data within those VNFs. Compromising MANO would effectively compromise all VNFs.  MANO are responsible for on-boarding, instantiation, termination and lifecycle management of all VNF  within a virtualised network. Combined with 3GPP layer OSS/BSS functions they control all VNFs and  indirectly (via the virtualisation layer) can access all data within those VNFs, unless specially  protected. Compromising MANO would effectively compromise all VNFs (to a much lesser extent the  same applies to the OSS/BSS). Therefore, for VNFs to be secure, NFs need to have minimum  security guarantees from MANO and be designed to be resistant to compromise of the underlying  MANO system.  Communications with and within NFV MANO: attackers may try to eavesdrop or modify the traffic that  transits between the NFVI and the NFV MANO, as well as traffic within the NFV MANO.  NFVO and/or VNFM: attackers may attempt to exploit these two components to disrupt the lifecycle  management of the network services (purpose of the orchestrator) or of individual VNFs (main role of  the VNFM).  In case of a DoS attack or a failure, the NFVO may be reliant on other elements (e.g. SDN controller  or VIM) under its configuration control to enable them to boot, reallocate resources and reload their  configuration. There is a risk that, should a major event occur, parts of the NFV infrastructure may  remain out of service causing major service issues.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  46  ID Challenge title Challenge description  In addition, any change, termination, or re-instantiation of security critical NFV elements, by the NFVO  and VNFM, where the critical data is overwritten, may compromise the integrity of the network; for  example, deletion of customer specific profiles, LEA target information or AuC keys.  The VIM is responsible for the management of the NFVI resources used by the VNFs (compute,  network and storage) and attacking it could, for example, allow denial of service (DoS) or data theft,  bypassing the isolation of the hypervisor or CIS.  CH- OM2  Orchestration  compromise and policy  violations  There are risks that:  • new, or changes to existing, MANO descriptor files 43 44 (e.g. network service templates, VNF  forwarding graph descriptor, VNF descriptor) could be made without applying the correct security  and affinity/anti-affinity policy rules45 between VMs or containers leading to local legal and  regulatory issues, increased risks of fraud and SDN and NFV elements exposed to additional  security vulnerabilities;  • an existing virtualised element (e.g. VNF, SDN Controller) managed by the NFVO may be  removed while there is still an existing operational service dependency from another network  element or system, causing a service outage and loss of availability.  If the NFVO user interface allows for the editing, importing or generation of such provisioning or  instantiation of script files (yml or other) that are used to manage VNFs (e.g. initiation and termination,  description of internal and external connectivity, dependencies between VNFCs), several attack  vectors may be exploited by an attacker.  CH- OM3  Resource integrity  caused by manual  changes or failure to  update resource  inventory  There could be a loss of integrity on the orchestration resource inventory with the SDN controllers,  VNFM service configuration caused by direct manual configuration at the SDN/NFV layer.  During the service management processes, commands may be correctly initiated from the NFVO to  the SDN controller and/or VIM, VNFM; however, the success or failure of these commands may not  be reflected in the service and resource inventories which could cause issues for data integrity.  CH- OM4  Vulnerabilities within  orchestration protocols  The protocols used by the NFVO to communicate with the components needed to manage the  virtualised environment may be vulnerable and attacks could be realised in several ways:  • Spoofing of the NFVO’s service requests may result in an attacker being able to generate  service requests to cause a DoS by:  o provisioning new instances in order to delete the number of resources available to the  NFV or SDN components;  o retiring NFV instances or SDN elements that are in use by the operational network;  o changing the SDN configuration.  This risk could impact a single element or the whole mobile network.  • Spoofing as an SDN controller, VIM or VNFM to send service management requests to the  NFVO on the resource performance could cause the NFVO to initiate changes on the  infrastructure. This exploit could be used by an attacker who wants to force the NFVO to move a  NFV component to another datacentre where the attacker may have physical access or has  compromised the virtualisation layer and wants to monitor customer traffic.  3.2.3 Administration and access control  Much of the openness and programmability offered by the 5G NFV network architecture relies  on the expanded use of APIs. The exploitation can target different types of API namely internal  network functions, internetworking interfaces, roaming interfaces, etc. exposed in different  layers of the network. A poorly designed or configured API with inaccurate access control rules  may expose network functions and sensitive parameters. Table 10 illustrates the main security  challenges raised by the administration of and access control to the 5G NFV.  Table 10: Main security challenges facing ‘administration and access control’  43 https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20014v3.3.1%20-%20GS%20- %20Network%20Service%20Templates%20Spec.pdf  44 https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/88/materials/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf  45 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-ifa/001_099/011/02.03.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa011v020301p.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20014v3.3.1%20-%20GS%20-%20Network%20Service%20Templates%20Spec.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20014v3.3.1%20-%20GS%20-%20Network%20Service%20Templates%20Spec.pdf https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/88/materials/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-ifa/001_099/011/02.03.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa011v020301p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  47  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH-AC1 Malicious insiders  Whoever commits a malicious action is not necessarily an outsider to the virtualised system.  Accidentally or intentionally, even an insider, such as a system administrator (e.g. hypervisor or CIS  administrator), could behave incorrectly.  Administration roles can be used to manage the NFV environment. This environment can be used by  the hypervisor or CIS administrator to eavesdrop or modify sensitive data running on a VM or  container or transferring between NFV components.  Moreover, this administrator may be able to change or stop processes running in the VM or container,  give other applications access to the VM or container or steal critical security data.  CH-AC2 Single administrator  domain  NFV deployments usually rely on a single administration domain, with a global administrator who is  able to manage the hosts and NFV environment. As such, at some level, all VNFs regardless of their  sensitivity are potentially reduced to the same security level of the single administration domain.  Therefore, if an attacker is able to gain global administrator privileges, they will be able to control and  manage all network functions, regardless of their sensitivity and trust domain.  CH-AC3  Lack of staff with  the skillsets needed  to operate  virtualised networks  The virtualisation of network functions introduces a new risk because virtualisation is still a  comparatively new architecture and carriers may still be unfamiliar with the risks inherent in networks  that are more defined by software than hardware. A lack of staff with the skillsets needed to operate  virtualised networks may represent the greatest threat in telecommunication networks utilising this  new architecture.  CH-AC4  Insecure  management,  configuration, and  monitoring  interfaces  The interconnectivity among the virtualised end‐to‐end architectural components exposes new  interfaces that, unless protected, can create new security threats. Through management interfaces  users can access and interact with services offered by NFV. A management interface is easily  hackable if it is not adequately protected because it is exposed to any external entity, which could  abuse the privileges granted to it.  APIs play an integral part during provisioning, management, orchestration and monitoring of the  services running in the NFV framework, which makes them a perfect target for attackers. API abuse is  the most-frequent attack vector. An attacker may try to exploit insecure APIs in order to access or  tamper with NFV’s services and/or databases. APIs-based attacks can lead to data loss or leakage,  identity theft, system compromise, as well as service unavailability. Potential API-based attacks  against NFV framework include parameter attacks, identity attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and  (distributed) denial of service attacks.  CH-AC5  Compromise of  orchestration  access control  One of the core features of NFV is management and orchestration which is, in essence, the ability to  dynamically scale network capacity up or down and continuously adapt to shifting requirements. This  may be realised through automated provisioning of network elements and or services. The  provisioning framework itself provides several attack vectors that may be exploited by an attacker.  These two features are highly centralised, which means the safe and stable operation of the entire  system will be jeopardised if the functions fail or are illegally controlled.  A poor authentication mechanism, weak access control and feeble authorisation rules may allow the  attacker to impersonate or appear as a legitimate authenticated and authorised user. The attacker  could then compromise the network and the NFV elements to influence their performance, behaviour  and services.  CH-AC6  Weak or insecure  authentication or  access control  authorisation to VIM  Attackers may be able to connect to VIM and break the administration password allowing them access  into VIM management features, which would allow them to modify the existing configuration causing a  DoS attack or to install unauthorised applications to facilitate fraud or eavesdropping.  VIM may accept all commands sent from the NFVO. Received Commands may cause changes to the  virtual environment that have a major service impact or cause a DoS.  Poor segregation between vendors within a VIM may allow a vendor access to the NFV configuration  of other vendors. The unauthorised access could cause knowingly or accidentally a DoS attack on a  competitor’s NFV by removing their VM or container resources.  3.2.4 New and legacy technologies  In the current NFV deployment, operators are incorporating NFV components into legacy  devices. In this hybrid architecture, the complete network management system is be divided into  two parts. The first part is a sub-system managing VNFs. The second part is the legacy OSS.  In order to avoid having to reconstruct the existing sub-system, the legacy OSS will stay  unchanged and will continue to manage existing PNFs. An interface between legacy OSS and  the virtualised environment is not precluded and could be a proprietary interface, based on the  operators’ requirements.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  48  Given that legacy or physical network function or devices will continue to be used for the  foreseeable future, operators will have to manage hybrid (part physical, part virtualised)  networks. Hence, existing OSS will need to be extended (in some way) to work together with the  new management and orchestration systems that support NFV.  There are also security challenges that should be considered for LI. The security challenges  raised by these hybrid physical and virtual network environments should be considered when  deploying the 5G telco management and orchestration architecture. Table 11 illustrates the  main security challenges raised by the mix of new and legacy technologies within a 5G NFV.  Table 11: Main security challenges facing ‘new and legacy technologies’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- LG1  Mixed virtual  and legacy PNF  deployments  Most virtualised deployments will commence with adding VNFs to an existing PNF based network. Over time  the number of VNFs will increase but mixed network deployments will be the default for the next 10+ years.  Similarly, mixed SDN and non-SDN linked NFs will also co-exist. By default, PNFs and VNFs have to be able  to implicitly trust each other in mixed deployments, given that 3GPP SA3 currently does not specify different  handling or trust relationships based on PNF or VNF implementation.  In mixed deployments, especially where older 3G CS NFs share common NFs (e.g. virtualised HSS, UDM)  with 4G or 5G higher security level VNFs, additional 3GPP security mechanisms may be required to prevent  attackers using insecure interfaces as the injection points against the otherwise secure VNFs (i.e. VNF  implicitly accepts messages from legacy PNF with lower security). However, the reverse attack also exists  where an attacker uses the much larger attack surface offered by VNFs to attack PNFs. VNFs would ignore  the messages but may well forward them to the less secure PNFs.  Attacks are also possible depending on the chain of VNF and PNFs, where an attacker injects messages  towards a VNF, which is forwarded to a PNF and finally to another VNF. While the first VNF and PNF are  unharmed by the attack, the second VNF falls foul of the implicit trust of PNF and VNF communications. It is  possible to conceive other similar chained attack scenarios where PNFs and VNFs exist together without  knowledge of each other’s implementation or trust domain segregation.  CH- LG2  Vulnerabilities of  physical hosts  X86 and similar server architectures have a number of physical security weaknesses from the perspective of a  critical national infrastructure. Plug and play interfaces (e.g. USB and removal RAID discs) unless disabled or  tightly controlled represent a risk to 3GPP NF security. However, more difficult to control attack vectors such  as PCI Express bus direct memory access (DMA) or use of OS swap or page files represent risks if physical  access to the server(s) hosting a 3GPP NF becomes possible. Similarly, most server firmware would detect  hardware changes (e.g. adding an extra copy of a physical network port which is visible to the host firmware),  but if the replacement hardware uses the same IDs and declared interfaces, this is much more difficult to  detect.  In legacy PNF implementations, such risks are better understood with physical constraints including secured  racks, physical testing of interfaces to confirm they are disabled and careful placement of more sensitive  functions (e.g. AUC) within CSP datacentres. However, for virtualised implements using large pools of  common hosts, physically securing all hosts (rather than those dedicated to a specific function) so that any  3GPP function can run on any host, while controlling physical access attacks is difficult to achieve. This threat  potentially increases with IAAS and NAAS deployments.  Furthermore, many datacentre hosts are equipped with baseband management controllers and intelligent  management interface protocol. If an attacker is able to access these controllers, they effectively have direct  control over all hosts and all VNFs running on them. Over recent years a number of such vulnerabilities have  occurred. For sensitive functions such as the AUC or LI functions, the risks would obviously be increased.  Almost all virtualised environments (e.g. NFV servers) rely on x86/64 architecture and common off-the-shelf  server hardware. Microprocessor side-channel security vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715,  CVE-2017-5754 (aka Spectre and Meltdown) can make NFV infrastructure a very valuable asset for attackers.  These vulnerabilities may lead to information disclosure and elevation of privilege. Mitigation and resolution of  these vulnerabilities are difficult and may call for both software (OS) and hardware (microcode) updates.  CH- LG3  Transformation  of legacy  OSS/BSS  Today’s OSS/BSS architectures are built on a solid but aging foundation, developed over several decades, for  telecom services that were relatively static and predictable. OSS/BSS systems are undergoing significant  changes in order to benefit from, and keep up with, the pace of innovation ushered in by SDN and NFV.  Operators seeking to take advantage of SDN and NFV to optimise their networks and improve agility can only  do so when a new generation of OSS/BSS processes is enhanced to cope with this new virtualised and cloud- based world. Migration will take time, as operators must adapt and upgrade complex and proprietary legacy  systems46.  46 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  49  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- LG4  Integration with  existing legacy  OSS/BSS  Most core legacy systems cannot support end-to-end functionality. It’s difficult for operators to deliver and  charge for low latency and high reliability, as well as assure it and provide an appropriate SLA because the  required billing integration may not be in place. Instead, they continue to use standalone solutions because of  the integration costs involved47.  The NFV infrastructure must dynamically reallocate its resources between different virtual network functions to  meet variations in traffic composition. Current OSS/BSS systems cannot support this level of real-time  dynamics and policy driven real-time service variation48.  SDN and NFV are poised to reduce the cost of capacity and in turn improve service density. The knock-on  effect will be an increase in service management overhead, which will create a greater workload for OSS/BSS.  OSS and BSS systems will need to adapt to avoid becoming a bottleneck. For instance, billing systems will  need to support more billing events as service instances grow significantly. The traffic of multiple customers  traffic must be aggregated efficiently, with unique subscriber profiles, many application types and distinct  policies49.  3.2.5 Adoption of open source or COTS  Use of open source within 5G NFV will continue to increase as vendors rely on open source  software to speed the delivery of new solutions. Open source software can be viewed as being  analogous to corporations outsourcing functions not related to their core competencies. This  introduces a new set of security challenges in terms of keeping a consistent and coherent  assurance of security-by-design, and the prevention of resulting security flaws. To compound  this issue, asking vendors to disclose the open source components used in their products may  disclose more vulnerabilities and add to the risk.  Another security challenge is that NFs based on NFV technologies can now run on lower cost,  commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, eliminating the need for more expensive, purpose- built hardware. When using COTS for the NFVI, security and performance may be impacted,  and security measures must be implemented to reduce the related risks. Table 12 illustrates the  main security challenges raised by the adoption of open source or COTS within the 5G NFV.  Table 12: Main security challenges facing ‘adoption of open source or COTS’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- OC1  Adoption of open  source software  Many 5G vendors and operators rely on open-source software to accelerate delivery of digital innovation.  Both traditional and agile development processes frequently incorporate the use of prebuilt, reusable open- source software components. As a result, some organisations may not have accurate inventories of open- source software dependencies used by their different applications, or a process to receive and manage  notifications concerning discovered vulnerabilities or available patches from the community supporting the  open-source.  Open-source software provides attackers with a target-rich environment because of its widespread use (e.g.  GitHub security breaches50 51). Open-source software is incorporated into applications in many ways, and  often 5G operators or vendors will not know where open-source is used. When open-source is used as the  foundation for a vendor’s product, any vulnerabilities could threaten the integrity of the vendor’s solution.  Asking vendors to disclose the open-source components used in their products may disclose more  vulnerabilities and add to the risk.  In 2020 we saw the Boot Hole vulnerability for GRUB2 bootloader (CVE-2020-10713), seven other GRUB2  vulnerabilities, and the critical HAProxy vulnerability with malformed HTTP/2 requests (CVE-2020-11100).  Since June 2017, the Linux kernel has had 12 CVEs with a CVSS score of 10.0 (critical). Prevasio’s recently  completed Operation Red Kangaroo scanned the entire Docker Hub and found 51 percent of all containers  had ‘critical’ vulnerabilities. As new open-source software vulnerabilities continue to be introduced into  47 https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-communications/post/without-modern-ossbss-5g-network-investments-may-be-throwing- good-money-after-bad  48 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  49 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  50 https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/how-secure-git  51 Hackers target GitHub (and other popular Git hosting tools) for many reasons. But the biggest is the potential they see in  hacking into repositories on GitHub and stealing (and potentially selling) intellectual property. Hardworking developers from  companies all over the world use GitHub for personal and business needs, often on an ad hoc basis. And developers in the  heat of battle can often overlook security concerns. Hackers know this — and exploit it.  https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-communications/post/without-modern-ossbss-5g-network-investments-may-be-throwing-good-money-after-bad https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-communications/post/without-modern-ossbss-5g-network-investments-may-be-throwing-good-money-after-bad https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  50  development projects, it has become clear that software vendors and operators need to implement secure  software development best practices and cannot rely exclusively upon the open-source community to build  secure software52.  CH- OC2  Adoption of  COTS hardware  Generally, hardware design and manufacturing occur prior to software development, so it is extremely  important to address hardware security in product lifecycles, because once attackers compromise hardware  modules, software security mechanisms running on these devices will be compromised as well. For  example, manufacturing backdoors eavesdropping, inducing faults, and hardware modification tampering  through jailbroken software.  Almost all virtualised environments rely on x86/64 architecture and common off-the-shelf (COTS) server  hardware. This makes telecom virtual appliances (NFV firmware) a very valuable asset for security  researchers and attackers alike.  An attacker with physical access to the hardware resources may be able to tamper with or remove the TPM,  disabling the trusted computing platform function and facilitating other attacks; for example, allowing an  untrusted host OS, hypervisor or CIS to be installed.  3.2.6 Supply chain  The 5G NFV supply chain is similarly susceptible to the introduction of risks such as malicious  software and hardware, counterfeit components, poor designs, manufacturing processes, and  maintenance procedures. The exposure to these risks is heightened by the broad appeal of 5G  technologies and the resulting rush to deployment. This may result in negative consequences,  such as data and intellectual property theft, loss of confidence in the integrity of the 5G network,  or exploitation to cause system and network failure. Table 13 illustrates the main security  challenges facing the supply chain of the 5G NFV.  Table 13: Main security challenges facing ‘the supply chain’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- SC1  Separation of test  and production  environments  A significant risk is formed if the separation between test and production environment is neglected. The  reason is that the security configurations of the two different environments may vary. In addition, the test  configurations are updated more frequently. Moreover, the test environment is also more likely to support  remote vendor access.  CH- SC2 Untrusted partners  Carriers and equipment vendors may use components within the NFV manufactured by untrusted  companies, likely, in part, because of their relatively low costs or the components may already exist as part  of the current LTE infrastructure. The use of components manufactured by untrusted companies could  expose entities to risks introduced by malicious software and hardware, counterfeit components, and  component flaws caused by poor manufacturing processes and maintenance procedures.  CH- SC3  Infected/untested/ unauthorized  patches or  upgrades  When updates are available, they are likely to be retrieved from a centralised server and then applied by a  script or automated update process. If such a server or the applied script has been compromised, spoofed or  subject to some type of malfunction there is a risk that updates have been compromised or damaged.  Deploying untested or unvalidated NFV components on the NFV network poses a significant risk. This risk  may result in anything ranging from minor inconveniences such as missing functionality to more dangerous  issues such as signalling loops or, in the worst case, complete network failure.  CH- SC4  Test isolation and  assurance  In legacy hardware deployments, 3GPP, GSMA or other testing schemes generally involve testing 3GPP  functions as opaque boxes or pentesting them in isolation from other network functions. While it is possible  to test virtual functions in this way, the level of assurance gained is different. Such stand-alone testing relies  on the underlying virtualisation and hardware layers being 100% secure and that no future vulnerabilities are  found in those underlying components.  Testing functions in isolation does not guarantee that when a VNF is instantiated on a different host  virtualisation environment or is instantiated in a larger virtualisation environment containing multiple VNFs  that a 3GPP function tested in isolation remains secure.  Isolation in testing refers to VNF to VNF isolation as well as platform to VNF isolation. In general, it means  that the VNF is firstly tested on its own in a dedicated NFVI and then tested with other VNFs in a shared  NFVI.  CH- SC5  Use of counterfeit  components  Counterfeit NFV components are more susceptible to cyber-attack and are more likely to break because of  their poor quality. Compromised counterfeit components could enable a malicious actor to impact the  confidentiality, integrity or availability of data that travels through NFV and to move laterally to other more  sensitive parts of the 5G network. Counterfeit components are inserted at the component manufacturing or  52 https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/1/open-source-security-software  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  51  distribution stage in the supply chain in order to impact components delivered to a subset (potentially a  targeted subset) of downstream customers. Counterfeit parts look like regular parts and are a form of fraud.  Scenario: a malicious actor identifies a government contractor that provides NFV components and attempts  to sell modified or counterfeit products to them at discounted prices. While the contractor is legitimate and  has the most to lose from counterfeit products, they are unaware that there is a potential problem and do not  conduct an initial analysis of possible counterfeiting risks that exist within its industry. To save money, the  contractor purchases the counterfeit components from the malicious actor and inserts them into their  product. The counterfeit part has gone undetected in usability and functional testing and is placed into  production. The resulting effect on the overall 5G system can take a variety of forms, such as impacting  system performance, the availability of critical services, or loss of data.  CH- SC6  Use of inherited  components  Inherited NFV components may come from extended supply chains consisting of third-party suppliers,  vendors, and service providers. Supply chains may be compromised via attacks on suppliers, including  suppliers of suppliers, who may have weaker security controls and audits on their development, production,  or delivery channels. Flaws or malicious code inserted early in the development phases are more difficult to  detect and could lead to the developer marking the component as legitimate through digital signatures or  other approvals. Malicious actors could then later exploit these vulnerabilities.  The malicious code may be introduced to the component in several different ways, such as via compromise  of the source code repository, theft of signing keys, or penetration of distribution sites and channels. As a  part of an authorised and normal distribution channel, operators unknowingly acquire and deploy these  compromised components on their 5G systems and networks. Advanced malicious code typically does not  disrupt normal operations and may not activate for several days or weeks, thereby remaining hidden from  typical application and software testing practices.  Scenario: a telecommunications company buys core network systems management software from a trusted  provider. However, unbeknownst to the trusted provider, one of the components it uses in the product has  been compromised and now contains malicious code. This is a threat that results from inheriting risk  decisions made by a supplier within the supply chain. The deeper into the supply chain it occurs, the more  difficult it is to identify in advance. This inserted vulnerability may be used by the malicious actor as a part of  a larger attack chain that uses the malicious code to gain access within the core network of the telecom and  then pivot towards other attack vectors.  3.2.7 Lawful interception (LI)  Securing and hiding LI functionality from other functions in an NFV environment is by far the  largest security challenge. Placing LI functions within the VNF environment exposes them to a  variety of security and visibility risks. Placing them outside of the NFV environment comes with  a different set of visibility risks, places significant constraints on VNF mobility, makes LI fragile  to dynamic changes in the NFV environment and will only be possible in scenarios where the  mandatory intra-VNF and inter-VNF encryption has been disabled. Disabling intra or inter VNF  encryption will expose the NFV platform to considerable cyber risks and is therefore unlikely to  be acceptable.  Specific consideration of LI security challenges in hybrid part legacy scenarios must be  considered. In real deployments, legacy nodes and VNF need to co-exist and be interconnected  with implicit trust. This implicit trust is required as VNFs are not supposed to know they have  been virtualised. This therefore means that the VNFs are connected to management and  service control plane links which include legacy nodes that do not implement the same level of  security as the VNF. Table 14 illustrates the main security challenges for Lawful Interception  (LI).  Table 14: Main security challenges facing ‘lawful interception (LI)’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- LI1  Encryption of  communications53  5G offers very high security standards. Although end-to-end encryption is not yet set out as mandatory in the  5G standards, it cannot be ruled out that it will be included in the standardisation process. End-to-end  encryption would make it impossible to access content in electronic communications, even through lawful  interception. In addition, encryption of an IMSI number (it is the individual number of the mobile phone card)  would make it impossible for law enforcement and judicial authorities to identify the mobile devices or location  of criminals or persons who pose a serious threat, as well as potential victims or persons facing a threat.  Without access to the IMSI number, certain lawful interceptions are not possible. Therefore, metadata  normally available via interception (such as location, date, time, call duration, calling and contacted party)  53 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8983-2019-INIT/en/pdf  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8983-2019-INIT/en/pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  52  would be lost to law enforcement and judicial authorities. In addition, 5G will have strict authentication  processes (in order to identify a user before access is granted) such as false-base detection that will make it  harder for law enforcement to investigate via lawful interception without being detected. (IMSI catchers which  are necessary for interception of mobile devices and location of suspects or victims would be detected.)  CH- LI2  Cooperation of  numerous  network providers  Up to now, when carrying out a lawful interception, the authorities deal with a limited number of network  providers. With 5G network slicing technology54, network and service providers may not – unless they are  obliged to do so – have a complete copy of the information available, which would make lawful interception  impossible.  5G architecture means that in order to monitor communications, one could require the cooperation of  numerous network providers both at home and abroad, under different jurisdictions. While law enforcement  authorities currently make requests to a single network provider operating from national territory, in the future  with 5G, they may have to deal with multiple service and network providers, including from abroad. The cross- border dimension of 5G technology may increase the need for international cooperation, which may increase  the time between request and implementation of the interception, with a non-negligible risk of losing a  complete copy of the technical information.  CH- LI3  Availability of  data at the LI  central nodes  In order to improve timely response, MEC will allow mobile phone networks to store and process contents in  decentralised clouds in the vicinity of network users which can directly communicate with each other.  Information will not necessarily be directed via central nodes, where lawful interception is currently  implemented. Therefore, data may not always be available anymore. As network functions and components  which used to exist physically become virtual or may be moved abroad, existing measures to  ensure  confidentiality of interception (protection against access to or even altering target lists by having specifically  vetted staff to carry out the measures on the national territory and physical protection measures such as  access restrictions) will no longer work.  CH- LI4  LI in hybrid  deployment  In real deployments, LI legacy nodes and NFV need to co-exist and be interconnected with implicit trust. This  therefore means that the NFV are connected to management and service control plane links which include LI  legacy nodes that do not implement the same level of security as the NFV.  There are two logical attack models which should be considered for LI:  • Virtualised node compromise using a legacy LI node;  • Legacy node compromise using the VNFs or host OS, hypervisor or CIS or associated signalling within  the NFV domain.  3.3 NFV VULNERABILITIES  Based on and inspired by the ENISA 5G threat landscape55, the list of potential vulnerabilities  related to the 5G NFV challenges are classified into the following categories. In addition to  virtualisation vulnerabilities, the potential vulnerabilities due to legacy systems are considered in  this analysis.  • service-based vulnerabilities of NFV components;  • improper protection of data and information of NFV components;  • improper hardening of NFV components;  • virtualisation layer vulnerabilities;  • vulnerable mechanisms for authentication and authorisation of NFV components;  • insufficient or improper monitoring mechanisms of NFV;  • vulnerabilities due to legacy OSS/BSS systems;  • improper protection of service based interfaces;  • vulnerabilities of 5G NFs;  • vulnerabilities in operating systems supporting 5G NFs;  • improper hardening of 5G core components;  • vulnerabilities of SDN;  • vulnerabilities of MEC;  54 Several network and service providers may be able to operate on the same physical infrastructure. For example, one  company will provide enhanced mobile broadband, cellular phones for example, another one will provide massive machine  type communications and a third one will provide low latency communications. Each service provider will use a customised  virtualisation layer of the same physical infrastructure, with different technical specifications. Relevant telecommunication  monitoring information may therefore not be available in every network slice.  55 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  53  Annex C provides a description of the different 5G NFV vulnerabilities with their associated  assets belonging to the above categories that can be exploited to perform attacks impacting the  confidentiality, integrity and availability of the 5G NFV system.  3.4 NFV ATTACK SCENARIOS  Attacks are defined by the ways an attacker can compromise system vulnerabilities or  weaknesses, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a NFV system.  There are many variants of attacks on 5G NFV and they can be organised according to the  following two factors (the attack taxonomy is provided and detailed in Annex D):  1. Attack sources belong to three categories:   attacks from within a NFV (internal weakness),   attacks from outside a NFV (external threat),   attacks occurring between NFV components (migration of an attack).  2. Impact is organised into three categories:   Denial of Service: attacks that cause service outages. Examples include  hardware vandalism, radio signal jamming, and traffic flooding.   Access Breach: attacks that lead to unauthorised system access, manipulation,  or a data breach. Examples include malicious changes to system configurations,  exploiting software vulnerabilities, communications hijacking and disclosure of  sensitive data.   Integrity Compromise: attacks that impact the integrity of infrastructure through  hardware, software, communications or operational tampering. Examples include  implanting malicious hardware components in system devices, altering operating  system code, modifying data, and circumventing organisational security policies.  Figure 15 shows the three attack sources categories with their associated attacks and Table 15  shows the impact of each attack.

A list of security measures and best practices has been established by analysing relevant  documents and standards identified during desktop research. This analysis allowed the  identification of frequently mentioned topics regarding NFV security and their classifications into  different security domains. The resulting list is grouped into three main categories, namely  policies, organisational and technical practices (see Figure 16). The full register of best  practices with references are provided in Annex E.  The mapping between categories of challenges, vulnerabilities, attacks, affected assets and  best practices is provided in section 4.4.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  56  Figure 16: List of best practices  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  57  4.1.1 Technical  In this section, we shed light on technical best security practices that should be followed in order  to achieve better security protection in a 5G NFV environment against the challenges identified  above. Table 16 highlights thirty-five technical measures and best practices. They are detailed  in Annex E.  Table 16: Technical best practices  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T1 Security monitoring  and filtering  This covers the use of virtual network security appliances such as anti-virus, virtual firewalls or virtual  IDS/IPS to achieve a level of security comparable to traditional networks. Further, machine learning  (ML) assisted solutions can be used to detect attack traffic (e.g. DoS attacks) and distinguish it from  normal traffic, so that it can be handled appropriately.  BP-T2  VNF image  validation and  protection  A mechanism should be provided to verify all VNF before they are installed on the orchestration  platform or other vendor specific deployment platform.  BP-T3 Tracking VNF  version changes  The orchestration and VNF management systems should have the ability to keep track of multiple  versions, multiple environments, multiple instances and allow the service provider’s team to perform  updates or upgrades with clear expectations of service continuity based on metadata information  including component dependencies.  BP-T4 VNF deployment  New VNF components must only be deployed into a production network where security policies have  been tested and applied, and where appropriate hardening measures have been taken to ensure that  unused ports, unrequired services, and insecure protocols have been disabled.  BP-T5 VNF deletion or  relocation  The orchestration platform should manage VNF deletion or relocation in a secure way. Security  mechanisms such us secure backup, storage, destruction, and isolation of sensitive data must be  applied.  BP-T6 Cryptography  Well-known, standardised and secure cryptographic schemes and protocols (e.g. NIST56, ANSSI57,  BSI58) shall be used for the cryptographic operations and the key management process. Proprietary  schemes and protocols must be avoided.  BP-T7 Hypervisor protection  The hypervisor shall enforce the network security policies regarding the isolation between VNFs,  memory access control, protection of sensitive data, etc. The hypervisor enables virtualisation  between underlying hardware and VMs. Security of the hypervisor is a must in order to protect the  whole virtualisation infrastructure.  One of the best security practices is to keep the hypervisor up to date by regularly applying security  patches as they are released. Failure to do so would result in exposure to security risks. Another best  practice is to disable all services that are not in use. For example, remote access services may not be  needed all the time and therefore it would be a good idea to enable these services only when they are  required. Administrators are the gatekeepers of the whole infrastructure and their accounts are the  keys. It should be mandated that admin accounts should be secured through the application of a  strong password policy along with strict adherence to an organisation’s security guidelines.  BP-T8  Security  management and  orchestration  NFV management and orchestration operations must be made secure, especially the lifecycle  management of VNF workloads.  BP-T9 Remote attestation  Today's deployed NFV systems face a huge number of threats that have the capability to compromise  them partly or fully. In many cases this involves an attacker modifying a system in such a way that  malicious software is executed. Execution of code that was not intended to be executed on the system  is expected to be detectable. One defensive measure that addresses the execution of malicious  software is remote attestation (RA) as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 01859. The remote attestation  technique should be used to remotely verify the trust status of a NFV platform.  BP-T10  Software compliance  and integrity  preservation  Mechanisms for checking integrity must be used to verify software, firmware, and information integrity  within the NFV.  56 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines  57 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/reglementation/confiance-numerique/liste-des-documents-constitutifs-du-rgs-v-2-0/  58 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html  59 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/reglementation/confiance-numerique/liste-des-documents-constitutifs-du-rgs-v-2-0/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  58  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T11  Security  segmentation and  isolation between  network functions  The security zoning concept (or segmentation) should be used to divide 5G networks horizontally and  vertically into portions in which different security controls can be applied. Security zoning enables the  application-specific customisation of security services. A zone could, for instance, provide its own AAA  (Authentication, Authorisation, Accountability) and security monitoring functionalities. Consequently,  different segments have different security or trust levels, i.e. can be trusted to address different  security risks.  BP-T12 Secure boot integrity  The NFV platform shall support a secure boot from hardware to VNFs to prevent tampering during the  system boot and integrity check on the sensitive NFV software files and running code to prevent  tampering at runtime, enhancing the protection of system integrity.  BP-T13 Data protection and  privacy  To prevent disclosure of user data (e.g. subscriber identifiers), 5G networks should use security  mechanisms such as the encryption cryptographic operation. It is important to pay attention to the  requirements of lawful interception60. Privacy and security, both of individuals’ personal data and of  critical infrastructure, are important preconditions for GDPR. Encryption is a crucial tool to achieve  these goals. Any approach to weaken or grant backdoor access to encryption methods defeats the  entire purpose of encryption and undermines users’ trust, exposing 5G systems to increased risks. At  the same time, it remains vitally important that companies and law enforcement authorities continue to  work together, ensuring that authorities have the best methods and access to electronic evidence  without weakening or putting strong encryption at risk.  BP-T14 Encrypting VNF  volume/swap areas  Virtual volume disks associated with VNFs may contain sensitive data. Therefore, they need to be  protected.  BP-T15 Trusted computing  technologies  NFV requires trusted computing technologies for ensuring secure root of trust, remote attestation61,  integrity monitoring, and secure storage. Such trusted computing technologies include Intel TXT,  SGX, AMD SEV or ARM Trustzone silicon-based security functionality implemented with a TPM that  stores measurements of the entire hypervisor stack and boot process.  BP-T16 Hardware security  Dedicated hardware should be used to ensure strong isolation (e.g. physical separation) between  tenants. In addition, hardware security devices should be used to ensure a secure boot, integrity  check, secure storage and trusted execution environment.  BP-T17 Centralised log  auditing  All the NFV, SDN and MANO elements should submit information on security events to a centralised  platform, which shall monitor and analyse the logs in real time for possible attempts at intrusion.  BP-T18  Use and ownership  of ‘root’  administration  credentials  NFV components should be configured to support multiple administration roles. As a minimum there  shall be an admin role (highest privilege) and a separate operational role with minimal privileges to  complete normal operational support.  BP-T19 VNF protection VNF data protection shall be enforced at rest and in transit.  BP-T20  Local or removal  blade storage – SAN  protection  If local, non-volatile, fixed or removable storage is used to support a VNF then it should not store  sensitive data. SAN should be protected by a mutual authentication process, hard zoning, data  protection at rest and in transit, etc.  BP-T21 Network security  • All internal interfaces between VNF elements, supporting MANO platforms and IT elements  (mediation, provisioning) that are not required to communicate publicly outside the  operators network, should use private IP addresses.  • Each VM or container supporting VNFs should have a predefined network security profile.  • Separate physical interfaces should be implemented for traffic segregation.  • All connectivity between internal NFV components and the external world should pass  through a firewall (or vFirewall).  • Communication should be monitored, and security events should be recorded in audit logs.  • Rules governing segmentation and zoning security should be followed with the use of  firewalls, IDS/IPS or other controls.  • VPNs should be created between VNFs and both internal and external non-VNF  environments.  • Patch management is important to fix vulnerabilities on network security devices (e.g.  firewall, VPN, IDS/IPS) to keep them up-to-date and running smoothly.  • The management of all operational traffic and interfaces should be protected by integrity  mechanisms and encryption. Unprotected sessions should not be accepted.  60 https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DIGITALEUROPE-Position-on-Encryption-Policy-.pdf  61 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DIGITALEUROPE-Position-on-Encryption-Policy-.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  59  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T22 SDN security  management  Communication between SDN elements should support a strong identity framework to uniquely  identify all components and users of a SDN system and verify identities with a trusted source. Without  a strong identity framework, the ability to build effective authentication, authorisation and accounting  implementations will be limited.  A strong identity should have the following properties:  • ability to distinguish its owner from other entities within a pre-defined scope,  • ability to be generated, updated and revoked,  • prevention of impersonation, preferably through strong cryptographic mechanisms.  Analysis of the SDN architecture identifies numerous means for elements inside the system’s trust  boundary to compromise the availability of the logically centralised control. Strong authentication  based on assured identity and access control mechanisms with various privilege levels should be  employed to authorise external parties and authenticate their access to the system, e.g. role-based  access control.  BP-T23  MANO access  control and  management  The common aspects for RESTful NFV MANO APIs have been defined in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 01362.  NFV MANO APIs, applications and their supporting platforms (OS, Database) should have  comprehensive user access controls and privileged access management. NFV-MANO APIs shall only  allow themselves to be accessed by authorised users. One solution for authorising access is the use  of OAuth2.0 with access token as described in ETSI GS NFV-SEC 02263.  BP-T24 VIM connectivity to  virtualisation layer  The connectivity between the VIM and the virtualisation layer should support a secure access  protocol.  BP-T25 Recovery and  reinstallation  A fast recovery and reinstallation process shall be in place to ensure high availability of the sensitive  NFV components and resources. The recovery process should be clearly documented, reviewed at  regular intervals for updates and made available to all the staff concerned.  BP-T26  Deploying  VMs/Containers of  differing trust levels  The VIM should be configured to ensure that VMs or containers of differing trust levels are not  deployed on the same physical host.  BP-T27  Orchestration  platform Security  Management  The orchestration platform sits over the NFV environment and allows the management and  deployment of VNFs across the whole NFV environment. Security controls should be implemented to  protect this critical platform such as strong authentication, access control rules, information flow  controls, audit logs, etc. The orchestration platform should support security monitoring and patch  management processes to provide continuous security updates.  BP-T28 Trusted time source The system should provide a protected and trusted network time source to the NFV components such  as GPS or an atomic clock64.  BP-T29  Secure 3rd party  hosting  environments  Sensitive information of VNFs shall be confidentially protected by operators when using a 3rd party  environment (e.g. NFVI).  BP-T30 Redundancy and  backup  The NFV platform should support redundancy and backup protection to improve reliability and ensure  the availability and integrity of 5G NFV data, components, applications, and services.  BP-T31 Specific container  security controls  • Appropriate restrictions on container placement and on the use of container caching should  be applied.  • A security policy that restricts the placement and co-existence of containers belonging to  different trust domains should be defined and implemented.  • A security policy which restricts which sub-functions within an NF, which has been  implemented using containers, may be cached within the general unencrypted container  cache or which requires security protection mechanisms for sensitive containers at rest  within the cache to be defined and implemented.  BP-T32 OSS/BSS protection  There should be a sharing of responsibility between the traditional OSS and the newly deployed SDN  controllers and NFV orchestration. The OSS will manage the relatively static configuration parameters  and limit overall resources assigned to sub-networks or services. The SDN controller and NFV  orchestration platforms will then dynamically manage these network resources to apply policy-based  services in real-time to individual traffic flows.  62 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/013/03.05.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL013v030501p.pdf  63 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/022/02.08.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC022v020801p.pdf  64 https://serverfault.com/questions/622094/what-is-an-acceptable-secure-time-source-in-a-datacentre-environment  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/013/03.05.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL013v030501p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/022/02.08.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC022v020801p.pdf https://serverfault.com/questions/622094/what-is-an-acceptable-secure-time-source-in-a-datacentre-environment  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  60  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T33 LI capabilities  LI capabilities should be consistent with 3GPP and ETSI specifications 65 66 67 68 69 on Lawful  Interception. They cover all necessary aspects in a 5G context: requirements, architecture and  functions, protocol, and procedures.  BP-T34 User plane security  While firewalls at trust boundaries provide some defence against attacks by limiting communication  between trusted entities to only permitted IP addresses using only valid protocols on allowed ports,  additional security controls are needed on the user plane to effectively mitigate DDoS, botnet attacks,  and malware infections. Network-based security functions such as firewalls, volumetric DDoS  protection, antibot net, anti-virus, and web filtering can be deployed on the user plane to provide end- to-end protection70.  BP-T35 MEC security  MEC is designed to support various use cases such as video analytics, location services, Internet of  Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), optimised distribution of local content, data caching, and more.  The MEC system should provide a secure environment for running services for the various actors  involved such as user, network operator, third-party application provider, application developer,  content provider and platform vendor.  MEC security relies on specifications provided by recognised bodies to address specific aspects,  especially ETSI ISG NFV for infrastructure virtualisation and management, the Trusted Computing  Group (TCG) for physical platform security, and IETF specifications for securing access to MEC  services. Furthermore, 3GPP TR 33.848 [47] is investigating the security consequences of  virtualisation of 3GPP NFs. This 3GPP report is applicable to many MEC use cases where the need  for additional security controls is higher than in core network datacentre implemented network  functions. It is expected to result in additional ETSI NFV security requirements that can be utilised for  MEC.  Moreover, security assurance is an important topic which is beginning to be required by regulators for  5G infrastructure components such as MEC. While the traditional common criteria technology (ISO  15408) remains a global reference for security assessment, tailored schemes that address the specific  constraints of 5G ecosystems, such as GSMA NESAS, are expected to play an important role in this  respect.  4.1.2 Policy  This second category of security measures encompasses the various policies and procedures  to be established to ensure an appropriate level of cybersecurity. The following 16 technical  policy measures and best practices have been identified (see Table 17 and a detailed  description in Annex E).  Table 17: Policy best practices  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-P1 Zero Trust  5G NFV deployments should build on mature cybersecurity standards employed in enterprise and  cloud environments. Examples include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO Information  Security Management System series71, the ETSI GS NFV-SEC 00372 Security and Trust Guidance  and the UK NCSC Zero Trust Architecture Design Principles73.  Zero Trust represents an overarching access security model that deliberately avoids assuming implicit  trust between elements in a network. This is particularly important in 5G as various external  stakeholders may need to access infrastructure components or services for management,  maintenance, or monitoring purposes74 75.  65 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf  66 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133126/15.00.00_60/ts_133126v150000p.pdf  67 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133128/15.00.00_60/ts_133128v150000p.pdf  68 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133108/12.08.00_60/ts_133108v120800p.pdf  69 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2266  70 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security- considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  71 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final  72 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec003v010101p.pdf  73 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/zero-trust-architecture/introduction-to-zero-trust  74 https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/zero-trust-and-5g  75 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security- considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133126/15.00.00_60/ts_133126v150000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133128/15.00.00_60/ts_133128v150000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133108/12.08.00_60/ts_133108v120800p.pdf https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2266 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec003v010101p.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/zero-trust-architecture/introduction-to-zero-trust https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/zero-trust-and-5g https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  61  BP-P2  Security  assessment of new  or changes to  existing VNF  service templates  New or modified VNF service templates should be validated through proper risk assessment by a  security professional.  BP-P3  Vulnerability  handling & patch  management  NFV and MANO software components will need to be monitored for vulnerabilities and patched as  quickly as possible to address evolving risks and ensure security and functionality.  BP-P4 Security testing and  assurance  Regular penetration and vulnerability testing should be performed across the NFVi and MANO  production environment to identify any vulnerabilities (e.g. OSs, hypervisor, CIS, VMs or containers)  or compromise of the network zoning rules. 5G stakeholders should also leverage internationally  recognised product testing, assurance, and certification regimes. Potential solutions to these  requirements include, among others, the Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS)76,  jointly defined by 3GPP and GSMA, and the ENISA EUCC77, EUCS78 schemes.  BP-P5 Incident  management  An incident detecting and handling process should be established to support incident response and  restoration activities.  BP-P6 Secure update  management  An update management process is required for introducing a new component or a software or  hardware change into the 5G system. Continuous integration and testing tools make the patching  process efficient and reduce the prolonged risk of exposure. NFV and MANO must support reactive  and proactive security monitoring and patch management to provide continuous security updates.  BP-P7  Restriction on  installing  applications  It should not be possible to install a VNF application into the operational NFV environment without  validation and approval by the operator.  BP-P8 Defence-in-depth Security must be implemented for the hardware, virtualisation, VNF, MANO and application layers.  Multilayer, defence-in-depth security with protective mechanisms must be present.  BP-P9 Strong password  policy  It should be mandated that all user accounts accessing the NFV/MANO system be secured by the  application of a strong password policy. Securing NFV/MANO passwords requires implementing and  enforcing a password policy that includes:  • strong passwords for every account  • the use of a password manager  • two-factor authentication (2FA)  • role-based access control (RBAC)  • privileged access management (PAM) for the most sensitive NFV/MANO components.  BP-P10 Secure supply  chain  Large elements of the supply chain are outside the direct control of the operator, and thus operators  should seek to impose obligations onto the supply chain to enhance security of the NFV.  BP-P11  Resources  inventory  management  system and  database  An inventory management system must account for all the physical elements, open source and NFV  software components that the operator owns on premises and in the cloud. In addition, the resource  inventory database should be protected by security controls. Inventories should be reviewed and  updated at regular intervals.  BP-P12 Apply hardening  policies  NFV, MANO and SDN components should be submitted to a continuous or repetitive hardening  process to ensure that known vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.  BP-P13  Multi-vendors  segregation and  trust  Multi-vendor segregation should be applied to ensure each vendor can only manage or impact its own  resources. In addition, trust vendors of NFV components should be selected. A security SLA should  also be established between the operator and vendors to define the security level that they must  meet.  BP-P14 Security-by-design  The security-by-design principle is to be followed in order to inspire trust in end users. This  requirement highlights the need to consider security aspects from the very beginning of the  development of a 5G system, throughout the supply chain, and over the whole lifecycle of 5G  components.  76 https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/  77 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-certification-eucc-candidate-scheme-v1-1.1  78 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme  https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-certification-eucc-candidate-scheme-v1-1.1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  62  BP-P15 Lifecycle  management  The security posture of a NFV deployment must consider that cloud-based networks are dynamic and  that threats are constantly evolving. Lifecycle management (LCM) will become more complex in a  NFV environment and will require automated management and orchestration functions79. Containers  inherently provide software modularity and decomposition, which allow for independent LCM following  DevOps principles and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). The NIST secure  software development framework (SSDF)80 and DevSecOps project81 for cloud-native applications  integrate security into the DevOps process, reducing vulnerabilities, mitigating the potential impacts of  vulnerabilities, and preventing the recurrence of vulnerabilities.  BP-P16 Software bill Of  materials (SBOM)  Vendors of 5G NFV software components should include a SBOM with the software package. The  generated SBOM should follow the NTIA guidelines and be in a machine-readable format such as  SPDX82, or CycloneDX83.  4.1.3 Organisational  Organisational best practices are of the utmost importance to ensure 5G NFV security. In what  follows, four organisational rules and best practices are introduced in Table 18 and detailed in  Annex E.  Table 18: Organisational best practices  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-O1  Secure physical  environment and  geographical  location  Security is not just about encrypting data streams but also about the physical deployment of equipment.  NFV devices and equipment location, type of equipment, and type of services running on the equipment  are all parts of the complete system and must be protected in a secure physical environment.  BP-O2 Training and  awareness  The following activities should be considered:  • information sharing between different 5G actors;  • adopting a holistic approach to security training and awareness among the employees,  including employees at all levels of the organisation;  • ensuring that security training is continuous, regular and frequently updated.  BP-O3 Trust model  A trust model of relationships among various 5G stakeholders should be built and be able to answer  questions such as: ‘for what one does on trust?’, ‘How much should one trust?’ and ‘How much anyone  can trust?’.  BP-O4 SLAs establishment  SLAs established between 5G stakeholders should include important security and compliance  measures. In this respect, SLAs are like an insurance policy for the 5G network services.  SLAs set the expectations for the performance of a service provider and for the security level. They also  establish penalties for missing targets. In that concept, NFV could not leave unaffected the evolution of  SLA models and their flexibility in adapting to more demanding parameters. An SLA management  framework should be defined in order to fill the gap between 5G stakeholders.  4.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND MEASURES OF THE EECC  Article 40 and Article 41 of the EECC define security requirements and measures as technical  and organisational measures for managing the risks posed to the security of networks and  services. ENISA guidance84 85 on security measures under the EECC are guidelines on security  measures addressed to competent authorities concerning the technical details of implementing  Articles 40 and 41 of the EECC: how to ensure that providers assess risks and take appropriate  security measures.  These guidelines list twenty-nine high-level security objectives, which are grouped in eight  security domains. For each security objective they list specific detailed security measures which  could be taken by providers to reach that particular security objective. Those security measures  79 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  80 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf  81 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/devsecops  82 https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/  83 https://cyclonedx.org  84 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  85 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/devsecops https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/ https://cyclonedx.org/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  63  are technology neutral. They should be applicable to a wide range of different types of  technologies including NFV in 5G.  4.3 OTHER RELEVANT SECURITY HARDENING GUIDANCE  For additional security hardening guidance, see among others:  • ENISA - Security aspects of virtualisation focusing on virtualisation security86.  • NIS cooperation group security measures for OES providing technical and  organisational security measures to manage risks posed to the security of NIS  (Network and Information Systems)87.

OPEN AND FUTURE SECURITY  CHALLENGES  Although many solutions have been proposed to overcome the security challenges in NFV,  many potential security challenges remain. Table 19 illustrates some of the research challenges  and future directions for NFV security.  Table 19: Open and future security challenges  Challenge Challenge description References  Encrypted data  processing  The risks of being able to capture encrypted data in an unencrypted form due to processing  of that data increases significantly. If that processing is highly sensitive (e.g. AUC  (authentication centre) or LI functions) then the risk may not be acceptable.  [47]  Performance  degradation  To truly understand performance, we must simulate growth in network usage. If overall loads  grow by 50%, how will VNF performance be impacted? And if all the load is centred on one  type or pattern of traffic or usage vs multiple types? What is the expected performance  degradation when using resource oversubscription? Different types of usage may require  different service chains that impact resources in a completely different way.  [48]  Host failure  What to do when something breaks? When a host fails, are the VNFs that are running  transitioned appropriately to other hosts? Are the correct rules set up to govern that  transition? How long does it take for the VNFs to resume service and is there an interruption  of service? It is crucial to validate the answers to these questions in system testing and in  production to prevent critical issues.  [48]  Compromised  virtualisation layer  Substantial and structural security issues may still remain around isolation of sensitive  functions where hypervisors, host OS and CISs are hostile or compromised. [49]  Runtime attestation  One of the security challenges is to define the standard interface in the ETSI NFV  architecture to deploy virtual security functions to react to various threats in real time. Such  functionalities should be able to communicate with the orchestration modules and follow the  instructions provided. Another challenge is to securely manage and monitor VNFs by  maintaining their configuration and information on their state during migration. This can be  difficult to do due to the dynamicity and elasticity of VNF operations in cloud environments.  Another challenge is to perform trust management between different vendors who build NFV  hardware and software. The challenge is to efficiently manage the trust chain among vendors  and provide trustiness in the final VNF products.  At the moment, attestation technologies only provide boot time attestation. This does not  guarantee modification during runtime or prevent tampering with the system’s critical  components, and such modifications would only be detected when the system is rebooted.  Runtime attestation is still an open research area that needs to be explored further. There is  also a strong need to develop a comprehensive security architecture to take care of these  security challenges in NFVI. To achieve these goals, network operators and vendors need to  work together to form a vibrant security eco-system. New standards, testbeds, and proofs of  concept would serve as a catalyst for securing NFV infrastructure. The services in this new  virtualised environment are evolving rapidly and, in turn, create new opportunities for  innovation.  [50], [132]  Distributed denial-of- service attacks  How to utilise the flexibility of VNF to defend against DDoS attacks in the network is a major  challenge. [51]  Trust management in  NFV  The emergence of NFV provides opportunities for various vendors to enter the networking  infrastructure market by providing NFV compatible hardware and software. It will be common  to have multiple vendors involved in a NFV supported network. However, how to manage the  trust chain and evaluate the trustworthiness of products is another research challenge. Also,  how to adaptively configure VNFs by choosing software to minimise security risk of the  network is another research topic.  [51]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  69  Trust between VNFs  It is important to maintain trust between the VNFs for the provision of security validation and  integrity. The following are three types of trusts which are important between VNFs:  • trust in the correctness of information output between software components;  • trust that the software components will operate correctly;  • trust in the performance of operations that have an indirect influence on data.  Trusting relationships are basic requirements for the software programs to be able to work  with each other in NFV environment. The trusting relationships chain needs to be made  longer in order to reach the level of complete security.  [52]  Challenges with VNF  images validation and  VNF  onboarding/deploying  There is a risk when validating images, onboarding and deploying VNFs on NFVI. Currently,  these processes are not part of the orchestration.  Every operator has its unique network configuration of hardware and software vendors plus  all the vast numbers of parameter settings. In real time communication there is also a number  of real-time dependencies, timers and correct sequences that must be considered.  To consider these challenges, a comprehensive certification process, standardised testing  framework and the creation of assets to automate the validation, onboarding and deployment  of VNFs are required to reduce risks.  [53]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  70  6. CONCLUSION  NFV in 5G is a technology that is continuously evolving through time due to the new  technologies, requirements and services that need to be addressed. Security, as an inherent  quality that has to be conceived along with the new services, is no exception and must keep up  with the pace. Security in the NFV era presents a long-term challenge. As NFV security  technology continues to develop, automated and virtualised protection systems with robust  security models will enable NFV networks to thrive.  5G deployments uses modern virtualisation techniques for distributed and cloud computing and  networking. NFV and SDN are approaches where these modern techniques are brought into  consistent frameworks which 5G systems builders can use to be effective and to create vendor  products that are interoperable. Those technologies that allow progress to take place are also  technologies that can expose new security challenges. Securing 5G must be designed-in and  not be an afterthought. Hence, a careful approach to the new aspects of cloud-native services,  SDN and NFV can improve their security. Additionally, taking a zero trust approach, combined  with the advanced techniques of cyberthreat intelligence, will further enhance 5G’s security.  In this report we have highlighted the main security challenges that (i) open up with these  technologies and (ii) arise due to the interoperability among them, which enables NFV in 5G.  Some of the main challenges highlighted in this report have shown the following.  • Centralisation of management capabilities presents a single-point-of-failure  weakness.  • Use of standardised general-purpose server and storage machines, routinely built  with open-source code, represent an increase in threats or attack surfaces.  • The growing participation of multiple partners or vendors, processes and  subsystems in the creation and delivery of services introduce the risks of data leaks,  data residue, and attacks. It can also create very complex supply chains. It’s difficult  to manage so many vendors. All it takes is a security flaw in one of the vendor’s  environments to launch a supply chain attack whose impact can reach far and wide.  • The more software components in a NFV, the more possibilities there are of finding  potential software vulnerabilities.  • 5G NFV architecture security should be decentralised by dividing it into a core  network and an edge network. Because the protection targets are widely distributed,  there are issues with the visibility of security.  To solve challenges, we have provided a list of technical, organisational and policy best  practices in security. The security architecture for NFV must be multi-layered. The aim should  be to have security-by-design across all 5G NFV network elements and layers. It is imperative  that security is ‘designed-in’ at all levels to ensure resilience, robustness and address the  connected world of the future enabled by 5G.  Security management and orchestration are necessary to coordinate security protection across  layers. Hardening and patching NFV security can counteract software vulnerabilities. Isolating  resources between different VMs or containers on the same physical machine on the  virtualisation layer can prevent data theft and malicious attacks between VMs or containers.  In-house or third-party security audits, or both, should be encouraged as a best practice for  empowering mobile networks (not limited to 5G NFV only). Operators need to be alert and  always one step ahead of possible security events.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  71  Efforts should be concentrated on developing, automating and refining technologies, policies  and processes for service orchestration, on the detection and prevention of intrusions, on  solutions to protect against viruses and malware, on dynamic authentication, identity, access  and the management of trust relationships, on the encryption of user traffic and its control or  management, on the screening, filtering and inspection of traffic, and on the segregation of data  and networks.  The level of security automation to automate the provisioning of networks, their security and  management in order to continuously maximise network efficiency and functionality should be  increased. With virtualised and highly distributed networks, effective 5G NFV end-to-end  security requires automated monitoring, mechanisms to prevent threats and protection systems  to provide swift responses to known and unknown threats in real-time.  A truly end-to-end approach to NFV security needs to consider the current ETSI and 3GPP  standards. 3GPP technical specifications on security architecture and procedures for 5G system  and ETSI technical specifications on security for NFV come with a set of security features and  improvements. To ensure the expected security benefits are realised, it is important that security  requirements defined in the 3GPP and ETSI specifications are fully and correctly implemented  and used, including relevant optional requirements.  Creation of a secure NFV architecture in 5G will enable customer privacy and security, build  trust and encourage adoption of 5G for critical functions (e.g. critical national infrastructure or  functions requiring high reliability such as healthcare).  In addition to the security challenges and best practices explored in this report, we have  outlined the roles and responsibilities in terms of security of the main 5G stakeholders and  administrators providing and managing the NFV in 5G.  Moreover, we highlighted the main assets to be protected with CIA security properties, the  vulnerabilities of various components and network interfaces that can be exploited by the  adversary, and the attack scenarios that may impact NFV in 5G. Links between all those  elements are provided in the annexes.  At the end of this report, a list of annexes is included to provide the full taxonomies of and the  links between the different elements from the core of the report. In addition, the annex provides  the standardisation efforts on NFV and SDN from various entities in the telecom industry and  other bodies.

The receiver should have corresponding  verification mechanisms. Lack of such measures or improper messages facilitate the abuse and  modification of sessions and messages.  NFV MANO  VUL2  Improper protection of  confidentiality of data transferred  over internal interfaces to MANO  Lack of appropriate protection of the confidentiality of data transferred over any internal interface of  MANO. NFV MANO; VNF  VUL3 Improper API Access  implementation  TLS not implemented for API communication, or implementation shortcomings such as lack of TLS- based authentication: client and authorisation servers are not mutually authenticated or client does  not authenticate the resource server.  Os-Ma-nfvo  VUL4 Use of legacy PNF Vulnerabilities of a PNF could be used as a starting point for an attack against VNFs, potentially  taking advantage of any legacy security used by PNFs and not provided by the virtualisation layer. Control plane  VUL5  Improper verification of identity and  location of transmitting party on  internal interfaces  If an internal interface allows any actions from data received without successfully identifying and  verifying the identity and location of the transmitting party, it enables masquerading of the  orchestrator and other forms of privilege escalation that in turn can lead to abuse of VIM or VNFM  functions by unauthorised parties.  NFV MANO  VUL6  Improper hardening  of NFV components  Inability to provide proof of integrity  of the data stores used for VM or  container images  Poor monitoring of stored images to determine if any unauthorised modification, deletion or insertion  has occurred renders VIM unable to ensure the integrity of VM or container images and of data  transfers.  VIM/CISM  VUL7 Lack of protection of user and  control planes data  An attacker could read and/or manipulate data in transit if control and user planes data in transit  between hosts is not sent over an encrypted, signed and authenticated channel. Control plane  VUL8 Improper patch management  Once identified, vulnerabilities in software can be fixed through security patches whereas hardware  vulnerabilities are much more costly to fix. Security patches may require a reboot and could cause  service disruption, particularly if many commodity servers have to be rebooted over a short period.  Security patches are not always done in time. Failure to apply necessary patches leave the systems  open to the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.  VNF  VUL9 Misconfiguration  Complexity brought by virtualisation increases the probability that errors and misconfigurations will  remain undetected. Accidental misconfigurations or failure to follow security standards and practices  can cause service problems directly, or leave open unintended vulnerabilities, which will cause  service problems if exploited.  VNF  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  92  VUL10 No mechanism to enforce geo- restrictions  The MANO system should allow instantiation of MANO components and managed entities, the  NFVIs, only at explicit geographic locations. Failure to do so may leave the system vulnerable to  legal and licensing risks.  NFV MANO  VUL11 Time manipulation  VNFs must synchronise with trusted time servers. Failure to do so, leaves the system vulnerable to  an attack that manipulates the network timing source or VNF clock, thus causing the network to be  compromised.  It is possible to move clock back and forth in order to confuse the NFVI and VNFs.  VNF  VUL12  Virtualisation layer  vulnerabilities  Inadequate access privileges in  virtualised environments  Administrative models that enable an admin/root/super user account type to have full access to  system resources allow visibility and modification of cryptographic keys, passwords in memory,  configuration files, intellectual property and other resources within the NFV. The hypervisor is fully  aware of the current state of each guest OS it controls. Hypervisor introspection can enable the  ability to view, inject, and/or modify information on operational state associated with the NFV through  direct or indirect methods. Access to status information can result in the ability to arbitrarily read  and/or write the contents of memory, storage, key storage and other NFV operational aspects.  NFVI  VUL13 Improper key management system  The host system shall provide cryptographically separated secure environments for different  applications. In the absence of these conditions, the virtualised environment can be abused to  compromise sensitive functions from less protected ones.  SM  VUL14  Lack of a proper mechanism for  ensuring a hardware-based root of  trust (HBRT)  A hardware-based root of trust (HBRT) should act as an initial root of trust to ensure a safe  environment for running sensitive virtualised components. NFVI  VUL15 Software vulnerabilities in NFV  implementation  The risks from software vulnerabilities could be higher with NFV than with traditional bespoke  appliances because VNFs are expected to run on commodity software and hardware and because  NFV is built on cloud technology with a standard level of security. Virtualisation technology will need  to be re-assessed before it can be considered suitable for protecting critical network infrastructure.  VNF  VUL16  Vulnerable  mechanisms for  authentication and  authorisation of NFV  components  Improper VNF on-boarding Improper procedures for signing and managing associated cryptographic keys may enable the  manipulation and compromise of the integrity of VNF Packages. VNFM  VUL17 Improper VNF instantiation Lack of or improper mechanisms to prevent the instantiation of VNF packages unless their signature  is verified may enable the manipulation and compromise of the integrity of VNFs.  Ve-Vnfm-em; Ve-Vnfm- vnf  VUL18 Improper authentication policy  Unauthenticated access to the system functions of NFV management and orchestration: the use of a  system function without successful authentication on the basis of the user’s identity and at least one  authentication attribute (e.g. password, certificate) opens an opportunity for exploitation and limits  accountability. This includes M2M communication.  NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL19 Insecure or insufficient  authentication attributes  Failure to protect accounts by at least one authentication attribute or active predefined authentication  attributes: depending on information sensitivity, different levels of strong authentication mechanisms  are required. Failure to identify the proper correspondence between levels of protection and the  authentication mechanisms implemented creates the possibility unauthorised entities will be allowed  to access unallocated resources.  NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  93  VUL20 Insecure password policy  A password policy must address password structure, password change, hidden password display  capabilities and consecutive failed login attempts. A weak password structure and/or a password  validity period that is too long could lead to a successful brute force attack. Failure to block  consecutive failed login attempts may lead to a password being guessed.  NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL21  Insecure authentication  mechanisms to management or  maintenance interfaces  The network product management must support mechanisms for mutual authentication. The mutual  authentication mechanism can rely on the protocol used for the interface itself or other means. NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL22 Insecure authorisation and access  control mechanisms  The authorisations for accounts and applications must be reduced to the minimum required for the  tasks they have to perform. NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL23  Insufficient or  improper monitoring  mechanisms of NFV  Insufficient or inadequate logging  of security events for MANO and  NFVI  A lack of security events being logged together with a unique system reference (e.g. host name, IP or  MAC address) and the exact time an incident occurred do not allow a correct and rapid audit in the  event of security incidents occurring  NFV-MANO; NFVI  VUL24 Logs not transferred to centralised  storage  Security event logs should be forwarded or uploaded to a central location or external systems.  Security event log files shall also be protected in storage and transfer states. NFV-MANO; NFVI  VUL25 Improper protection of security  event log files  Availability and integrity of log files of security events could lead to delays, wrong audit results, delays  in the restoration of security and the persistence of threats. NFV-MANO; NFVI  VUL26  Vulnerabilities due to  legacy OSS/BSS  systems  Use of weak cryptographic  algorithms  The OSS/BSS applications may use weak cryptography in their components. According to ANSSI,  BSI, SOG-IS and NIST reports, several encryptions and hashing algorithms are considered insecure.  For instance, TDES, MD5, SHA1, RSA (key size smaller than 2048 bits) algorithms are still used for  encryption, signature and hashing purposes. These algorithms are considered inadequate for  modern security requirements. A weak encryption algorithm is a critical security problem in an  OSS/BSS system since the encrypted data transmitted with NFV/MANO includes sensitive  information.  OSS/BSS systems  VUL27 Insecure interface between  OOS/BSS and NFV/MANO  The security of each interface depends on the type of interface, manufacturer, etc. Newer interfaces  such as SOAP and REST over TLS are more secure than older interfaces. Unsecure interfaces may  still be in use such as TLSv1, FTP, SNMP and compromised by exploiting vulnerabilities in protocols  such as insecure settings, spoofing, and other vulnerabilities.  OSS/BSS systems  VUL28 Insufficient or inadequate logging  of sensitive data  OSS/BSS systems log high amounts of data, which includes request logs, provisioning logic  execution logs, user audit trails, etc. Apart from helping in finding faults in the application, logging  also helps in finding security breaches. Nevertheless, the high amount of data that goes into  OSS/BSS logs makes logging an important asset to secure. Logs may be archived in insecure  network storage. Attackers can use a combination of attacks to get access to logs.

A VM or container or group of VMs or containers  connected to the same network can be the target of attacks from other VMs or containers on the  network. (2) The virtualisation layer (host OS, hypervisor and CIS software): the most important  software in a virtual system is the virtualisation layer. Any security vulnerability in the virtualisation  VIM/CISM  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  97  layer and associated infrastructure and management software or tools puts VNFs at risk.

An attack on a single VNF installed in NFVI can compromise the entire infrastructure.  A malicious administrator manages to obtain confidential information about a user thanks to some  badly implemented virtualisation procedures in an NFV context. Since the malicious administrator has  root access to the virtualisation layer, by using a search operation he can extract the user ID,  passwords and cryptographic keys from the memory dump, which in turn violates user privacy and data  confidentiality. To execute this attack, the attacker first creates a backup copy of the VM drive and then  uses open-source tools, such as kpartx and vgscan, to extract sensitive data from it.  Another attacker scenario is that the hypervisor or CIS administration role can be used to manage the  VM or container and vSwitch environment. The administrator could use this environment to monitor or  eavesdrop security critical information operating on a VM or container or passing between NFVs  components. The administration role may eavesdrop unsecured traffic (e.g. unsecured SIP - session  initiation protocol) or create a memory dump of a running VM or container to obtain security critical or  personal information, e.g. customer authentication credentials, which would allow them to log into the  customer SIP account and fraudulently use their service or have access to compromise customer  privacy.  Note: the risk posed by the hypervisor or CIS administrator role exists in all deployment scenarios.  However, the risk is increased if this role is not under the direct control of the operator.  Impacts:  As one of the objectionable operations, the administrator can extract and use the memory dump of a  user’s VM or container to extract a user’s ID and password and TLS keys which is a direct breach of  the user’s privacy.  Access  breach [50]  ATT2 Attacks from within an  NFV  Software flaw  attacks  Software components with NFV are vulnerable to different types of attacks. The security breaches  brought to the NFVI by one software can spread out to other components and therefore make the  entire environment vulnerable. Software NFV components may carry flaws in their design, but not  specifically related to their code. Misconfigurations are typically exploited to perform such attacks.  Another attack can be obtaining a privileged status by using return-oriented-programming.  Impacts:  A vendor with wrong intentions may provide weak security features in the software which makes the  software vulnerable to attack and therefore puts the entire network to risk. This example will qualify for  both human-instigated and software vulnerability. It could be possible to bypass firewall restrictions or  to take advantage of a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [86], [52], [88]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  99  ATT3 Attacks from within an  NFV  Resource misuse  attacks Misuse of shared resources (by user or VNF): resource misuse attacks e.g. RFA and FRC attacks  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [87]  ATT4 Attacks from within an  NFV  Security standard  subversion attacks  Vulnerabilities present in security standards can be exploited. Consequently, all the components  supporting those standards are affected. Two examples are set out here below:  1. Vulnerabilities in the 5G or 4G security standards: new vulnerabilities are revealed affecting  both the operator infrastructure and end-devices (including mobiles, NB-IoT, laptop etc). As  demonstrated in the paper New Vulnerabilities in 5G Networks93, these vulnerabilities can  be exploited in 4G base stations or in commercially available NB-IoT protocols using low- cost hardware and software platforms to mount battery draining, hijacking and bidding down  attacks. Those attacks affect the range from gigabit high speed LTE devices to NB-IoT  devices.  2. Vulnerabilities in the NIST Special Publication 800-90A and ISO 18031 standards94 95: these  standards contain algorithms for generating the random numbers used, for example, to  generate keys for cryptographic systems. One of the algorithms contained within these  documents is a pseudorandom number generator called the dual elliptic curve deterministic  random bit generator (Dual EC DRBG) that has long been known to admit a serious  potential back door in the event that an attacker generates the standard algorithm  parameters. Several cryptographic software vendors have implemented Dual EC in their  products. For example, OpenSSL’s FIPS module includes Dual EC as an optional random  number generator. The backdoor which used Dual_EC_DRBG as a CSPRNG would allow  the attacker with knowledge of the trapdoor to decrypt, for example, TLS encryption or VPN  traffic, read all traffic, and modify the data as needed.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [90], [91], [92]  ATT5 Attacks from within an  NFV LI attacks  Attack scenario due to the hybrid legacy or virtual LI architecture:  Compromise of legacy node: In this scenario, an attacker makes use of the VNFs or host OS or  hypervisor or CIS or associated signalling within the NFV domain to attack legacy nodes which were  otherwise previously secure. This could be as simple as the legacy nodes now sharing the same  administration domains as VNFs such that the legacy node operations become more visible to MANO  than was possible in the full legacy network. Legacy nodes are unlikely to implement many of the  mechanisms an LI VNFCI POI would utilise based on ETSI GS NFV-SEC 012. Therefore, NFV may  considerably compromise the security by protecting the obscurity of legacy POIs. Furthermore, it may  be relatively simple to monitor overt events in the NFV domain and then look for corresponding  SDN/NFV actions taken by legacy POIs in mixed networks. Furthermore, the physical firewalls and  other protection mechanisms around the legacy nodes may be virtualised, considerably increasing the  attack exposure surface to those nodes. It is also possible to consider a scenario where an attacker  initiates an attack from within the legacy domain which is then allowed to route through VNFs (not  directly impacting the VNFs), which then returns as a trusted message into the legacy domain which  does result in an attack.

These  attacks do not aim at gaining control over the resource nor at exfiltrating data, but only affect its  availability.  The major reason behind such attacks are:  1) VNFs getting controlled remotely (by a third party),  2) due to a completely external malicious attack in order to destroy the NFVI such as can be done with  a DDOS. A VNF’s internal vulnerabilities also make it open to external attacks.  Impacts:  1. A denial-of-service attack (DoS) can be attempted on the NFV infrastructure in order to  make it run out of resources and therefore also shut down its service to some extent. During  the DoS attack, one VNF can be targeted for the attack and be made to generate numerous  amount of traffic to be sent to other VNFs running on the same host or on a different host.  The danger of DDoS could also affect untargeted services and tenants that are hosted on  the same physical host.  2. Such an attack can be performed from the hypervisor or CIS by using the management  console (or a service controlling it) to shut down the targeted VM container.  3. Network protocols can be used to flood the hypervisor or CIS and/or its execution  environment using DDoS attacks.  4. A more discreet manner to proceed with such a denial of service is to reconfigure the virtual  hardware environment to cause VM or container dysfunction (e.g. reducing allocated RAM)  to reduce the footprint of the attack.  5. The networking environment may be shared with other tenants of the NFV sharing the same  virtualisation layer. The traffic introduced by the other tenants may cause increased risks  including DoS on the NFVI.  Denial of  service  [50], [77], [85],  [86], [87], [52],  [88]  ATT7 Attacks from outside  an NFV  DNS Amplification  attacks  The NFVI supports a virtual DNS and the NFV orchestrator can increase the number of DNS servers  depending upon the number of queries. An attacker generates multiple DNS queries using IP spoofing  and as a response more virtual DNS are rolled out by the orchestrator. This can lead to a further  shutting down of the services of the NFV.  Denial of  service [50]  ATT8 Attacks from outside  an NFV Injection attacks  It is a malware injection attack on the hypervisor or CIS and its VMs or containers. A hypervisor or CIS  allows multiple VMs or containers to communicate and integrate with each other, taking care to  manage the virtualisation layer of the NFV system. A malware injection aims to affect the virtualisation  layer in the infrastructure of NFV via altering its internal code. The degree as to how badly a malware  attack affects the system varies, including slowing down the response time for the system.  Malware injection attacks implemented on VMs or containers can also cause modification to the  permissions of the virtual service. It may lead to having the sensitive data of VNFs visible to other  VNFs in unauthorised ways. Also, this attack could affect the NFV host OS and hypervisor or CIS,  which may lead to dysfunction in the CPU, VMs or containers and in the memory of the system.  An attacker (e.g. supplier that has installed some Trojan in its VNF supply to attack other co-hosted  VNF) can break the confidentiality and integrity of a software (code + data) once it is launched.

A malicious system posing as an OSS/BSS can disrupt  the network by sending incorrect configuration requests to the NFV/MANO and SDN systems. If the  attacker is able to spoof a system, it can mount a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, which might lead to  tampering with data or sniffing out important information on the interface with MANO and NFV systems.  Alternately, the attacker might just passively listen to the information (sniff) on an interface. In addition,  the attacker may perform DoS attacks on the NFV/MANO and SDN systems.  An attacker can deny service to the OSS/BSS systems by using several techniques such as resource  exhaustion by sending multiple login requests or a high number of provisioning requests.  An attacker may be able to sniff the credentials used by the OSS/BSS systems due to a weak  authentication or authorisation implementation to authenticate with the NFV or MANO. Data transfer in  plaintext is vulnerable to sniffing, which can reveal subscribers’ personal information and secret  network parameters.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [100]  ATT10 Attacks from outside  an NFV LI attacks  Attack scenario due to the hybrid legacy-virtual LI architecture:  Compromise of virtualised node: In this scenario, an attacker makes use of a legacy LI node (POI or  wider node functionality) or associated signalling to that node, in order to attack an otherwise secure  VNF containing a vPOI. This could be as simple as capturing unencrypted or poorly secured messages  sent to legacy nodes and then using these messages to perform attacks on the VNF. Since the VNF is  required to trust the legacy nodes and communicate with them using legacy protocols, the VNFs  becomes at risk of bid down, man-in-the-middle or plain text attacks on the messages or interfaces.  Furthermore, an attacker, by studying the operation of a legacy node, may be able to identity inference  attacks against a VNF of the same type and manufacture (e.g. legacy CSCF vs VNF CSCF). It is also  possible to consider a scenario where an attacker initiates an attack from within the NFV domain which  is then allowed to route through legacy nodes (not directly impacting the legacy nodes), which then  returns as a trusted message into the NFV domain which does result in an attack.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [127]  ATT11  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Malicious  VM/Container  attacks  Hypervisor or CIS resource monopolisation attacks: the hypervisor or CIS resource monopolisation  attacks consist of a malicious VM or container taking control of a hypervisor or CIS to gain exclusive  access to these resources. This leads to the violation of the isolation of the hypervisor or CIS resource  or to the theft of data from other VMs or containers.  VM or container hopping attacks: a VM or container hopping attack consists of a malicious VM or  container that directly targets another VM or container from the virtualisation environment. Such attacks  permit the tampering and the elevation of privilege in the virtualisation architecture.  VM or container monitoring attacks: the attacks consist of a VM or container monitoring another VM or  container to collect information about that VM or container without compromising it. They can typically  rely on passive monitoring of another VM container. These attacks are mainly conditioned by the  exploitation of side channels, and the co-residence of VMs or containers.  VM or Container escape attacks: the VM or container escape attack aims at compromising the  hypervisor or CIS in order to access another VM or container or execute code in the physical host. It is  very similar to VM or container hopping, and corresponds to the same threats, but relies on the  hypervisor or CIS compromise to break the isolation. Once the attacker gains access to one of the VMs  or containers, it uses this VM or container’s network connectivity to reach the hypervisor or CIS API  and then attacks the hypervisor or CIS to cause great damage. The major supporting factor behind this  type of attack is the improper isolation of hypervisor or CIS and VMs or containers.

These attacks may affect memory pages owned by other VMs or containers, to proceed to  in-memory information leakage or even to build a hidden channel between both VMs or  containers.  2. These attacks may contribute to leaks of cryptography keys.  ATT12  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Malicious  hypervisor/CIS  attacks  These attacks target the hypervisor or CIS of the virtualisation architecture. The threats related to these  attacks affect the hypervisor or CIS itself, by tampering with it, repudiating the traceability of its  behaviour, disclosing information about its configuration and the configuration of the VM or container,  and elevating the privilege of a VM or container user to that of the hypervisor or CIS administrator.  The VM or container introspection attack exploits a malicious hypervisor or CIS to analyse the  behaviour of a VM or container and infer its internal state.  The inter-VM or container communication introspection attacks may also provide interesting information  regarding the communications of the VM or container with other hosted VMs or containers through I/O  or networking subsystems that are handled by the hypervisor or CIS. This raises privacy issues related  to the interception and introspection of communications.  If a type 2 solution or container is deployed then the virtual environment is subject to any vulnerability  that might exist in the underlying OS. For example, a missed patch or update could expose the host  OS, hypervisor CIS and VMs or containers to attack.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [88], [47]  ATT13  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Command/control  channel attacks  The command and control channel is a privileged communication medium between the hypervisor or  CIS and a VM or container. This threat targets the hypervisor or CIS, through the repudiation of  malicious activities in a VM or container.  Access  breach  [88]  ATT14  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Hardware attacks  Hypervisors or CISs and host OSs are running at the top of a hardware layer. They are therefore  constrained by the hardware layer, which is composed of devices with their own firmwares. These  firmwares may carry their own flaws, providing the necessary material to an attacker to compromise  them. The corresponding threats are tampering with hardware, the disclosure of information based on  side channels, and the elevation of privileges to get control on the software components running over  the hardware. These attacks are emphasised by the hard constraints regarding the upgrade procedure  of these firmwares. Such upgrades are typically limited by the degradation of services during the  upgrade process, or by a lack of support from manufacturers.  The Spectre and Meltdown issues96 are substantial threats that have severe impacts on security. The  vulnerabilities allow processes to read information in memory that should not be accessible to them.  User processes can access information from other processes and the kernel, and in a virtualised  environment they can also access information on the host and, potentially, other guests.

Privilege  escalation is a common attack on the VIM, and, if successful, it can lead to partial control over the host.  Attacks on network functions and/or resources (e.g. spoofing, sniffing and denial of service) can also  take place.

A rogue element could also  generate and amplify traffic, log data or any other type of data that require other network elements to  act upon it. The goal of such an attack is to limit the ability of the network to cope with the current traffic  load and to disrupt the network’s ability to provide the services intended.  ATT16  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Time manipulation  attacks  This could introduce several threats such as tampering with security logs, expiry of used certificates or  UEs getting out of sync with the network.  If an attack manipulates the network timing source or VNF clock, the network can be compromised.  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [110]  ATT17  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  LI attacks  An example of this attack could be manipulating the lawful intercept functionality, which may provide  the attacker with the ability to access this function at will through enabling unauthorised accounts or the  redirection of IP traffic.  A national memory stack segment (MSS) may be deployed in a foreign datacentre where local LEA  (law enforcement agency) legislation allows access to the security critical customer and LI information.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [127]  ATT18  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Orchestration  attacks  Attack scenario 1: Spoofing of the orchestration platform’s service requests may result in an attacker  being able to generate service requests to cause DoS by:  • provisioning new instances in order to deplete the number of resources available to the NFV or  SDN components;  • retiring NFV instances or SDN elements that are in use by the operational network;  • changing the SDN configuration.  This risk could impact a single element or the whole mobile network.  Attack scenario 2: Spoofing as an SDN controller, VIM or VNFM to send service management requests  to the orchestration platform on the resource performance could cause the orchestration platform to  initiate changes on the infrastructure.  This exploit could be used by an attacker who wants to force the orchestration platform to move a NFV  component to another datacentre where the attacker may have physical access or has compromised  the virtualisation layer and wants to monitor customer traffic.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [86], [6]  ATT19  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Supply chain  attacks  Compromised components could affect network performance and compromise the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of network assets. Furthermore, compromised devices may provide malicious  actors with persistent access to 5G networks and the capability to intercept data that routes through the  devices. Compromised devices may infect connected computers, phones and other devices with  malware and may have data rerouted, changed or deleted.  Untrusted companies that have significant international market share within telecommunication  networks may introduce risks even if they do not have a large presence within EU networks. Therefore,  even if the EU network were completely secure, data traveling overseas may pass through untrusted  telecommunication networks and potentially be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, disruption, or  destruction.  This may result in anything from an attacker being able to install a malicious configuration and  ultimately control the network element or function or, in the case of a damaged deployment, it could  lead to limited or total failure of all the network elements that are scheduled to be updated.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [62]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  104  An untrusted host OS and hypervisor or CIS may have embedded vulnerabilities (for example  embedded Trojan software or rooted OS), exposing all VMs or containers and associated NFVs to  attack. An attacker may exploit these embedded vulnerabilities to allow them to compromise VMs or  containers operating within the hypervisor or CIS.  As different virtualisation environments may provide different levels of security protection for the  application layer, stand-alone testing of a VNF may not ensure that the desired level of assurance of  the VNF remains the same when deployed in different virtualised scenarios. Furthermore, VNFs used  in different service types (e.g. network slices) or different services (e.g. vertical services) may face  requirements for security assurance that are different from the service layer. A VNF successfully tested  in isolation may not provide the required level of assurance for a specific slice or service, for a given  NFVI.  ATT20  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Third party hosting  attacks  A third-party tenant has direct access to the SAN (storage area network) and any local storage used by  NFVs within the datacentre. This privileged access could facilitate access to security critical or  customer information, or a DoS attack.  When deployed by an operator who uses a third party host environment not under the operator’s  control, without appropriate protection, the sensitive information of a VNF could be compromised by the  third party.  An attacker with physical access to the hardware environment may be able to tamper or remove the  TPM (trusted platform module), disabling the trusted computing platform function and facilitating other  attacks, e.g. allowing an untrusted host OS and hypervisor or CIS to be installed.

Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [6]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  105  E ANNEX: BEST PRACTICES REGISTER  ID Measures/Best  practices Description References  BP-T1 Security monitoring  and filtering  Below are three approaches to deploy virtual security functions (e.g. antivirus, firewall, IDS/IPS).  Security function embedded within the VM container: the advantage of this option is that the network security function is aware of the context of  the VM or container. For example, the firewall is aware of any new port used by the network function and thus requires less configuration. The  disadvantage is that the operator may not be able to choose or change the vendor of the security function, who is chosen by the provider of the  network function.  Security function as a standalone VM/Container: the network security functions are standalone VMs or containers. This option provides the  operator with the flexibility to choose a vendor of security functions to protect particular network interfaces. However, such an architecture is exposed  to malicious changes of the network topology and other network layer risks.  Security function in the virtualisation layer: the network security agents are outside of the VMs or containers within the virtualisation layer. A  single security function can protect all the VMs or containers managed by the virtualisation layer instead of having one security function per VM or  container. The operator can easily change the vendor of the security function as the security function is independent of the VM or container. This  option may, however, require more configuration compared with the first option where the security function is embedded within the VM or container.  Network interfaces should be locked down so that they only accept a restricted number of expected protocols.  [1], [61], [47],  [25]  BP-T2 VNF Image validation  and protection  A VNF Package is composed of several components such as, for example, VNFD, software images, scripts, etc. During the on-boarding of the VNF  package, a validation of the package should be performed. The validation should be a procedure that verifies the integrity of the VNF package. A  package is certified by performing acceptance testing and full functional testing against the VNF including configuration, management and service  assurance.  It is easy to tamper with VNF images. It requires only a few seconds to insert some malware into a VNF image file while it is being uploaded to an  image database or being transferred from an image database to a compute node. Luckily, VNF images can be cryptographically signed and verified  during launch time. This can be achieved by setting up some signing authority and modifying the hypervisor or CIS configuration to verify an image’s  signature before they are launched.  The software package and the artefacts within the package of a VNF shall have their integrity protected by the vendor’s signature. The software  package and the artefacts within the package of a VNF and the software catalogue holding its image should have their integrity protected after  onboarding. The software package and the artefacts within the package of a VNF containing sensitive information must support the protection of  confidentiality.  Software package and artefacts within the package of a VNF must be bound to a specific network after onboarding, such that unauthorised software  cannot be instantiated even if it has a valid vendor certificate.  [1], [13] [50],  [47], [25],  [133]  BP-T3 Tracking VNF version  changes  The orchestration and VNF management systems should have the ability to keep track of multiple versions, multiple environments, multiple instances  and allow the service provider team to perform updates or upgrades with clear expectations of service continuity based on metadata information  including component dependencies.  [13], [38]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  106  BP-T4 VNF deployment  Minimum baseline security controls and hardening measures should be configured for new VNF deployments. This can be done in many ways such  as using pre-hardened golden images, deployment time configuration, etc. Such controls include fully implemented access control rules and ensuring  that any unused ports, features, insecure protocols, or services are disabled.  [6], [25]  BP-T5 VNF deletion or  relocation  The NFVO may only relocate or retire a VNF after backup and storage of critical data such as encryption keys or subscriber information to ensure  this data is not lost during migration or restructuring of the network. This also applies when a request to relocate or retire a VNF comes from the  EMS.  The NFVO may only relocate or retire a VNF after having validated that the security and affinity policies can be and will be applied upon  reintroduction of the element either in the same or a new location. This validation must take into account both operator and regulatory requirements.  The NFVO may only relocate or retire a VNF after its operational state is no longer depended upon by other VNFs. In the event of a VNF being  attacked or compromised it should be possible to isolate the VNF from the production environment and restore the VNF to a state prior to the attack.  It should also be possible to take a snapshot of the affected VNF to allow for security investigation and analysis.  [38], [122]  BP-T6 Cryptography  Secure key management must be implemented to manage all the steps of a key lifecycle: key generation using an appropriate level of entropy from a  reliable source, secure key storage, key rotation and revocation, secure key destruction, etc.  The use of tamper resistant hardware security modules for secure boot and secure execution of cryptographic algorithms should be considered.  Specific security cryptographic mechanisms include bidirectional authentication, transmission encryption and integrity protection.  3GPP TS 33.50197 offers a detailed explanation of the security architecture and procedures for 5G. ENISA98 lists several cryptographic best  practices to accomplish this, including:  • encrypt UE by default;  • apply not-NULL ciphering for user and signalling data;  • use a secure protocol on the network for both user and control plane data;  • use state-of-the-art mechanisms for transport protection and mutual authentication;  • implement the required authentication specifications and consider secondary authentication;  • ensure keys are properly protected and stored;  • ensure use of current security protocols for TLS (TLS 1.2 and above) and appropriate key and certificate management practices;  • use tamper-resistant hardware for storing or processing critical data.  ETSI GR NFV-SEC 00599 provides a guide to the use of public key infrastructures (PKI) for the purpose of distributing public key certificates (PKC)  as applicable to the ETSI ISG NFV for the support of public key cryptography in authenticating, authorising and encrypting links between objects in  NFV.  ENISA also recommends establishing PKI infrastructure for secure admin access and protecting your network against external access, especially in  a cloud environment.  [25], [133]  BP-T7 Hypervisor/CIS  protection  Hypervisor or CIS introspection can be used to scrutinise software running inside VMs or containers to find abnormal activities. It acts as a host- based IDS that has access to the states of all VMs or containers, so that the root kit and boot kit inside VMs or containers cannot hide easily. Using  introspection capabilities, the hypervisor’s or CIS’s functionalities are enhanced, enabling it, among other things, to monitor network traffic, access  files in storage, and to execute read memory. Hypervisor or CIS introspection APIs are powerful tools to perform deep VM or container analysis and  [1], [50], [47],  [25]  97 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169  98 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-in-5g-specifications/  99 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/005/01.02.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC005v010201p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  107  potentially increase VM or container security. However, they can also be used as an exploit that makes it possible to break and bypass the isolation  between VMs or containers and the hypervisor or CIS.  Example: LibVMI is the library for hypervisor introspection for various platforms, implemented in C language with Python bindings. It gives the  hypervisor the means to perform deep inspection of VMs (e.g. memory checking, vCPU register inspection, and recording trapping events).  The hypervisor or CIS must enforce network security policies. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that;  • VMs or containers are isolated from each other,  • VMs or containers are prevented from accessing each other’s memory spaces,  • keys used to encrypt memory are also under hypervisor or CIS control,  • hypervisors or CISs are not allowed to write directly to memory,  • hypervisors or CISs are not allowed to bypass normal memory access controls and security within the VM or container,  • hypervisors or CISs are not allowed to change data within a VNF at run-time.  Note: a Type 1 hypervisor is considered significantly more secure than a Type 2 'hosted' solution (where the hypervisor is installed on top of the host  OS directly controlling the hardware and network adapters) as there are less attack services (OS and hypervisor).  BP-T8 Security Management  and Orchestration  One best practice consists of designing a NFV orchestrator incorporating the security and trust requirements of the NFVI. The orchestration and  management of security functions requires integration by enabling interaction among the security orchestrator, the VNFM, and the element  management systems (EMS). This type of protection can be achieved by setting scaling boundaries in the VNFD or network service descriptor  (NSD), for example, and having the NFVO enforce these restrictions to protect from attacks such as a DNS amplification attack.  Operators must ensure that they use an out-of-band (OOB) management network that is not accessible from the internet so management interfaces  are secured from remote access. If an operator allows for remote access into the OOB for employees and/or OEM support, the operator must ensure  that they use a multi-factor authentication (MFA), at a minimum, for any type of VPN access. An MFA VPN combined with zero-trust greatly improves  secure remote access to protect the 5GC Network.  Secure management and administration of the NFVI and NFV-MANO is critical for the security of a virtualised network. The following describe the  basic principles for such secure management.  a) Administration of the NFVI is only available over mutually authenticated, encrypted and integrity protected channels or APIs.  b) All channels or APIs are separated from each other and use separate credentials.  c) The number of privileged accounts for the NFVI is constrained to a minimal manageable number to meet the CSP’s needs.  d) NFV-MANO and NFVI administrators do not have any privileged rights to other services within the CSP.  e) NFV-MANO and NFVI administrators are only provided with the privileges and accesses required to carry out their role.  f) NFV-MANO and NFVI administrators do not have access to workloads running within the virtualised environment.  g) NFV-MANO and NFVI administration access is limited to best practice configuration methods (e.g. authorised API calls).  h) Internal components within VNFs are not able to directly connect to entities or management functions outside of the network trust domain,  except via interfaces that are explicitly part of the VNF security design.  i) NFV-MANO and NFVI administration is automated wherever possible.  j) Manual administration of the NFVI is by exception and raises a security alert.  k) Functions that manage the administration and security of the NFVI (e.g. MANO) are physically separate and do not run on the same NFVI  as the NFs they manage.  [1], [50], [57],  [61], [18]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  108  l) Functions that support the administration and security of the NFVI are treated as security critical functions.  BP-T9 Remote attestation  The remote attestation (RA) technique can be used to remotely verify the trust status of an NFV platform. ETSI suggests leveraging hardware  security module (HSM), trusted platform module (TPM) and virtual TPM/HSM (vTPM/vHSM) to provide trusted protection for VNFs. These modules  are used to shelter integrity measurements (i.e. hash values), cryptographic keys and certificates that are required to empower remote attestation of  VNF components. Indeed, remote attestation guarantees the integrity of VNF instances at load time. Practical implementations of the remote  attestation service include the open cloud integrity tool (openCIT), an open-source software hosted on GitHub.  It shall be possible to attest a VNF through the full attestation chain from the hardware layer through the virtualisation layer to the VNF layer.  Attestation of a platform’s integrity should be linked to the application layer and possible for other functions to query. If platform attestation fails, the  VNF should not be allowed to run.  Attestation of the VNF should be performed prior to deployment or network integration and during operations.  In ETSI GR NFV-SEC 018, several use case scenarios are described that aim to establish specific trust between NFV stakeholders:  (1) measurement of VM during launch,  (2) protected VM launch on a trusted NFVI,  (3) measurement of VM during launch and while in use,  (4) remote attestation of secret storage,  (5) secure VM migration between two trusted NFVIs.  Other Examples of attestation solutions are Hytrust and OpenAttestation.  In the OpenAttestation example, the launch of a VM only occurs when the Openstack Controller gets the confirmation that the compute node is  trustworthy from a so-called attestation server (AS) which performs the appraisal of the trusted compute pool that Openstack Controller wants to use  for the VM.  [1], [50], [47],  [132]  BP-T10  Software compliance  and integrity  preservation  (6) A software checksum (hash or signature) should be created by the vendor during NFV and a supporting NFVI (e.g. host OS, hypervisor or  CIS, SDN Controllers) software compilation that can be validated with a corresponding checksum created during any testing and  validation process operated by the operator or a third party.  (7) TEE is an important enabler for that goal. Tamper-proofing techniques enable the preservation of software integrity by causing an altered  software to fail.  (8) The concept of trusted execution and the associated technologies (e.g. Intel SGX enclave) that make certain that even a malicious host  OS or operator cannot tamper or inspect any managed payload memory space.  [1], [63]  BP-T11  Security segmentation  and isolation between  network functions  To prevent a VM or container from impacting other VMs, containers or hosts, it is a best practice to separate VM or container traffic and management  traffic. This will prevent attacks by VMs or containers tearing into the management infrastructure. It is also a good idea to separate the VLAN traffic  into groups and disable all other VLANs that are not in use. Likewise, VMs or containers of similar functionalities can be grouped into specific zones  and their traffic should be isolated. Each zone can be protected using access control policies and a dedicated firewall based on security level it  needs. One example of such zones is a demilitarised zone (DMZ). Due to differing security requirements, a separate virtual environment using  separate clusters should be setup for VNFs and MANO.  Physical and/or logical separation shall be applied to keep sensitive control plane sub-components within a VNF (e.g. key material or billing data)  away from lower security sub-functions or other general user plane traffic handling sub-functions.  Best practices include:  [1], [50], [75],  [78], [79],  [47], [25], [17]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  109  (1) Linux kernel security: in virtualised platforms, the kernel of the host systems is a highly important component that provides isolation  between the applications. The SELinux module, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), is implemented in the kernel and  provides robust isolation between the tenants when virtualisation technology is used over the host. Secure virtualisation (sVirt) is a new  form of SELinux, developed to integrate mandatory access control security with Linux based hypervisors. sVirt provides isolation between  VM processes and data files. Beyond these tools, other kernel hardening tools can be useful to secure the Linux kernel. A notable  example is hidepd, which can be used to prevent unauthorised users from seeing the process information of other users. Another example  is GRSecurity, which provides protection against attacks on corrupted memory.  (2) Best practices are to avoid co-hosting, on the same hardware, VNFs that have very different levels of sensitivity or very different levels of  vulnerability to influence by an attacker.  (3) The trust domains of network functions should be identified. Each trust domain should be managed separately. Security policies for each  trust domain should be managed independently.  (4) Delegated administrator roles must be used, with roles which could give a user or administrator the ability to inspect the memory of  functions only in exceptional circumstances.  (5) Confidentiality protection should be provided to protect information traveling between memory locations in a single or multiple logical  memory block.  BP-T12 Secure boot integrity  Using trusted platform module (TPM) as a hardware root of trust, the measurement of system sensitive components such as platform firmware,  BIOS, bootloader, OS kernel, and other system components can be securely stored and verified. The platform measurement can only be taken when  the system is reset or rebooted; there is no way to write the new platform measurement in TPM during the system run-time. The validation of the  platform measurements can be performed by TPM’s launch control policy (LCP) or through the remote attestation server.  [50], [79], [25]  BP-T13 Data protection and  privacy  For the RAN operator, theft of sensitive or private data may result in churn, fines and loss of business due to compromised business reputation or  regulatory violation. The operator is responsible for ensuring that data in transit, at rest and in use are protected according to the requirements of the  regulatory agency and use case using the following best industry practices:  Data at rest  Sensitive information of a VNF shall be protected during its lifecycle process to avoid leakage of the information to other VNFs reusing the storage  resource.  Data should be backed up, while sensitive data, such as security logs, should be encrypted before storage in the persistent volume. Access control  and monitoring data access and usage are other essential functions for protecting data. A privacy impact assessment (PIA) for personally identifiable  information (PII) should be performed to identify and mitigate privacy risks to data assets.  When VNF moves from one host to another or when VNF is terminated, the system should ensure that resources, privacy sensitive data, and/or keys  are fully cleared.  Security policy which restricts where certain types of data can reside should be defined and implemented by CSPs.  Data in transit  Data must be encrypted, and its integrity protected, when it flows between the different parts of the VNFs and, externally, between NFV nodes to  defend against internal and external attacks. 3GPP 33.501 stipulates mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. In addition, the following security  protocols among others should be used:  • air interface: 5G provides encryption and integrity protection of control signalling and encryption and optional integrity of user data;  • control plane: DTLS 1.2;  • management plane: Mutual TLS using version 1.2 and above.  [47], [25],  [113]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  110  Data-in-use  Depending on the existing protection of the cloud infrastructure, additional protection of data in use could be needed. For instance, the use of trusted  execution environments (TEE) has the potential to increase the security of crypto and key-management operations and protect data in use.  BP-T14 Encrypting VNF  volume/swap areas  The best practice to secure the VNF volumes is by encrypting them and storing the cryptographic keys at safe locations. TPM or HSM modules can  be used to securely store these keys. In addition, the hypervisor or CIS should be configured to securely wipe out the virtual volume disks in the  event a VNF is crashed or intentionally destroyed to prevent it from unauthorised access. VM or container swapping is a memory management  technique used to move memory segments from the main memory to disk, which is used as a secondary memory in order to increase system  performance in case the system runs out of memory. These transferred memory segments can contain sensitive information such as passwords and  certificates. They can be stored on the disk and remain persistent even after system reboot. This enables an attack scenario whereby a VM or  container swap is copied and investigated to retrieve any useful information. One way to avoid this kind of attack is to encrypt VM or container swap  areas. Linux based tools such as dm-crypt can be used for this purpose.  [50], [25],  [133]  BP-T15 Trusted computing  technologies  To provide a trusted hardware platform, the hardware (blade servers) should support Intel TXT, SGX, AMD SEV or ARM Trustzone silicon-based  security functionality implemented with a TPM that stores measurements of the entire hypervisor or CIS stack and boot process.  This measure should be applied to:  • blade clusters supporting VNF that support security critical functions; for example, lawful interception, customer access credential (HSS),  security key management (AuC) or that have external traffic interfaces directly accessed by third parties or customers (Internet, GRX);  • all other MANO and VNF blade clusters to improve base platform security and reduce the complexity of affinity rules and hardware cluster of  differing security trust levels.  A mechanism should be in place to identify any attempt to physically remove the TPM from a system board. If physical tampering has been identified  the blade server should be considered compromised and no longer be used to support VNFs. For example, on HP blades any attempt to remove an  installed TPM from the system board breaks or disfigures the TPM security rivet.  [25]  BP-T16 Hardware security  If hardware is provided by a third party cloud provider, then a dedicated cluster supporting only the operator’s VNFs should be provided to ensure  physical, not logical, segregation from other tenants.  It is also recommended that separate dedicated hardware is used to provide independent NFV management (MANO) and service clusters (NFV). In  addition, separated clusters should be used to provide MANO and NFVI.  The use of HW secure enclave technologies, such as AMD SEV and Intel TDX provide stronger tenant isolation from the cloud provider. The general  commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware may have varying levels of security functionality, such as hardware rooted secure storage, unique  hardware identities, secure boot with software integrity check, and trusted execution environment (TEE), built-in depending on the manufacturer.  TEE refers to a technique of storing or running code in a protected memory area where no other applications or the host have access. An example is  secure enclaves that can be used as a hardware root-of-trust for secure storage of secrets and running sensitive code. A HSM or TPM can be used  to provide hardware rooted protection of keys.  [113]  BP-T17 Centralised log  auditing  All the NFV, SDN and MANO elements should submit security events (e.g. authentication, authorisation and accounting, login attempts,  administration functions and configurations) to a centralised platform, which shall monitor and analyse in real time the messages for possible  attempts at intrusion. It is also recommended that all the elements make use of the same trust time synchronising source (e.g. NTP server) to  support accurate correlation of events across the network.  It is also recommended that all audit logs are transferred to a log management platform outside the NFV to maintain their integrity and remove the  risk of tampering.  [79], [80], [25]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  111  BP-T18  Use and ownership of  ‘root’ administration  credentials  It is recommended that:  • each hypervisor or CIS has a single ‘root’ admin account that is used for local administration and to connect the host to VIM;  • to avoid sharing this common ‘root’ account, across the whole NFVI, at least one local named user account be created and assigned full admin  privileges, and this account should be the primary account for operating the hypervisor or CIS;  • strong access controls, account privileges and security logging are enabled;  • the hypervisor or CIS is configured to support multiple administration roles, and as a minimum there must be an admin role (highest privilege)  and a separate operational role with minimal privileges to complete normal operational support;  • delegated administrator roles be used, with the global administrator role only being used in exceptional cases, e.g. to add permissions for other  high-level administrators;  • all administration login attempts and critical operations must be logged and audited.  [79], [6], [47],  [25]  BP-T19 VNF protection  Protection of VNFs  It should be possible to deploy a VNF to a host that provides specific security resources (e.g. HMEE, secure compute, secure memory) in order to  bind a VNF to a specific host or group of hosts.  Binding should be verified by secure hardware backed attestation of the health and security of the host. Controls should be verified and enforced at  boot time and each time a function is migrated.  The system should manage (e.g. assign or log bindings) key storage and confidential data in a manner that provides protection against data  compromise.  Sensitive data should only be decrypted or handled in an unencrypted format in VNFs on trusted and well-known hosts.  It must be possible to control whether untrusted or less trusted VNFs are allowed to run on the same host as VNFs in a higher trust domain.  It must be possible to further restrict VNFs on a single host depending on whether they handle decrypted sensitive data.  The system should prevent and detect unauthorised or unintended data manipulation and leakage (e.g. modification of VNF images, instantiating  parallel VM(s) or container(s) on the same physical CPU).  Securing internal VNF communication  Where a NFV is composed on multiple VNFs the vendor should demonstrate how it protects the internal communication of its NFV, as it transits  between VMs or containers.  Protection of stored data  NFV vendors should ensure that any security critical (including LI), customer privacy or confidentiality related information is stored securely on any  shared or local storage (e.g. SAN, SSD).  Vendors should be able to clearly state the security mechanisms used to protect this data using industry standard best practice (e.g. encryption).  Protection of LI data and functionality  NFV vendors should demonstrate how they are protecting LI functionality to ensure that it cannot be compromised or weakened by running their VNF  in the NFV environment.  It is recommended that vendors are asked to clearly state how they are compliant in protecting sensitive LI data and interfaces and to specify  whether there are any specific deployment requirements to allow their VNF to operate in a multi-vendor virtualised environment and ensure that the  integrity of their security mechanisms is maintained.  [6], [47], [25],  [123], [17]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  112  BP-T20  Local or removable  blade storage – SAN  protection  Local storage protection  If local blade storage is supported, then it should not store sensitive information such that its theft or removal would enable an attacker to gain a copy  of the stored data.  Mutual authentication between VMs or containers and SAN  Mutual authentication should be implemented between each VM or container and its associated SAN storage using CHAP (e.g. DH-CHAP, FCPAP).  SAN data protection in transit  The operator should consider protecting sensitive data in transit between NFV and SAN using encapsulated security payload (ESP), as specified by  the fibre channel protocol (FC-SP) or equivalent.  SAN physical blade interface  It is recommended that a separate physical interface module is used on each blade or rack mounted server for connectivity to the SAN. It is not  recommended for any SAN connectivity to share common IP interface with other operational traffic.  SAN storage protection  The SAN storage shall protect against tampering and any ability to create unauthorised local copies of any of the stored data.  In the event of tampering or unauthorised copying, an alarm and log event should be generated recording what data has been copied and which user  initiated the action.  Note: it is expected that the SAN security (including backup management) will be addressed through existing IT security controls for the operation,  access, backup and availability of the SAN.  [6], [47], [25],  [114]  BP-T21 Network security  Topology hiding  All internal interfaces between VNF elements, supporting MANO platforms and IT elements (mediation, provisioning) that are not required to publicly  communicate outside the operators network, should use private IP addresses.  It is recommended that all external interfaces are NAT through a firewalling function to provide additional protection of the identity of the elements  within the VNFI.  VNF network security profile  Each VNF supporting VNFC functions should have a predefined network security profile describing its requirements for vNICs, ports, port group,  VLANs and the requirement for internal VXLAN connections.  The security profile shall also define the vNIC firewall rules related to protocols (port numbers) that need to be supported on each VLAN or VXLAN  connection. It is expected that vendors will provide a security profile for their applications, which will have to be aligned with the operators’ zoning  guidelines.  Note: there should never be a requirement for all ports to be open, particularly on external standard based interfaces (e.g. GTP).  Deploy NFVs with separate dedicated interfaces  Ideally, separate physical interfaces should be implemented to maintain different traffic segregation in line with security zoning and X.805 principles.  However, if this is not supported by a vendor then a separate logical interface and VLAN must be used to maintain security zoning.  Production and O&M traffic separation  O&M interfaces should not share the same physical NIC, vNIC, distributed port group (DPG) or port group with other production traffic types (e.g.  BSS, User Plane or Signalling).  [6], [47], [25]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  113  Connectivity from management to production cluster  Any connectivity between the operation and management (MANO) cluster and the production cluster should pass through a firewall. If a virtual  firewall is implemented, it should be implemented within the management cluster.  Note: it is expected that MANO systems would not share the same hypervisor or CIS environment as production NFV elements.  Network resource pools  To prevent a VM or container causing a DoS by monopolising system and network resources, it is recommended that network resource pools should  be configured.  Internal virtual switching control  The internal hypervisor or CIS controlled virtual IP network (vSwitch/VDS) should be controlled to ensure a policy of positive enabling and must not  support default connectivity or ‘any to any’ functionality.  Virtual network monitoring  In some deployments, internal network monitoring functions can be installed on the virtualisation layer. If these are installed, the functions must be  restricted to the administrator only and should not provide a mechanism for compromising the security of the hypervisor or CIS or other VMs or  containers.  Additionally, any operation of this type of monitoring functionality should generate an alarm to the VIM and be recorded in the audit logs.  VLAN and VXLAN zoning  A comprehensive set of common VLAN and VXLANs must be created across each NFVi to ensure traffic separation and security zoning  requirements.  Note: VLAN and VXLAN zoning should ensure that clear vendor separation is maintained.  Only VLAN and VXLANs necessary to support VNFs hosted on a cluster should be configured on the ‘leaf’ and ‘spine’ switching layers. The VLAN IP  infrastructure should follow existing segmentation and zoning rules with the use of firewalls or other security controls to provide protection between  zones.  Existing hardware firewall appliances can continue to be used to provide boundary protection when connecting to untrusted or semi-trusted networks  (e.g. internet or GRX). However, it is recognised that virtualised security appliances may be used in the future.  Use of VPNs  Where possible, VPNs should be created between VNFs and both internal and external non-VNF environments, e.g. interconnectivity between P-GW  and Mediation for EDR transfer or HLR/HSS provisioning interfaces with the BSS Provisioning platform.  Dedicated network infrastructure  If a third party XaaS provider is being used then it is recommended that dedicated local ‘leaf’ switching infrastructure supporting only the operator  VNFs is provided to ensure segregation from other tenants.  Additionally, it is also recommended that dedicated spine switches be provided also but this may not always be practical.  Protect all OAM traffic  Link security can be provided through the use of native traffic encryption such as HTTPS, SFTP, SMNP v3 or using TLS or IPsec tunnelling  protocols.  Note: it is recommended this control should be applied in addition to any security protection provided if, for example, OAM traffic is carried over an  IPsec tunnel.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  114  BP-T22 SDN security  management  The following controls apply if using a message bus technology for communication between SDN elements. However, it is expected this technology  will be widely used in 5G architectures.  • A strong mechanism to authenticate the integrity of messages must be deployed between the ‘publisher’ and ‘producer’ over the message  bus.  No messages should be accepted or processed by the message broker or ‘consumer’ systems from unknown, ‘fake’ or unauthenticated  users.  It is recommended to that communications be secured using TLS (TLS 1.2 and above) security or certificates where supported (e.g.  Kafka),.  • The message bus should be monitored for any unauthenticated messages or ‘fake’ or default usernames and a security alarm raised for  investigation.  • If an SDN is deployed to support the NFVi then it is recommended that security functionality is deployed that identifies potential attacks on  any SDN elements. Any security functionality should provide automated alarms and the ability to change the network or element  configuration to mitigate the attack.  For example:  o DoS attacks on SDN elements (specifically, NEs and SDN Controllers);  o Access control failures or attempts to use functions or services where the user does not have the correct privileges.  • A high availability architecture should be implemented for key SDN components (e.g. SDN Controllers) to ensure operational service is  maintained. The design should include primary and secondary IP links with, where possible, diverse routing to allow for single point of  network failure.  • It is recommended, in order to maintain operational integrity, that any changes to network, service and virtual environments are restricted  to the orchestrator. Therefore, the SDN Controller and the VNFM and VIM should have additional controls applied to them to restrict such  access for normal operation. Restricting the SDN Controller and the VNFM and VIM will prevent the application of rules and changes that  may break policy and rules during deployment of service templates.  • For operational emergencies a high-level administration account should be created. However such an account must not be available to  support engineers or used during normal operations. The credentials should be stored safely and be maintained by operations  management. Ideally, these should be stored in a safe physical location such as a safe with monitored and recorded access.  • The orchestration layer and SDN must be architected so that SDN networks and NFV environments are not operationally dependent on  the orchestration or MANO layer to maintain operating services under circumstances that may render the orchestration platform  unavailable.  [6], [97], [121]  BP-T23 MANO access control  and management  The MANO components should support a high-level of role granularity to ensure appropriate levels of privilege can be assigned to all users to protect  key processes and the integrity of data.  Ideally, all OAM access should be controlled through a centralised single sign-on or PAM solution with all access (success and failure) recorded in  the audit log mechanism. Multi-factor authentication should be used to log into administrator accounts.  All administration and management should only be permitted from known, attested devices and multi-factor authentication should be enforced.  In ETSI GS NFV-SEC 022, ETSI defines an access token mechanism for the authorisation of access for NFV-MANO APIs and the associated  procedure for the verification of the access token. One solution defined to handle these authorisations for API request and notification is the use of  OAuth 2.0 protocol as defined by IETF RFC 6749100. The confidentiality and data integrity of all messages must be ensured, e.g. by using a  transport-layer mechanism, such as TLS (TLS 1.2 and above), on each interface. The authorisation server database used to authenticate the user  [6], [47],  [123], [134],  [135]  100 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  115  and store associated user credentials, access tokens and refresh tokens must be stored in a tamper resistant location (e.g. HSM). See ETSI GS  NFV-SOL 013 and ETSI GS NFV-SEC 022 for technical details.  BP-T24 VIM connectivity to  virtualisation layer  The connectivity between the VIM and the virtualisation layer should support a secure access protocol (e.g. IPSec, TLS) to protect against the  eavesdropping of password information. It is also recommended that the secure access should support mutual authentication before allowing any  O&M connectivity.  Additionally, it is advised that any vendor defaults (e.g. self-signed certificates) be removed and replaced with operator generated certificates.  Each operator should develop a certificate policy in accordance with their regional and national requirements as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC  005.  [6], [25], [133]  BP-T25 Recovery and  reinstallation  Recovery mechanisms in NFV must ensure the following:  • The NFVI must be restored completely, with all configurations and settings adjusted correctly. This includes controller nodes pointing to  the right set of components, settings reloaded with correct parameters, and full inter-operability restored. Of particular importance is  restoring the interoperation between NFV, SDN, and MANO systems, in an automated way, without the need for human intervention to  reconfigure these systems to become functional again.  • VNFs must be fully restored. This includes reloading virtual machines, containers and network services and setting the last state in place  correctly.  • In the event of a suspected compromised of a hypervisor or CIS, or a VM or container it should be possible to overwrite a hypervisor or  CIS installation or individual VM or container with minimal need for platform re-configuration.  • Any reload mechanism should be securely controlled and managed remotely by the VIM, or locally using secure access through the LMT,  and also include verification of hardware integrity (e.g. boot disc, UEFI).  • When instantiating a new VM or container instance it is recommended that a different guest operating system ‘root’ administration  credentials or security keys (IPSec, TLS) should be used for each instance.  [49], [38],  [122]  BP-T26  Deploying  VMs/containers of  differing trust levels  The VIM should be configured to ensure that VMs or containers of differing trust levels are not deployed on the same physical host or blade and that  VMs or containers requiring a ‘hardware root of trust’ cannot be installed on a physical host or blade that does not fully support trusted boot (e.g.  Intel-TXT) and TPM.  For example, a VNF that requires a ‘trusted computing’ environment to support LI functions should only be installed on a cluster than can support this  level of security.  [6], [25], [123]  BP-T27 NFVO security  management  A mutual authentication mechanism should exist between the NFVO, VIM and EMS platforms to provide a level of trust and to ensure only the  authorised NFVO can make requests to the VIM and EMS platforms and vice versa.  The NFVO should provide internal workflow rules to prevent accidental changes to the NFVi and NFV services that could have an impact on service  delivery.  A mechanism should exist to provide configuration roll-back in the event of any unauthorised or accidental service changes.  The NFVO should create and maintain a comprehensive audit log of all service changes including the identity of the user making each change.  The NFVO should implement robust transaction management for any NFV management for supporting NFVi changes to ensure that the opportunity  for configuration integrity errors across the orchestration controlled elements and service inventory is eliminated.  Best practice for provisioning platform controls for configuration roll-back and failure alarming must be implemented.  [6], [38],  [122], [123]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  116  BP-T28 Trusted time source  The VNFs should synchronise with trusted time servers such as a GPS or an atomic clock. In 5G networks, high precision time synchronisation  within microseconds will be required. 5G will not only provide personal mobile service, but also massive machine type communications (MTC) and  services where latency and reliability are critical. These critical services require trusted and protected time sources.  ETSI GR NFV-SEC 016 (Draft specification - work in progress) is a study on how the location of sensitive VNFs (e.g. LI functions, VNFs handling  data with restrictions on the location where data protection is handled and network security functions) can be attested. The study considers using  trusted locstamp and timestamp information derived from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), such as Galileo. The study also considers  other binding solutions for physical location. The report outlines several solutions for timestamp-time synchronisation and distribution (e.g. White  Rabbit Network, IEEE® 1588-2019, based on trusted GNSS/ LEOs), for timestamp datacentre time protocol (DTP) and for locstamp (e.g. based on  binding a trusted hardware‘s ID with the location of a vertical hierarchy, indoor positioning such as RFID tagging and trusted GNSS positioning).  [47], [136]  BP-T29 Secure 3rd party  hosting environments  Third party hosting environments that support VNFs should meet 3GPP virtualisation security requirements to enable operators to meet legal or  regulatory requirements.  The system should be able to monitor the attestation of third party hosting environments.  [47]  BP-T30 Redundancy and  backup  Recovery  The system should be deployed in such a way as to provide isolation and redundancy to increase the resiliency and defence against a single point of  failure. MANO functions should include internal health checks to detect potential intrusion and take protective action.  There are a variety of ways operators should consider redundancy. Below are three ways the operator should be thinking about redundancy when it  comes to its recovery plan.  • Network redundancy: network redundancy is the process of adding additional instances of network devices and lines of communication to  help ensure network availability and decrease the risk of failure along the critical data path. Having redundancy by providing additional  pathways through your network via redundant routers or switches would ensure minimal downtime and complete continuity of NFV  services.  • Power redundancy: backup power supply (a generator, for instance) that specifically keeps critical NFV hardware running in colocation  facilities.  • Geographic redundancy: geographic redundancy is important for how sensitive data is backed up. Having a redundant backup in an  entirely different location will allow quicker recovery with little downtime.  • The recovery plan should already identify a fail-over location for the NFV system in the event that the current location is inoperable.  Backup  Backups is the process of creating and storing copies of NFV data to protect against data loss. A backup involves duplicating important data like VNF  code and data, configurations, cryptographic materials, network configurations, audit logs or anything that the NFV system needs to stay operational.  Regardless of the backup solution chosen, offsite backups are a must across all industries. Operators are required to store backups in a secure  location, preferably an off-site facility, such as an alternate or backup site.  Having both backups and redundancy contributes to the NFV system running smoothly. Backups make sure that if something is lost, corrupted or  stolen then a copy of the sensitive NFV data is available. Redundancy makes sure that if something fails, the NFV system is able to work regardless  of the problem.  [47]  BP-T31 Specific container  security controls  Appropriate restrictions on container placement and on the use of container caching should include:  • user handling containers relative to network management containers within a VNF;  • separation of containers belonging to different NFs on different physical servers;  [47]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  117  • special handling of containers implementing interfaces between different trust domains (intra-VNF and inter-VNF).  The virtualisation layer must provide capabilities to limit the impact on co-hosted containers caused by a rogue container escaping its isolation. One  of the commonly practiced security controls is to enforce strict resource limits on container usage, which helps in preventing resource starvation due  to an attack by a rogue container.  The virtualisation layer must enforce the principle of ‘least privilege’ which ensures that no containers run with a privilege higher than what is actually  required.  The VNF images shall not be packaged with embedded secrets such as passwords or credentials, or any other critical configuration data.  NIST SP 800-190101 and ANSSI102, Container security103, Redhat104 and others provide detailed best practices for the security of containers.  BP-T32 OSS/BSS protection  The contrasting attributes of the legacy and virtualised infrastructures should be considered from an overall management perspective. This will be  particularly important during the migration phase while both types of infrastructure are running in parallel. The OSS/BSS would, therefore, need to be  adapted for near-real time operation and be able to support a hybrid network across SDN/NFV and non-SDN, non-NFV domains.  OSS systems should be consistent with the ETSI NFV architectural framework [7] and support the Os-Ma interface between the traditional OSS/BSS  and the NFV management and orchestration (MANO) framework. OSS/BSS systems should delegate fine-grained management of the NFV  Infrastructure and the specific VNFs to the VIM and the VNFM, which in turn are orchestrated by the NFV orchestrator (NFVO). Thus, the OSS/BSS  will be responsible for the high level configuration of the infrastructure and network functions, but the NFV MANO framework will manage the  dynamic aspects of infrastructure and services105.  The integration with the SDN controller and applications will follow a similar approach. The OSS will manage the configuration of the SDN data  plane, configure and set policies for the SDN controller and control SLAs for SDN applications, but the dynamic control of the SDN forwarding plane  will be managed by the SDN controller and the SDN control to data-path interface (CDPI)106 107.  Operators moving to deploy virtualised network architectures based on SDN and NFV are likely to evolve the OSS/BSS systems in stages. Existing  operators have a significant installed base and it is unrealistic to replace all existing infrastructure. The new capability will be deployed first where it  brings the most value or where the legacy network requires upgrades anyway108.  [99], [100],  [101]  BP-T33 LI capabilities  General recommendations involve:  • Dialogue between governments and 5G stakeholders to define clear, modular and transparent LI;  • Efficient LI implementation through regulatory consistency, adoption of existing international technical standards (e.g. 3GPP, ETSI), and  centralised, multi-country LI solutions;  • LI law and regulation that is clear, transparent and judiciously implemented.  The following provides a brief checklist of security measures that 5G stakeholders should consider.  • Passwords and authentication: LI operations should be managed by the principle of least privilege (POLP), which limits each user to the  minimum access privileges needed to perform his or her job. Access controls for the users should use two-factor authentication.  • Encryption: all LI data should be transmitted, both within the network and on the external delivery interface, with strong encryption.

The system also monitors uptime and downtime on different  devices and provides visibility into broadband utilisation and link status.  • Dedicated solution: the LI solution should be dedicated to LI purposes only. Trying to leverage the LI device for commercial uses such as  traffic monitoring may expose the equipment to unauthorised use or operational risks.  • Potential breach reporting: any compromise or potential compromise of an LI must be reported to law enforcement.  • Testing: once the LI solution is installed, it must be tested. The communication features to be tested will vary depending on the type of  network (e.g. broadband, wireless, VoIP) and the communication features offered on the given network.  • Periodic testing: communication networks evolve over time. A network change may disable or impair the workings of the LI solution. For  this reason the network operator should schedule periodic testing of the solution.  • Software maintenance: like most forms of software, an LI solution requires maintenance. Any LI licensing agreement should arrange for  patches, updates and upgrades as needed. Specifically, all security patches and updates for all LI platforms must be installed and kept  current.  • Penetration testing: in a penetration test, an external entity searches for cyber vulnerabilities in the LI solution and tries to ‘hack’ into it.  • Security policy: the LI security policy should be included in the operator’s written network security policy, which should implement industry  standards such as ISO 27001, NIST SP 800 series, etc.  BP-T34 User plane security  Additional security controls are needed on the user plane as follows:  • to protect NFV components from attacks sourced from the public internet and cloud;  • to protect the network from attacks sourced from internally attached NFV components;  • to protect the NFVI from attacks sourced from internally attached components and the internet.  Inline detection and mitigation functions in the network can be used at the internet edge to prevent volumetric DDoS attacks from the internet,  including TCP SYN floods, UDP floods, and DNS floods, which can attack the availability of the network or service.  Threat detection or prevention and response using IDS/IPS should also be used to effectively defend against or prevent malware and ransomware  infections on NFVI and network functions.  [113]  BP-T35 MEC security  To address the issue of inadequate isolation, MEC can include network segmentation, resource separation, data segregation, software and network  attestation, etc.  The hardening of MEC needs to ensure that all the default configurations (including OS software, firmware, and applications) are appropriately set  and, further, that these settings can be verified against a reference. Countermeasures such as the filtering of packets heading for the target site  under attack, restriction of the communication port used for DoS/DDoS attacks, and the reduction or suspension of the operations of target  telecommunications facilities need to be considered.  A regular security testing programme or certification of MEC components is required as part of a secure value chain.  Control measures to ensure the security of physically isolated areas of MEC components include earthquake-proofing, automatic fire control  equipment, monitoring by a remote office to detect facility failures, physically secure perimeters, supporting automatic alert function, etc. The physical  [126]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  119  security may not be fully guaranteed in a MEC environment and critical MEC components (e.g. security end points and crypto functions) need to be  implemented in HMEEs (hardware mediated execution environments) e.g. Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone.  SBI (service-based interface) of MEC components should provide adequate protection for access and data in transit. The confidentiality and data  integrity of all messages should be ensured by using TLS on each interface. Appropriate security controls are required for protecting sensitive data  during storage, processing and transfer by MEC applications. The MEC platform should authenticate all MEC application instances and only provide  them with the information for which the application is authorised. OAuth 2.0 based on X.509 client certificates are used for authorisation of access to  RESTful MEC service APIs as defined by ETSI ISG MEC. In the case of service-producing applications defined by third parties, other mechanisms  such as standalone use of JWT (JSON web token) can be used to secure related APIs.  In addition, since MEC is based on virtualised infrastructure, it needs to include real-time security management based on NFV specifications (see  ETSI GS NFV-SEC 013 [38]). Especially when deploying MEC in NFV environments, MEC should be considered as part of a whole system real-time  security monitoring and management strategy. Appropriate mechanisms for the collection and processing of security events should be in place,  where the log functions should upload log files securely to a central location or to an external system. Secure transport protocols should be used.  Access to the security event log should be controlled to allow only privileged users to have access to the log files. Critical event logs must be  enhanced with mechanisms to enable independent third parties to audit them, preserving their arrow of time and their links to the identities of the  elements involved. As part of regulatory issues, the European regulation (NIS-Directive) expects isolation of physical and logical components of  critical services from services with low criticality. The MEC system needs to support regulatory requirements for lawful interception and retained data  based on ETSI and 3GPP standards (e.g. in ETSI TS 101 331109, ETSI TS 102 656110 and 3GPP TS 33.126111).  BP-P1 Zero trust  Treat 5G infrastructure as an untrusted environment and explicitly authenticate and authorise interactions between all assets in all areas - both inside  and outside the network - prior to allowing access. Secure and limit interactions to the minimum necessary, and continuously monitor asset security  posture, adjusting access rights accordingly.  Zero trust represents an overarching access security model that deliberately avoids assuming implicit trust between elements in a network. This is  particularly important in 5G as various external stakeholders may need to access infrastructure components or services for management,  maintenance or monitoring purposes. For example, enterprise users may need to select access to 5G slice management services. Third party  vendors may need access to select components for configuration or troubleshooting. Properly implemented, zero trust can provide appropriate  stakeholder access while securing 5G services against misuse.  Strong digital identities with digital signing from a certificate authority (CA) establishes a root of trust for VNFs while mutual authentication using  transport layer security (TLS) or datagram TLS (DTLS) with public-key infrastructure and X.509 (PKIX) and strong cipher suites ensures trust  between network functions, between the network and NFV, and between application clients and server. (D)TLS with X.509 digital certificates provide  automation and security to ensure that only trusted devices are permitted access to a trusted network and application. 5G also provides strong  mutual authentication using 5G-AKA, EAP-AKA and EAP-TLS.  A zero trust architecture includes automated security configuration for control policies over user access with visibility, monitoring and logging for  alerting and auditing. Multifactor authentication (MFA), an important component of zero trust, should be used to ensure secure human access to  management interfaces and applications in the 5G NFV. NFV components should be assumed to be untrusted and be able to establish trust through  the process of certificate based mutual authentication.  Any of the NFV entities or components should have a certificate and an associated and protected private key to execute cryptographic security  functions with other terminating entities as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC.  [61], [27],  [113], [131],  [133]  BP-P2  Security assessment  of new or changes to  existing VNF service  templates  New or modified VNF service templates should be validated through proper risk assessment by a security professional. This process ensures that  the template complies with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. It also ensures that the template adheres to specific security policies on  interface security, security affinity/anti-affinity rules, NFV network zoning and application security.

According to the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, patch development and distribution—the process  whereby a software developer creates a fix for a vulnerability and distributes it to users—is key to eliminating the risk that a given vulnerability can  pose. The report recommends, among other things, that developers and manufacturers of software and hardware components establish a publicly  accessible process for reporting vulnerabilities, retain records documenting when a vulnerability was made known or discovered by the company,  and maintain a vulnerability disclosure and patching policy for their products. In addition, the report recommends that the US government study the  potential effectiveness of directing NIST to develop guidance or expectations about how quickly patches should be implemented once released.  [60], [25],  [123]  BP-P4 Security testing  assurance  Regular penetration and vulnerability testing should be performed across the NFVI and MANO production environment to identify any known  vulnerabilities or compromise of the network zoning rules.  It is recommended that testing should be carried out if new infrastructure or IP based interconnect elements have been deployed or as a minimum on  an annual basis.  Security assurance testing of a VNF needs to be performed using a standardised NFVI environment used to test all VNFs. When testing the security  assurance of a VNF, the scope of testing should be clarified, including defining the pre-conditions of the virtualised test environment or platform and  defining assumptions made in the process. Where possible, recreate these assumptions in the product deployment, e.g. close ports which do not  need to be open.  Both positive and common vulnerability testing (e.g. negative testing) should be carried out against VNFs and the underlying virtualisation and  hardware layers. This is required to mitigate the increased attack surface which was partly addressed by physical security assurance protections in  physical networks.  VNFs should be checked regularly to see if they are using out-of-date or insecure versions of a library and these libraries should be updated if and  when possible. This is required to mitigate the increased attack surface which was partly addressed by physical security assurance protections in  physical networks.  It is recommended to use certified components (e.g. hypervisors, OSs, TEE, TPM, etc.) according to a recognised scheme such as Common Criteria.  Potential solutions to the above requirements include, among others, the NESAS 3GPP(SCAS)/GSMA and ENISA EU certifications schemes  (Currently, three cybersecurity certification schemes are under development by ENISA. One scheme, covering ICT products and called EUCC, is  almost ready. It is based on an existing international scheme called Common Criteria. There is a second scheme covering cloud services (this is the  EUCS scheme) and a third one on 5G networks (EU5G)).  [6], [47], [25],  [139]  BP-P5 Incident management  Implement defensive security controls and continuous monitoring backed by machine learning capabilities and establish incident response  operations to detect and mitigate threats. Key capabilities include the following.  - Vulnerability management: adopt internationally-accepted standards and best practices on the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities and  handling to effectively identify, mitigate, and remediate security vulnerabilities (e.g. software patching) in a timely manner.  - Denial-of-service defence systems: monitor network traffic to detect and mitigate network flooding attacks.  - Intrusion detection and prevention systems: monitor network traffic to detect and mitigate unauthorised access or attempts to exploit system  vulnerabilities.  - Malicious traffic filtering systems: monitor network traffic to block malicious or unwanted traffic such as spam or attempts to interact with  malicious domains and websites.  - Anti-malware systems: monitor network traffic and endpoint and server devices to detect and block malware files or malware execution.  - Security operations centre: establish a centralised security monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence organisation responsible for  rapidly detecting and mitigating security breaches. Adopt integrated cybersecurity capabilities and automation tools that simplify and streamline  security operations.  [27]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  121  BP-P6 Secure update  management  The process must consider the ability to update the cryptographic algorithms and to adapt to upcoming 5G security challenges.  Updates must be applied in a timely manner to protect against hardware or software bugs and security flaws, including those which are newly found.  [50], [47]  BP-P7 Restrictions on  installing applications  It should not be possible to install a VNF application into the operational NFV environment without validation and approval by the operator.  Note: this can be a manual control process but it is expected that additional technical security controls will be adopted that allow only signed code to  be installed in the NFV infrastructure.  [1], [50], [6],  [47], [25]  BP-P8 Defence-in-depth  Operators need to use all the layers of security (defence-in-depth) to protect the NFV platforms including firewalls, access control lists, IP tables, rate  limiting, closing all unnecessary ports, disabling all unnecessary services (for example, TLS and remote access service may not be needed all the  time, so therefore it would be a good idea to enable these services only when needed), using strong confidential integrity algorithms, and so forth.  [50], [61]  BP-P9 Strong password  policy  A strong complex password should be configured for each hypervisor or CIS ‘root’ account and secured in a safe location with physical and  procedural controls on its access and use. It is recommended that the ‘root’ account is only used in exceptional operational circumstances by the  hypervisor or CIS administrator and that separate user accounts are configured with less privilege for day-to-day operational management.  Note: in the virtual environment hypervisor or CIS ‘root’ password has a greater significance as it controls multiple VMs or containers and provides  access to security sensitive information.  [50], [6], [123]  BP-P10 Secure supply chain  Trustworthy equipment (all supply chain), resilient system and verification must all be based on standards. Devising the required standards must be  a collaborative effort between private (industry, SME, and research) and public (policy makers, regulators) parties, as no single vendor, operator or  government can do it alone.  Operators should implement effective supply-chain and procurement controls to ensure the services they operate and provide comply with legal  requirements and manage supply-chain threats. Processes should be in place to identify, prioritise and assess suppliers and partners of critical  systems, components and services using a supply chain risk assessment process.  Zero trust principles should be implemented to identify supply chain weaknesses across product creation, manufacturing, testing, and delivery — without the need for disruptions that ultimately can halt operations.  Cybersecurity audits and certifications should be conducted by an independent and accredited body against a defined set of criteria, standards, and  the issuing of a certificate indicating conformance. Globally, there are two international arrangements relevant to assuring 5G product security. The  Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS), developed jointly by GSMA and 3GPP, covers security assessments of 5G vendor  development and product lifecycle processes and security evaluations of network products. Secondly, 5G products can also be certified under the  Common Criteria scheme.  Through collaboration, a shared responsibility model, zero trust principles, and security assurance, supply chains will strengthen as security  improves.  [60], [138],  [139]  BP-P11  Resources inventory  management system  and database  Hardware inventory  It is expected a hardware (blade) for hypervisor or CIS and bare metal installation for inventory shall exist to support operational management.  However, in addition, to providing the ability to complete security investigations and meet possible local regulatory or legal requirements, it is  recommended that the inventory stores:  1. the location of each blade server (e.g. country, datacentre, rack, shelf);  2. mapping VNF to hypervisor or CIS and blade server showing the current and historic records;  3. information as to whether any native installations are sharing the same blade server chassis, associated resources and network infrastructure.  Software inventory  [6], [123]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  122  A mechanism should exist to identify all VNFCs running in each VM or container within each hypervisor or CIS. It should also be possible to identify  which hardware, datacentre, location and country is being used and the assigned IP addresses and types of communication flows, routing tables and  effective security policies and filtering rules are in place. In addition, automatic validation should be completed against the VIM and EMS platforms to  ensure only authorised VNFC applications are running and installed.  Open source inventory  Organisations must set up accurate inventories of open-source software dependencies used by their various applications, or a process to receive  and manage notifications concerning discovered vulnerabilities or available patches from the community supporting the open-source.  Data integrity should be maintained between the NFVi and SDN controller layers and the resource inventory through a robust mechanism  implemented during deployment.  Such mechanism must have the capability to check the SDN and NFV configuration against the one stored on the resource inventory. It must also  have the capability to validate the security policies to ensure they are still being applied correctly, e.g. verifying firewall rules on the orchestration  interface or check location of any VNF.  A detection or audit mechanism must be implemented to identify where a workflow has been initiated requesting changes to the NFV or SDN  environment but where no acknowledgement has been received on its success or failure. Upon detection of such changes an alarm must be raised  so the operational team can investigate the incident.  BP-P12 Apply hardening  policies  For instance, the hypervisor or CIS should be hardened to allow only the minimum services and processes necessary to operate VMs or containers,  and all other services should be removed by default. As a minimum, the following configuration changes must be made among others:  • remove all unused features;  • when a VM or container is deleted the virtual disk should be zeroed to prevent an attacker reconstructing the contents of the VM or  container disk;  • disable the ability to connect external devices to VMs or containers (e.g. CD, serial and parallel ports);  • make sure a VM does not have the ability to run with the full OS privilege level and can only operate at guest level; this can be controlled  using Intel VT-x and AMD-V extensions;  • make sure each VM or container has a predefined set of restricted resources to ensure one VM or container cannot impact the resources  and performance of another in the same hypervisor or CIS;  • disable the ability of a VM to initiate ‘disk shrinking’;  • enable persistent disk mode;  • restrict the visibility of one VM or container to detect another VM or container existing on the same host;  • use zoning and LUN masking to segregate SAN activity with each VM having unique authentication credentials;  • remove direct access to the O&M functionality of the hypervisor or CIS for management only through a secure connection from the VIM;  however, this may not always be operationally feasible, so the hypervisor or CIS installation should limit access to the hypervisor or CIS  ‘root’ operating system to either:  o a dedicated O&M interface supporting a secure protocol (e.g. TLS) with only an IP address,  o ACL restriction on which domain can connect successfully;  • only allow ‘root’ access from the local terminal (LMP);  • where a hardware manufacturer provided monitoring tools that are implemented on the hypervisor or CIS or they utilise embedded  support for industry standard protocols such as Common Information Model (CIM), these functions must be installed and operated on the  hypervisor or CIS with limited privileges.  [37], [79],  [81], [82],  [125]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  123  BP-P13 Multi-vendor  segregation and trust  Segregation  Multi-vendor segregation is necessary to ensure each vendor can only manage or impact the resources related to their own VM or container across  the NFVI architecture.  Ideally, different vendors should not share the same VM or container.  Note: this can be achieved by following VMware guidelines112 for implementing secure multi-tenancy.  Trust  Select VNF vendors that make their vulnerabilities public so their customers can take appropriate actions and mitigations as quickly as possible.  There is no security in obscurity.  [124]  BP-P14 Security by design  The security-by-design concept should be used to address the protection of NFV resources and components at design time through the integration of  security mechanisms. This should concern the hardware layer, the virtualisation layer, MANO and VNFs.  Use secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) principles to avoid vulnerabilities and thus contribute to developing NFV software applications  and services in a secure manner.  Promote the use of DevSecOps113 methodology. The DevSecOps process aims at merging the security discipline within DevOps, thus considering  security in every stage of the development process. By having security and development teams working together early in the development lifecycle,  security naturally finds itself in the product by design.  [49], [88]  BP-P15 Lifecycle  management  Secure software development principles for VNFs incorporate the following industry best practices:  • validating the removal of unused software modules and execution paths;  • validating the disabling of unused protocols and the closure of unused ports;Run VM or container image and software package scanning  to find known vulnerabilities and fix them before release;  • using container-specific host OSs to reduce risk by limiting the attack surface, as recommended in ENISA 5G threat landscape114, the  ENISA security aspects of virtualisation115, NIST SP 800-190116, NIST guidance117, and others;  • enforcing Centre for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks118 for K8S, docker, and Linux to establish a hardened baseline;  • ensuring that the software supplier practices proper due diligence when using commercial third-party and open-source software in their  projects119;  • validating application performance on the hardened infrastructure.  [6], [113]  BP-P16  Software bill of  materials (SBOM)  A SBOM is a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various open source and commercial software components,  libraries and modules used in building software. Complex systems such as the 5G NFV might include hundreds or even thousands of software  components that software development and cybersecurity teams must track through all stages of the lifecycle.

The minimum elements an SBOM NTIA describes are organised into these three categories:  • data fields,  • automation support,  • practices and processes.  BP-O1  Secure physical  environment and  geographical location  A datacentre site supporting NFVi and MANO elements should be operated and controlled by the operator and, ideally, not be outsourced using a  third party IaaS supplier.  While not recommended, if the operator chooses to use a third party operated datacentre then additional security controls are necessary to ensure  the third party complies with the operator’s physical and outsourcing security controls.  The geographical location of any hardware supporting the NFV must comply with each operators local regulatory and legal requirements for  operating a telecoms network or handling sensitive data for customers or LI.  Anti-affinity rules should be applied to protect against possible infringement.  Privacy sensitive information of a VNF must be protected from being leaked out of its legal jurisdiction.  The system should manage the physical location of the VNFs and sub-components and SDN routing to provide attestation that the VNFCs provide a  commensurate level of security to match the requirements of the service or to meet legal or regulatory requirements.  [6], [47], [25],  [123]  BP-O2 Training and  awareness  Information sharing between different 5G actors: all 5G stakeholders, including operators, suppliers, etc. should work together to enhance the  security of 5G.  5G stakeholders should participate in international security events and working groups formed to enable discussion, cooperation and intelligence  sharing to improve security awareness.  Adopt a comprehensive approach to security training and awareness among the employees, including employees on all levels. Security training  should cover 5G relevant threats and be tailored to the employees' roles and responsibilities.  Ensure that security trainings are continuous, regular and frequently updated. Training programmes should be updated after new important threats  are disclosed and should be adjusted according to the lessons learned from ongoing incident handling and recovery activities.  [107]  BP-O3 Trust model  Foster security-related information sharing between different 5G stakeholders while protecting intellectual property. Suppliers and service providers  should provide evidence about the implementation of their cybersecurity management system to operators. For transparency purposes, OEMs  should consider providing similar evidence to their suppliers and service providers as well.  Define the relevant cybersecurity aspects of the partnerships along the supply chain and develop security requirements and procurement guidelines  between 5G stakeholders. To prevent security risks and threats that may stem from outsourced services or components or systems provided by third  party suppliers, operators should define procurement guidelines as well as security requirements to be applied to the suppliers to their third parties. A  security SLA may also be established between the operator and its supplier to define the security level that the supplier should meet.  [108]  BP-O4 SLAs establishment  SLAs between 5G stakeholders should consider the security aspects to identify mitigation strategies and how to implement actions in response to  those responsible for the security assessment of the 5G NFV.  The SLAs for security management and maintenance can include plans to mitigate known threats and respond to future threats.  Addressing security in the SLA promotes transparency, facilitates communication between the stakeholders involved, including their internal entities  (e.g. teams for security management and monitoring) and establishes consensus practices to solidify the overall 5G system security.

H.1 OSM  Open-Source MANO (OSM) is an ETSI-hosted open-source community delivering a production- quality MANO stack for NFV, capable of consuming openly published information models,  available to everyone, suitable for all VNFs, operationally significant and VIM-independent.  OSM is aligned to NFV ISG information models while providing first-hand feedback based on its  implementation experience120 121.  OSM Release EIGHT brings several improvements over previous releases. It allows the  flexibility of cloud-native applications to be combined within the same network service with the  predictability of traditional virtual and physical network functions (VNFs and PNFs) and all the  required advanced networking required to build complex E2E telecom services. OSM Release  EIGHT is at the forefront of Edge and 5G operations technology, deploying and operating  containerised network functions on Kubernetes with a complete lifecycle management, and  automated integration.  In addition, OSM extends the SDN framework to support the next generation of SDN solutions  providing higher level primitives and increasing the number of available options for supporting  I/O-intensive applications. Furthermore, the plugin models for intra- and inter-datacentre SDN  have been consolidated, and the management, addition and maintenance of SDN plugins  significantly simplified.  OSM Release EIGHT also brings major enhancements designed to improve the overall user  experience and interoperability choices. This includes an improved workflow for VNF  configuration which allows much faster and complex operations, and the support of additional  types of infrastructures, such as Azure and VMware's vCD 10, complementing the previously  available choices (OpenStack-based VIMs, VMware VIO, VMware vCD, AWS, Fog05 and  OpenVIM). It improves the orchestration of diverse virtualisation environments, including PNFs,  a number of different VIMs for VNFs, and Kubernetes for Cloud native NFs.  H.2 ONAP  Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) is an open-source project hosted by the Linux  Foundation122, officially launched in 2017, enabling telco networks to become increasingly more  autonomous. ONAP is capable of providing a real-time, policy-driven service orchestration and  automation, enabling telco operators and application developers to instantiate and configure  network functions. ONAP, through different releases, supports features such as a) multi-site and  multi-vendor automation capabilities, b) service and resources deployment, thus providing c)  cloud network elements and services instantiation in a dynamic, real-time and closed-loop  manner for several major telco activities, (e.g. design, deployment and operation of services at  design-time and run-time.  120 https://osm.etsi.org/docs/user-guide/02-osm-architecture-and-functions.html  121 https://www.etsi.org/technologies/open-source-mano  122 Open Network Automation Platform, https://docs.onap.org/en/elalto/index.html#  https://osm.etsi.org/docs/user-guide/02-osm-architecture-and-functions.html https://www.etsi.org/technologies/open-source-mano https://docs.onap.org/en/elalto/index.html  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  153  Various edge cloud architectures have already emerged from different communities and  potentially can be plugged into the ONAP architecture for service orchestration. The ONAP  community analyses the orchestration requirements of services over various edge clouds and  how these requirements impact ONAP components in terms of data collection, processing,  policy management, resource management, control loop models and security, as well as  application and network function deployment and control. We invite the reader to read more  detail in this link123.  H.3 OPNFV  It was launched by the Linux Foundation in September 2014 [67]. OPNFV focuses on NFVI and  includes an SDN controller and switch. OPNFV is a platform for implementing NFV and can  provide feedback on the necessary information to the ONAP platform. The four goals of OPNFV  are as follows:  • after testing, to use continuous integration or continuous delivery (CI/CD) to develop an  open-source platform that can build NFV system functions;  • to invite operators of telecommunication services to join the programme and verify that  OPNFV meets user expectations;  • to join other open-source projects that will use OPNFV to ensure consistency,  performance and interoperability.  • To build an ecosystem of NFV solutions based on open source.  H.4 SONATA  The SONATA project124 is a component of an EU-funded project, Horizon 2020, and part of the  5G-PPP initiative. The SONATA [65] service platform is implemented as a modular  microservice, which is very flexible and helps the operator to modify a customised function.  Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) are emerging as  major transformational technologies towards ‘software networks’, a new paradigm that is  furthering the evolution of the telecom sector with new network capabilities and business  opportunities. SONATA addresses the significant challenges associated with both the  development and deployment of the complex services envisioned for 5G networks and  empowered by these technologies. Core objectives include:  • reduced time-to-market of networked services: SONATA streamlines development with  abstract programming models, SDK and a DevOps model that integrates operators,  manufacturers and third-party developers;  • optimised resources and reduced costs of service deployment and operation: SONATA  orchestrates complex services for connectivity, computing and storage resources, and  automatically re-configures running services.  • accelerated industry adoption of software networks: SONATA supports the full service  lifecycle, i.e. development, testing, orchestration, deployment, management and  operations, and will define a roadmap for the uptake of results towards stakeholders'  larger transition to SDN/NFV.  H.5 OPENSTACK TACKER  OpenStack Tacker125 is under the big tent of OpenStack projects and aims at building an open  orchestrator with a general purpose VNF Manager to deploy and operate virtual network  functions on an NFV platform. It is based on the ETSI MANO architectural framework and  provides a full functional stack to orchestrate VNFs end-to-end. Today, Tacker offers features  like a VNF catalogue, a basic VNF lifecycle management, VNF configuration management  123 https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Edge+Automation+through+ONAP+Arch.+Task+Force+-  +Distributed+Management+%28ONAP+etc.%29+components  124 http://sonatanfv.org/content/objectives  125 OpenStack Tacker,” https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Tacker  http://sonatanfv.org/content/objectives https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Tacker  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  154  framework, and a VNF health monitoring framework. The VNF catalogue makes use of the  topology and orchestration specification for cloud applications (TOSCA) language for the  definition of VNF meta-data and OpenStack Glance to store and manage the VNF images.  Tacker VNF lifecycle management takes care of the instantiation and termination of virtual  machines, self-healing and auto-scaling, and VNF image updates. It also takes care of  interfaces to vendor specific element management systems. Like the VNF catalogue, the basic  VNF lifecycle management relies on existing OpenStack services and uses OpenStack Heat to  start and stop virtual machines that contain the VNF. Thus, the TOSCA templates are  automatically translated to OpenStack Heat templates.  H.6 OPENBATON  OpenBaton126 is an open source project by Fraunhofer FOKUS that enables implementation of  the ETSI management and orchestration specification. Its main components are a network  function virtualisation orchestrator, a generic virtual network function manager that manages  VNF lifecycles based on the VNF description, and an SDK comprising a set of libraries that  could be used for building a specific VNF Manager.  The NFV orchestrator, which is the main component of OpenBaton, is written in Java using the  spring.io framework. To interconnect the NFV orchestrator to different VNF managers,  OpenBaton relies on the Java messaging system. The NFV orchestrator is currently using  OpenStack as an integrated virtual infrastructure manager, supporting dynamic registration of  NFV points of presence and deploys in parallel multiple slices consisting of one or multiple  VNFs. Through this functionality the orchestrator provides a multi-tenant environment distributed  on top of multiple cloud instances.  H.7 KUBERNETES  Over the last few years Kubernetes127 (noted as K8s) has become a de facto standard for  container orchestration. As container transformation unfolds in the telecom industry, VM based  VNFs give way to cloud native NFs.  Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling,  and management. In the parlance of ETSI’s NFV architecture, it performs the role of the  container infrastructure service management (CISM) function (which performs equivalent  ‘virtualised resource management’ as VIMs do but for the container deployment case as  described in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040).  ETSI GS NFV-SOL 018128 (Draft specification - work in progress) provides a mapping of the  NFV object model for OS container management and orchestration to managed objects of  Kubernetes® and HelmTM as specified by the CNCF® along with a specification of a mapping  between a common set of input parameters (e.g. derived from VNFD/NSD and/or NFV-MANO  RESTful APIs) and output parameters associated with the management and orchestration of the  managed objects.  It profiles the reference Kubernetes® API as an NFV protocol and data model solution for OS  container management and orchestration. It profiles the reference HelmTM documentation as an  NFV protocol and data model solution for the management of OS container workloads based on  an MCIOP (managed container infrastructure object package). It profiles the reference OCITM  Distribution Specification API (which is based on the DockerTM registry API) as an NFV protocol  126 “OpenBaton” https://openbaton.github.io/  127 https://kubernetes.io  128  https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDis play=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUD E_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STA TUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCI ES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProj ectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY  https://openbaton.github.io/ https://kubernetes.io/ https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  155  and data model solution for OS container image management.  The latest published versions of the Kubernetes® API, HelmTM documentation and OCITM  distribution specification API are profiled against the requirements of the functions and the  management service interfaces of the container infrastructure service management (CISM) and  container image registry (CIR) functions as specified in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 and ETSI GS  NFV-IFA 010.  ETSI GS NFV-SOL 018 includes guidelines and rules on how the profiled and referenced  solutions can be adopted in a way that facilitates their integration with the NFV-MANO  framework solutions.  In the Kubernetes ecosystem, there is a project called KubeVirt that provides a way to take an  existing VM and run it inside a container. With KubeVirt, it possible to deploy and manage  applications that comprise any arbitrary mix of native container workloads and VM workloads  using Kubernetes. The underlying infrastructure can be OpenStack, VMware, bare metal or any  of the main public clouds including Azure, AWS or Google.

Determining the  applicability of open source to an appropriate domain can be overwhelming. Table 21 provides a snapshot of some projects to be considered when  determining the applicability of open source across different layers of the 5G network [22], [7], [105], [106].  Table 21: Open source projects in 5G  Project Area Focus Description Link  Open compute  project (OCP) Infrastructure Hardware  The mission of OCP is ‘to apply the benefits of open source to hardware  and rapidly increase the pace of innovation in, near and around the  datacentre and beyond.’ OCP’s Telecom Working Group has developed  the CG-OpenRack-19 specification. This specification offers operators of  telecom datacentres the benefits of open platform standards combined  with the carrier-grade and environmental enhancements required for  edge computing, which will be one of the most important building blocks  for successful 5G deployments.  http://www.opencompute.org/about/ocp-adoption  http://www.eenewseurope.com/news/open-compute-projects- first-carrier-grade-specs  Disaggregated  network operating  system (DANOS)  Infrastructure Operating  system  DANOS  is an open and flexible alternative to traditional networking  operating systems. It will support a network operating system framework  that leverages existing open-source resources and complementary  platforms such as switches and white box routers.  https://www.danosproject.org  Linux Infrastructure Operating  system Linux enables white box to be used in carrier grade networks. https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/linu x/  Berkley software  distribution (BSD) Infrastructure Operating  system  BSD is an operating system (also includes the kernel) which has been  derived from the Unix operating system. http://www.bsd.org  P4 Infrastructure Hardware  P4 is an open-source initiative designed primarily to provide a declarative  language for interacting with networking forwarding planes. P4 programs  specify how a switch processes the packets. P4 controls silicon processor  chips in network forwarding devices such as switches, routers and  network interface cards.  https://p4.org  VPP Infrastructure Network  The VPP platform is an extensible framework that provides out-of-the-box  production quality switch or router functionality. It is the open-source  version of Cisco's Vector Packet Processing (VPP) technology, a high  performance, packet-processing stack that can run on commodity CPUs.  https://fd.io  O-RAN Access Control Radio  The O-RAN alliance uses two themes: ‘openness and intelligence’ for  next generation wireless networks and beyond. ‘Building a more cost- effective, agile RAN requires openness. Open interfaces are essential to  enable smaller vendors and operators to quickly introduce their own  services’ and ‘intelligence networks will become increasingly complex  with the advent of 5G, densification and richer and more demanding  https://www.o-ran.org/  http://www.opencompute.org/about/ocp-adoption http://www.eenewseurope.com/news/open-compute-projects-first-carrier-grade-specs http://www.eenewseurope.com/news/open-compute-projects-first-carrier-grade-specs https://www.danosproject.org/ https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/linu%20x/ http://www.bsd.org/ https://p4.org/ https://fd.io/ https://www.o-ran.org/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  158  applications. To tame this complexity, we cannot use traditional human  intensive means of deploying, optimising and operating a network.  Instead, networks must be self-driving, they should be able to leverage  new learning-based technologies to automate operational network  functions and reduce OPEX’.  Openair5G Access control Radio  Openair5G is an open software that gathers a community of developers  from around the world, who work together to build wireless cellular radio  access network (RAN) and core network (CN) technologies.  https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface 5g/wikis/home  https://openairinterface.org  Telecom infra  project (TIP) Access control Radio  TIP focuses on decoupling the RAN control plane from the user plane,  building a modular RAN software stack that uses commodity hardware  and publishing open north- and south-bound interfaces.  https://telecominfraproject.com  Openair CN Core network  Wireless  core  network  Openair CN is for implementing 4G LTE EPC and 5G NGC. https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface 5g/wikis/home  M-CORD Core network SDN  controller  M-CORD is an open-source reference solution for operators deploying  5G.

Both have the objectives of increasing interoperability, reducing costs and facilitating the establishment of a healthy business ecosystem. The  difference has to do with the method to achieve those goals.  Historically, standards have been developed using consensus-based collaboration in a process that required written documentation of the specific standard  (for example, a specification, protocol, an application protocol interface (API)). This is no different than open-source projects, with the exception that for open  source, contributions are in the form of running code.  Usually, the collaboration process in standards is a very transparent one based on less transparent or even proprietary implementations. Open-source  projects can bring implementation transparency during the harmonisation or standardisation process, as well as after the finalisation of a standard as a way  to establish implementations as reference.  Therefore, open-source projects should be considered complementary to the development of standards, as a way to accelerate and improve the process of  creating interoperable solutions. Figure 21 shows where standards and open-source initiatives work together to benefit vendors, service providers and end  users. Combined with automation tools, continuous testing and integration, as well as broad adoption of DevOps within large organisations, this combination  can be a powerful catalyst for innovation and rapid development130.

This 5G revolution will also expand the attack surface for cyberthreats thus  necessitating the introduction of the principles of security-by-design from the early stages of the  design and deployment of 5G networks.  Towards this technological revolution, the European Commission and the Member States, with  the support of ENISA, developed a single EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on Cybersecurity in  5G Networks, following on the European Commission’s Recommendation on the cybersecurity  of 5G networks. Subsequently, the NIS Cooperation Group published the EU toolbox of risk  mitigating measures.  The objectives of this toolbox are to identify a possible common set of measures that are  capable of mitigating the main cybersecurity risks of 5G networks that were identified in the EU  report on coordinated risk assessment, and to provide guidance for the selection of measures  that should be prioritised in mitigation plans at national and at Union level. One of the technical  measures, TM04, calls on relevant authorities in EU Member States to ensure that Mobile  Network Operators follow security best practices for network function virtualisation (NFV).  Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) has made a huge impact in a very short time since the  use of virtualisation technologies brings various benefits such as agility, flexibility and cost  efficiency. At the same time, the introduction of NFV in 5G networks also introduces new  challenges and risks. NFV changes the network security environment due to resource pools  based on cloud computing and open network architecture.  Thanks to the agility and the Orchestration and Management (O&M) efficiency of NFV networks,  attacked networks can potentially be abandoned and resources recycled, enabling disasters to  be quickly isolated, a response that’s impossible in traditional networks. Network functions,  network links, and even entire networks can be rapidly redeployed, enabling fast recovery from  disasters. At the same time, though, security challenges have become more diverse.  In this report the relevant challenges, vulnerabilities and attacks pertaining to NFV within  the 5G network are explored and security controls and best practices are put forward to  address these challenges, taking into account the particularities of this highly complex,  heterogeneous and volatile environment.  Accordingly, this ENISA study provides the following main information:  • The 5G NFV security framework,  • Potential 5G NFV deployment models,  • Main stakeholders involved in the 5G NFV ecosystem with their roles and  responsibilities,  • Challenges, vulnerabilities, assets and attack taxonomies for 5G NFV,  • Best practices to improve the cybersecurity posture of 5G NFV,  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  6  • Full mapping of challenges, vulnerabilities, assets, attack scenarios and best practices,  • NFV Standardisation, Open-Source and initiatives from academia and industry.  Specifically, in this report sixty security challenges grouped into 7 categories have been  identified and explored. These drive the report to the next steps: vulnerabilities, attack  scenarios, their impact on the 5G NFV assets and 55 best practices classified under Technical,  Policy and Organisational categories.  The main challenges explored in this report have shown that:  • Resource virtualisation: the virtualisation layer provides unified computing resources  based on generalised hardware to the layers above and is the basis of all cloud-native  and virtualised network functions and service software. If the virtualisation layer is  breached, all network functions come under direct attack with disastrous  consequences.  • Resource sharing: a single physical server may run several different tenants' virtual  resources (e.g. virtual machines (VMs ) or containers), and a single tenant's virtual  resource might be distributed across several physical servers. Multi-tenancy resource  sharing and the breaking of physical boundaries introduce the risks of data leaks, data  residue and attacks.  • Use of open source: there will be increasing use of open-source software. This  introduces a new set of security challenges in terms of keeping a consistent and  coherent approach to security-by-design and the prevention of deliberate security  flaws.  • Multi-vendor environment: in such an environment is it difficult to coordinate security  policies and determine responsibility for security problems and requires more effective  network security monitoring capabilities.  • Supply chain: introduces risks such as malicious software and hardware, counterfeit  components, poor designs, manufacturing processes and maintenance procedures.  This may result in negative consequences, such as data and intellectual property theft,  loss of confidence in the integrity of the 5G network, or exploitation to cause system  and network failure.  • Lawful Interception (LI) functionality: placing LI functions within the virtualised  environment exposes them to a variety of security and visibility risks.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Fifth Generation (5G) networks aim at providing value-added services with advanced  performance such as low-latency communications, high reliability, high data rates and capacity  to support an increasing number of connected devices. 5G aims to provide a flexible platform to  integrate vertical industries and a wide range of services and applications such as autonomous  driving, robotics, augmented and virtual reality, remote healthcare, and more.  For such services and use cases, security technology and architecture must be natively  integrated into the overall hybrid and virtual architecture to appropriate internal and external  security services. Previous iterations, such as GSM/CMDA (2G) and HSPA/eVDO (3G,) were  designed to connect people to people predominantly through voice and text, while LTE/LTE-A  (4G) was designed to connect people to the Internet. 5G expands upon this evolution through  ubiquitous connectivity of things to people, services, the Internet and things.  To meet the requirements for scale, throughput, latency, and reliability, 5G architecture has  adopted Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and software-Defined Networking (SDN) to  streamline network and service deployment, operations and management. Operators, service  providers and other verticals (e.g. Connected Cars, IOT, eHealth, Industry 4.0) can leverage  SDN/NFV to provide flexible and cost-effective service without compromising the end user’s  quality of service (QoS).  NFV and SDN open the door to flexible networks and rapid creation of services. This both offers  opportunities for security and introduces additional security challenges and complexities in  some cases.  With the rapid proliferation of 5G networks, operators have started the deployment of NFV.  While several standardisation bodies (e.g. ETSI, 3GPP, NGMN and GSMA) have started  looking into the many security issues introduced by NFV, additional work is needed with greater  involvement of the security community including vendors, operators, universities and regulators.  This report will focus on various security challenges and opportunities introduced by NFV in 5G.  We will present current security challenges, vulnerabilities and attacks pertaining to NFV within  the 5G network and put forward security controls and best practices to address these  challenges taking into account the particularities of this highly complex, heterogeneous and  volatile environment.  1.1 OBJECTIVES  This ENISA study aims at underlining and analysing the security challenges related to 5G NFV.  The main objectives are to identify challenges and best practices to ensure the security of 5G  NFV, while mapping the relevant security challenges, vulnerabilities, attacks scenarios, assets  and best practices.  Note: ‘5G NFV’ in this report means the ‘NFV as applicable to 5G’.  This study indicates how challenges and vulnerabilities can be exploited through cyberthreats  and how this exploitation can be mitigated through security controls and best practices.  The following objectives have been set:  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  8  • identify 5G NFV sensitive assets,  • identify potential and main cyber challenges, vulnerabilities and attack scenarios  targeting 5G NFV,  • map identified challenges, vulnerabilities and attack scenarios to assets,  • identify relevant security measures and best practices, and map them to the security  challenges.  Identified challenges, vulnerabilities, attack scenarios and best practices are consolidated from  various publicly available resources including:  • main 5G standardisation documents and telecommunication best practices (3GPP,  ETSI, NIST, FFT, FCC and GSMA),  • EU-funded research projects (5GPPP),  • industrial white papers,  • research articles,  • guidance and recommendations for organisations such as CIS and CSA,  • interviews and contributions from 5G security experts and Member States  1.2 SCOPE  Towards this technological revolution, the European Commission and the Member States (MS),  with the support of ENISA, developed a single EU Coordinated Risk Assessment on  Cybersecurity in 5G Networks1, following on the European Commission’s Recommendation on  the cybersecurity of 5G networks2 (published on 26 March, 2019).  This coordinated risk assessment is based on individual national risk assessments and  identifies the main threats and threat actors, the most sensitive assets, the main vulnerabilities  and the main risks.  To complement this report and as a further input for the toolbox, ENISA carried out a dedicated  threat landscape mapping, consisting of a detailed analysis of certain technical aspects, in  particular the identification of network assets and of threats affecting these.  Subsequently, on 29 January 2020, the NIS Cooperation Group published the EU toolbox of risk  mitigating measures3. The objectives of this toolbox are to identify a possible common set of  measures that are capable of mitigating the main cybersecurity risks of 5G networks as have  been identified in the EU coordinated risk assessment report, and to provide guidance for the  selection of measures, which should be prioritised in mitigation plans at national and at Union  level.  The toolbox identifies two groups of measures MS can take: strategic and technical measures.  In addition, it identifies a number of supporting actions that can assist, enable or support the  implementation of strategic and technical measures.  One of the technical measures, TM04, calls on relevant authorities in EU Member States to  ensure that mobile network operators follow best practices in security for network function  virtualisation (NFV). To support implementation of this technical measure, the Toolbox also  defines the supporting action SA01, calling for reviews or the development of guidelines and  best practices on network security, and identifying ENISA and the relevant authorities in MSs as  relevant actors for these regards. NFV Security in 5G is one of the key issues that needs to be  1 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security  2 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154  3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/eu-wide-coordinated-risk-assessment-5g-networks-security https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58154 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/cybersecurity-5g-networks-eu-toolbox-risk-mitigating-measures  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  9  addressed comprehensively in order to take advantage of the business opportunities arising  from 5G Networks.  This ENISA study outlines best practices for the security of 5G NFV. It is building on several  previous ENISA studies on 5G45 and virtualisation6 and mainly focuses on 5G NFV.  The purpose of the report is to explain the security challenges associated with NFV in 5G and  make practical best practices and recommendations for addressing those challenges when  planning for, implementing and maintaining NFV.  Within NFV, a Network Function is implemented in a virtualised form of NF or cloud Native NF.  In this report the term ‘VNF’ Virtual Network Function is used to designate both virtualised NF  and cloud Native NF. The VNF is defined in this report as a software implementation of a  Network Function, capable of running on the Cloud Infrastructure. VNFs are built from one or  more VNF components (VNFC) and, in most cases, the VNFC is hosted on a single VM or  container.  Virtualised NF and Cloud Native NF are similar in that they both virtualise network functions to  build an agile 5G NFV infrastructure. Both use an underlying physical server to readily expand  and adapt whenever and wherever the user needs to deploy network capabilities. The  difference mainly lies in how those network functions are abstracted from the underlying  physical server infrastructure.  • Virtualised NF uses a hypervisor to provide a single layer of abstraction that enables  networking and network security functions to run as dedicated appliances (e.g. routers,  firewalls, etc.) in the form of virtual machines (VMs), which can quickly be deployed on  generic hardware.  • Cloud native NF reduces each discrete network and network security function into a  microservice, packaged in its own container, and deployed on generic hardware  resources on a cloud platform.  Consequently, some aspects of NFV may vary among technologies (e.g. VM, container), but the  most security challenges and best practices in this report are intended to apply to most or all  NFV technologies, unless otherwise specified.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  The main purpose of this report is to provide knowledge and information on 5G NFV challenges  and best practices to the relevant community. This information may be useful to a variety of  target groups.  • Non-technical stakeholders such as policy-makers, regulators and law  enforcement: this target group may find this report useful for understanding the  emerging challenges, vulnerabilities, threats and respective practices and measures  for mitigation.  • Experts working in the telecommunication sector, such as operators, vendors,  and service providers: this target group may find this report useful for carrying out  detailed threat analyses and risk assessments in accordance with their particular  needs and mandate (e.g. to protect a specific number of components based on asset  impact analysis, respond to specific vulnerabilities with customised mitigation  measures among others).  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-aspects-of-virtualization  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  10  • Businesses, consultants and product developers: this target group can draw  valuable conclusions from the developed analysis and material for their offerings  (products, services). This can take the form of demonstrating how vulnerabilities have  been eliminated by using developed defences, use of the material within customer  projects, or use of the material as a benchmark for defining cybersecurity protection  policies for such infrastructures (e.g. for the development of verticals). Moreover, the  developed material can be used in developing security audits for 5G NFV  infrastructures.  • Experts in research and innovation: the material presented provides a detailed view  of security issues for 5G NFV. This target group may use this material as a basis for  gap analysis, as material to evaluate the impact of research and as a source for  innovative actions with regard to its further development and implementation. Finally,  this target group may use this material as a useful resource for numerous academic  activities, such as teaching, research, support of scholars, etc.  1.4 METHODOLOGY  ENISA has developed this study by following a four-step methodological approach.  Figure 1: Methodology  (1) Project scope definition: the first step consisted in establishing the scope of the  project and identifying the main topics to be considered during the study.  (2) Desktop research and identification of expert groups: extensive research of  relevant documents to gather as much information as possible about 5G NFV security  challenges and best practices. The identified documents and standards were used as  references for the development of this report. During this step, subject matter experts  were also invited to validate scope and provide feedback.  (3) Analysis of collected material and report development: all the information  collected, whether through desktop research or directly from the experts identified, was  thoroughly analysed.  (4) Review and report validation: ENISA shared the draft of the report with its relevant  stakeholder communities and reference groups for review. Taking the feedback from  the stakeholders into account, the proposed final version of the report was issued.  1.5 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The study is structured as follows.  1.

NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  12  2. 5G NFV SECURITY  FRAMEWORK  2.1 5G END-TO-END ARCHITECTURE  Figure 2 presents an NFV/SDN-enabled 5G architecture. It illustrates the various components  from the core to the far edge. As defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), the  5G network is a Service-Based Architecture (SBA) which is a set of interconnected network  functions (NFs) that deliver the control plane functionality and common data repositories of a 5G  network [1], [2], [3], [4].  Supporting an SBA brings new requirements for the control, coordination and orchestration of  disaggregated network functions that are distributed across the network. These network  functions are virtualised or containerised microservices that can support the 5G core, the Radio  Access Network (RAN), and the MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing).  Cloud RAN (CRAN), Virtualised RAN (VRAN) and Open RAN (ORAN) are all concepts that  have emerged in the last few years to run baseband functions on commodity server hardware,  based on the principles of Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV). The MEC takes advantage of  the existing NFV infrastructure to provide services characterised by low latency, proximity,  location awareness, high bandwidth and real-time insight into radio network information.  In order to support CRAN/ORAN/VRAN and MEC, operators will deploy small datacentres at the  edge. These infrastructures will make it possible to deploy applications and VNFs at the edge  without investing additional resources. The MEC (edge) platform at each datacentre will allow  third party applications to activate traffic offloading at the edge while also enabling access to  other information provided by the operator.  The core network is the central part of the 5G infrastructure. It enables all functions related to  multi-access technologies. Its main purpose is to deliver services over all kinds of networks  (wireless, fixed, converged). The target of SDN is to use programmable software-driven devices  to control the behaviour of the infrastructure. With SDN, user services can be delivered faster,  and the efficiency of network resources increases. SDN is based on three principles:  1. decoupling of control from traffic forwarding and processing,  2. logically centralised control,  3. programmability of network services.  A fully virtualised 5G network could bring significant benefits of harmonisation: one single  uniform hardware platform across the core network, RAN and edge. This could simplify the  management of the complete network, reducing operations and maintenance costs.  The following two sections give more details on the co-dependent technologies of NFV and  SDN. Where NFV is in charge of dynamically creating and managing the network functions and  provisioning various network services, SDN provides the capabilities to manage and orchestrate  the virtual networks among these services. While both SDN and NFV make networking  architectures more flexible and dynamic, they perform different roles.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  13  2.1.1 Service based architecture  Compared to previous generations the 3GPP 5G system architecture is service based (SBA)  (Figure 3) [2], [3], [4]. That means wherever suitable the architectural elements are defined as  network functions that offer their services via interfaces of a common framework to any network  functions that are permitted to make use of these provided services. The SBA specifies flat peer  to peer relationships between Network Functions (NFs) via the HTTP/2-based Service Based  Interface (SBI). Network Repository Functions (NRF) allow every network function to discover  the services offered by other network functions.  This architectural model, which further adopts principles like modularity, reusability and self- containment of network functions, is chosen to enable deployments to take advantage of the  latest virtualisation and software technologies [5]. Instead of specifying network entities, a more  modular design is achieved by specifying a set of NFs which allows stronger decoupling  between logical and physical architecture, facilitating the virtualisation of the different NFs  running on generic computer hardware. Furthermore, NFs can be physically implemented in  different ways (e.g. all of them in a single physical node, distributed across multiple nodes or  running on a cloud platform).  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  14  With the split of control plane and user plane, NFs responsible of the control plane are different  from those responsible of the user plane allowing independent scalability and evolution (e.g.  allocating more capacity to the control plane without affecting the user plane). Moreover, it  allows flexible deployments, e.g. centralised location for control plane or distributed (remote)  location for user plane.  2.1.2 5G Network Functions  The 5G core is a mesh of interconnected services as shown in Figure 3. In addition, the 5G  system architecture introduces several security-related 5G network functions [2], [3], [4], [6] as  shown in Figure 4. Table 1 gives a brief explanation of each network function.  Table 1: 5G network functions  Network Function Description  User Plane  User Plane Function  (UPF)  The User Plane Function deals with the user plane communication in the 5GC, acting as a gateway between  the RAN and the external Data Network (DN) (e.g. Internet). The main functionalities are: packet routing and  forwarding, downlink packet buffering and downlink data notification triggering, QoS handling and traffic  measurements.  Control Plane  Access and Mobility  Management Function  (AMF)  The Access and Mobility Management Function is a control plane function in charge of handling the control  signalling between the UE and the 5GC. The main functionalities are: registration management, connection  management to establish the control plane signalling with the UE, mobility management (e.g. idle mode UE  reachability), control and execution of paging and support of infra-system and inter-system mobility.  Session Management  Function (SMF)  The Session Management Function is a control plane function in charge of the following main functionalities:  session establishment, modification and release, UE IP address allocation and management, control of  policy enforcement and QoS and configuration of traffic steering at UPF to route traffic to proper destination.  Policy Control Function  (PCF)  The Policy Control Function provides policy rules (e.g. authorised QoS for each service data flow) to the  network functions in charge of enforcing them (e.g. SMF).  Application Function  (AF)  The Application Function allows interacting with the applications making use of the network. This can be  used for applications that require dynamic policy control, e.g. for dynamically modifying the bit rate to be  provided. Based on interactions with these applications, policy requirements are provided to the PCF.  Unified Data  Management (UDM)  The function of Unified Data Management is to provide the handling of user identification, subscription  management, access authorisation based on subscription data (e.g. roaming restrictions), and generation of  authentication credentials. It uses subscription data that may be stored in the UDR (Unified Data Repository).  Network Exposure  Function (NEF)  The Network Exposure Function is used to expose services of the 5G core towards other networks (e.g. third  party providers, verticals, etc.). This allows the fast creation of new services making use of the 5G core.  Network Repository  Function (NRF)  The Network Repository, with the profile of the available NF instances (id, PLMN ID, network slice identifiers,  capacity information, etc.) and their supported services, allows an NF to discover the services offered by the  other NFs of the core network. This provides a lot of flexibility for defining the interactions between NFs and  allows that any NF can directly interact with another one.  Security-related Network Function  Authentication Server  Function (AUSF)  The AUSF provides the UE authentication service. AUSF shall handle authentication requests for both,  3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The AUSF shall provide SUPI to the VPLMN (core network or serving  network) only after authentication confirmation if authentication request with SUCI was sent by VPLMN. The  AUSF shall inform the UDM that a successful or unsuccessful authentication of a subscriber has occurred.  Authentication  Credential Repository  and Processing  Function (ARPF)  The ARPF is a functional element of the UDM (Unified Data Management), responsible for generating 5G HE  AV (5G Home Environment Authentication Vectors) based on the subscriber’s shared secret key. It selects  an authentication method based on subscriber identity and configured policy and computes the  authentication data and keying materials.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  15  Network Function Description  Inter-PLMN UP Security  (IPUPS)  The 5G System architecture introduces Inter-PLMN UP Security (IPUPS) at the perimeter of the PLMN for  protecting user plane messages. The IPUPS is a functionality of the UPF that enforces GTP-U security on  the N9 interface between UPFs of the visited and home PLMNs.  Security Context  Management Function  (SCMF)  The SCMF retrieves the key from the SEAF, which is used to derive further keys.  Subscription Identifier  De-concealing Function  (SIDF)  The SIDF is a functional element of the UDM (Unified Data Management), responsible for decrypting a SUCI  (Subscription Concealed Identifier) to reveal the subscriber’s SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier).  Security Anchor  Function (SEAF)  The SEAF forms, as an outcome of the primary authentication, the unified, common anchor key KSEAF for  all the access scenarios. The unified anchor key KSEAF can be used by the UE and the serving network to  protect the subsequent communication7.  Security Edge  Protection Proxy  (SEPP)  The 5G System architecture introduces a Security Edge Protection Proxy (SEPP) as an entity sitting at the  perimeter of the PLMN for protecting control plane messages. The SEPP enforces inter-PLMN security on  the N32 interface. The SEPP shall act as a non-transparent proxy node.  Security Policy Control  Function (SPCF) The SPCF provides policies related to the security of network functions such as AMF, SMF and UE.  Network Slice Selection  Function (NSSF)  The NSSF supports the selection of the Network Slice instance(s) serving a UE. It offers services to the AMF  and NSSF in a different PLMN via the Nnssf service-based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [3] and 3GPP TS  23.502 [4]).  Figure 4: Security-related 5G network functions8  7https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59 b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf  8 https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/T-ISAC_5G-Security_PenttinenJ-GSMA-public.pdf  https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andreas_Kunz2/publication/319527681_Overview_of_5G_security_in_3GPP/links/59b116d80f7e9b37434a8248/Overview-of-5G-security-in-3GPP.pdf https://www.gsma.com/security/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/T-ISAC_5G-Security_PenttinenJ-GSMA-public.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  16  2.1.3 Support of network slicing  A distinct key feature of the 5G system architecture is network slicing. Within the scope of the  3GPP 5G system architecture a network slice refers to the set of 3GPP defined features and  functionalities that together form a complete Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) for providing  services to UEs.  Network slicing allows for controlled composition of a PLMN from the specified network  functions with their specific, provided services that are required for a specific usage scenario.  Each PLMNs is customised by instantiating only the features, capabilities and services required  to satisfy the subset of the served users/UEs or related business customer needs [5]. With 5G,  NFs can be individually instantiated for each network slice and placed where appropriate. In this  way, multiple network slices can be created, each one composed of a collection of control plane  and user plane NFs customised to the needs of the slice. For example, one network slice can  include the NFs to support mobile broadband services with full mobility support, and another  one to support non-mobile, latency-critical industry applications.  2.1.4 Support of multi-access edge computing (MEC)  MEC uses the wireless access network to provide services and cloud computing functions  required by telecom users, and to construct a carrier class service environment with high  performance, low latency and high bandwidth to improve the communication experience of  mobile users.  Edge computing is an evolution of cloud computing that brings application hosting from  centralised datacentres down to the network edge, close to the consumers and the data  generated by applications. The main advantages are the computation offloading, distributed  content delivery and caching, and low latency services.  In order to profit from the advantages provided by edge computing in 5G, the technology needs  to support connecting the 5G core to a local area data network (LADN) where the applications  are implemented and the UPF must be able to perform the local routing of certain traffic to the  LADN.  In terms of physical deployment of MEC hosts, there are multiple options available based on  various operational, performance or security related requirements. The following list gives an  outline of some of the feasible options for the physical location of MEC:  1. MEC and the local UPF collocated with the base station,  2. MEC collocated with a transmission node, possibly with a local UPF,  3. MEC and the local UPF collocated with a network aggregation point,  4. MEC collocated with the core network functions (i.e. in the same datacentre).  The options presented above show that MEC can be flexibly deployed in different locations from  near the base station to the central data network. Common for all deployments is the UPF which  is deployed and used to steer the traffic towards the targeted MEC applications and towards the  network.  2.2 NFV ARCHITECTURE  The virtualisation of network elements, NFV, is a concept that virtualises the main elements of a  network. In this sense, instead of having a dedicated hardware element to provide a function of  the network, software running on general hardware is used. In this way, entire classes of  network node functions can be set up as building blocks that can be connected to create overall  telecommunications networks. Examples of the virtualised functions that can be provided  include virtualised load balancers, firewalls, intrusion detection devices, WAN accelerators,  routers, access control and billing.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  17  As a standard specification, ETSI focuses on high-level architecture, development guidelines,  and interoperability enabled by open interfaces. ETSI describes the high-level NFV functional  architectural framework and the design of virtualised network functions and of the supporting  infrastructure. It identifies three main working domains in NFV:  1. Virtualised network function is the software implementation of a network function which  can run over the NFVI.  2. NFV infrastructure (NFVI) includes the diversity of physical resources and how these  can be virtualised. NFVI supports the execution of the VNFs.  3. NFV management and orchestration (MANO) covers the orchestration and lifecycle  management of physical and/or software resources that support the virtualisation of the  infrastructure, and the lifecycle management of VNFs.  The initial release of the ETSI NFV specification was predominantly dependent on hypervisor- based virtual machines (VMs) for virtualisation. Most of the specifications in ETSI NFV continue  serving that purpose when being applied to the cloud native NFV. Nevertheless, an adaption is  needed in some areas because of the differences between the VM based and cloud native  solutions. Thus, the ETSI NFV group has published containerised VNF specifications enabling  containerised VNFs to be managed in an NFV framework.  The ETSI NFV group has published ETSI GS NFV-IFA 0409, which specifies the requirements  for service interfaces and is an object model for operating system (OS) container management  and orchestration. These specifications provide a baseline for the integration of OS container  management and orchestration into the NFV framework.  ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 also specifies requirements on the list of services to be offered by  architectural elements providing the Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM) and  Container Image Registry (CIR) functions described in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 02910 and on the  interfaces for exposing these services to NFV-MANO and other consuming entities.  The CISM is responsible for maintaining the containerised workloads and manages the OS  container, computation storage, network resources and their configuration. The CIR is  responsible for storing and maintaining information on OS container software images.  ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040 is supplemented by the NFV Release 4 specifications ETSI GS NFV-IFA  01011 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 01112. These provide enhancements for the specification of the  management and orchestration functional requirements, and extensions to the VNF package  and VNF descriptor specifications respectively.  The considerably high level NFV architecture for 5G is in line with the ETSI NFV reference  architecture [7], the NFV-MANO architectural framework [8], the ETSI NFV Adaptation to the  Cloud Native Architecture [9] [10], and the ENISA 5G threat landscape [6] (section 3.7) (Figure  5). Table 2 describes the main NFV [7] and MANO [8] components of this architecture. In Figure  5, the main NFV components covering both VM-based and cloud native (container based) are  highlighted.  In this report, it is assumed that the VIM supports the CISM to be able to manage both VMs and  containers virtualisation technologies. As explained in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029, there are multiple  options to integrate the CISM within the NFV MANO. Only option #1 (CISM embedded in the  VIM) is highlighted for reasons of simplicity since the aim is to give a big picture of the NFV  9 https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20040v4.2.1%20-%20GS%20- %20OS%20Container%20MANO%20service%20interfaces.pdf  10 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-IFA/001_099/029/03.03.01_60/gr_NFV-IFA029v030301p.pdf  11 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/010/04.01.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA010v040101p.pdf  12 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/011/04.02.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA011v040201p.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20040v4.2.1%20-%20GS%20-%20OS%20Container%20MANO%20service%20interfaces.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20040v4.2.1%20-%20GS%20-%20OS%20Container%20MANO%20service%20interfaces.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-IFA/001_099/029/03.03.01_60/gr_NFV-IFA029v030301p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/010/04.01.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA010v040101p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-IFA/001_099/011/04.02.01_60/gs_NFV-IFA011v040201p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  18  architecture without going into the details of all these options already explained in ETSI GR  NFV-IFA 029.  More details about the 5G NFV architecture can be found in [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13],  [14], [15], [16]. More details about the different MANO solutions are given in Annexes H and I.  Table 2: NFV and MANO main components  Security-related  Network Function Description  NFV (Network Functions Virtualisation)  Common components  between VM-based and  cloud native NFV  (network functions  virtualisation)  • NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): The NFVI consists of all the hardware and software components that are  contained within the environment in which VNFs are deployed. It provides virtualised computing,  storage, and networking. One of the advantages of NFV is that the NFV-Infrastructure can be located  across several physical locations, allowing operators to typically place their centres at the most  convenient locations. The network providing connectivity between these locations is part of the NFV- Infrastructure.  • Operations Support System/Business Support System (OSS/BSS):  includes the collection of  applications that a service provider uses to operate its business. While OSS deals with network  management, fault management, configuration management and service management, BSS deals with  customer management, product management, order management and billing.  • Element Management System (EMS): is responsible for the configuration, fault management,  accounting and collection of performance measurement results for the network functions provided by  the VNF. An example of management function is fault, configuration, accounting, performance and  security management (FCAPS).  • Hardware Resources: in NFV, the physical hardware resources include computing, storage and  networks that provide processing, storage and connectivity to VNFs through the virtualisation layer  (Host OS, Hypervisor, CIS).  • Virtualised Network Function (VNF): an implementation of an NF that can be deployed on a network  function virtualisation infrastructure (NFVI). VNFs are built from one or more VNF components (VNFC)  and, in most cases, the VNFC is hosted on a single VM or container.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  19  Security-related  Network Function Description  • Virtualised Network Function Component (VNFC): is an internal component of a VNF that provides  a VNF provider with a defined sub-set of that VNF's functionality. Its main characteristic is that a single  instance of this component maps 1:1 against a single instance of an atomic deployable unit. An  instance of an atomic deployable unit is represented by a single VM for hypervisor-based virtualisation  or represented by one or a set of OS containers for CIS (Container Infrastructure Service) based  virtualisation.  • Virtualisation layer: it consists of two sub layers: a host OS and hypervisor (for VMs) and CIS (for  containers).  Cloud native  components within NFV  • Container Infrastructure Service (CIS): the cloud-native equivalent of hypervisor is container  infrastructure service (CIS), which provides all the runtime infrastructural dependencies for one or more  container virtualisation technologies. It can run on top of a bare metal or hypervisor-based virtualisation.  It is used to create, destroy and manage containers on top of an operating system.  • Container: is a virtualisation container using a shared operating system (OS) kernel of its host.  Containers can host a VNF component (VNFC) for instance.  VM-based components  within NFV  • Hypervisor: is a piece of software which partitions the underlying physical resources and creates  virtual machines, and isolates the VMs from each other. It is running either directly on top of the  hardware (bare metal hypervisor type 1) or running on top of a hosting operating system (hosted  hypervisor type 2). The abstraction of resources comprises all those entities inside a computer or  server which are accessible, such as processor, memory/storage, NICs. The hypervisor enables the  portability of VMs to different Hardware.  • Virtual Machine (VM): has all the ingredients (processor, memory/storage, interfaces/ports) of a  physical computer or server and is generated by a hypervisor, which partitions the underlying physical  resources and allocates them to VMs. Virtual machines can host a VNF component (VNFC) for  instance.  NFV MANO (Management and Orchestration)  Common components  between VM-based and  cloud native NFV MANO  • Network Function Virtualisation Orchestrator (NFVO): is responsible for coordinating the VNFM and  VIM according to the requirements of the OSS/BSS to orchestrate a specific service such as a firewall  or to detect intrusions. It implements resource and service orchestration in the network. NFVO is split  up into resource orchestrator (RO) and network service orchestrator (NSO).  • First, RO collects the current information regarding possible physical and virtual resources of NFVI  through the VIM. Second, NSO applies a complete lifecycle management of multiple network services.  In this way, NFVO keeps updating the information about the available VNFs running on top of NFVI. As  a result, NFVO can initiate multiple network services. As part of the lifecycle management, NFVO can  also terminate a network service whenever a service request is no longer being received for that  specific service.  • In several solutions, NFVO and VNFM are integrated into MANO. Open Source MANO (OSM)13, Open  Networking Automation Platform (ONAP)14, OpenBaton15, Cloudify16, SONATA17, and Katana Slice  Manager18 are considered as the leading integrated solutions for MANO. Note that OSM can also  perform management and orchestration tasks on PNFs.  • VNF Manager (VNFM): is responsible for managing the lifecycle of VNFs. VNFM operations include:  o instantiation of VNFs  o scaling of VNFs  o updating and/or upgrading  o VNFs Termination of VNFs.  VM-based components  within NFV MANO  • Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM): is the management system for NFVI. It is responsible for  controlling and managing the interaction of a VNF with the underlying computing, storage and  networking resources and their virtualisation. It performs resource management tasks such as inventory  of hypervisors, allocation of VMs onto hypervisors or increasing resources to VMs. Moreover, it  performs operations on the visibility of the NFVI, analysis of data on the performance of the  13 Open Source MANO (OSM), “OSM Open Source NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO) software stack aligned  with ETSI NFV,” April 2021, https://osm.etsi.org  14 ONAP, “ONAP Open Networking Automation Platform,” April 2021, https://www.onap.org/  15 OpenBaton, “OpenBaton An extensible and customizable NFV MANO-compliant framework,” April 2021,  http://openbaton.org  16 Cloudify, “Cloudify Multi Cloud Orchestration,” April 2021, https://cloudify.co/  17 SONATA, “Sonata agile development. testing and orchestration of services in 5g virtualized networks,” April 2021,  https://www.sonata-nfv.eu  18 Katana Wiki Home, “MediaNetworks Laboratory,” April 2021, https://github.com/medianetlab/katana-slice_manager/wiki  https://osm.etsi.org/ https://www.onap.org/ http://openbaton.org/ https://cloudify.co/ https://www.sonata-nfv.eu/ https://github.com/medianetlab/katana-slice_manager/wiki  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  20  Security-related  Network Function Description  infrastructure and collection of information for capacity planning, monitoring and optimisation.  Consequently, VIM can supervise the allocation of NFVI resources to the available VNFs. OpenStack19  and OpenVIM20 (for VNFs) are possible solutions for VIM.  Cloud native  components within NFV  MANO  • Container Infrastructure Service Management (CISM): is a functional block that manages one or  more container infrastructure services. The CISM provides mechanisms for lifecycle management of  the managed container infrastructure objects, which are hosting application components as services or  functions. It is a cloud-native equivalent of virtualised infrastructure manager (VIM).  • CISM is responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage and network resources,  as well as scheduling the microservice containers in the cloud. CISM also collects performance  measurements in the infrastructure including container level and makes the data available for other  functional blocks for monitoring purposes. Other responsibilities of CISM include virtual networking  control and management, as well as the southbound integration with various network controllers to  achieve the physical network control and management capabilities.  • Kubernetes21 (for cloud native NFs) is a possible solution for CISM. Multiple options can be envisioned  for mapping the CISM functionality to NFV-MANO as outlined in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 and ETSI GS  NFV-IFA 040. Each option has it is pros and cons. Such options include:  o Option#1: CISM embedded in the VIM,  o Option#2: CISM distributed across VNFM and VIM,  o Option#3: CISM as a stand-alone functional block,  o Option#4: CISM-only replacing VIM and VNFM,  o Option#5: CISM embedded into VNF with support for shared container service,  o Option#6: CISM embedded into VNF without support for shared container service.  Other  NFV Security Managers  (SM)  NFV SM is a function that applies security policy to a virtualised network based on both predefined default  policy and active analysis of information provided through security monitoring. It is responsible for enforcing  security policy for VNFs and for instructing NFV-MANO to take VNF specific or system wide security actions  [17], [18]. The security manager is a logical subcomponent of a CSP's overall network security management  and monitoring systems. A CSP security management platform may require one or more security managers  (SMs) depending on the security isolation and role separation required between different trust domains. In  cooperation with MANO blocks dedicated to managing the virtualised network, the policy driven SM is  specialised to manage the security on a network service over its entire lifecycle. It covers the following  functionalities:  • Security Policy Planning designs and optimises security policies for specific targets of protection  (e.g. network services);  • Security Policy Enforcement & Validation automates the deployment and supports the lifecycle  management of security functions as defined in the design phase, then configures security  policies on the security functions. In addition, during the lifetime of a network service, the  validation and re-configuration or remediation of associated security policies is supported, also in  an automated manner.  2.3 NFV WITH SDN ROLES  Besides the NFV technology, management and deployment of 5G technology is simplified by  the adoption of complementary technologies enabling flexible usage of deployed hardware and  fast provisioning of new functions and services, namely the SDN.  The core similarity between software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions  virtualisation (NFV) is that they both use network abstraction. SDN seeks to separate network  control functions from network forwarding functions, while NFV seeks to abstract network  forwarding and other networking functions from the hardware on which it runs.  19 OpenStack, “OpenStack The Most Widely Deployed Open Source Cloud Software in the World,” April 2021,  https://www.openstack.org/  20 OpenVIM, “Telefónica NFV reference lab,” April 2021, https://github.com/nfvlabs/openvim  21 Kubernetes, “Kubernetes Production-Grade Container Orchestration,” April 2021, https://kubernetes.io  https://www.openstack.org/ https://github.com/nfvlabs/openvim https://kubernetes.io/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  21  Thus, both depend heavily on virtualisation to enable network design and infrastructure to be  abstracted in software and then implemented by underlying software across hardware platforms  and devices [19].  When SDN executes on an NFV infrastructure, SDN forwards data packets from one network  device to another. At the same time, SDN's networking control functions for routing, policy  definition and applications run in a VM or container somewhere on the network. Thus, NFV  provides basic networking functions, while SDN controls and orchestrates them for specific  uses. SDN further allows configuration and behaviour to be programmatically defined and  modified [19].  SDN and NFV differ in how they separate functions and abstract resources. SDN abstracts  physical networking resources – switches, routers and so on – and moves decision making to a  virtual network control plane. In this approach, the control plane decides where to send traffic,  while the hardware continues to direct and handle the traffic. NFV aims to virtualise all physical  network resources beneath a hypervisor, which allows the network to grow without the addition  of more devices [19]. While both SDN and NFV make networking architectures more flexible  and dynamic, they perform different roles in defining those architectures and the infrastructure  they support [19].  A whole overview of the NFV/SDN architecture is shown Figure 6. This architecture takes into  account SDN and NFV technologies. On one hand, the framework presents a layered structure:  infrastructure, control and application layers, in the same way as SDN architecture. Moreover, it  takes advantage of the NFV concept to allow the easy implementation and management of  network functions, without the need to increase the hardware devices [20], [21].  Figure 6: Integrating SDN Controller into the reference NFV architecture  The SDN controller centralises the control plane functionalities and provides an abstract view of  all the connectivity-related components it manages. The SDN Controller sets up and manages  the underlying networking resources to provide the required connectivity for communicating the  VNFs. Managed by the VIM, this controller may change infrastructure behaviour on-demand  according to VIM specifications, adapted from the requests of tenants.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  22  In the infrastructure layer, we have the current mobile infrastructure of the network operator  providing support to a wide range of wireless and cellular technologies such as WiFi, LTE,  UTMS, GSM, among others. On top of the hardware layer, there is a virtualisation layer to  enable the virtualisation of hardware devices. The resources could be in different locations and  datacentres and this takes three components into account:  • networking: these devices incorporate mobile technologies and OpenFlow protocol;  • storage: this element can include object storage or block storage (Swift and Cinder  OpenStack) or another novel technique;  • computing: this includes high volume servers.  The control layer is in charge of monitoring, analysis, management and orchestration of devices.  It consists of four modules: monitoring, analyser, network OS and NFV MANO.  • Monitoring Module: this module is able to provide the complete low-level overview of  the managed systems by means of gathering metrics coming from different network  devices.  • Analyser Module: this module could give a deep analysis of the data in order to  determine the behaviour that suits the network. This module also can infer the  recommended behaviour of the network. The techniques used in the analysis can  include data mining, learning algorithms and pattern recognition, among others.  • Network OS: this uses the OpenFlow or similar protocols to send instructions to the  infrastructure layer elements. Its functionality is similar to an operating system (OS) in  computing.  • NFV MANO: this module determines and organises the actions to be executed in the  system, the orchestration, the management of the resources and the control functions.  SDN/NFV control layer can adapt the network resources depending on the actual situation of  the network and dynamically respond to failures or degradation of network performance. On the  top of the architecture is located the application layer, which consists of two basic modules:  • Communication Interface: this module enables an open API for programmers to  facilitate the development of new services.  • Network Functions: this module presents a scalable structure to create customised  network functions or control applications.  2.4 5G NFV STAKEHOLDERS  Table 3 illustrates the actors that hold stakes in the 5G NFV markets, forming different clusters  who would be active in 5G ecosystems.  First, the stakeholders from the traditional 5G industry are those who provide connectivity  solutions, equipment, SW and cloud providers. They are the actors who take part in developing,  delivering and providing 5G services. Second, policy makers and standard setting organisations  have defined 5G as we know it today. Third, vertical industries are important stakeholders  providing different services to third parties. [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] were used as references for  the development of this chapter.  The 5G NFV network architecture implies the introduction of new processes, activities and  operations thus defining new technical roles (e.g. administrators, integrators) and  responsibilities involved in the operation, administration and maintenance of the 5G NFV. The  operation, administration and maintenance of 5G NFV infrastructure requires much effort and  particular skill profiles need to be employed. Listings of the roles, responsibilities and the  corresponding technical processes and activities are provided in Annex A. Each role can belong  to multiple stakeholders.

Mobile Virtual Network  Operators (MVNO)  MVNOs work with MNOs to offer their telecom services by acquiring the required network capacity  for customers.  Cloud Providers They provide computation and storage resources to third parties.  Over-The-Top (OTT) Content  And Service Providers  These providers offer different applications and services to end users based on their demands and  quality requirements.  Communications Service  Providers (CSPs)  Communications Service Providers (CSPs) include service providers such as Mobile Network  Operators (MNO) and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO).  Law Enforcement Organisations  and Governmental Agencies  They should have access to control and sometimes intercept user data in 5G networks in the  regulated framework of Lawful Interception.  Regulators and Policymakers Government regulators or regulatory agencies include bodies such as the Federal Communications  Commission (US), European Commission (EU), etc.  Standardisation Bodies These include international associations, alliances with a geographical, thematic or sectorial focus,  such as the International Telecommunication Union, GSMA, 3GPP, etc.  Vertical Markets These provide various services to third parties that exploit resources (network and cloud)  specifically from operators and cloud service providers.  End Users or Subscribers  These users have a subscription and can therefore access virtualised services. When they access a  service, they directly or indirectly generate a data flow within the control plan, then the user plan.  Their communications are transported by the user plan.  2.5 NFV SECURITY OPPORTUNITIES  Despite potential challenges due to the use of recent technologies such as NFV and SDN in 5G  networks, these same technologies also open new opportunities. The main opportunities for  NFV to improve the 5G security and trustworthiness are provided in Table 4 ([22], [27]).  Table 4: NFV security opportunities  NFV security  opportunities Description  Increased automation  This is provided by the management and orchestration (MANO) layer. NFV MANO provides the opportunity  to automate the creation, reconfiguration and scaling in and out of network functions, and to do it in real time  on the fly, based on workload needs. The automation feature provided by NFV MANO allows the security  controls and mitigations to be automated. For instance, the logging of security events, monitoring, detection,  prevention, verification of integrity, patch management and others can be instantiated and provided as a  service to network functions and applications.  Security zoning and  segmentation  In the 5G network, multi-tenancy drives the need for the logical separation of virtual resources among  tenants. Through orchestration, certain VNFs can be deployed on separate VMs or containers and compute  nodes, and they can be further segregated by using separate networks. In addition, the use of security zones  allows VNFs to be deployed on or migrated to hosts that satisfy security-pertinent criteria such as location  and level of hardening (for example, some hosts may employ the trusted computing technology).  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  25  NFV security  opportunities Description  Distributed security  services  The NFV allows for the dynamic distribution not only of the instantiated VNFs throughout the virtualised  infrastructure at the edge, at the core or at the RAN, but also for security. 5G network services are deployed  across multiple administrative domains. NFV admins can instantiate new monitoring instances, reconfigure  or modify the existing ones at the right location in the network according to available resources or security  contexts.  Patch management  NFV eases the deployment of security updates. An upgraded instance of the VNF can be launched and  tested while the previous instance remains active. Services and customers can then be migrated to the  upgraded instance over a period of time (shorter or longer as dictated by operational needs). The older  instance with the un-patched security flaw can be retired once the process is complete.  Incident response  NFV opens up the possibility to automate and improve the incident response. This automated incident  response provides rapid and flexible re-configuration of virtual resources. In addition, it eases the  decommissioning and re-commissioning of VNFs. If a VNF is compromised (for example, through  unauthorised access via a back door), an uncompromised version can be instantiated to replace it and the  compromised version can be decommissioned and a copy of it made for forensic analysis.  Programmability Programmability offers the flexibility and dynamicity needed to have adaptable security mechanisms such as  logging, policy monitoring, and verification mechanisms.  Centralised control and  traffic steering  In SDN, forwarding elements are directly connected to and controlled by controller software (e.g. Ryu23 or  OpenDaylight24). This centralisation of the control plane enables a defence system to rapidly respond to  network changes from a central controller through updating the forwarding rules of the entire network  infrastructure, e.g. suspicious traffic can be dynamically detected and re-directed to security appliances.  Network slicing  Network slicing is released by virtualisation using SDN, NFV and cloud computing technologies. The E2E  multi-domain and multi-tenancy support in 5G network slicing promises to enable vertical industries with a  diverse set of performance, service and security requirements. Network slicing will give operators capabilities  of creating different level of services for different verticals, enabling them to customise their operations.  2.6 NFV KEY TECHNOLOGIES  This section presents an overview on different virtualisation, containerisation and MANO  technologies [28] currently being used in 5G to run and orchestrate multiple VNFs at the core,  edge and RAN. It examines the differences between using virtual machines (VMs) vs containers  vs unikernel vs cloud native microservices in the context of 5G.  2.6.1 Virtualisation  2.6.1.1 Hypervisor  Hypervisor-based virtualisation provides isolated environments on top of a shared pool of  resources [29], [30]. Hypervisor is a software layer that abstracts the underlying physical  resources and provides virtual machines with the full functionalities of a real system. Moreover,  a hypervisor is responsible for resource allocation to the VM as well as being responsible for  monitoring and managing VMs through coordination with the primary OS of the underlying  hardware.  There are two types of hypervisors known as Type 1 and Type 2.  • Based on Type I – Bare Metal Hypervisor: a type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the  host machine's physical hardware, and it's referred to as a bare-metal or native  hypervisor. The type I hypervisor doesn't have to load an underlying OS. It does not  need any host OS because the communication to hardware resources is direct with full  visibility of hardware resources [30].  • Based on Type II - Hosted Hypervisor: a type 2 hypervisor is typically installed on  top of an existing OS. It is sometimes called a hosted hypervisor because it relies on  23 https://ryu-sdn.org  24 https://www.opendaylight.org  https://ryu-sdn.org/ https://www.opendaylight.org/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  26  the host machine's pre-existing OS to manage calls to CPU, memory, storage and  network resources.  The bare-metal hypervisors (type I) are a more secure option. Unlike the hosted hypervisor,  they do not depend on the underlying OS. Table 5 summarises the features of Type I and Type  II hypervisors [31].  Table 5: Features of type I and type II hypervisors  Criteria Type I Type II  AKA Bare metal Hosted  Definition Runs directly on server hardware Runs on top of the supported OS  Scalability Better scalability Not so much, because of its reliance on the underlying OS  System  independence  Has direct access to hardware along with VMs, its  hosts  Is not allowed to directly access the host hardware and its  resources  Performance Provides better hardware resource utilisation Provides less hardware resource utilisation.  Security More secure as it is a hardware-based hypervisor  Less secure as it is a software-based hypervisor. Any  problem in the OS may affect the entire system including  the protected hypervisor.  Setup or installation In many such hypervisors, setup is hard and  hardware support is needed.  In many such hypervisors, setup is easy as there is already  an OS.  Examples VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM, Xen  Hypervisor, Oracle VM, Citrix Hypervisor  Oracle VM VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Pro and  VMware Fusion, QEMU, Parallels Desktop, KVM25  2.6.1.2 Virtual machines  A VM is a type of virtualisation that splits bare metal servers into multiple independent instances  with separate operating systems inside. The operating system, applications and services are all  bundled into a single image that is accessed via a hypervisor, built on virtualised hardware.  Such virtualisation allows us to move away from the approach of running one application or  service per physical server and achieve better utilisation of capacity. The sizing of the VM will  depend on the resources available and the characteristics of the application that is going to be  executed on this machine. Within the VM, it is possible to run different OS depending on the  necessities or requirements of the application running on top of it.  A VM consists of several files that are stored on a storage device. The key files are the  configuration file, virtual disk file, NVRAM setting file and log file [28]. Some of the most  interesting functions that VMs enable are Snapshots26, Migration27 and Failover28 [32].  2.6.2 Cloud native  25 Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) has qualities of both a hosted and a bare-metal virtualisation hypervisor. It can turn  the Linux kernel itself into a hypervisor so the VMs have direct access to the physical hardware.  26 Snapshots: A snapshot is a state of a VM, and generally its storage devices, at an exact point in time. A snapshot  enables the VM's state at the time of the snapshot to be restored later, effectively undoing any changes that occurred  afterwards. This capability is useful as a backup technique, for example, prior to performing a risky operation.  27 Migration: The snapshots can be moved to another host machine with its own hypervisor; when the VM is temporarily  stopped, snapshotted, moved, and then resumed on the new host, this is known as migration. If the older snapshots are  kept in synchronisation regularly, this operation can be quite fast, and allow the VM to provide uninterrupted service while  its prior physical host is, for example, taken down for physical maintenance.  28 Failover: Similar to the migration mechanism, failover allows the VM to continue operations if the host fails. Generally, it  occurs if the migration has stopped working. However, in this case, the VM continues operation from the last-known  coherent state, rather than the current state, based on whatever materials the backup server was last provided with.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  27  Cloud-native is an approach to building and running applications that fully exploits the benefits  of the cloud computing model. Applications are cloud-native network functions. 5G NFs, as a  cloud native NF, is designed using the following important cloud-native principles.  2.6.2.1 Containerisation  OS-level virtualisation represents the containerisation model, which envisages that only the  applications and their dependencies are integrated into a container. Each container shares the  host OS kernel operating on bare metal, as well as its binaries and libraries so the applications  run quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another29.  As a result, containers are exceptionally lightweight and fast to start. Containers allow for more  efficient implementation of microservices principles due to their elasticity and ease of  provisioning. Containers are more commonly adopted by cloud-native applications, as each  service component becomes a separate element in a microservices architecture.  Many types of containerisation technologies are available, for instance:  • Docker containers: this is a popular open-source project based on Linux containers.  Docker is written in GO and developed by Dotcloud. Docker is basically a container  engine (ETSI CIS) which uses the Linux kernel features like namespaces and control  groups to create containers on top of an operating system and automates application  deployment on the container.  • Java containers: these types of software packages enable standalone functioning of  Java applications or parts of them. Examples: Springboot, Jetty, Tomcat.  • LXD containers: represent Linux containers software technology that is very similar to  various Linux distributions. These are integrated with the OpenNebula EDGE platform.  • OpenVZ containers30: Open Virtuozzo is a dedicated container-based virtualisation  technology specially created for Linux operating systems.  • RKT containers: rocket containers and RKT container engine were developed by  CoreOS for the majority of Linux distributions in a cloud-native environment. This type  of container is composed of a pod (like in the Kubernetes model and concept) with one  or more applications inside.  • Hyper-V containers: they constitute a different type of container because they create their  own copy of the Windows OS kernel and are completely isolated, having incorporated both  kernel space and user modes. They can be easily associated with a VM.  2.6.2.2 Microservices  A 5G NF, as a cloud native NF, is composed of cloud-native network functions components that  combine to enable 5G-specific features. The basic components of a cloud native NF are  microservices, which can be executed independently in separate containers, be deployed  independently, and be re-composed when creating a new cloud native NF. These microservice- based cloud native NFs are highly scalable and can enable the deployment of new features  quickly.  A microservices architecture develops a single application as a suite of small services, each of  which run their own process and communicate with lightweight mechanisms. Applications  designed from the beginning as a microservice may have the innovation needed for the new  telecom service environment.  The microservices architecture requires a high degree of orchestration. Moreover, consideration  must be given to whether decomposing into a microservice can actually be counterproductive.  29 https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container  30 https://openvz.org/  https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container https://openvz.org/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  28  Because microservicing supports cloud-native architecture, it can create problems with latency,  which is the death knell for 5G applications and services.  While mobile operators stand to benefit tremendously from fully deployed 5G networks, the  reality is that there are a number of foundational issues that must be addressed to ensure those  networks provide the speed, latency and reliability that 5G applications demand.  As is generally true in technology, a hybrid approach to developing VM, container and  microservices technologies is likely the best pragmatic path forward for operators31. By  combining the main principles ‘containerisation’ and ‘microservices’ operators can build a 5G  network with cloud-native network functions.  2.6.3 Hybrid virtualisation and containerisation  With the development of cloud native technology, the telco infrastructure is on a path to  leveraging the container-based architecture. But until then, solutions will incorporate a mixture  of VMs and containers. In virtualised legacy networks like the EPC and 5G Non-Standalone  (NSA) core, network functions that create real-time services and manage the user plane traffic  typically run on VMs, which is appropriate for supporting services that do not have strict latency  requirements or network configurations. Meanwhile, operators use containers for broadband  services that need scalability or services that are not susceptible to failures. Therefore, to  support interworking with existing networks, the 5G network requires virtualisation and cloud  native technology that can support both VMs and containers at the same time. Typical VMs,  containers and hybrid architectures are depicted in Figure 7.  31 https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190411/5g/cloud-native-5g-reader-forum  https://www.rcrwireless.com/20190411/5g/cloud-native-5g-reader-forum  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  29  2.6.4 Unikernels  Unikernel is an alternative to both VMs and containers for lightweight virtualisation of resources.  It can embed only one application and a limited set of its dependencies which, differently from  containers, also includes the libraries for hardware resource management [33]. It emerged due  to the idea that the majority of the functions running either in the cloud or at the edge do not  require many of the services inherent to OSs, and thus those services can be excluded.  Unikernels are single-purpose appliances that are specialised at compile time into standalone  kernels32. They are constructed with the minimal necessary libraries, modularly, compiled  together with the application code into an image (no division between kernel and user spaces)  that can be run on top of a hypervisor or directly on a hardware layer. Different library OSs (e.g.  IncludeOS, UKL, MirageOS, OSv, Rumprun, runtime.js) can be used to develop unikernels, with  slightly different security profiles, programming languages (some of them aiming to avoid  programming directly in C), and legacy compatibility.  Among other advantages, unikernels improve security over other virtualisation paradigms since  (i) they have no other functions or ports apart from the specific application they were built for,  thus the attack surface is minimal, and (ii) they achieve a degree of isolation similar to VMs and  much higher than containers, since the latter share a common kernel. Besides, due to their  specialisation, unikernels come with the benefit of faster boot times and lower image sizes than  containers, as well as a similar degree of memory consumption when running.  Still, unikernels have some drawbacks that come mainly from their immaturity. The most critical  one is related to the high development times as (i) kernel functionalities have to be carefully  selected and configured for the specific application, (ii) there is a lack of tools designed for  debugging unikernels, and (iii) to be updated they have to be shut down, updated, recompiled  and instantiated, a set of operations that is not possible to run on the fly.  The nature of unikernels33 make them suitable for deploying stateless, high-response, low-  latency VNFs located at Edge nodes. General algorithms (e.g. compression, encryption, data  32 A. Madhavapeddy et al., ‘Unikernels: Library Operating Systems for the Cloud’, ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 48, no. 4. 2013, pp. 461–72.  33 http://unikernel.org/projects/  http://unikernel.org/projects/  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  30  aggregation) and specific functions for vehicular edge computing (VEC), edge computing for  smart cities and augmented reality (AR)34 are use cases in which unikernels can be of utility.  The UNICORE project35, which aims at providing a toolchain for facilitating the development of  secure, portable, scalable, lightweight and high performance unikernels, foresees their potential  application in 5G-RAN, vCPE and serverless computing, among other fields. As current  virtualised infrastructure managers (VIMs) support unikernels, some H2020 5G-PPP projects  (such as 5G-MEDIA36, 5GCity37, Superfluidity38, 5G-Complete39, etc.) are using them jointly  with VMs and containers within their 5G deployments, being leveraged in tandem with  conforming services thus benefiting from their respective advantages.  2.6.5 VMs vs containers vs unikernels  Operators have been deploying VNFs for several years to replace hardware-based appliances.  Operators deploy network functions virtualisation (NFV) in one of three ways: on virtual  machines (VMs) with hypervisors; in containers; or using a hybrid approach. VMs have their  own operating system (OS), while containers share an OS. As such, containers are more  efficient because they don’t require multiple operating systems per host.  However, containers present several challenges for telecom-grade environments. The first  challenge is that sharing the OS creates the potential for applications and their containers to  interfere with each other or create resource contention. For mobile operators in particular, this  approach creates difficulties in both the control and data planes for a 5G environment, where  latency, efficiency, security and a high level of distribution are needed.  Unikernels, as a third option, primarily target the drawbacks of legacy VMs by compressing the  kernel and shared libraries to the bare minimum while maintaining compatibility with the  traditional cloud virtualisation stacks (hypervisors, controllers, MANO). Differently from  containers, which have a shared kernel, each unikernel has its own kernel. This allows better  isolation than containers. Table 6 provides a comparison of virtualisation technologies. In  addition, Figure 8 illustrates the main differences between the architecture of VMs, containers  and unikernels [33].

Such shared resources may expose security risks on  several different levels and the severity of the risk may depend on the nature of such tenants.  Below are the main NFV deployment models with varying risks that may be considered in a  virtualised environment. Main references used to develop this section are: [32], [23], [34], [35].  2.7.1 Single operator environment  The same operator owns, operates and controls completely the VNFs, the virtualisation layer  and the hardware and the premises in which they are located (see Figure 9). In this model, the  operator is only exposed to its own network elements and functions. In this model, the operator  must cater for most of the risks, since it has to implement security measures to protect the  different layer of NFV including VNFs, virtual resources, and physical infrastructure.  The operator must also implement robust Identity, credential and access management policies  to protect its assets and prevent attacks such as man-in-the-middle, whereby an attacker (e.g. a  malicious or compromised tenant) can illegitimately access the offered service. Malicious  insiders in the operator’s system administration represent a further risk of compromising the  operator’s reputation and exposing security risks to the tenant, which may receive compromised  services that may violate its data.  In this model, the tenant has no control over the infrastructure. Tenant data are stored within the  operator infrastructure and, thus, it is of paramount importance that strong security measures  necessary to protect these data are applied. Such measures include the prevention of data loss  and strong isolation when data belonging to different tenants share the same server (or  resources). Data breaches can also happen when a malicious tenant violates someone’s data.  With this model, consumers usually access the services offered through web browsers, thus the  operator must not overlook vulnerabilities in the software offered and in the protocols used (e.g.  HTTP) in order to protect its network from attacks. A typical category of attack is the abuse and  nefarious use of services performed, for example, by a consumer who executes a malware  injection or DoS attack on the operator’s server, profiting from the services offered.  Figure 9: Single operator environment model  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  32  2.7.2 Operator hosting virtual network operators  This is based on the single operator environment model. In this model, the network operator  hosts other virtual network operators within the same facility. It would probably isolate each  virtual operator on separate hardware. However, in theory, the VMs or containers of different  virtual network operators could run alongside each other over the same virtualisation layer (see  Figure 10). In this model, the operator is exposed to its own network elements and functions, as  well as the network elements and functions of the other virtual operators.  Figure 10: Operator hosting virtual network operators model  2.7.3 Third party hosting  A third-party cloud provider operates the computer hardware, infrastructure network and the  virtualisation layer on which VNFs are running. The premises, including cable chambers, patch  panels, etc., are physically secured by the third-party cloud provider. There are three scenarios  in this model (see Figure 11):  • scenario 1 – separate cloud for a single operator: in this scenario, the platform runs the  VNFs of a single operator;  • scenario 2 – community cloud for multiple operators: in this scenario, the platform runs  the VNFs of multiple operators;  • scenario 3 – public cloud for operators and other service providers: in this scenario, the  platform runs operator’s VNFs or other non-network related services.  In all scenarios, the operators are always accountable and responsible for the protection of  VNFs and data. In all scenarios, the operator is exposed to its own network elements and  functions as well as to the third-party hosting service that may not be accountable and that may  be able to transparently gather information emitted from the network infrastructure.  In scenario 2, the operator may also be exposed to network traffic from other operators. In  scenario 3, the operator may also be exposed to network traffic from other operators as well as  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  33  traffic from other services that may have lesser security and/or integrity requirements than the  operator.  In this model, the operator must avoid software VNF vulnerabilities to prevent an attacker from  making a nefarious use of services. For its part, the cloud provider must avoid software flaws in  the operating system, in the virtual resources and servers offered to the operator(s) while  guaranteeing them access to the platform through secure APIs to prevent malware Injections.  Due to weak isolation among resources of the platform assigned to different VNFs belonging to  diverse operators or to the non-network services of other service providers, attacks such as side  channel or VM or container data theft may occur. At the same time, applications or non-network  related services from other service providers that are not necessarily all trusted may run on the  same platform in different VMs or containers, so the operator can be damaged by an attacker  that manages to exploit a lack of isolation between a vulnerable VM or container and other VMs  or containers or the host machine, thus having illegitimate access to other VNFs belonging to  other operators or the cloud provider’s platform.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  34  2.7.4 Operator hosting third party service providers  In this model, the operator leaves to the service provider the task of deploying its own  applications, thus executing arbitrary software on the operator infrastructure (see Figure 12). In  this case the operator is in charge of protecting its assets, which include data and servers  underlying virtual resources offered as MEC services.  For the operator, potential threats can be caused in the following situations: (i) elevated  privileges are given to a service provider on storage access (data breach risks), (ii) the service  provider is able to control the infrastructure offered by the operator through insecure APIs  (insecure APIs risks) and execute arbitrary code (higher risk of hijacking of the elements of the  infrastructure by malicious service providers), and (iii) a service provider could run malicious  code through the operating system of its VM, thus penetrating the operator’s infrastructure, or  could, intentionally or accidentally, fail in updating its VM, thus exposing it to attacks.  2.7.5 Summary  The different deployment models described above are summarised in Table 7. It shows the  actor(s) involved on the management and operation at each layer of the NFV system for each  deployment model. The column ‘Location’ states the location where the infrastructure is  deployed. The column ‘Cloud Type’ identifies which NFV deployment scenarios are similar to  the common deployment models used in cloud computing.

This initial step will guide us to identify the best practices and provide  recommendations.  3.1 ASSETS  To address NFV challenges in a 5G ecosystem, it is essential to identify the assets of such a  complex ecosystem. The main asset categories introduced in this report are inspired from the  ENISA Threat Landscape for 5G Networks [6] (December 2020), [36] (November 2019) and  derived from the 5G NFV architecture described at the beginning of this report. These main  categories include components and entities from network products, management and  orchestration, data, processes and environment. A complete diagram of the asset mind maps is  present in Annex B.  Figure 13: 5G NFV asset categories  An assessment of the asset categories in maintaining security-related protection properties in  terms of CIA (confidentiality, integrity and availability) for each category is provided in Annex A.  The critical asset categories of 5G NFV to be protected are as follows (see Figure 13).  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  37  • The NFV network components category includes NFV components network planes,  functions, and elements. These divide into multiple asset groups such as core  functions, virtualisation infrastructure, network function virtualisation (NFV), physical  infrastructure, security, software-defined networking (SDN), Multi-Edge Computing  (MEC), among others.  • The NFV MANO network components category includes the management of network  functions (NFVO, VIM, VNFM), network slicing, operations support system,  network/element (EMS/NMS) and SDN Controller. MANO is the most vital part of the  5G infrastructure since it is responsible for controlling the entire set of network  functions, their virtualisation and the entire related software lifecycle.  • The NFV Data category includes users, applications, VNFs, NS, system, network,  SDN, configuration and security-related data.  • The NFV processes and environment category includes processes and facilities  related to MNOs and vendors.  3.2 SECURITY CHALLENGES  While NFV opens the door for flexible networks and rapid service creation, these offer both  security opportunities while also introducing additional security challenges and complexities.  The 5G networks would essentially promote the use of NFV technologies. NFV, like many new  technologies, presents new security challenges and these extend many of the security  challenges applicable to NFV to 5G networks. Thus, it is important to address the security  challenges appropriately and to focus on instilling stronger security and privacy settings in 5G  NFV systems.  In this chapter, we identify and describe the security challenges that the 5G NFV may face.  Documents used as references for the development of this chapter are provided in Annex G.  The challenges have been grouped into categories to make them more understandable. The  resulting list consists of seven categories (see Figure 14).  Figure 14: Categories of security challenges  Each category is provided in one section. Each section starts with an overview of the challenge  category followed by a table describing the associated challenges. A high-level mapping table  showing the relationship at the category level between challenge categories, vulnerabilities,  attacks, affected assets and best practices is provided in section 4.4. A detailed mapping is  provided in Annex F.  3.2.1 Virtualisation or containerisation  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  38  Cloud, virtualisation, containerisation, edge computing and SDN play additional roles in the era  of 5G. The scale, elasticity, agility, responsiveness and rich software functionality required for  5G applications and microservices can only be achieved in the cloud. Today NFV is carried out  on VMs and containers, and they’ll continue to be utilised in a 5G environment.  As with any new technology, the benefits may also present potential security challenges if  proper security measures are not considered. NFV enables network slicing by replacing network  functions on appliances such as routers, load balancers and firewalls with instances of  virtualised software that run on commodity hardware.  Virtual network functions and/or cloud-native network functions are used to run these functions  as packaged software which also means a much wider attack area. Moreover, SDNs enable  programmable network controls and abstract the underlying infrastructure from the apps and  network services. Centralised and controllable, SDNs provide the agility required to adapt to the  evolving needs of 5G microservices. However, SDNs are susceptible to attacks such as  forwarding device attacks, control pane threats, API vulnerabilities, counterfeit traffic flows and  more.  In the edge and far edge, operators are introducing VNFs which causes a new set of security  challenges. VMs or containers may require elevated privileges to support certain network  functions that could cause security vulnerabilities for the host system as well as peer VMs or  containers. Due to the unique characteristic of the NFV environment, different network functions  can be created and terminated dynamically on different and distributed entities.  The NFV approach allows for the dynamic distribution of the instantiated VNFs throughout the  virtualised infrastructure at the edge, at the core or at the operator’s datacentre. In the same  way, monitoring can also be distributed and take place at different locations in the operator’s  network covering different parts of the network. Dynamic distribution of NFV architectures pose  major security challenges that need to be considered.  A unique aspect of co-residency in NFV is that, in an NFV stack, co-residency can happen  between more layers, such as between VNFs and the virtualisation layer or between the  virtualisation layer and physical hosts. The co-residency of VNFs on the same physical host can  occur due to placement or migration, which is known to lead to side-channel or resource  depletion attacks due to the shared physical resources such as CPU, memory, or cache. The  co-residency of VNFs on the host can also occur when different tenants employ the same host  to run similar network functions, such as virtual firewall or virtual IDS. The fact that multiple  tenants are sharing both virtual and physical resources in the same NFV stack poses additional  security challenges. Table 8 illustrates the main security challenges raised by the virtualisation  or containerisation technologies.  Table 8: Main security challenges facing ‘virtualisation or containerisation’  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH-V1  Challenges  within the  runtime  software  Virtualisation of network functions will increase the network’s vulnerability to attackers due to the increased  reliance on software. A NFV software component may contain potential software vulnerabilities or it can be a  malware itself. In virtualised implementations all VNFs are implemented using a common software platform  such as OpenStack, Kubernetes.  While vendors may produce tweaked variants, the code core will be largely identical. Similarly, host OS,  hypervisor, CIS and VNFs software will be identical or from a limited set of variants. What this means is that  if an attacker is able to identify a software vulnerability in one VNF, that vulnerability will likely exist in many  other VNFs making the attackers job much easier and increases the risk of a cascading security failure in  the network. If network security functions (e.g. SEPP) use the same software core or are in the same  virtualisation layer trust domain as the functions they are protecting, the risk increases further if a software  vulnerability occurs.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  39  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  Note: the term ‘trust domain’ is defined by ETSI in [17]. It is a collection of entities that share a set of security  policies. In NFV networks, multiple trust domains should be considered by CSPs during the deployment  phase where a CSP wishes to achieve security role and management separation, security isolation,  separation between sensitive and non-sensitive components, etc.  CH-V2  Flexibility and  openness of  service  environment  Virtualisation technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network functions virtualisation  (NFV) are thriving in anticipation of 5G networks. However, they too come with new security concerns.  Because of their open, flexible, programmable nature, SDN and NFV open a new avenue of security threats.  The promised flexibility and openness of service environments via VNFs raises security concerns since data  and NFV software are not directly controlled by the more risk-aware enterprises due to the risk of  introspection by a malicious actor with total control on the execution environment entailing memory, storage  and processing elements.  CH-V3  Challenges  within the  hypervisor  Hypervisor security mean ensuring that virtualised network elements are protected from exfiltration and VM- based attacks that come from east-west and north-south traffic.  The most important software in a NFV is the hypervisor. Any security vulnerability in the hypervisor and  associated infrastructure and management software or tools puts VNFs at risk.  The hypervisor is fully aware of the current state of each guest OS it controls. Hypervisor introspection can  enable the ability to view, inject, and/or modify information on the operational status associated with NFV  through direct or indirect methods. Access to status information can result in the ability to arbitrarily read  and/or write the contents of memory, storage, key storage and other NFV operational aspects.  CH-V4 Time  manipulation  The virtualisation infrastructure provides a flexible environment for hosting several applications and  telecommunication services. Precise and secure timing services and time-stamping of events are critical to  many of those services (e.g. mobile wireless) and applications (e.g. high frequency trading, financial  transactions, banking systems, billing, etc.). The virtualisation infrastructure itself requires timing and  synchronisation for fault management (through logging of events) and security management (through  identity and access management).  A fundamental problem with all virtualised implementations is that VNFs have trouble accurately telling the  time and generating entropy. Unlike a PNF which can easily be designed to have direct access to a physical  clock, a VNF’s view of time is only virtual.  If an attacker or, in some scenarios, a malicious VM or container on the same host is able to manipulate the  virtual CPU clock then is it possible to affect management or service functions such as manipulating  cryptographic algorithms, key generation or other processes which are highly time dependent or may also  impact the synchronisation between UEs and the network. Such manipulation may involve stretching the  shape of clock cycles rather than simply increasing or decreasing their frequency. ETSI GR NFV-SEC 01640  (draft specification - work in progress) provides more detailed discussion on timing issues with virtualised  environments.  CH-V5 Entropy  generation  Entropy is used across VNFs. When VNFs do not have access to high quality entropy it can negatively affect  security due to weak cryptographic keys.  The key point of cryptography is cryptographic algorithms and keys. The random number generator is used  to generate seeds and keys randomly in many cryptographic operations. The strength and security of keys  depends on their randomness. For this reason it is essential to use keys, for instance, to encrypt and decrypt  information, and the security of these keys is closely related to the quality of entropy. If not enough quality  entropy is available predictable keys may be produced, which are susceptible to a breach.  For these reasons, a reliable source of entropy ensuring strong and random key generation is required to be  used by the cryptographic operations (e.g. encryption).  CH-V6 Encrypted data  processing  In a virtualised environment it is necessary to explicitly consider the risk to cryptographic processing of data  within a VNF where a fully hardened HSM or HMEE (hardware mediated execution environment) is not used  to perform the cryptographic function.  Most software manipulating data with cryptographic operations will perform modification actions on  encrypted data by first unencrypting the data either in general memory (less than ideal) or CPU cache  (better but vulnerabilities exist). Following the necessary processing, the data will be encrypted again.  Within existing SA3 specifications, while some specialist operations are performed in tamper resistant  hardware (e.g. UICC), the bulk of cryptographic processing (e.g. user plane protection) will be performed  using general X86 (or similar) servers within the core network.  In a virtualised environment there are various ways in which unencrypted data can be captured: through the  virtualisation layer, server management hardware, modification of VNF images, instantiating a parallel VM or  container on the same physical CPU, or any number of other options. The risks of being able to capture  encrypted data in an unencrypted form due to the processing of that data, increases significantly. If that  processing is highly sensitive (e.g. AUC (authentication centre) or LI functions) then the risk may not be  40 https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Drafts/SEC016_Location_Locstamp_Timestamp/NFV-SEC016v007.zip  https://docbox.etsi.org/ISG/NFV/Open/Drafts/SEC016_Location_Locstamp_Timestamp/NFV-SEC016v007.zip  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  40  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  acceptable. Placing entire VMs into HMEE(s) is unlikely to be needed as it is more appropriate to place  specific sub-functions, processes or containers into a HMEE which current CPU based HMEE(s) can  support. However, in most cases this support is not currently OS kernel native.  CH-V7  Challenges  within IP layer  vs application  layer  In a PNF implementation there are significant differences (pros and cons) between using security protocols  such as IPSec designed to protect IP traffic over 3GPP reference points and over the top end to end  application layer security (typically using TLS). Both are good at providing protection again a physical  attacker trying to attack a physical cable or optical fibre but their characteristics vary in terms of where the  encryption terminates in relation to where the data is processed or stored. TLS is considered to terminate  closer to the point where a function processes or manages data, whereas IPSec may terminate at a PNF  closer to the edge of the network.  In flat virtualised deployments with a common virtualisation layer and resources, there is very little difference  between IPSec and TLS with neither offering, by default, protection from virtualisation layer (host OS,  hypervisor, CIS) attacks. In this scenario, both IPSec and TLS tunnels terminate in arbitrary memory  locations which will be in the same accessible range as the plain text data they are intended to protect.  Unless the IPSec or TLS tunnels transverse a physical network linked externally to the datacentres, the  threats they mitigate can largely become irrelevant. Using HMEEs massively improves security (see ETSI  TS NFVSEC 01241). However, it is clearly impractical for all TLS or IPSec endpoints for all control plane or  user plane traffic to be terminated in HMEEs.  CH-V8  Default  deployment or  configuration  If a new, or a modification of, an existing VNF is deployed or instantiated into the production environment  where it is connected to traffic and signalling interfaces, there is a risk that the VNF may become  compromised before the element management EMS) has successfully configured the interface security  controls. This may be caused by default or due to minimal security controls existing in the VNFD (virtual  network function descriptor) or image.  A common VNFD instance or image may be used to deploy multiple images of the same VNF. It is probable  that each VNFD image will contain the same default security credentials and configuration. Between  deployment and configuration these default security credentials may increase the exposure of the NFV  elements to compromise, due to, for example, the same guest ‘root’ password, crypto private keys, and  TLS/IPsec certificates.  CH-V9 Network traffic  exposure  Existing monitoring systems need to be adapted and correctly controlled since they were meant mostly for  physical and not virtual systems and boundaries, and do not allow fine‐grained analysis adapted to the  needs of SDN/NFV based 5G network management. The lack of visibility and controls on internal virtual  networks that are created, coupled with the heterogeneity of devices used, make many performance  assessment applications ineffective. For instance, existing security monitoring applications cannot monitor  virtual connections in 5G network elements.  Increased virtualisation introduces challenges for network monitoring. Due to the virtualised architecture of  5G networks and deployment of network functions closer to the radio access network or network access  edge, it will be more difficult to detect and recognise the types of traffic inside and between VNFs crossing  these networks and mitigate against any new threats. This could lead to difficulty in diagnosing network  performance issues or failure to spot attackers.  Traffic routed through a virtualised network may not be completely accessible for physical firewall controls or  visible to traditional security inspections as previously applied on physical networks.  CH- V10  Security logs  troubleshooting  failure  NFV should be able to determine the source of attacks and recover, and protect against that source in the  future. It should be verified that every security event is logged. NFV components may generate a huge  number of logs on the virtualisation platform, therefore log analysis and event correlation in NFV will quickly  become a ‘big data’ issue. Tools also are needed that can address all the forensics and compliance  requirements.  Compromised VNFs can generate a huge number of logs on the virtualisation platform, making it difficult to  analyse logs from other VNFs, especially when the initial entries in the log files are deleted. There is also a  risk when the infrastructure logs are leaked, as this consequently enables cross relating logs from one VNF  operator to another in order to extract sensitive information.  CH- V11  Container  acceleration  capabilities  Container acceleration capabilities, such as container caching, present security challenges as otherwise  encrypted VM equivalent image artefacts may be available in their unencrypted form in the cache to allow for  fast container re-instantiation.  The fast cycle times of containers also make traditional security monitoring and policy enforcement more  challenging as network security enforcement decision engines cannot so easily make real-time decisions on  access permission as is possible for longer lifetime VMs.  Techniques using both containers and VMs provide some mitigation (e.g. running all containers for a specific  VNF with a large VM, or using VMs for VNF security sensitive components such as TLS end points). Using  this approach, however, restricts the flexibility of containers and introduces additional complexity or cost.  41 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/012/03.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec012v030101p.pdf  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/012/03.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec012v030101p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  41  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V12  Container  isolation failure  From a security and isolation perspective, in the container deployment scenario the VM hypervisor is  replaced by a CIS which manages the life-cycle of a container within a given group of containers (e.g. pod or  cluster). However, the CIS does not provide equivalent VM security memory isolation or breakout protection.  The container application usually runs on ‘bare metal’ with no OS equivalent to the guest OS used in VM  based implementations.  The newer generation of NFV implementations have chosen to deploy NF as a group of containers due,  especially, to the benefits associated with containers and aspects of their deployment over traditional VM  deployment. Such deployments can be highly flexible by allowing the operators to deploy multiple NFs as a  collection of small microservices on the same physical machines and/or even deploy NF containers within  VMs. Containers co-hosted on the same physical machine as tenants share the same kernel and OS  resources. This allows for a potential risk that a rogue container could escape the confinement of the  container and have an impact on other co-hosted containers.  There are multiple ways for attackers to escape isolation in the container. There have been reports that a  number of CVEs have documented known vulnerabilities that have been identified in the past. One way to  escape containers is to exploit vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel enforces container  isolation by employing namespaces and cgroups. However, if attackers gain kernel level privileges through  privilege escalation, they can circumvent isolation as reported in CVEs (e.g. CVE-2019-5736, CVE-2020- 15257and CVE-2021-31440). There are CVEs that have reported vulnerabilities in container runtimes that  allow container breakouts.  CH- V13  Sensitive data  in NF container  images  There are scenarios which benefit from including configuration and secrets, such as passwords or  credentials, in NF container images. For example, containers need to be able to connect to other containers  within the deployment as well as with external entities. All these connections need to be authenticated and  secured. One way of achieving this is to provide the requisite secrets or keys to the containers which allow  them to authenticate and be authenticated and secure the communication channel. A common but in-secure  means of providing secrets to the containers is by packaging the secrets or the keys with the image itself.  But there is the risk that the same can be extracted, read or manipulated before the container is deployed  and the secret used.  With a long supply chain, container images are vulnerable to outside scrutiny. With container images  containing secrets or keys, this becomes a serious threat vector. Adversaries can extract them by obtaining  a copy of the image and they can be potentially shared with third parties for illicit gain.  • Secrets embedded within a container image can be stolen  • Secrets embedded within a container image can be modified  CH- V14  Core network  functions in the  MEC  Multi-access edge computing (MEC) transforms the way data is processed and stored by moving some core  network functions closer to the end user at the network edge, rather than relying on a central location that  may be hundreds of miles away. The introduction of untrusted 5G components into the MEC could expose  core network elements to risks introduced by software and hardware vulnerabilities, counterfeit components  and component flaws caused by poor manufacturing processes or maintenance procedures.  The presence of system components, such as hypervisors, CISs, operating systems and applications in the  MEC, may provide malicious actors with additional attack vectors to intercept, manipulate and destroy critical  data. Untrusted components or malware inserted within the MEC may impact user privacy by providing  malicious actors the capability to clone devices and impersonate end-users to make calls, send texts, and  use data. Malicious actors can use untrusted components or malware to gain access to the MEC and end- user components, leveraging them to gain access to the wider radio access network (RAN).  CH- V15  Wide  geographical  distribution of  MEC  infrastructures  As MEC Infrastructures can span a wide geographical distribution and be located in challenging  environments, maintaining a uniform datacentre level of physical security is a significant challenge. A  potential flaw in the physical security of any MEC hardware may result in physical attack on the  infrastructure. Physical security and environmental vulnerabilities of MEC hosts may arise due to improper  physical and environmental security of edge computing facilities, improper security monitoring of edge  computing facilities, etc.  CH- V16  Insecure  API/improper  authentication  of MEC  components  APIs are a well-known subject of multiple attack types, as they are exposed to external access. The  common API framework CAPIF is used by 3GPP as the standardised means to support providing and  accessing APIs (and ETSI MEC is fully aligned with CAPIF). From a software development point of view,  compliance with CAPIF should be ensured during API design and implementation phases. Further, the  vulnerabilities in the service-based interface (SBI) of MEC components can include improper transport layer  protection of data transferred over internal interfaces and improper verification of identity and access control  to authorised MEC applications.  CH- V17  Insufficient/impr oper Monitoring  Mechanisms of  MEC  components  Since MEC is based on virtualised infrastructure, it needs to include real-time security management based  on NFV specifications (see ETSI GS NFV-SEC 013) [38]. Especially when deploying MEC in NFV  environments, MEC should be considered as part of a whole system real-time security monitoring and  management strategy. Insufficient or improper monitoring mechanisms of MEC components can result from  insufficient logging of security events for MEC App and MEC host.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  42  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V18  Centralisation  of the SDN  control  platforms  SDN centralises the network control platforms and enables programmability in communication networks.  These two disruptive features, however, create opportunities for cracking and hacking the network. For  example, the centralised control will be a favourable choice for DoS attacks and exposing the critical  application programming interfaces (APIs) to unintended software can bring the whole network down [39].  The SDN controller modifies flow rules in the data path, hence the controller traffic can be easily identified.  This makes the controller a visible entity in the network rendering it a favourite choice for DoS attacks. The  centralisation of network control can also make the controller a bottleneck for the whole network due to  saturation attacks as presented in [40],[41].  CH- V19  Malicious SDN  applications  Since most network functions can be implemented as SDN applications, malicious applications if granted  access can spread havoc across a network and constrict bandwidth and negatively affect operations.  CH- V20  Common SDN  interfaces  Before 5G networks, mobile networks had dedicated communication channels based on GTP (GPRS  tunnelling protocol) and IPsec tunnels. A significant level of expertise is required to attack communication  interfaces, such as X2, S1, S6, S7, which are used only in mobile networks. However, SDN-based 5G  networks will not have such dedicated interfaces but rather common SDN interfaces. The openness of these  interfaces will increase the possible set of attackers.  The communication in SDN based 5G mobile networks can be categorised into three communication  channels, i.e. data channel, control channel and inter-controller channel [42]. In current SDN system, these  channels are protected by using TLS (transport layer security) sessions [43]. However, TLS sessions are  highly vulnerable to IP layer attacks [44], SDN scanner attacks [45] and lack strong authentication  mechanisms [46].  CH- V21  Isolation failure  between VNFs  The execution of diverse VNFs over the same NFV infrastructure sharing computing resources (e.g. CPU,  memory) and networking (e.g. vSwitches, physical NICs) can create security issues, if VNFs are not properly  isolated from other VNFs, from the virtualisation platform, from the host and from the network infrastructure.  Security measures enforcing the isolation shall be implemented in a hypervisor hosting multiple VMs or a  CIS hosting multiple containers with different security levels, for example, between VNFs supporting lawful  interception (LI) with non-critical VNFs.  There are various approaches to isolating VNFs, ranging from using physically separate hardware to using  separate VMs or containers.  There are several security threats if VNFs are not appropriately isolated, and resources are not shared  effectively. These include the noisy neighbour problem and potential side-channel attacks.  Note:  • Noisy neighbour is a term commonly used to describe situations in NFV infrastructure where an  application experiences degradation in performance due to the fact that some of the resources it needs  are occupied by other applications in the same cloud node. These situations cannot be easily identified  using straightforward approaches, which calls for the use of sophisticated methods for the  management of NFV infrastructure.  • Side channel attacks occur when an attacker is capable of gathering actionable information about  cryptographic secrets by observing the implementation of a platform (for example, power consumption,  run time, etcetera) and use that information to induce faults or modify the cache. Side channel attacks  do not necessarily require detailed information on the platform or system being attacked. Many side  channel attacks rely on statistical analysis of platform metadata that is typically exchanged (or  available) in the clear. NFV platform is susceptible to side channel attacks just like regular (non-virtual)  platforms.  CH- V22  Memory  introspection  In a virtual environment while the virtualisation layer plays a role in preventing one VM or container from  accessing the memory of another (except through declared VM or container shared memory locations), the  virtualisation layer is also able to inspect any memory which is directly under its control.  The virtualisation layer access to memory or other VM or container resources cannot be detected by VM or  container or 3GPP security mechanisms. Encrypting memory provides some resistance but if the keys used  to encrypt the memory are also under hypervisor or CIS control (including hypervisor or CIS resource  controlled TPM / HSMs) then this does not prevent introspection.  In addition to reading memory, the hypervisor or CIS is also in many cases able to write directly to memory,  bypassing normal memory access controls and security within the VM or container. This allows an attacker  with access to the hypervisor or CIS to change data within a VNF at run-time or indeed change the operation  of the VNF itself.  Container based NFV environments are subject to similar memory introspection risks, with the container (or  cluster) management engine providing similar functionality to the hypervisor in VM based implementations.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  43  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V23  Trusted  domains  segmentation  5G network functions can be grouped into different trust domains which have varying security requirements.  For example, trust in functions which contain long-term cryptographic keys might require different levels of  trust to functions which only hold session keys or those which do not contain cryptographic values at all.  However, this classification is too simplistic. Nearly all 3GPP NFs will contain some sensitive private  information for billing purposes or cryptographic material. Applying the same security policies to NFs in  different trust domains could lead to reduced security and/or reduced functionality.  Security domains based on grouping whole NFs may not be sufficient. In some scenarios (e.g. LI), sub- functions of NFs (e.g. LI POIs) may need to belong to different trust domains to the rest of the NF  functionality.  The definition of appropriate segregation and security policies for NFs in different trust domains requires the  establishment of trust domains for 3GPP NFs. It is up to 3GPP to define what a sensitive function or sub- function is and how they must be handled to protect privacy or security sensitive data, within a virtualised  environment.  While 3GPP TS 33.50142 provides some consideration for 5G network functions, CSPs are also in the  process of virtualising IMS or 3G/4G networks, for which similar consideration has not yet been given.  CH- V24  Access to  storage  resources  NFV environments run on server hardware (blade). In some use cases, there may be a need for using local  storage. The common deployment is to use a SAN. The deployment of SANs within the NFV environments  may have various risks, including copying an image or removing the local storage device to gain access and  obtain sensitive information.  A compromised VM or container can launch an attack on the SAN to obtain access to a storage area  containing critical images and data  The availability of the SAN is essential in a virtualised environment and any DoS attacks would affect the  entire NFV.  CH- V25  Sharing of  private keys  between VNFs  and  confidentiality  of sensitive  data  In the 5G core network, NF communications are secured using TLS, according to the profiles in TS 33.210.  ECDSA and RSA are used to authenticate these communications. Therefore, a VNF must contain private  keys to authenticate these exchanges. These keys need to be provisioned to VMs or containers securely on  first boot or need to be stored securely on the image in some fashion.  A decision also needs to be made as to whether two NF instances may share the same key pair, for  example if the second instance is to be deployed in case the first fails.  Certain VNFs will hold sensitive data, which should not be available to other VNFs or which should only be  made available in a specific set of circumstances. For example, the 3GPP TS 33.501 includes the  requirement that long-term keys shall never leave the secure environment of the UDM/ARPF.  To have the same level of confidence in the confidentiality of sensitive data when stored in a VNF as when it  is stored on physically separated hardware, it is necessary to consider new threat vectors. For example, the  long-term keys in a virtual UDM/ARPF could be stolen by an attacker with root access to the virtualisation  layer. Alternatively, cache side-channel attacks might allow the operator of a VNF sharing resources to  recover data.  CH- V26  Availability of  network  functions  One of the advantages of virtualisation is that a network can scale and transform to meet demand. In  general, it is likely that the availability of required VNFs is less of a concern than in a physical deployment.  However, virtualisation does introduce new availability risks. For example, shared resources might be  monopolised by a neighbouring VM or container (the noisy neighbour problem).  Many VNFs are essential for the 5G core network to function. For example, if a UDM/ARPF is not available  then a user cannot complete primary authentication. Similarly, if an AMF is not available then a connection  cannot be managed. Therefore, it is important that the VNF is guaranteed to be available in the same way as  a physical network function would be.  CH- V27  Software  catalogue  image  exposure  Virtualised networks define convenient software onboarding APIs and use central software catalogues to  hold the VNF images prior to instantiation. There has been significant resistance in ETSI ISG NFV and  open-source communities to mandate full mandatory integrity checking of software images at both the  overall package and sub-component (artefact) level. Current implementations offer minimal if any mandatory  signing and where they do, this is based purely on vendor signatures. Therefore, in theory at least, any  image from the same vendor would pass verification checks if loaded into the wrong CSP software  catalogue.  Furthermore, the software catalogues with or without integrity protection provide a standardised description  of the VNFs, their resource requirements, their configuration and ultimately the compiled executables that  make up the VNF. If an attacker can access the catalogue then they will be able to gain directly a lot of  information which can then be used to attack running instances of the VNF. Where those VNFs contain  cryptographic functions or sensitive information, this increases the risk further.  42 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169  https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  44  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  Based on current virtualisation standards in ETSI and Open Source, the protection of the confidentiality of  whole images or artefacts during run-time, on-boarding, storage, and instantiation is not supported, although  for LI purposes this was recommended in ETSI TS NFV-SEC 011.  CH- V28  Multi-vendors  integration  At the integration and deployment stage of the NFV, the major challenges are related to interoperability  between different vendors and how to integrate the software components, hardware, and security solutions  of multiple vendors into a stable and efficient system, and how to assign SLA agreements between different  components.  Hardware, the virtualisation layer, VNFs and control solutions for cloud resources may be provided by  different vendors, increasing the risk of security holes due to mismatched assumptions and expectations.  Security solutions within NFV could be provided by different vendors, which may be complex to manage and  monitor, resulting in the operator not using these security solutions.  CH- V29  Multi-tenants  Co-residency  As an NFV stack is multi-tenant in nature, placing and migrating a VNF can be a challenging task for the  provider due to the issue of co-residency. It is well known that co-residency may lead to various security  issues, such as side-channel attacks, and additionally the tenant may have specific requirements in terms of  (the lack of) co-residency. Co-residency may occur in an NFV environment when a VNF is first placed or  when an existing VNF is migrated. The tenant requirements may specify that certain VNFs are to be placed  on a dedicated host or a VM or container needs to have an auto-scaling feature such that its need for more  space can be quickly fulfilled. In terms of security, co-resident VNFs may belong to tenants with conflicting  interests, and the co-residency may enable an insider attack with increased privileges and connectivity not  available to regular attackers.  The co-residency of VNFs on the same VM or container can also occur when different tenants employ the  same VM or container to run similar network functions, such as a virtual firewall or virtual IDS.  Lack of multi-tenant controls in an operator’s NFV infrastructure or MANO, where multiple tenants are  supported, increases the opportunity for the compromise of a VNF and the underlying NFV infrastructure  (e.g. supporting network, host OS, hypervisor, CIS, storage, hardware IO, compute and memory).  CH- V30  Elastic nature  of NFVI- migration of  VNFs  Due to the dispersion of VMs or containers that belong to a VNF across racks and datacentres within the  NFVI PoP in the core, MEC and RAN, and due to the migration of VMs or containers for optimisation or  maintenance purposes, the physical perimeters of the network functions become blurred and ‘fluid’ making it  practically impossible to manually define and manage security zones. If a VM or container is migrated to  another cluster where the security level is different or security measures are lacking, the VNFs may be  exposed to untrusted network traffic.  5G involves the active use of mobile edge computing technology (MEC). These can be corporate  applications running on service providers’ networks: intelligent services, financial services, multimedia, etc. It  should be noted that in this case, a 5G provider’s networks are integrated into the corporate infrastructure.  This gives the attacker new opportunities for entering corporate networks, as the MEC equipment is placed  outside the protected perimeter of an organisation.  CH- V31  Geographical  location  Using NFV, the violation of regulatory policies and laws becomes possible by moving one VNF from a legal  location to another illegal location. The consequences of violating regulatory policies can be a complete  banning of the service and/or the imposition of a financial penalty, which may be the original intention of the  attacker in order to harm the service provider.  For some VNFs (or subcomponents) it is necessary to know exactly where a VNF is (or at least in which  datacentre it resides).  By default, cloud hosting environments do not by nature provide an attestable guarantee of physical location  of a host or VNF. It is possible to indirectly attest location through host IDs but it is also possible to move a  host from one location to another. 3GPP functions such as AUC, UDM or LI functions need to be attestable  within the boundaries of a specific physical location (ETSI TR NFV-SEC 016 discusses some of these  issues).  Furthermore, if functions such as SEPP are supposed to be the physical boundary of a network then it may  be necessary to be able to constrain them, and the SDN routing to them, to specific physical locations.  CH- V32  Data life cycle  and location  In virtualised environments, it is necessary to consider where data has been and whether that data is  sensitive as regards privacy. If a VNF moves from one host to another or is terminated, and the previous  resources are allocated to another VNF without being fully cleared, this risks compromising privacy sensitive  data or keys.  OSs are not unknown to proliferate temp files, which in a PNF is much easier to contain (ignoring PNFs with  external storage). In a VNF, if storage or memory is not fully erased before reuse there is a significant risk of  data loss between VNFs. By extension, software is not unknown to crash or experience abnormal behaviour,  increasing the risk of data remaining in undesirable locations.  If a VNF cannot securely attest what host it is running on then high security functions could be deployed on  vulnerable hosts.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  45  ID Challenge  title Challenge description  CH- V33  VNF host  spanning  VNFs are large complex lumps of functionality which span multiple physical hardware hosts in a virtualised  implementation. In a virtualised environment, access to the interconnections between servers making up a  single VNF can be gained much more easily.  While there is a risk of an attacker gaining physical access to the interconnections between servers making  up a single PNF, this generally requires physical access to the hardware. In a virtualised environment,  however, access can be gained much more easily as the servers making up a function are more likely to be  physically distributed and the SDN v-switch would allow an attacker to fork IP packets flowing much more  easily between remote hosts Such forking is very difficult to detect or prevent from within a VNF unless  specific mitigation during design is taken to minimise the risk.  While TLS automatically applied by the NFV or SDN layer between VMs or containers reduces threats from  external attackers, it is much less effective against attackers who have (or have gained) access to NFV  MANO, etc.  CH- V34  Dynamic nature  of network  functions  One of the main persistent challenges to the use of NFV in mobile networks is the dynamic nature of VNFs  that leads to configuration errors and thus security lapses.  For instance, using NFV, virtual networking components (e.g. virtual routers and virtual networks) can be  easily created. Quick and dynamic service decisions can result in human error when a virtual router is  created and used to interconnect virtual networks without the use of any firewall. Compared to physical  network appliance deployments, the dynamicity of virtual network appliances and its connectivity can lead to  improper separation between the network and its subnets.  3.2.2 Orchestration and management  The MANO layer is considered as the brains of all operations for the creation, configuration,  provision and monitoring of network services and their related components. In contrast, it can  be seen as a single point of failure and an attractive target for attack, as any compromised  operations may lead to the failure of an entire system.  The main function of MANO is to control the connectivity between VNFs, create the  relationships between VNFs and virtual infrastructure resources, maintain a sequence of  network forwarding paths, and address all the service chaining processes. However, a lack of  consistency on how to manage and orchestrate the network services can incur security  challenges. Table 9 illustrates the main security challenges raised by the orchestration and  management of the 5G NFV.  Table 9: Main security challenges facing 'orchestration and management’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- OM1  MANO single point of  failure  MANO is the control node of an NFV. It controls all VNFs and indirectly (via the virtualisation layer) it  can access all data within those VNFs. Compromising MANO would effectively compromise all VNFs.  MANO are responsible for on-boarding, instantiation, termination and lifecycle management of all VNF  within a virtualised network. Combined with 3GPP layer OSS/BSS functions they control all VNFs and  indirectly (via the virtualisation layer) can access all data within those VNFs, unless specially  protected. Compromising MANO would effectively compromise all VNFs (to a much lesser extent the  same applies to the OSS/BSS). Therefore, for VNFs to be secure, NFs need to have minimum  security guarantees from MANO and be designed to be resistant to compromise of the underlying  MANO system.  Communications with and within NFV MANO: attackers may try to eavesdrop or modify the traffic that  transits between the NFVI and the NFV MANO, as well as traffic within the NFV MANO.  NFVO and/or VNFM: attackers may attempt to exploit these two components to disrupt the lifecycle  management of the network services (purpose of the orchestrator) or of individual VNFs (main role of  the VNFM).  In case of a DoS attack or a failure, the NFVO may be reliant on other elements (e.g. SDN controller  or VIM) under its configuration control to enable them to boot, reallocate resources and reload their  configuration. There is a risk that, should a major event occur, parts of the NFV infrastructure may  remain out of service causing major service issues.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  46  ID Challenge title Challenge description  In addition, any change, termination, or re-instantiation of security critical NFV elements, by the NFVO  and VNFM, where the critical data is overwritten, may compromise the integrity of the network; for  example, deletion of customer specific profiles, LEA target information or AuC keys.  The VIM is responsible for the management of the NFVI resources used by the VNFs (compute,  network and storage) and attacking it could, for example, allow denial of service (DoS) or data theft,  bypassing the isolation of the hypervisor or CIS.  CH- OM2  Orchestration  compromise and policy  violations  There are risks that:  • new, or changes to existing, MANO descriptor files 43 44 (e.g. network service templates, VNF  forwarding graph descriptor, VNF descriptor) could be made without applying the correct security  and affinity/anti-affinity policy rules45 between VMs or containers leading to local legal and  regulatory issues, increased risks of fraud and SDN and NFV elements exposed to additional  security vulnerabilities;  • an existing virtualised element (e.g. VNF, SDN Controller) managed by the NFVO may be  removed while there is still an existing operational service dependency from another network  element or system, causing a service outage and loss of availability.  If the NFVO user interface allows for the editing, importing or generation of such provisioning or  instantiation of script files (yml or other) that are used to manage VNFs (e.g. initiation and termination,  description of internal and external connectivity, dependencies between VNFCs), several attack  vectors may be exploited by an attacker.  CH- OM3  Resource integrity  caused by manual  changes or failure to  update resource  inventory  There could be a loss of integrity on the orchestration resource inventory with the SDN controllers,  VNFM service configuration caused by direct manual configuration at the SDN/NFV layer.  During the service management processes, commands may be correctly initiated from the NFVO to  the SDN controller and/or VIM, VNFM; however, the success or failure of these commands may not  be reflected in the service and resource inventories which could cause issues for data integrity.  CH- OM4  Vulnerabilities within  orchestration protocols  The protocols used by the NFVO to communicate with the components needed to manage the  virtualised environment may be vulnerable and attacks could be realised in several ways:  • Spoofing of the NFVO’s service requests may result in an attacker being able to generate  service requests to cause a DoS by:  o provisioning new instances in order to delete the number of resources available to the  NFV or SDN components;  o retiring NFV instances or SDN elements that are in use by the operational network;  o changing the SDN configuration.  This risk could impact a single element or the whole mobile network.  • Spoofing as an SDN controller, VIM or VNFM to send service management requests to the  NFVO on the resource performance could cause the NFVO to initiate changes on the  infrastructure. This exploit could be used by an attacker who wants to force the NFVO to move a  NFV component to another datacentre where the attacker may have physical access or has  compromised the virtualisation layer and wants to monitor customer traffic.  3.2.3 Administration and access control  Much of the openness and programmability offered by the 5G NFV network architecture relies  on the expanded use of APIs. The exploitation can target different types of API namely internal  network functions, internetworking interfaces, roaming interfaces, etc. exposed in different  layers of the network. A poorly designed or configured API with inaccurate access control rules  may expose network functions and sensitive parameters. Table 10 illustrates the main security  challenges raised by the administration of and access control to the 5G NFV.  Table 10: Main security challenges facing ‘administration and access control’  43 https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20014v3.3.1%20-%20GS%20- %20Network%20Service%20Templates%20Spec.pdf  44 https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/88/materials/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf  45 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-ifa/001_099/011/02.03.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa011v020301p.pdf  https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20014v3.3.1%20-%20GS%20-%20Network%20Service%20Templates%20Spec.pdf https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Publications_pdf/Specs-Reports/NFV-IFA%20014v3.3.1%20-%20GS%20-%20Network%20Service%20Templates%20Spec.pdf https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/88/materials/slides-88-opsawg-6.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-ifa/001_099/011/02.03.01_60/gs_nfv-ifa011v020301p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  47  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH-AC1 Malicious insiders  Whoever commits a malicious action is not necessarily an outsider to the virtualised system.  Accidentally or intentionally, even an insider, such as a system administrator (e.g. hypervisor or CIS  administrator), could behave incorrectly.  Administration roles can be used to manage the NFV environment. This environment can be used by  the hypervisor or CIS administrator to eavesdrop or modify sensitive data running on a VM or  container or transferring between NFV components.  Moreover, this administrator may be able to change or stop processes running in the VM or container,  give other applications access to the VM or container or steal critical security data.  CH-AC2 Single administrator  domain  NFV deployments usually rely on a single administration domain, with a global administrator who is  able to manage the hosts and NFV environment. As such, at some level, all VNFs regardless of their  sensitivity are potentially reduced to the same security level of the single administration domain.  Therefore, if an attacker is able to gain global administrator privileges, they will be able to control and  manage all network functions, regardless of their sensitivity and trust domain.  CH-AC3  Lack of staff with  the skillsets needed  to operate  virtualised networks  The virtualisation of network functions introduces a new risk because virtualisation is still a  comparatively new architecture and carriers may still be unfamiliar with the risks inherent in networks  that are more defined by software than hardware. A lack of staff with the skillsets needed to operate  virtualised networks may represent the greatest threat in telecommunication networks utilising this  new architecture.  CH-AC4  Insecure  management,  configuration, and  monitoring  interfaces  The interconnectivity among the virtualised end‐to‐end architectural components exposes new  interfaces that, unless protected, can create new security threats. Through management interfaces  users can access and interact with services offered by NFV. A management interface is easily  hackable if it is not adequately protected because it is exposed to any external entity, which could  abuse the privileges granted to it.  APIs play an integral part during provisioning, management, orchestration and monitoring of the  services running in the NFV framework, which makes them a perfect target for attackers. API abuse is  the most-frequent attack vector. An attacker may try to exploit insecure APIs in order to access or  tamper with NFV’s services and/or databases. APIs-based attacks can lead to data loss or leakage,  identity theft, system compromise, as well as service unavailability. Potential API-based attacks  against NFV framework include parameter attacks, identity attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks and  (distributed) denial of service attacks.  CH-AC5  Compromise of  orchestration  access control  One of the core features of NFV is management and orchestration which is, in essence, the ability to  dynamically scale network capacity up or down and continuously adapt to shifting requirements. This  may be realised through automated provisioning of network elements and or services. The  provisioning framework itself provides several attack vectors that may be exploited by an attacker.  These two features are highly centralised, which means the safe and stable operation of the entire  system will be jeopardised if the functions fail or are illegally controlled.  A poor authentication mechanism, weak access control and feeble authorisation rules may allow the  attacker to impersonate or appear as a legitimate authenticated and authorised user. The attacker  could then compromise the network and the NFV elements to influence their performance, behaviour  and services.  CH-AC6  Weak or insecure  authentication or  access control  authorisation to VIM  Attackers may be able to connect to VIM and break the administration password allowing them access  into VIM management features, which would allow them to modify the existing configuration causing a  DoS attack or to install unauthorised applications to facilitate fraud or eavesdropping.  VIM may accept all commands sent from the NFVO. Received Commands may cause changes to the  virtual environment that have a major service impact or cause a DoS.  Poor segregation between vendors within a VIM may allow a vendor access to the NFV configuration  of other vendors. The unauthorised access could cause knowingly or accidentally a DoS attack on a  competitor’s NFV by removing their VM or container resources.  3.2.4 New and legacy technologies  In the current NFV deployment, operators are incorporating NFV components into legacy  devices. In this hybrid architecture, the complete network management system is be divided into  two parts. The first part is a sub-system managing VNFs. The second part is the legacy OSS.  In order to avoid having to reconstruct the existing sub-system, the legacy OSS will stay  unchanged and will continue to manage existing PNFs. An interface between legacy OSS and  the virtualised environment is not precluded and could be a proprietary interface, based on the  operators’ requirements.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  48  Given that legacy or physical network function or devices will continue to be used for the  foreseeable future, operators will have to manage hybrid (part physical, part virtualised)  networks. Hence, existing OSS will need to be extended (in some way) to work together with the  new management and orchestration systems that support NFV.  There are also security challenges that should be considered for LI. The security challenges  raised by these hybrid physical and virtual network environments should be considered when  deploying the 5G telco management and orchestration architecture. Table 11 illustrates the  main security challenges raised by the mix of new and legacy technologies within a 5G NFV.  Table 11: Main security challenges facing ‘new and legacy technologies’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- LG1  Mixed virtual  and legacy PNF  deployments  Most virtualised deployments will commence with adding VNFs to an existing PNF based network. Over time  the number of VNFs will increase but mixed network deployments will be the default for the next 10+ years.  Similarly, mixed SDN and non-SDN linked NFs will also co-exist. By default, PNFs and VNFs have to be able  to implicitly trust each other in mixed deployments, given that 3GPP SA3 currently does not specify different  handling or trust relationships based on PNF or VNF implementation.  In mixed deployments, especially where older 3G CS NFs share common NFs (e.g. virtualised HSS, UDM)  with 4G or 5G higher security level VNFs, additional 3GPP security mechanisms may be required to prevent  attackers using insecure interfaces as the injection points against the otherwise secure VNFs (i.e. VNF  implicitly accepts messages from legacy PNF with lower security). However, the reverse attack also exists  where an attacker uses the much larger attack surface offered by VNFs to attack PNFs. VNFs would ignore  the messages but may well forward them to the less secure PNFs.  Attacks are also possible depending on the chain of VNF and PNFs, where an attacker injects messages  towards a VNF, which is forwarded to a PNF and finally to another VNF. While the first VNF and PNF are  unharmed by the attack, the second VNF falls foul of the implicit trust of PNF and VNF communications. It is  possible to conceive other similar chained attack scenarios where PNFs and VNFs exist together without  knowledge of each other’s implementation or trust domain segregation.  CH- LG2  Vulnerabilities of  physical hosts  X86 and similar server architectures have a number of physical security weaknesses from the perspective of a  critical national infrastructure. Plug and play interfaces (e.g. USB and removal RAID discs) unless disabled or  tightly controlled represent a risk to 3GPP NF security. However, more difficult to control attack vectors such  as PCI Express bus direct memory access (DMA) or use of OS swap or page files represent risks if physical  access to the server(s) hosting a 3GPP NF becomes possible. Similarly, most server firmware would detect  hardware changes (e.g. adding an extra copy of a physical network port which is visible to the host firmware),  but if the replacement hardware uses the same IDs and declared interfaces, this is much more difficult to  detect.  In legacy PNF implementations, such risks are better understood with physical constraints including secured  racks, physical testing of interfaces to confirm they are disabled and careful placement of more sensitive  functions (e.g. AUC) within CSP datacentres. However, for virtualised implements using large pools of  common hosts, physically securing all hosts (rather than those dedicated to a specific function) so that any  3GPP function can run on any host, while controlling physical access attacks is difficult to achieve. This threat  potentially increases with IAAS and NAAS deployments.  Furthermore, many datacentre hosts are equipped with baseband management controllers and intelligent  management interface protocol. If an attacker is able to access these controllers, they effectively have direct  control over all hosts and all VNFs running on them. Over recent years a number of such vulnerabilities have  occurred. For sensitive functions such as the AUC or LI functions, the risks would obviously be increased.  Almost all virtualised environments (e.g. NFV servers) rely on x86/64 architecture and common off-the-shelf  server hardware. Microprocessor side-channel security vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715,  CVE-2017-5754 (aka Spectre and Meltdown) can make NFV infrastructure a very valuable asset for attackers.  These vulnerabilities may lead to information disclosure and elevation of privilege. Mitigation and resolution of  these vulnerabilities are difficult and may call for both software (OS) and hardware (microcode) updates.  CH- LG3  Transformation  of legacy  OSS/BSS  Today’s OSS/BSS architectures are built on a solid but aging foundation, developed over several decades, for  telecom services that were relatively static and predictable. OSS/BSS systems are undergoing significant  changes in order to benefit from, and keep up with, the pace of innovation ushered in by SDN and NFV.  Operators seeking to take advantage of SDN and NFV to optimise their networks and improve agility can only  do so when a new generation of OSS/BSS processes is enhanced to cope with this new virtualised and cloud- based world. Migration will take time, as operators must adapt and upgrade complex and proprietary legacy  systems46.  46 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  49  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- LG4  Integration with  existing legacy  OSS/BSS  Most core legacy systems cannot support end-to-end functionality. It’s difficult for operators to deliver and  charge for low latency and high reliability, as well as assure it and provide an appropriate SLA because the  required billing integration may not be in place. Instead, they continue to use standalone solutions because of  the integration costs involved47.  The NFV infrastructure must dynamically reallocate its resources between different virtual network functions to  meet variations in traffic composition. Current OSS/BSS systems cannot support this level of real-time  dynamics and policy driven real-time service variation48.  SDN and NFV are poised to reduce the cost of capacity and in turn improve service density. The knock-on  effect will be an increase in service management overhead, which will create a greater workload for OSS/BSS.  OSS and BSS systems will need to adapt to avoid becoming a bottleneck. For instance, billing systems will  need to support more billing events as service instances grow significantly. The traffic of multiple customers  traffic must be aggregated efficiently, with unique subscriber profiles, many application types and distinct  policies49.  3.2.5 Adoption of open source or COTS  Use of open source within 5G NFV will continue to increase as vendors rely on open source  software to speed the delivery of new solutions. Open source software can be viewed as being  analogous to corporations outsourcing functions not related to their core competencies. This  introduces a new set of security challenges in terms of keeping a consistent and coherent  assurance of security-by-design, and the prevention of resulting security flaws. To compound  this issue, asking vendors to disclose the open source components used in their products may  disclose more vulnerabilities and add to the risk.  Another security challenge is that NFs based on NFV technologies can now run on lower cost,  commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, eliminating the need for more expensive, purpose- built hardware. When using COTS for the NFVI, security and performance may be impacted,  and security measures must be implemented to reduce the related risks. Table 12 illustrates the  main security challenges raised by the adoption of open source or COTS within the 5G NFV.  Table 12: Main security challenges facing ‘adoption of open source or COTS’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- OC1  Adoption of open  source software  Many 5G vendors and operators rely on open-source software to accelerate delivery of digital innovation.  Both traditional and agile development processes frequently incorporate the use of prebuilt, reusable open- source software components. As a result, some organisations may not have accurate inventories of open- source software dependencies used by their different applications, or a process to receive and manage  notifications concerning discovered vulnerabilities or available patches from the community supporting the  open-source.  Open-source software provides attackers with a target-rich environment because of its widespread use (e.g.  GitHub security breaches50 51). Open-source software is incorporated into applications in many ways, and  often 5G operators or vendors will not know where open-source is used. When open-source is used as the  foundation for a vendor’s product, any vulnerabilities could threaten the integrity of the vendor’s solution.  Asking vendors to disclose the open-source components used in their products may disclose more  vulnerabilities and add to the risk.  In 2020 we saw the Boot Hole vulnerability for GRUB2 bootloader (CVE-2020-10713), seven other GRUB2  vulnerabilities, and the critical HAProxy vulnerability with malformed HTTP/2 requests (CVE-2020-11100).  Since June 2017, the Linux kernel has had 12 CVEs with a CVSS score of 10.0 (critical). Prevasio’s recently  completed Operation Red Kangaroo scanned the entire Docker Hub and found 51 percent of all containers  had ‘critical’ vulnerabilities. As new open-source software vulnerabilities continue to be introduced into  47 https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-communications/post/without-modern-ossbss-5g-network-investments-may-be-throwing- good-money-after-bad  48 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  49 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  50 https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/how-secure-git  51 Hackers target GitHub (and other popular Git hosting tools) for many reasons. But the biggest is the potential they see in  hacking into repositories on GitHub and stealing (and potentially selling) intellectual property. Hardworking developers from  companies all over the world use GitHub for personal and business needs, often on an ad hoc basis. And developers in the  heat of battle can often overlook security concerns. Hackers know this — and exploit it.  https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-communications/post/without-modern-ossbss-5g-network-investments-may-be-throwing-good-money-after-bad https://blogs.oracle.com/oracle-communications/post/without-modern-ossbss-5g-network-investments-may-be-throwing-good-money-after-bad https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  50  development projects, it has become clear that software vendors and operators need to implement secure  software development best practices and cannot rely exclusively upon the open-source community to build  secure software52.  CH- OC2  Adoption of  COTS hardware  Generally, hardware design and manufacturing occur prior to software development, so it is extremely  important to address hardware security in product lifecycles, because once attackers compromise hardware  modules, software security mechanisms running on these devices will be compromised as well. For  example, manufacturing backdoors eavesdropping, inducing faults, and hardware modification tampering  through jailbroken software.  Almost all virtualised environments rely on x86/64 architecture and common off-the-shelf (COTS) server  hardware. This makes telecom virtual appliances (NFV firmware) a very valuable asset for security  researchers and attackers alike.  An attacker with physical access to the hardware resources may be able to tamper with or remove the TPM,  disabling the trusted computing platform function and facilitating other attacks; for example, allowing an  untrusted host OS, hypervisor or CIS to be installed.  3.2.6 Supply chain  The 5G NFV supply chain is similarly susceptible to the introduction of risks such as malicious  software and hardware, counterfeit components, poor designs, manufacturing processes, and  maintenance procedures. The exposure to these risks is heightened by the broad appeal of 5G  technologies and the resulting rush to deployment. This may result in negative consequences,  such as data and intellectual property theft, loss of confidence in the integrity of the 5G network,  or exploitation to cause system and network failure. Table 13 illustrates the main security  challenges facing the supply chain of the 5G NFV.  Table 13: Main security challenges facing ‘the supply chain’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- SC1  Separation of test  and production  environments  A significant risk is formed if the separation between test and production environment is neglected. The  reason is that the security configurations of the two different environments may vary. In addition, the test  configurations are updated more frequently. Moreover, the test environment is also more likely to support  remote vendor access.  CH- SC2 Untrusted partners  Carriers and equipment vendors may use components within the NFV manufactured by untrusted  companies, likely, in part, because of their relatively low costs or the components may already exist as part  of the current LTE infrastructure. The use of components manufactured by untrusted companies could  expose entities to risks introduced by malicious software and hardware, counterfeit components, and  component flaws caused by poor manufacturing processes and maintenance procedures.  CH- SC3  Infected/untested/ unauthorized  patches or  upgrades  When updates are available, they are likely to be retrieved from a centralised server and then applied by a  script or automated update process. If such a server or the applied script has been compromised, spoofed or  subject to some type of malfunction there is a risk that updates have been compromised or damaged.  Deploying untested or unvalidated NFV components on the NFV network poses a significant risk. This risk  may result in anything ranging from minor inconveniences such as missing functionality to more dangerous  issues such as signalling loops or, in the worst case, complete network failure.  CH- SC4  Test isolation and  assurance  In legacy hardware deployments, 3GPP, GSMA or other testing schemes generally involve testing 3GPP  functions as opaque boxes or pentesting them in isolation from other network functions. While it is possible  to test virtual functions in this way, the level of assurance gained is different. Such stand-alone testing relies  on the underlying virtualisation and hardware layers being 100% secure and that no future vulnerabilities are  found in those underlying components.  Testing functions in isolation does not guarantee that when a VNF is instantiated on a different host  virtualisation environment or is instantiated in a larger virtualisation environment containing multiple VNFs  that a 3GPP function tested in isolation remains secure.  Isolation in testing refers to VNF to VNF isolation as well as platform to VNF isolation. In general, it means  that the VNF is firstly tested on its own in a dedicated NFVI and then tested with other VNFs in a shared  NFVI.  CH- SC5  Use of counterfeit  components  Counterfeit NFV components are more susceptible to cyber-attack and are more likely to break because of  their poor quality. Compromised counterfeit components could enable a malicious actor to impact the  confidentiality, integrity or availability of data that travels through NFV and to move laterally to other more  sensitive parts of the 5G network. Counterfeit components are inserted at the component manufacturing or  52 https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/1/open-source-security-software  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  51  distribution stage in the supply chain in order to impact components delivered to a subset (potentially a  targeted subset) of downstream customers. Counterfeit parts look like regular parts and are a form of fraud.  Scenario: a malicious actor identifies a government contractor that provides NFV components and attempts  to sell modified or counterfeit products to them at discounted prices. While the contractor is legitimate and  has the most to lose from counterfeit products, they are unaware that there is a potential problem and do not  conduct an initial analysis of possible counterfeiting risks that exist within its industry. To save money, the  contractor purchases the counterfeit components from the malicious actor and inserts them into their  product. The counterfeit part has gone undetected in usability and functional testing and is placed into  production. The resulting effect on the overall 5G system can take a variety of forms, such as impacting  system performance, the availability of critical services, or loss of data.  CH- SC6  Use of inherited  components  Inherited NFV components may come from extended supply chains consisting of third-party suppliers,  vendors, and service providers. Supply chains may be compromised via attacks on suppliers, including  suppliers of suppliers, who may have weaker security controls and audits on their development, production,  or delivery channels. Flaws or malicious code inserted early in the development phases are more difficult to  detect and could lead to the developer marking the component as legitimate through digital signatures or  other approvals. Malicious actors could then later exploit these vulnerabilities.  The malicious code may be introduced to the component in several different ways, such as via compromise  of the source code repository, theft of signing keys, or penetration of distribution sites and channels. As a  part of an authorised and normal distribution channel, operators unknowingly acquire and deploy these  compromised components on their 5G systems and networks. Advanced malicious code typically does not  disrupt normal operations and may not activate for several days or weeks, thereby remaining hidden from  typical application and software testing practices.  Scenario: a telecommunications company buys core network systems management software from a trusted  provider. However, unbeknownst to the trusted provider, one of the components it uses in the product has  been compromised and now contains malicious code. This is a threat that results from inheriting risk  decisions made by a supplier within the supply chain. The deeper into the supply chain it occurs, the more  difficult it is to identify in advance. This inserted vulnerability may be used by the malicious actor as a part of  a larger attack chain that uses the malicious code to gain access within the core network of the telecom and  then pivot towards other attack vectors.  3.2.7 Lawful interception (LI)  Securing and hiding LI functionality from other functions in an NFV environment is by far the  largest security challenge. Placing LI functions within the VNF environment exposes them to a  variety of security and visibility risks. Placing them outside of the NFV environment comes with  a different set of visibility risks, places significant constraints on VNF mobility, makes LI fragile  to dynamic changes in the NFV environment and will only be possible in scenarios where the  mandatory intra-VNF and inter-VNF encryption has been disabled. Disabling intra or inter VNF  encryption will expose the NFV platform to considerable cyber risks and is therefore unlikely to  be acceptable.  Specific consideration of LI security challenges in hybrid part legacy scenarios must be  considered. In real deployments, legacy nodes and VNF need to co-exist and be interconnected  with implicit trust. This implicit trust is required as VNFs are not supposed to know they have  been virtualised. This therefore means that the VNFs are connected to management and  service control plane links which include legacy nodes that do not implement the same level of  security as the VNF. Table 14 illustrates the main security challenges for Lawful Interception  (LI).  Table 14: Main security challenges facing ‘lawful interception (LI)’  ID Challenge title Challenge description  CH- LI1  Encryption of  communications53  5G offers very high security standards. Although end-to-end encryption is not yet set out as mandatory in the  5G standards, it cannot be ruled out that it will be included in the standardisation process. End-to-end  encryption would make it impossible to access content in electronic communications, even through lawful  interception. In addition, encryption of an IMSI number (it is the individual number of the mobile phone card)  would make it impossible for law enforcement and judicial authorities to identify the mobile devices or location  of criminals or persons who pose a serious threat, as well as potential victims or persons facing a threat.  Without access to the IMSI number, certain lawful interceptions are not possible. Therefore, metadata  normally available via interception (such as location, date, time, call duration, calling and contacted party)  53 https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8983-2019-INIT/en/pdf  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-8983-2019-INIT/en/pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  52  would be lost to law enforcement and judicial authorities. In addition, 5G will have strict authentication  processes (in order to identify a user before access is granted) such as false-base detection that will make it  harder for law enforcement to investigate via lawful interception without being detected. (IMSI catchers which  are necessary for interception of mobile devices and location of suspects or victims would be detected.)  CH- LI2  Cooperation of  numerous  network providers  Up to now, when carrying out a lawful interception, the authorities deal with a limited number of network  providers. With 5G network slicing technology54, network and service providers may not – unless they are  obliged to do so – have a complete copy of the information available, which would make lawful interception  impossible.  5G architecture means that in order to monitor communications, one could require the cooperation of  numerous network providers both at home and abroad, under different jurisdictions. While law enforcement  authorities currently make requests to a single network provider operating from national territory, in the future  with 5G, they may have to deal with multiple service and network providers, including from abroad. The cross- border dimension of 5G technology may increase the need for international cooperation, which may increase  the time between request and implementation of the interception, with a non-negligible risk of losing a  complete copy of the technical information.  CH- LI3  Availability of  data at the LI  central nodes  In order to improve timely response, MEC will allow mobile phone networks to store and process contents in  decentralised clouds in the vicinity of network users which can directly communicate with each other.  Information will not necessarily be directed via central nodes, where lawful interception is currently  implemented. Therefore, data may not always be available anymore. As network functions and components  which used to exist physically become virtual or may be moved abroad, existing measures to  ensure  confidentiality of interception (protection against access to or even altering target lists by having specifically  vetted staff to carry out the measures on the national territory and physical protection measures such as  access restrictions) will no longer work.  CH- LI4  LI in hybrid  deployment  In real deployments, LI legacy nodes and NFV need to co-exist and be interconnected with implicit trust. This  therefore means that the NFV are connected to management and service control plane links which include LI  legacy nodes that do not implement the same level of security as the NFV.  There are two logical attack models which should be considered for LI:  • Virtualised node compromise using a legacy LI node;  • Legacy node compromise using the VNFs or host OS, hypervisor or CIS or associated signalling within  the NFV domain.  3.3 NFV VULNERABILITIES  Based on and inspired by the ENISA 5G threat landscape55, the list of potential vulnerabilities  related to the 5G NFV challenges are classified into the following categories. In addition to  virtualisation vulnerabilities, the potential vulnerabilities due to legacy systems are considered in  this analysis.  • service-based vulnerabilities of NFV components;  • improper protection of data and information of NFV components;  • improper hardening of NFV components;  • virtualisation layer vulnerabilities;  • vulnerable mechanisms for authentication and authorisation of NFV components;  • insufficient or improper monitoring mechanisms of NFV;  • vulnerabilities due to legacy OSS/BSS systems;  • improper protection of service based interfaces;  • vulnerabilities of 5G NFs;  • vulnerabilities in operating systems supporting 5G NFs;  • improper hardening of 5G core components;  • vulnerabilities of SDN;  • vulnerabilities of MEC;  54 Several network and service providers may be able to operate on the same physical infrastructure. For example, one  company will provide enhanced mobile broadband, cellular phones for example, another one will provide massive machine  type communications and a third one will provide low latency communications. Each service provider will use a customised  virtualisation layer of the same physical infrastructure, with different technical specifications. Relevant telecommunication  monitoring information may therefore not be available in every network slice.  55 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-for-5g-networks  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  53  Annex C provides a description of the different 5G NFV vulnerabilities with their associated  assets belonging to the above categories that can be exploited to perform attacks impacting the  confidentiality, integrity and availability of the 5G NFV system.  3.4 NFV ATTACK SCENARIOS  Attacks are defined by the ways an attacker can compromise system vulnerabilities or  weaknesses, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a NFV system.  There are many variants of attacks on 5G NFV and they can be organised according to the  following two factors (the attack taxonomy is provided and detailed in Annex D):  1. Attack sources belong to three categories:   attacks from within a NFV (internal weakness),   attacks from outside a NFV (external threat),   attacks occurring between NFV components (migration of an attack).  2. Impact is organised into three categories:   Denial of Service: attacks that cause service outages. Examples include  hardware vandalism, radio signal jamming, and traffic flooding.   Access Breach: attacks that lead to unauthorised system access, manipulation,  or a data breach. Examples include malicious changes to system configurations,  exploiting software vulnerabilities, communications hijacking and disclosure of  sensitive data.   Integrity Compromise: attacks that impact the integrity of infrastructure through  hardware, software, communications or operational tampering. Examples include  implanting malicious hardware components in system devices, altering operating  system code, modifying data, and circumventing organisational security policies.  Figure 15 shows the three attack sources categories with their associated attacks and Table 15  shows the impact of each attack.

A list of security measures and best practices has been established by analysing relevant  documents and standards identified during desktop research. This analysis allowed the  identification of frequently mentioned topics regarding NFV security and their classifications into  different security domains. The resulting list is grouped into three main categories, namely  policies, organisational and technical practices (see Figure 16). The full register of best  practices with references are provided in Annex E.  The mapping between categories of challenges, vulnerabilities, attacks, affected assets and  best practices is provided in section 4.4.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  56  Figure 16: List of best practices  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  57  4.1.1 Technical  In this section, we shed light on technical best security practices that should be followed in order  to achieve better security protection in a 5G NFV environment against the challenges identified  above. Table 16 highlights thirty-five technical measures and best practices. They are detailed  in Annex E.  Table 16: Technical best practices  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T1 Security monitoring  and filtering  This covers the use of virtual network security appliances such as anti-virus, virtual firewalls or virtual  IDS/IPS to achieve a level of security comparable to traditional networks. Further, machine learning  (ML) assisted solutions can be used to detect attack traffic (e.g. DoS attacks) and distinguish it from  normal traffic, so that it can be handled appropriately.  BP-T2  VNF image  validation and  protection  A mechanism should be provided to verify all VNF before they are installed on the orchestration  platform or other vendor specific deployment platform.  BP-T3 Tracking VNF  version changes  The orchestration and VNF management systems should have the ability to keep track of multiple  versions, multiple environments, multiple instances and allow the service provider’s team to perform  updates or upgrades with clear expectations of service continuity based on metadata information  including component dependencies.  BP-T4 VNF deployment  New VNF components must only be deployed into a production network where security policies have  been tested and applied, and where appropriate hardening measures have been taken to ensure that  unused ports, unrequired services, and insecure protocols have been disabled.  BP-T5 VNF deletion or  relocation  The orchestration platform should manage VNF deletion or relocation in a secure way. Security  mechanisms such us secure backup, storage, destruction, and isolation of sensitive data must be  applied.  BP-T6 Cryptography  Well-known, standardised and secure cryptographic schemes and protocols (e.g. NIST56, ANSSI57,  BSI58) shall be used for the cryptographic operations and the key management process. Proprietary  schemes and protocols must be avoided.  BP-T7 Hypervisor protection  The hypervisor shall enforce the network security policies regarding the isolation between VNFs,  memory access control, protection of sensitive data, etc. The hypervisor enables virtualisation  between underlying hardware and VMs. Security of the hypervisor is a must in order to protect the  whole virtualisation infrastructure.  One of the best security practices is to keep the hypervisor up to date by regularly applying security  patches as they are released. Failure to do so would result in exposure to security risks. Another best  practice is to disable all services that are not in use. For example, remote access services may not be  needed all the time and therefore it would be a good idea to enable these services only when they are  required. Administrators are the gatekeepers of the whole infrastructure and their accounts are the  keys. It should be mandated that admin accounts should be secured through the application of a  strong password policy along with strict adherence to an organisation’s security guidelines.  BP-T8  Security  management and  orchestration  NFV management and orchestration operations must be made secure, especially the lifecycle  management of VNF workloads.  BP-T9 Remote attestation  Today's deployed NFV systems face a huge number of threats that have the capability to compromise  them partly or fully. In many cases this involves an attacker modifying a system in such a way that  malicious software is executed. Execution of code that was not intended to be executed on the system  is expected to be detectable. One defensive measure that addresses the execution of malicious  software is remote attestation (RA) as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC 01859. The remote attestation  technique should be used to remotely verify the trust status of a NFV platform.  BP-T10  Software compliance  and integrity  preservation  Mechanisms for checking integrity must be used to verify software, firmware, and information integrity  within the NFV.  56 https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines  57 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/reglementation/confiance-numerique/liste-des-documents-constitutifs-du-rgs-v-2-0/  58 https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html  59 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-standards-and-guidelines https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/reglementation/confiance-numerique/liste-des-documents-constitutifs-du-rgs-v-2-0/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSI-TR-02102-1.html https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  58  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T11  Security  segmentation and  isolation between  network functions  The security zoning concept (or segmentation) should be used to divide 5G networks horizontally and  vertically into portions in which different security controls can be applied. Security zoning enables the  application-specific customisation of security services. A zone could, for instance, provide its own AAA  (Authentication, Authorisation, Accountability) and security monitoring functionalities. Consequently,  different segments have different security or trust levels, i.e. can be trusted to address different  security risks.  BP-T12 Secure boot integrity  The NFV platform shall support a secure boot from hardware to VNFs to prevent tampering during the  system boot and integrity check on the sensitive NFV software files and running code to prevent  tampering at runtime, enhancing the protection of system integrity.  BP-T13 Data protection and  privacy  To prevent disclosure of user data (e.g. subscriber identifiers), 5G networks should use security  mechanisms such as the encryption cryptographic operation. It is important to pay attention to the  requirements of lawful interception60. Privacy and security, both of individuals’ personal data and of  critical infrastructure, are important preconditions for GDPR. Encryption is a crucial tool to achieve  these goals. Any approach to weaken or grant backdoor access to encryption methods defeats the  entire purpose of encryption and undermines users’ trust, exposing 5G systems to increased risks. At  the same time, it remains vitally important that companies and law enforcement authorities continue to  work together, ensuring that authorities have the best methods and access to electronic evidence  without weakening or putting strong encryption at risk.  BP-T14 Encrypting VNF  volume/swap areas  Virtual volume disks associated with VNFs may contain sensitive data. Therefore, they need to be  protected.  BP-T15 Trusted computing  technologies  NFV requires trusted computing technologies for ensuring secure root of trust, remote attestation61,  integrity monitoring, and secure storage. Such trusted computing technologies include Intel TXT,  SGX, AMD SEV or ARM Trustzone silicon-based security functionality implemented with a TPM that  stores measurements of the entire hypervisor stack and boot process.  BP-T16 Hardware security  Dedicated hardware should be used to ensure strong isolation (e.g. physical separation) between  tenants. In addition, hardware security devices should be used to ensure a secure boot, integrity  check, secure storage and trusted execution environment.  BP-T17 Centralised log  auditing  All the NFV, SDN and MANO elements should submit information on security events to a centralised  platform, which shall monitor and analyse the logs in real time for possible attempts at intrusion.  BP-T18  Use and ownership  of ‘root’  administration  credentials  NFV components should be configured to support multiple administration roles. As a minimum there  shall be an admin role (highest privilege) and a separate operational role with minimal privileges to  complete normal operational support.  BP-T19 VNF protection VNF data protection shall be enforced at rest and in transit.  BP-T20  Local or removal  blade storage – SAN  protection  If local, non-volatile, fixed or removable storage is used to support a VNF then it should not store  sensitive data. SAN should be protected by a mutual authentication process, hard zoning, data  protection at rest and in transit, etc.  BP-T21 Network security  • All internal interfaces between VNF elements, supporting MANO platforms and IT elements  (mediation, provisioning) that are not required to communicate publicly outside the  operators network, should use private IP addresses.  • Each VM or container supporting VNFs should have a predefined network security profile.  • Separate physical interfaces should be implemented for traffic segregation.  • All connectivity between internal NFV components and the external world should pass  through a firewall (or vFirewall).  • Communication should be monitored, and security events should be recorded in audit logs.  • Rules governing segmentation and zoning security should be followed with the use of  firewalls, IDS/IPS or other controls.  • VPNs should be created between VNFs and both internal and external non-VNF  environments.  • Patch management is important to fix vulnerabilities on network security devices (e.g.  firewall, VPN, IDS/IPS) to keep them up-to-date and running smoothly.  • The management of all operational traffic and interfaces should be protected by integrity  mechanisms and encryption. Unprotected sessions should not be accepted.  60 https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DIGITALEUROPE-Position-on-Encryption-Policy-.pdf  61 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DIGITALEUROPE-Position-on-Encryption-Policy-.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/018/01.01.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC018v010101p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  59  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T22 SDN security  management  Communication between SDN elements should support a strong identity framework to uniquely  identify all components and users of a SDN system and verify identities with a trusted source. Without  a strong identity framework, the ability to build effective authentication, authorisation and accounting  implementations will be limited.  A strong identity should have the following properties:  • ability to distinguish its owner from other entities within a pre-defined scope,  • ability to be generated, updated and revoked,  • prevention of impersonation, preferably through strong cryptographic mechanisms.  Analysis of the SDN architecture identifies numerous means for elements inside the system’s trust  boundary to compromise the availability of the logically centralised control. Strong authentication  based on assured identity and access control mechanisms with various privilege levels should be  employed to authorise external parties and authenticate their access to the system, e.g. role-based  access control.  BP-T23  MANO access  control and  management  The common aspects for RESTful NFV MANO APIs have been defined in ETSI GS NFV-SOL 01362.  NFV MANO APIs, applications and their supporting platforms (OS, Database) should have  comprehensive user access controls and privileged access management. NFV-MANO APIs shall only  allow themselves to be accessed by authorised users. One solution for authorising access is the use  of OAuth2.0 with access token as described in ETSI GS NFV-SEC 02263.  BP-T24 VIM connectivity to  virtualisation layer  The connectivity between the VIM and the virtualisation layer should support a secure access  protocol.  BP-T25 Recovery and  reinstallation  A fast recovery and reinstallation process shall be in place to ensure high availability of the sensitive  NFV components and resources. The recovery process should be clearly documented, reviewed at  regular intervals for updates and made available to all the staff concerned.  BP-T26  Deploying  VMs/Containers of  differing trust levels  The VIM should be configured to ensure that VMs or containers of differing trust levels are not  deployed on the same physical host.  BP-T27  Orchestration  platform Security  Management  The orchestration platform sits over the NFV environment and allows the management and  deployment of VNFs across the whole NFV environment. Security controls should be implemented to  protect this critical platform such as strong authentication, access control rules, information flow  controls, audit logs, etc. The orchestration platform should support security monitoring and patch  management processes to provide continuous security updates.  BP-T28 Trusted time source The system should provide a protected and trusted network time source to the NFV components such  as GPS or an atomic clock64.  BP-T29  Secure 3rd party  hosting  environments  Sensitive information of VNFs shall be confidentially protected by operators when using a 3rd party  environment (e.g. NFVI).  BP-T30 Redundancy and  backup  The NFV platform should support redundancy and backup protection to improve reliability and ensure  the availability and integrity of 5G NFV data, components, applications, and services.  BP-T31 Specific container  security controls  • Appropriate restrictions on container placement and on the use of container caching should  be applied.  • A security policy that restricts the placement and co-existence of containers belonging to  different trust domains should be defined and implemented.  • A security policy which restricts which sub-functions within an NF, which has been  implemented using containers, may be cached within the general unencrypted container  cache or which requires security protection mechanisms for sensitive containers at rest  within the cache to be defined and implemented.  BP-T32 OSS/BSS protection  There should be a sharing of responsibility between the traditional OSS and the newly deployed SDN  controllers and NFV orchestration. The OSS will manage the relatively static configuration parameters  and limit overall resources assigned to sub-networks or services. The SDN controller and NFV  orchestration platforms will then dynamically manage these network resources to apply policy-based  services in real-time to individual traffic flows.  62 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/013/03.05.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL013v030501p.pdf  63 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/022/02.08.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC022v020801p.pdf  64 https://serverfault.com/questions/622094/what-is-an-acceptable-secure-time-source-in-a-datacentre-environment  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/013/03.05.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL013v030501p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SEC/001_099/022/02.08.01_60/gs_NFV-SEC022v020801p.pdf https://serverfault.com/questions/622094/what-is-an-acceptable-secure-time-source-in-a-datacentre-environment  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  60  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-T33 LI capabilities  LI capabilities should be consistent with 3GPP and ETSI specifications 65 66 67 68 69 on Lawful  Interception. They cover all necessary aspects in a 5G context: requirements, architecture and  functions, protocol, and procedures.  BP-T34 User plane security  While firewalls at trust boundaries provide some defence against attacks by limiting communication  between trusted entities to only permitted IP addresses using only valid protocols on allowed ports,  additional security controls are needed on the user plane to effectively mitigate DDoS, botnet attacks,  and malware infections. Network-based security functions such as firewalls, volumetric DDoS  protection, antibot net, anti-virus, and web filtering can be deployed on the user plane to provide end- to-end protection70.  BP-T35 MEC security  MEC is designed to support various use cases such as video analytics, location services, Internet of  Things (IoT), augmented reality (AR), optimised distribution of local content, data caching, and more.  The MEC system should provide a secure environment for running services for the various actors  involved such as user, network operator, third-party application provider, application developer,  content provider and platform vendor.  MEC security relies on specifications provided by recognised bodies to address specific aspects,  especially ETSI ISG NFV for infrastructure virtualisation and management, the Trusted Computing  Group (TCG) for physical platform security, and IETF specifications for securing access to MEC  services. Furthermore, 3GPP TR 33.848 [47] is investigating the security consequences of  virtualisation of 3GPP NFs. This 3GPP report is applicable to many MEC use cases where the need  for additional security controls is higher than in core network datacentre implemented network  functions. It is expected to result in additional ETSI NFV security requirements that can be utilised for  MEC.  Moreover, security assurance is an important topic which is beginning to be required by regulators for  5G infrastructure components such as MEC. While the traditional common criteria technology (ISO  15408) remains a global reference for security assessment, tailored schemes that address the specific  constraints of 5G ecosystems, such as GSMA NESAS, are expected to play an important role in this  respect.  4.1.2 Policy  This second category of security measures encompasses the various policies and procedures  to be established to ensure an appropriate level of cybersecurity. The following 16 technical  policy measures and best practices have been identified (see Table 17 and a detailed  description in Annex E).  Table 17: Policy best practices  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-P1 Zero Trust  5G NFV deployments should build on mature cybersecurity standards employed in enterprise and  cloud environments. Examples include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and ISO Information  Security Management System series71, the ETSI GS NFV-SEC 00372 Security and Trust Guidance  and the UK NCSC Zero Trust Architecture Design Principles73.  Zero Trust represents an overarching access security model that deliberately avoids assuming implicit  trust between elements in a network. This is particularly important in 5G as various external  stakeholders may need to access infrastructure components or services for management,  maintenance, or monitoring purposes74 75.  65 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf  66 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133126/15.00.00_60/ts_133126v150000p.pdf  67 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133128/15.00.00_60/ts_133128v150000p.pdf  68 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133108/12.08.00_60/ts_133108v120800p.pdf  69 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2266  70 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security- considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  71 https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final  72 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec003v010101p.pdf  73 https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/zero-trust-architecture/introduction-to-zero-trust  74 https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/zero-trust-and-5g  75 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security- considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133127/15.00.00_60/ts_133127v150000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133126/15.00.00_60/ts_133126v150000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133128/15.00.00_60/ts_133128v150000p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/133100_133199/133108/12.08.00_60/ts_133108v120800p.pdf https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=2266 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/nfv-sec/001_099/003/01.01.01_60/gs_nfv-sec003v010101p.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/zero-trust-architecture/introduction-to-zero-trust https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/ericsson-technology-review/articles/zero-trust-and-5g https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  61  BP-P2  Security  assessment of new  or changes to  existing VNF  service templates  New or modified VNF service templates should be validated through proper risk assessment by a  security professional.  BP-P3  Vulnerability  handling & patch  management  NFV and MANO software components will need to be monitored for vulnerabilities and patched as  quickly as possible to address evolving risks and ensure security and functionality.  BP-P4 Security testing and  assurance  Regular penetration and vulnerability testing should be performed across the NFVi and MANO  production environment to identify any vulnerabilities (e.g. OSs, hypervisor, CIS, VMs or containers)  or compromise of the network zoning rules. 5G stakeholders should also leverage internationally  recognised product testing, assurance, and certification regimes. Potential solutions to these  requirements include, among others, the Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS)76,  jointly defined by 3GPP and GSMA, and the ENISA EUCC77, EUCS78 schemes.  BP-P5 Incident  management  An incident detecting and handling process should be established to support incident response and  restoration activities.  BP-P6 Secure update  management  An update management process is required for introducing a new component or a software or  hardware change into the 5G system. Continuous integration and testing tools make the patching  process efficient and reduce the prolonged risk of exposure. NFV and MANO must support reactive  and proactive security monitoring and patch management to provide continuous security updates.  BP-P7  Restriction on  installing  applications  It should not be possible to install a VNF application into the operational NFV environment without  validation and approval by the operator.  BP-P8 Defence-in-depth Security must be implemented for the hardware, virtualisation, VNF, MANO and application layers.  Multilayer, defence-in-depth security with protective mechanisms must be present.  BP-P9 Strong password  policy  It should be mandated that all user accounts accessing the NFV/MANO system be secured by the  application of a strong password policy. Securing NFV/MANO passwords requires implementing and  enforcing a password policy that includes:  • strong passwords for every account  • the use of a password manager  • two-factor authentication (2FA)  • role-based access control (RBAC)  • privileged access management (PAM) for the most sensitive NFV/MANO components.  BP-P10 Secure supply  chain  Large elements of the supply chain are outside the direct control of the operator, and thus operators  should seek to impose obligations onto the supply chain to enhance security of the NFV.  BP-P11  Resources  inventory  management  system and  database  An inventory management system must account for all the physical elements, open source and NFV  software components that the operator owns on premises and in the cloud. In addition, the resource  inventory database should be protected by security controls. Inventories should be reviewed and  updated at regular intervals.  BP-P12 Apply hardening  policies  NFV, MANO and SDN components should be submitted to a continuous or repetitive hardening  process to ensure that known vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.  BP-P13  Multi-vendors  segregation and  trust  Multi-vendor segregation should be applied to ensure each vendor can only manage or impact its own  resources. In addition, trust vendors of NFV components should be selected. A security SLA should  also be established between the operator and vendors to define the security level that they must  meet.  BP-P14 Security-by-design  The security-by-design principle is to be followed in order to inspire trust in end users. This  requirement highlights the need to consider security aspects from the very beginning of the  development of a 5G system, throughout the supply chain, and over the whole lifecycle of 5G  components.  76 https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/  77 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-certification-eucc-candidate-scheme-v1-1.1  78 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme  https://www.gsma.com/security/network-equipment-security-assurance-scheme/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-certification-eucc-candidate-scheme-v1-1.1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  62  BP-P15 Lifecycle  management  The security posture of a NFV deployment must consider that cloud-based networks are dynamic and  that threats are constantly evolving. Lifecycle management (LCM) will become more complex in a  NFV environment and will require automated management and orchestration functions79. Containers  inherently provide software modularity and decomposition, which allow for independent LCM following  DevOps principles and continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). The NIST secure  software development framework (SSDF)80 and DevSecOps project81 for cloud-native applications  integrate security into the DevOps process, reducing vulnerabilities, mitigating the potential impacts of  vulnerabilities, and preventing the recurrence of vulnerabilities.  BP-P16 Software bill Of  materials (SBOM)  Vendors of 5G NFV software components should include a SBOM with the software package. The  generated SBOM should follow the NTIA guidelines and be in a machine-readable format such as  SPDX82, or CycloneDX83.  4.1.3 Organisational  Organisational best practices are of the utmost importance to ensure 5G NFV security. In what  follows, four organisational rules and best practices are introduced in Table 18 and detailed in  Annex E.  Table 18: Organisational best practices  ID Best Practice title Best Practice description  BP-O1  Secure physical  environment and  geographical  location  Security is not just about encrypting data streams but also about the physical deployment of equipment.  NFV devices and equipment location, type of equipment, and type of services running on the equipment  are all parts of the complete system and must be protected in a secure physical environment.  BP-O2 Training and  awareness  The following activities should be considered:  • information sharing between different 5G actors;  • adopting a holistic approach to security training and awareness among the employees,  including employees at all levels of the organisation;  • ensuring that security training is continuous, regular and frequently updated.  BP-O3 Trust model  A trust model of relationships among various 5G stakeholders should be built and be able to answer  questions such as: ‘for what one does on trust?’, ‘How much should one trust?’ and ‘How much anyone  can trust?’.  BP-O4 SLAs establishment  SLAs established between 5G stakeholders should include important security and compliance  measures. In this respect, SLAs are like an insurance policy for the 5G network services.  SLAs set the expectations for the performance of a service provider and for the security level. They also  establish penalties for missing targets. In that concept, NFV could not leave unaffected the evolution of  SLA models and their flexibility in adapting to more demanding parameters. An SLA management  framework should be defined in order to fill the gap between 5G stakeholders.  4.2 SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AND MEASURES OF THE EECC  Article 40 and Article 41 of the EECC define security requirements and measures as technical  and organisational measures for managing the risks posed to the security of networks and  services. ENISA guidance84 85 on security measures under the EECC are guidelines on security  measures addressed to competent authorities concerning the technical details of implementing  Articles 40 and 41 of the EECC: how to ensure that providers assess risks and take appropriate  security measures.  These guidelines list twenty-nine high-level security objectives, which are grouped in eight  security domains. For each security objective they list specific detailed security measures which  could be taken by providers to reach that particular security objective. Those security measures  79 https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf  80 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf  81 https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/devsecops  82 https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/  83 https://cyclonedx.org  84 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc  85 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  https://www.ericsson.com/4a49ce/assets/local/reports-papers/further-insights/doc/02092021-12911-security-considerations-for-cloud-ran-6-edits.pdf https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/devsecops https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/ https://cyclonedx.org/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/guideline-on-security-measures-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/5g-supplement-security-measures-under-eecc  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  63  are technology neutral. They should be applicable to a wide range of different types of  technologies including NFV in 5G.  4.3 OTHER RELEVANT SECURITY HARDENING GUIDANCE  For additional security hardening guidance, see among others:  • ENISA - Security aspects of virtualisation focusing on virtualisation security86.  • NIS cooperation group security measures for OES providing technical and  organisational security measures to manage risks posed to the security of NIS  (Network and Information Systems)87.

OPEN AND FUTURE SECURITY  CHALLENGES  Although many solutions have been proposed to overcome the security challenges in NFV,  many potential security challenges remain. Table 19 illustrates some of the research challenges  and future directions for NFV security.  Table 19: Open and future security challenges  Challenge Challenge description References  Encrypted data  processing  The risks of being able to capture encrypted data in an unencrypted form due to processing  of that data increases significantly. If that processing is highly sensitive (e.g. AUC  (authentication centre) or LI functions) then the risk may not be acceptable.  [47]  Performance  degradation  To truly understand performance, we must simulate growth in network usage. If overall loads  grow by 50%, how will VNF performance be impacted? And if all the load is centred on one  type or pattern of traffic or usage vs multiple types? What is the expected performance  degradation when using resource oversubscription? Different types of usage may require  different service chains that impact resources in a completely different way.  [48]  Host failure  What to do when something breaks? When a host fails, are the VNFs that are running  transitioned appropriately to other hosts? Are the correct rules set up to govern that  transition? How long does it take for the VNFs to resume service and is there an interruption  of service? It is crucial to validate the answers to these questions in system testing and in  production to prevent critical issues.  [48]  Compromised  virtualisation layer  Substantial and structural security issues may still remain around isolation of sensitive  functions where hypervisors, host OS and CISs are hostile or compromised. [49]  Runtime attestation  One of the security challenges is to define the standard interface in the ETSI NFV  architecture to deploy virtual security functions to react to various threats in real time. Such  functionalities should be able to communicate with the orchestration modules and follow the  instructions provided. Another challenge is to securely manage and monitor VNFs by  maintaining their configuration and information on their state during migration. This can be  difficult to do due to the dynamicity and elasticity of VNF operations in cloud environments.  Another challenge is to perform trust management between different vendors who build NFV  hardware and software. The challenge is to efficiently manage the trust chain among vendors  and provide trustiness in the final VNF products.  At the moment, attestation technologies only provide boot time attestation. This does not  guarantee modification during runtime or prevent tampering with the system’s critical  components, and such modifications would only be detected when the system is rebooted.  Runtime attestation is still an open research area that needs to be explored further. There is  also a strong need to develop a comprehensive security architecture to take care of these  security challenges in NFVI. To achieve these goals, network operators and vendors need to  work together to form a vibrant security eco-system. New standards, testbeds, and proofs of  concept would serve as a catalyst for securing NFV infrastructure. The services in this new  virtualised environment are evolving rapidly and, in turn, create new opportunities for  innovation.  [50], [132]  Distributed denial-of- service attacks  How to utilise the flexibility of VNF to defend against DDoS attacks in the network is a major  challenge. [51]  Trust management in  NFV  The emergence of NFV provides opportunities for various vendors to enter the networking  infrastructure market by providing NFV compatible hardware and software. It will be common  to have multiple vendors involved in a NFV supported network. However, how to manage the  trust chain and evaluate the trustworthiness of products is another research challenge. Also,  how to adaptively configure VNFs by choosing software to minimise security risk of the  network is another research topic.  [51]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  69  Trust between VNFs  It is important to maintain trust between the VNFs for the provision of security validation and  integrity. The following are three types of trusts which are important between VNFs:  • trust in the correctness of information output between software components;  • trust that the software components will operate correctly;  • trust in the performance of operations that have an indirect influence on data.  Trusting relationships are basic requirements for the software programs to be able to work  with each other in NFV environment. The trusting relationships chain needs to be made  longer in order to reach the level of complete security.  [52]  Challenges with VNF  images validation and  VNF  onboarding/deploying  There is a risk when validating images, onboarding and deploying VNFs on NFVI. Currently,  these processes are not part of the orchestration.  Every operator has its unique network configuration of hardware and software vendors plus  all the vast numbers of parameter settings. In real time communication there is also a number  of real-time dependencies, timers and correct sequences that must be considered.  To consider these challenges, a comprehensive certification process, standardised testing  framework and the creation of assets to automate the validation, onboarding and deployment  of VNFs are required to reduce risks.  [53]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  70  6. CONCLUSION  NFV in 5G is a technology that is continuously evolving through time due to the new  technologies, requirements and services that need to be addressed. Security, as an inherent  quality that has to be conceived along with the new services, is no exception and must keep up  with the pace. Security in the NFV era presents a long-term challenge. As NFV security  technology continues to develop, automated and virtualised protection systems with robust  security models will enable NFV networks to thrive.  5G deployments uses modern virtualisation techniques for distributed and cloud computing and  networking. NFV and SDN are approaches where these modern techniques are brought into  consistent frameworks which 5G systems builders can use to be effective and to create vendor  products that are interoperable. Those technologies that allow progress to take place are also  technologies that can expose new security challenges. Securing 5G must be designed-in and  not be an afterthought. Hence, a careful approach to the new aspects of cloud-native services,  SDN and NFV can improve their security. Additionally, taking a zero trust approach, combined  with the advanced techniques of cyberthreat intelligence, will further enhance 5G’s security.  In this report we have highlighted the main security challenges that (i) open up with these  technologies and (ii) arise due to the interoperability among them, which enables NFV in 5G.  Some of the main challenges highlighted in this report have shown the following.  • Centralisation of management capabilities presents a single-point-of-failure  weakness.  • Use of standardised general-purpose server and storage machines, routinely built  with open-source code, represent an increase in threats or attack surfaces.  • The growing participation of multiple partners or vendors, processes and  subsystems in the creation and delivery of services introduce the risks of data leaks,  data residue, and attacks. It can also create very complex supply chains. It’s difficult  to manage so many vendors. All it takes is a security flaw in one of the vendor’s  environments to launch a supply chain attack whose impact can reach far and wide.  • The more software components in a NFV, the more possibilities there are of finding  potential software vulnerabilities.  • 5G NFV architecture security should be decentralised by dividing it into a core  network and an edge network. Because the protection targets are widely distributed,  there are issues with the visibility of security.  To solve challenges, we have provided a list of technical, organisational and policy best  practices in security. The security architecture for NFV must be multi-layered. The aim should  be to have security-by-design across all 5G NFV network elements and layers. It is imperative  that security is ‘designed-in’ at all levels to ensure resilience, robustness and address the  connected world of the future enabled by 5G.  Security management and orchestration are necessary to coordinate security protection across  layers. Hardening and patching NFV security can counteract software vulnerabilities. Isolating  resources between different VMs or containers on the same physical machine on the  virtualisation layer can prevent data theft and malicious attacks between VMs or containers.  In-house or third-party security audits, or both, should be encouraged as a best practice for  empowering mobile networks (not limited to 5G NFV only). Operators need to be alert and  always one step ahead of possible security events.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  71  Efforts should be concentrated on developing, automating and refining technologies, policies  and processes for service orchestration, on the detection and prevention of intrusions, on  solutions to protect against viruses and malware, on dynamic authentication, identity, access  and the management of trust relationships, on the encryption of user traffic and its control or  management, on the screening, filtering and inspection of traffic, and on the segregation of data  and networks.  The level of security automation to automate the provisioning of networks, their security and  management in order to continuously maximise network efficiency and functionality should be  increased. With virtualised and highly distributed networks, effective 5G NFV end-to-end  security requires automated monitoring, mechanisms to prevent threats and protection systems  to provide swift responses to known and unknown threats in real-time.  A truly end-to-end approach to NFV security needs to consider the current ETSI and 3GPP  standards. 3GPP technical specifications on security architecture and procedures for 5G system  and ETSI technical specifications on security for NFV come with a set of security features and  improvements. To ensure the expected security benefits are realised, it is important that security  requirements defined in the 3GPP and ETSI specifications are fully and correctly implemented  and used, including relevant optional requirements.  Creation of a secure NFV architecture in 5G will enable customer privacy and security, build  trust and encourage adoption of 5G for critical functions (e.g. critical national infrastructure or  functions requiring high reliability such as healthcare).  In addition to the security challenges and best practices explored in this report, we have  outlined the roles and responsibilities in terms of security of the main 5G stakeholders and  administrators providing and managing the NFV in 5G.  Moreover, we highlighted the main assets to be protected with CIA security properties, the  vulnerabilities of various components and network interfaces that can be exploited by the  adversary, and the attack scenarios that may impact NFV in 5G. Links between all those  elements are provided in the annexes.  At the end of this report, a list of annexes is included to provide the full taxonomies of and the  links between the different elements from the core of the report. In addition, the annex provides  the standardisation efforts on NFV and SDN from various entities in the telecom industry and  other bodies.

The receiver should have corresponding  verification mechanisms. Lack of such measures or improper messages facilitate the abuse and  modification of sessions and messages.  NFV MANO  VUL2  Improper protection of  confidentiality of data transferred  over internal interfaces to MANO  Lack of appropriate protection of the confidentiality of data transferred over any internal interface of  MANO. NFV MANO; VNF  VUL3 Improper API Access  implementation  TLS not implemented for API communication, or implementation shortcomings such as lack of TLS- based authentication: client and authorisation servers are not mutually authenticated or client does  not authenticate the resource server.  Os-Ma-nfvo  VUL4 Use of legacy PNF Vulnerabilities of a PNF could be used as a starting point for an attack against VNFs, potentially  taking advantage of any legacy security used by PNFs and not provided by the virtualisation layer. Control plane  VUL5  Improper verification of identity and  location of transmitting party on  internal interfaces  If an internal interface allows any actions from data received without successfully identifying and  verifying the identity and location of the transmitting party, it enables masquerading of the  orchestrator and other forms of privilege escalation that in turn can lead to abuse of VIM or VNFM  functions by unauthorised parties.  NFV MANO  VUL6  Improper hardening  of NFV components  Inability to provide proof of integrity  of the data stores used for VM or  container images  Poor monitoring of stored images to determine if any unauthorised modification, deletion or insertion  has occurred renders VIM unable to ensure the integrity of VM or container images and of data  transfers.  VIM/CISM  VUL7 Lack of protection of user and  control planes data  An attacker could read and/or manipulate data in transit if control and user planes data in transit  between hosts is not sent over an encrypted, signed and authenticated channel. Control plane  VUL8 Improper patch management  Once identified, vulnerabilities in software can be fixed through security patches whereas hardware  vulnerabilities are much more costly to fix. Security patches may require a reboot and could cause  service disruption, particularly if many commodity servers have to be rebooted over a short period.  Security patches are not always done in time. Failure to apply necessary patches leave the systems  open to the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.  VNF  VUL9 Misconfiguration  Complexity brought by virtualisation increases the probability that errors and misconfigurations will  remain undetected. Accidental misconfigurations or failure to follow security standards and practices  can cause service problems directly, or leave open unintended vulnerabilities, which will cause  service problems if exploited.  VNF  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  92  VUL10 No mechanism to enforce geo- restrictions  The MANO system should allow instantiation of MANO components and managed entities, the  NFVIs, only at explicit geographic locations. Failure to do so may leave the system vulnerable to  legal and licensing risks.  NFV MANO  VUL11 Time manipulation  VNFs must synchronise with trusted time servers. Failure to do so, leaves the system vulnerable to  an attack that manipulates the network timing source or VNF clock, thus causing the network to be  compromised.  It is possible to move clock back and forth in order to confuse the NFVI and VNFs.  VNF  VUL12  Virtualisation layer  vulnerabilities  Inadequate access privileges in  virtualised environments  Administrative models that enable an admin/root/super user account type to have full access to  system resources allow visibility and modification of cryptographic keys, passwords in memory,  configuration files, intellectual property and other resources within the NFV. The hypervisor is fully  aware of the current state of each guest OS it controls. Hypervisor introspection can enable the  ability to view, inject, and/or modify information on operational state associated with the NFV through  direct or indirect methods. Access to status information can result in the ability to arbitrarily read  and/or write the contents of memory, storage, key storage and other NFV operational aspects.  NFVI  VUL13 Improper key management system  The host system shall provide cryptographically separated secure environments for different  applications. In the absence of these conditions, the virtualised environment can be abused to  compromise sensitive functions from less protected ones.  SM  VUL14  Lack of a proper mechanism for  ensuring a hardware-based root of  trust (HBRT)  A hardware-based root of trust (HBRT) should act as an initial root of trust to ensure a safe  environment for running sensitive virtualised components. NFVI  VUL15 Software vulnerabilities in NFV  implementation  The risks from software vulnerabilities could be higher with NFV than with traditional bespoke  appliances because VNFs are expected to run on commodity software and hardware and because  NFV is built on cloud technology with a standard level of security. Virtualisation technology will need  to be re-assessed before it can be considered suitable for protecting critical network infrastructure.  VNF  VUL16  Vulnerable  mechanisms for  authentication and  authorisation of NFV  components  Improper VNF on-boarding Improper procedures for signing and managing associated cryptographic keys may enable the  manipulation and compromise of the integrity of VNF Packages. VNFM  VUL17 Improper VNF instantiation Lack of or improper mechanisms to prevent the instantiation of VNF packages unless their signature  is verified may enable the manipulation and compromise of the integrity of VNFs.  Ve-Vnfm-em; Ve-Vnfm- vnf  VUL18 Improper authentication policy  Unauthenticated access to the system functions of NFV management and orchestration: the use of a  system function without successful authentication on the basis of the user’s identity and at least one  authentication attribute (e.g. password, certificate) opens an opportunity for exploitation and limits  accountability. This includes M2M communication.  NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL19 Insecure or insufficient  authentication attributes  Failure to protect accounts by at least one authentication attribute or active predefined authentication  attributes: depending on information sensitivity, different levels of strong authentication mechanisms  are required. Failure to identify the proper correspondence between levels of protection and the  authentication mechanisms implemented creates the possibility unauthorised entities will be allowed  to access unallocated resources.  NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  93  VUL20 Insecure password policy  A password policy must address password structure, password change, hidden password display  capabilities and consecutive failed login attempts. A weak password structure and/or a password  validity period that is too long could lead to a successful brute force attack. Failure to block  consecutive failed login attempts may lead to a password being guessed.  NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL21  Insecure authentication  mechanisms to management or  maintenance interfaces  The network product management must support mechanisms for mutual authentication. The mutual  authentication mechanism can rely on the protocol used for the interface itself or other means. NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL22 Insecure authorisation and access  control mechanisms  The authorisations for accounts and applications must be reduced to the minimum required for the  tasks they have to perform. NFV-MANO; VNF; NFVI  VUL23  Insufficient or  improper monitoring  mechanisms of NFV  Insufficient or inadequate logging  of security events for MANO and  NFVI  A lack of security events being logged together with a unique system reference (e.g. host name, IP or  MAC address) and the exact time an incident occurred do not allow a correct and rapid audit in the  event of security incidents occurring  NFV-MANO; NFVI  VUL24 Logs not transferred to centralised  storage  Security event logs should be forwarded or uploaded to a central location or external systems.  Security event log files shall also be protected in storage and transfer states. NFV-MANO; NFVI  VUL25 Improper protection of security  event log files  Availability and integrity of log files of security events could lead to delays, wrong audit results, delays  in the restoration of security and the persistence of threats. NFV-MANO; NFVI  VUL26  Vulnerabilities due to  legacy OSS/BSS  systems  Use of weak cryptographic  algorithms  The OSS/BSS applications may use weak cryptography in their components. According to ANSSI,  BSI, SOG-IS and NIST reports, several encryptions and hashing algorithms are considered insecure.  For instance, TDES, MD5, SHA1, RSA (key size smaller than 2048 bits) algorithms are still used for  encryption, signature and hashing purposes. These algorithms are considered inadequate for  modern security requirements. A weak encryption algorithm is a critical security problem in an  OSS/BSS system since the encrypted data transmitted with NFV/MANO includes sensitive  information.  OSS/BSS systems  VUL27 Insecure interface between  OOS/BSS and NFV/MANO  The security of each interface depends on the type of interface, manufacturer, etc. Newer interfaces  such as SOAP and REST over TLS are more secure than older interfaces. Unsecure interfaces may  still be in use such as TLSv1, FTP, SNMP and compromised by exploiting vulnerabilities in protocols  such as insecure settings, spoofing, and other vulnerabilities.  OSS/BSS systems  VUL28 Insufficient or inadequate logging  of sensitive data  OSS/BSS systems log high amounts of data, which includes request logs, provisioning logic  execution logs, user audit trails, etc. Apart from helping in finding faults in the application, logging  also helps in finding security breaches. Nevertheless, the high amount of data that goes into  OSS/BSS logs makes logging an important asset to secure. Logs may be archived in insecure  network storage. Attackers can use a combination of attacks to get access to logs.  OSS/BSS systems  VUL29  Improper protection of  service-based  interfaces  Improper transport layer protection  of service-based interfaces (SBI)  Service-based-interfaces of network functions should provide adequate protection for access and for  data in transit. Relevant vulnerabilities include:  • improper transport layer protection, and improper authentication mechanisms;  • vulnerable authorisation mechanisms on service access.  All 5G network functions  (NF) utilising SBI  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  94  VUL30  Vulnerabilities of 5G  NFs  Incorrect implementation of 5G  network functions security  requirements  Incorrect or incomplete implementation of security requirements, as defined in 3GPP TS 33.501 open  confidentiality, integrity and availability risk, for all data passed across networks and for unprotected  access to network functions.

UPF; AMF; UDM; SMF;  AUSF; SEPP; NRF; NEF  VUL31 Improper protection of data and  information of 5G NFs components  Relevant vulnerabilities include:  • system functions revealing confidential data;  • improper protection of data and information in storage;  • lack of or improper cryptographic protection of data in transfer;  • no traceability of access to personal data.  UPF/User data;  UPF/Signalling data;  gNB; AMF; UDM; SMF;  AUSF; SEPP; NRF; NEF  VUL32 Improper protection of availability  and integrity of 5G NFs  Relevant vulnerabilities include:  • failure to address overload situation;  • boot from unauthorised memory devices;  • improper handling of unexpected input;  • insufficient assurance of software package integrity.

A VM or container or group of VMs or containers  connected to the same network can be the target of attacks from other VMs or containers on the  network. (2) The virtualisation layer (host OS, hypervisor and CIS software): the most important  software in a virtual system is the virtualisation layer. Any security vulnerability in the virtualisation  VIM/CISM  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  97  layer and associated infrastructure and management software or tools puts VNFs at risk.

An attack on a single VNF installed in NFVI can compromise the entire infrastructure.  A malicious administrator manages to obtain confidential information about a user thanks to some  badly implemented virtualisation procedures in an NFV context. Since the malicious administrator has  root access to the virtualisation layer, by using a search operation he can extract the user ID,  passwords and cryptographic keys from the memory dump, which in turn violates user privacy and data  confidentiality. To execute this attack, the attacker first creates a backup copy of the VM drive and then  uses open-source tools, such as kpartx and vgscan, to extract sensitive data from it.  Another attacker scenario is that the hypervisor or CIS administration role can be used to manage the  VM or container and vSwitch environment. The administrator could use this environment to monitor or  eavesdrop security critical information operating on a VM or container or passing between NFVs  components. The administration role may eavesdrop unsecured traffic (e.g. unsecured SIP - session  initiation protocol) or create a memory dump of a running VM or container to obtain security critical or  personal information, e.g. customer authentication credentials, which would allow them to log into the  customer SIP account and fraudulently use their service or have access to compromise customer  privacy.  Note: the risk posed by the hypervisor or CIS administrator role exists in all deployment scenarios.  However, the risk is increased if this role is not under the direct control of the operator.  Impacts:  As one of the objectionable operations, the administrator can extract and use the memory dump of a  user’s VM or container to extract a user’s ID and password and TLS keys which is a direct breach of  the user’s privacy.  Access  breach [50]  ATT2 Attacks from within an  NFV  Software flaw  attacks  Software components with NFV are vulnerable to different types of attacks. The security breaches  brought to the NFVI by one software can spread out to other components and therefore make the  entire environment vulnerable. Software NFV components may carry flaws in their design, but not  specifically related to their code. Misconfigurations are typically exploited to perform such attacks.  Another attack can be obtaining a privileged status by using return-oriented-programming.  Impacts:  A vendor with wrong intentions may provide weak security features in the software which makes the  software vulnerable to attack and therefore puts the entire network to risk. This example will qualify for  both human-instigated and software vulnerability. It could be possible to bypass firewall restrictions or  to take advantage of a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [86], [52], [88]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  99  ATT3 Attacks from within an  NFV  Resource misuse  attacks Misuse of shared resources (by user or VNF): resource misuse attacks e.g. RFA and FRC attacks  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [87]  ATT4 Attacks from within an  NFV  Security standard  subversion attacks  Vulnerabilities present in security standards can be exploited. Consequently, all the components  supporting those standards are affected. Two examples are set out here below:  1. Vulnerabilities in the 5G or 4G security standards: new vulnerabilities are revealed affecting  both the operator infrastructure and end-devices (including mobiles, NB-IoT, laptop etc). As  demonstrated in the paper New Vulnerabilities in 5G Networks93, these vulnerabilities can  be exploited in 4G base stations or in commercially available NB-IoT protocols using low- cost hardware and software platforms to mount battery draining, hijacking and bidding down  attacks. Those attacks affect the range from gigabit high speed LTE devices to NB-IoT  devices.  2. Vulnerabilities in the NIST Special Publication 800-90A and ISO 18031 standards94 95: these  standards contain algorithms for generating the random numbers used, for example, to  generate keys for cryptographic systems. One of the algorithms contained within these  documents is a pseudorandom number generator called the dual elliptic curve deterministic  random bit generator (Dual EC DRBG) that has long been known to admit a serious  potential back door in the event that an attacker generates the standard algorithm  parameters. Several cryptographic software vendors have implemented Dual EC in their  products. For example, OpenSSL’s FIPS module includes Dual EC as an optional random  number generator. The backdoor which used Dual_EC_DRBG as a CSPRNG would allow  the attacker with knowledge of the trapdoor to decrypt, for example, TLS encryption or VPN  traffic, read all traffic, and modify the data as needed.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [90], [91], [92]  ATT5 Attacks from within an  NFV LI attacks  Attack scenario due to the hybrid legacy or virtual LI architecture:  Compromise of legacy node: In this scenario, an attacker makes use of the VNFs or host OS or  hypervisor or CIS or associated signalling within the NFV domain to attack legacy nodes which were  otherwise previously secure. This could be as simple as the legacy nodes now sharing the same  administration domains as VNFs such that the legacy node operations become more visible to MANO  than was possible in the full legacy network. Legacy nodes are unlikely to implement many of the  mechanisms an LI VNFCI POI would utilise based on ETSI GS NFV-SEC 012. Therefore, NFV may  considerably compromise the security by protecting the obscurity of legacy POIs. Furthermore, it may  be relatively simple to monitor overt events in the NFV domain and then look for corresponding  SDN/NFV actions taken by legacy POIs in mixed networks. Furthermore, the physical firewalls and  other protection mechanisms around the legacy nodes may be virtualised, considerably increasing the  attack exposure surface to those nodes. It is also possible to consider a scenario where an attacker  initiates an attack from within the legacy domain which is then allowed to route through VNFs (not  directly impacting the VNFs), which then returns as a trusted message into the legacy domain which  does result in an attack.

These  attacks do not aim at gaining control over the resource nor at exfiltrating data, but only affect its  availability.  The major reason behind such attacks are:  1) VNFs getting controlled remotely (by a third party),  2) due to a completely external malicious attack in order to destroy the NFVI such as can be done with  a DDOS. A VNF’s internal vulnerabilities also make it open to external attacks.  Impacts:  1. A denial-of-service attack (DoS) can be attempted on the NFV infrastructure in order to  make it run out of resources and therefore also shut down its service to some extent. During  the DoS attack, one VNF can be targeted for the attack and be made to generate numerous  amount of traffic to be sent to other VNFs running on the same host or on a different host.  The danger of DDoS could also affect untargeted services and tenants that are hosted on  the same physical host.  2. Such an attack can be performed from the hypervisor or CIS by using the management  console (or a service controlling it) to shut down the targeted VM container.  3. Network protocols can be used to flood the hypervisor or CIS and/or its execution  environment using DDoS attacks.  4. A more discreet manner to proceed with such a denial of service is to reconfigure the virtual  hardware environment to cause VM or container dysfunction (e.g. reducing allocated RAM)  to reduce the footprint of the attack.  5. The networking environment may be shared with other tenants of the NFV sharing the same  virtualisation layer. The traffic introduced by the other tenants may cause increased risks  including DoS on the NFVI.  Denial of  service  [50], [77], [85],  [86], [87], [52],  [88]  ATT7 Attacks from outside  an NFV  DNS Amplification  attacks  The NFVI supports a virtual DNS and the NFV orchestrator can increase the number of DNS servers  depending upon the number of queries. An attacker generates multiple DNS queries using IP spoofing  and as a response more virtual DNS are rolled out by the orchestrator. This can lead to a further  shutting down of the services of the NFV.  Denial of  service [50]  ATT8 Attacks from outside  an NFV Injection attacks  It is a malware injection attack on the hypervisor or CIS and its VMs or containers. A hypervisor or CIS  allows multiple VMs or containers to communicate and integrate with each other, taking care to  manage the virtualisation layer of the NFV system. A malware injection aims to affect the virtualisation  layer in the infrastructure of NFV via altering its internal code. The degree as to how badly a malware  attack affects the system varies, including slowing down the response time for the system.  Malware injection attacks implemented on VMs or containers can also cause modification to the  permissions of the virtual service. It may lead to having the sensitive data of VNFs visible to other  VNFs in unauthorised ways. Also, this attack could affect the NFV host OS and hypervisor or CIS,  which may lead to dysfunction in the CPU, VMs or containers and in the memory of the system.  An attacker (e.g. supplier that has installed some Trojan in its VNF supply to attack other co-hosted  VNF) can break the confidentiality and integrity of a software (code + data) once it is launched.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [69], [87]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  101  ATT9 Attacks from outside  an NFV OSS/BSS attacks  An attacker may spoof an OSS/BSS system. A malicious system posing as an OSS/BSS can disrupt  the network by sending incorrect configuration requests to the NFV/MANO and SDN systems. If the  attacker is able to spoof a system, it can mount a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, which might lead to  tampering with data or sniffing out important information on the interface with MANO and NFV systems.  Alternately, the attacker might just passively listen to the information (sniff) on an interface. In addition,  the attacker may perform DoS attacks on the NFV/MANO and SDN systems.  An attacker can deny service to the OSS/BSS systems by using several techniques such as resource  exhaustion by sending multiple login requests or a high number of provisioning requests.  An attacker may be able to sniff the credentials used by the OSS/BSS systems due to a weak  authentication or authorisation implementation to authenticate with the NFV or MANO. Data transfer in  plaintext is vulnerable to sniffing, which can reveal subscribers’ personal information and secret  network parameters.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [100]  ATT10 Attacks from outside  an NFV LI attacks  Attack scenario due to the hybrid legacy-virtual LI architecture:  Compromise of virtualised node: In this scenario, an attacker makes use of a legacy LI node (POI or  wider node functionality) or associated signalling to that node, in order to attack an otherwise secure  VNF containing a vPOI. This could be as simple as capturing unencrypted or poorly secured messages  sent to legacy nodes and then using these messages to perform attacks on the VNF. Since the VNF is  required to trust the legacy nodes and communicate with them using legacy protocols, the VNFs  becomes at risk of bid down, man-in-the-middle or plain text attacks on the messages or interfaces.  Furthermore, an attacker, by studying the operation of a legacy node, may be able to identity inference  attacks against a VNF of the same type and manufacture (e.g. legacy CSCF vs VNF CSCF). It is also  possible to consider a scenario where an attacker initiates an attack from within the NFV domain which  is then allowed to route through legacy nodes (not directly impacting the legacy nodes), which then  returns as a trusted message into the NFV domain which does result in an attack.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [127]  ATT11  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Malicious  VM/Container  attacks  Hypervisor or CIS resource monopolisation attacks: the hypervisor or CIS resource monopolisation  attacks consist of a malicious VM or container taking control of a hypervisor or CIS to gain exclusive  access to these resources. This leads to the violation of the isolation of the hypervisor or CIS resource  or to the theft of data from other VMs or containers.  VM or container hopping attacks: a VM or container hopping attack consists of a malicious VM or  container that directly targets another VM or container from the virtualisation environment. Such attacks  permit the tampering and the elevation of privilege in the virtualisation architecture.  VM or container monitoring attacks: the attacks consist of a VM or container monitoring another VM or  container to collect information about that VM or container without compromising it. They can typically  rely on passive monitoring of another VM container. These attacks are mainly conditioned by the  exploitation of side channels, and the co-residence of VMs or containers.  VM or Container escape attacks: the VM or container escape attack aims at compromising the  hypervisor or CIS in order to access another VM or container or execute code in the physical host. It is  very similar to VM or container hopping, and corresponds to the same threats, but relies on the  hypervisor or CIS compromise to break the isolation. Once the attacker gains access to one of the VMs  or containers, it uses this VM or container’s network connectivity to reach the hypervisor or CIS API  and then attacks the hypervisor or CIS to cause great damage. The major supporting factor behind this  type of attack is the improper isolation of hypervisor or CIS and VMs or containers.  Impacts:  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [50], [88]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  102  1. These attacks may affect memory pages owned by other VMs or containers, to proceed to  in-memory information leakage or even to build a hidden channel between both VMs or  containers.  2. These attacks may contribute to leaks of cryptography keys.  ATT12  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Malicious  hypervisor/CIS  attacks  These attacks target the hypervisor or CIS of the virtualisation architecture. The threats related to these  attacks affect the hypervisor or CIS itself, by tampering with it, repudiating the traceability of its  behaviour, disclosing information about its configuration and the configuration of the VM or container,  and elevating the privilege of a VM or container user to that of the hypervisor or CIS administrator.  The VM or container introspection attack exploits a malicious hypervisor or CIS to analyse the  behaviour of a VM or container and infer its internal state.  The inter-VM or container communication introspection attacks may also provide interesting information  regarding the communications of the VM or container with other hosted VMs or containers through I/O  or networking subsystems that are handled by the hypervisor or CIS. This raises privacy issues related  to the interception and introspection of communications.  If a type 2 solution or container is deployed then the virtual environment is subject to any vulnerability  that might exist in the underlying OS. For example, a missed patch or update could expose the host  OS, hypervisor CIS and VMs or containers to attack.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [88], [47]  ATT13  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Command/control  channel attacks  The command and control channel is a privileged communication medium between the hypervisor or  CIS and a VM or container. This threat targets the hypervisor or CIS, through the repudiation of  malicious activities in a VM or container.  Access  breach  [88]  ATT14  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Hardware attacks  Hypervisors or CISs and host OSs are running at the top of a hardware layer. They are therefore  constrained by the hardware layer, which is composed of devices with their own firmwares. These  firmwares may carry their own flaws, providing the necessary material to an attacker to compromise  them. The corresponding threats are tampering with hardware, the disclosure of information based on  side channels, and the elevation of privileges to get control on the software components running over  the hardware. These attacks are emphasised by the hard constraints regarding the upgrade procedure  of these firmwares. Such upgrades are typically limited by the degradation of services during the  upgrade process, or by a lack of support from manufacturers.  The Spectre and Meltdown issues96 are substantial threats that have severe impacts on security. The  vulnerabilities allow processes to read information in memory that should not be accessible to them.  User processes can access information from other processes and the kernel, and in a virtualised  environment they can also access information on the host and, potentially, other guests.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [88]  ATT15  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Network attacks  Attackers may find a way to compromise the communication between NFV and MANO. Privilege  escalation is a common attack on the VIM, and, if successful, it can lead to partial control over the host.  Attacks on network functions and/or resources (e.g. spoofing, sniffing and denial of service) can also  take place.  An attacker can compromise virtual firewalls to restrict firewall functionality while allowing sufficient  access to carry out the attack.

A rogue element could also  generate and amplify traffic, log data or any other type of data that require other network elements to  act upon it. The goal of such an attack is to limit the ability of the network to cope with the current traffic  load and to disrupt the network’s ability to provide the services intended.  ATT16  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Time manipulation  attacks  This could introduce several threats such as tampering with security logs, expiry of used certificates or  UEs getting out of sync with the network.  If an attack manipulates the network timing source or VNF clock, the network can be compromised.  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [110]  ATT17  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  LI attacks  An example of this attack could be manipulating the lawful intercept functionality, which may provide  the attacker with the ability to access this function at will through enabling unauthorised accounts or the  redirection of IP traffic.  A national memory stack segment (MSS) may be deployed in a foreign datacentre where local LEA  (law enforcement agency) legislation allows access to the security critical customer and LI information.  Access  breach  Integrity  compromise  [127]  ATT18  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Orchestration  attacks  Attack scenario 1: Spoofing of the orchestration platform’s service requests may result in an attacker  being able to generate service requests to cause DoS by:  • provisioning new instances in order to deplete the number of resources available to the NFV or  SDN components;  • retiring NFV instances or SDN elements that are in use by the operational network;  • changing the SDN configuration.  This risk could impact a single element or the whole mobile network.  Attack scenario 2: Spoofing as an SDN controller, VIM or VNFM to send service management requests  to the orchestration platform on the resource performance could cause the orchestration platform to  initiate changes on the infrastructure.  This exploit could be used by an attacker who wants to force the orchestration platform to move a NFV  component to another datacentre where the attacker may have physical access or has compromised  the virtualisation layer and wants to monitor customer traffic.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [86], [6]  ATT19  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Supply chain  attacks  Compromised components could affect network performance and compromise the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of network assets. Furthermore, compromised devices may provide malicious  actors with persistent access to 5G networks and the capability to intercept data that routes through the  devices. Compromised devices may infect connected computers, phones and other devices with  malware and may have data rerouted, changed or deleted.  Untrusted companies that have significant international market share within telecommunication  networks may introduce risks even if they do not have a large presence within EU networks. Therefore,  even if the EU network were completely secure, data traveling overseas may pass through untrusted  telecommunication networks and potentially be vulnerable to interception, manipulation, disruption, or  destruction.  This may result in anything from an attacker being able to install a malicious configuration and  ultimately control the network element or function or, in the case of a damaged deployment, it could  lead to limited or total failure of all the network elements that are scheduled to be updated.  Access  breach  Denial of  service  Integrity  compromise  [62]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  104  An untrusted host OS and hypervisor or CIS may have embedded vulnerabilities (for example  embedded Trojan software or rooted OS), exposing all VMs or containers and associated NFVs to  attack. An attacker may exploit these embedded vulnerabilities to allow them to compromise VMs or  containers operating within the hypervisor or CIS.  As different virtualisation environments may provide different levels of security protection for the  application layer, stand-alone testing of a VNF may not ensure that the desired level of assurance of  the VNF remains the same when deployed in different virtualised scenarios. Furthermore, VNFs used  in different service types (e.g. network slices) or different services (e.g. vertical services) may face  requirements for security assurance that are different from the service layer. A VNF successfully tested  in isolation may not provide the required level of assurance for a specific slice or service, for a given  NFVI.  ATT20  Attacks occurring  between NFV  components  Third party hosting  attacks  A third-party tenant has direct access to the SAN (storage area network) and any local storage used by  NFVs within the datacentre. This privileged access could facilitate access to security critical or  customer information, or a DoS attack.  When deployed by an operator who uses a third party host environment not under the operator’s  control, without appropriate protection, the sensitive information of a VNF could be compromised by the  third party.  An attacker with physical access to the hardware environment may be able to tamper or remove the  TPM (trusted platform module), disabling the trusted computing platform function and facilitating other  attacks, e.g. allowing an untrusted host OS and hypervisor or CIS to be installed.

Security function embedded within the VM container: the advantage of this option is that the network security function is aware of the context of  the VM or container. For example, the firewall is aware of any new port used by the network function and thus requires less configuration. The  disadvantage is that the operator may not be able to choose or change the vendor of the security function, who is chosen by the provider of the  network function.  Security function as a standalone VM/Container: the network security functions are standalone VMs or containers. This option provides the  operator with the flexibility to choose a vendor of security functions to protect particular network interfaces. However, such an architecture is exposed  to malicious changes of the network topology and other network layer risks.  Security function in the virtualisation layer: the network security agents are outside of the VMs or containers within the virtualisation layer. A  single security function can protect all the VMs or containers managed by the virtualisation layer instead of having one security function per VM or  container. The operator can easily change the vendor of the security function as the security function is independent of the VM or container. This  option may, however, require more configuration compared with the first option where the security function is embedded within the VM or container.  Network interfaces should be locked down so that they only accept a restricted number of expected protocols.  [1], [61], [47],  [25]  BP-T2 VNF Image validation  and protection  A VNF Package is composed of several components such as, for example, VNFD, software images, scripts, etc. During the on-boarding of the VNF  package, a validation of the package should be performed. The validation should be a procedure that verifies the integrity of the VNF package. A  package is certified by performing acceptance testing and full functional testing against the VNF including configuration, management and service  assurance.  It is easy to tamper with VNF images. It requires only a few seconds to insert some malware into a VNF image file while it is being uploaded to an  image database or being transferred from an image database to a compute node. Luckily, VNF images can be cryptographically signed and verified  during launch time. This can be achieved by setting up some signing authority and modifying the hypervisor or CIS configuration to verify an image’s  signature before they are launched.  The software package and the artefacts within the package of a VNF shall have their integrity protected by the vendor’s signature. The software  package and the artefacts within the package of a VNF and the software catalogue holding its image should have their integrity protected after  onboarding. The software package and the artefacts within the package of a VNF containing sensitive information must support the protection of  confidentiality.  Software package and artefacts within the package of a VNF must be bound to a specific network after onboarding, such that unauthorised software  cannot be instantiated even if it has a valid vendor certificate.  [1], [13] [50],  [47], [25],  [133]  BP-T3 Tracking VNF version  changes  The orchestration and VNF management systems should have the ability to keep track of multiple versions, multiple environments, multiple instances  and allow the service provider team to perform updates or upgrades with clear expectations of service continuity based on metadata information  including component dependencies.  [13], [38]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  106  BP-T4 VNF deployment  Minimum baseline security controls and hardening measures should be configured for new VNF deployments. This can be done in many ways such  as using pre-hardened golden images, deployment time configuration, etc. Such controls include fully implemented access control rules and ensuring  that any unused ports, features, insecure protocols, or services are disabled.  [6], [25]  BP-T5 VNF deletion or  relocation  The NFVO may only relocate or retire a VNF after backup and storage of critical data such as encryption keys or subscriber information to ensure  this data is not lost during migration or restructuring of the network. This also applies when a request to relocate or retire a VNF comes from the  EMS.  The NFVO may only relocate or retire a VNF after having validated that the security and affinity policies can be and will be applied upon  reintroduction of the element either in the same or a new location. This validation must take into account both operator and regulatory requirements.  The NFVO may only relocate or retire a VNF after its operational state is no longer depended upon by other VNFs. In the event of a VNF being  attacked or compromised it should be possible to isolate the VNF from the production environment and restore the VNF to a state prior to the attack.  It should also be possible to take a snapshot of the affected VNF to allow for security investigation and analysis.  [38], [122]  BP-T6 Cryptography  Secure key management must be implemented to manage all the steps of a key lifecycle: key generation using an appropriate level of entropy from a  reliable source, secure key storage, key rotation and revocation, secure key destruction, etc.  The use of tamper resistant hardware security modules for secure boot and secure execution of cryptographic algorithms should be considered.  Specific security cryptographic mechanisms include bidirectional authentication, transmission encryption and integrity protection.  3GPP TS 33.50197 offers a detailed explanation of the security architecture and procedures for 5G. ENISA98 lists several cryptographic best  practices to accomplish this, including:  • encrypt UE by default;  • apply not-NULL ciphering for user and signalling data;  • use a secure protocol on the network for both user and control plane data;  • use state-of-the-art mechanisms for transport protection and mutual authentication;  • implement the required authentication specifications and consider secondary authentication;  • ensure keys are properly protected and stored;  • ensure use of current security protocols for TLS (TLS 1.2 and above) and appropriate key and certificate management practices;  • use tamper-resistant hardware for storing or processing critical data.  ETSI GR NFV-SEC 00599 provides a guide to the use of public key infrastructures (PKI) for the purpose of distributing public key certificates (PKC)  as applicable to the ETSI ISG NFV for the support of public key cryptography in authenticating, authorising and encrypting links between objects in  NFV.  ENISA also recommends establishing PKI infrastructure for secure admin access and protecting your network against external access, especially in  a cloud environment.  [25], [133]  BP-T7 Hypervisor/CIS  protection  Hypervisor or CIS introspection can be used to scrutinise software running inside VMs or containers to find abnormal activities. It acts as a host- based IDS that has access to the states of all VMs or containers, so that the root kit and boot kit inside VMs or containers cannot hide easily. Using  introspection capabilities, the hypervisor’s or CIS’s functionalities are enhanced, enabling it, among other things, to monitor network traffic, access  files in storage, and to execute read memory. Hypervisor or CIS introspection APIs are powerful tools to perform deep VM or container analysis and  [1], [50], [47],  [25]  97 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3169  98 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-in-5g-specifications/  99 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gr/NFV-SEC/001_099/005/01.02.01_60/gr_NFV-SEC005v010201p.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  107  potentially increase VM or container security. However, they can also be used as an exploit that makes it possible to break and bypass the isolation  between VMs or containers and the hypervisor or CIS.  Example: LibVMI is the library for hypervisor introspection for various platforms, implemented in C language with Python bindings. It gives the  hypervisor the means to perform deep inspection of VMs (e.g. memory checking, vCPU register inspection, and recording trapping events).  The hypervisor or CIS must enforce network security policies. This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that;  • VMs or containers are isolated from each other,  • VMs or containers are prevented from accessing each other’s memory spaces,  • keys used to encrypt memory are also under hypervisor or CIS control,  • hypervisors or CISs are not allowed to write directly to memory,  • hypervisors or CISs are not allowed to bypass normal memory access controls and security within the VM or container,  • hypervisors or CISs are not allowed to change data within a VNF at run-time.  Note: a Type 1 hypervisor is considered significantly more secure than a Type 2 'hosted' solution (where the hypervisor is installed on top of the host  OS directly controlling the hardware and network adapters) as there are less attack services (OS and hypervisor).  BP-T8 Security Management  and Orchestration  One best practice consists of designing a NFV orchestrator incorporating the security and trust requirements of the NFVI. The orchestration and  management of security functions requires integration by enabling interaction among the security orchestrator, the VNFM, and the element  management systems (EMS). This type of protection can be achieved by setting scaling boundaries in the VNFD or network service descriptor  (NSD), for example, and having the NFVO enforce these restrictions to protect from attacks such as a DNS amplification attack.  Operators must ensure that they use an out-of-band (OOB) management network that is not accessible from the internet so management interfaces  are secured from remote access. If an operator allows for remote access into the OOB for employees and/or OEM support, the operator must ensure  that they use a multi-factor authentication (MFA), at a minimum, for any type of VPN access. An MFA VPN combined with zero-trust greatly improves  secure remote access to protect the 5GC Network.  Secure management and administration of the NFVI and NFV-MANO is critical for the security of a virtualised network. The following describe the  basic principles for such secure management.  a) Administration of the NFVI is only available over mutually authenticated, encrypted and integrity protected channels or APIs.  b) All channels or APIs are separated from each other and use separate credentials.  c) The number of privileged accounts for the NFVI is constrained to a minimal manageable number to meet the CSP’s needs.  d) NFV-MANO and NFVI administrators do not have any privileged rights to other services within the CSP.  e) NFV-MANO and NFVI administrators are only provided with the privileges and accesses required to carry out their role.  f) NFV-MANO and NFVI administrators do not have access to workloads running within the virtualised environment.  g) NFV-MANO and NFVI administration access is limited to best practice configuration methods (e.g. authorised API calls).  h) Internal components within VNFs are not able to directly connect to entities or management functions outside of the network trust domain,  except via interfaces that are explicitly part of the VNF security design.  i) NFV-MANO and NFVI administration is automated wherever possible.  j) Manual administration of the NFVI is by exception and raises a security alert.  k) Functions that manage the administration and security of the NFVI (e.g. MANO) are physically separate and do not run on the same NFVI  as the NFs they manage.  [1], [50], [57],  [61], [18]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  108  l) Functions that support the administration and security of the NFVI are treated as security critical functions.  BP-T9 Remote attestation  The remote attestation (RA) technique can be used to remotely verify the trust status of an NFV platform. ETSI suggests leveraging hardware  security module (HSM), trusted platform module (TPM) and virtual TPM/HSM (vTPM/vHSM) to provide trusted protection for VNFs. These modules  are used to shelter integrity measurements (i.e. hash values), cryptographic keys and certificates that are required to empower remote attestation of  VNF components. Indeed, remote attestation guarantees the integrity of VNF instances at load time. Practical implementations of the remote  attestation service include the open cloud integrity tool (openCIT), an open-source software hosted on GitHub.  It shall be possible to attest a VNF through the full attestation chain from the hardware layer through the virtualisation layer to the VNF layer.  Attestation of a platform’s integrity should be linked to the application layer and possible for other functions to query. If platform attestation fails, the  VNF should not be allowed to run.  Attestation of the VNF should be performed prior to deployment or network integration and during operations.  In ETSI GR NFV-SEC 018, several use case scenarios are described that aim to establish specific trust between NFV stakeholders:  (1) measurement of VM during launch,  (2) protected VM launch on a trusted NFVI,  (3) measurement of VM during launch and while in use,  (4) remote attestation of secret storage,  (5) secure VM migration between two trusted NFVIs.  Other Examples of attestation solutions are Hytrust and OpenAttestation.  In the OpenAttestation example, the launch of a VM only occurs when the Openstack Controller gets the confirmation that the compute node is  trustworthy from a so-called attestation server (AS) which performs the appraisal of the trusted compute pool that Openstack Controller wants to use  for the VM.  [1], [50], [47],  [132]  BP-T10  Software compliance  and integrity  preservation  (6) A software checksum (hash or signature) should be created by the vendor during NFV and a supporting NFVI (e.g. host OS, hypervisor or  CIS, SDN Controllers) software compilation that can be validated with a corresponding checksum created during any testing and  validation process operated by the operator or a third party.  (7) TEE is an important enabler for that goal. Tamper-proofing techniques enable the preservation of software integrity by causing an altered  software to fail.  (8) The concept of trusted execution and the associated technologies (e.g. Intel SGX enclave) that make certain that even a malicious host  OS or operator cannot tamper or inspect any managed payload memory space.  [1], [63]  BP-T11  Security segmentation  and isolation between  network functions  To prevent a VM or container from impacting other VMs, containers or hosts, it is a best practice to separate VM or container traffic and management  traffic. This will prevent attacks by VMs or containers tearing into the management infrastructure. It is also a good idea to separate the VLAN traffic  into groups and disable all other VLANs that are not in use. Likewise, VMs or containers of similar functionalities can be grouped into specific zones  and their traffic should be isolated. Each zone can be protected using access control policies and a dedicated firewall based on security level it  needs. One example of such zones is a demilitarised zone (DMZ). Due to differing security requirements, a separate virtual environment using  separate clusters should be setup for VNFs and MANO.  Physical and/or logical separation shall be applied to keep sensitive control plane sub-components within a VNF (e.g. key material or billing data)  away from lower security sub-functions or other general user plane traffic handling sub-functions.  Best practices include:  [1], [50], [75],  [78], [79],  [47], [25], [17]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  109  (1) Linux kernel security: in virtualised platforms, the kernel of the host systems is a highly important component that provides isolation  between the applications. The SELinux module, developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), is implemented in the kernel and  provides robust isolation between the tenants when virtualisation technology is used over the host. Secure virtualisation (sVirt) is a new  form of SELinux, developed to integrate mandatory access control security with Linux based hypervisors. sVirt provides isolation between  VM processes and data files. Beyond these tools, other kernel hardening tools can be useful to secure the Linux kernel. A notable  example is hidepd, which can be used to prevent unauthorised users from seeing the process information of other users. Another example  is GRSecurity, which provides protection against attacks on corrupted memory.  (2) Best practices are to avoid co-hosting, on the same hardware, VNFs that have very different levels of sensitivity or very different levels of  vulnerability to influence by an attacker.  (3) The trust domains of network functions should be identified. Each trust domain should be managed separately. Security policies for each  trust domain should be managed independently.  (4) Delegated administrator roles must be used, with roles which could give a user or administrator the ability to inspect the memory of  functions only in exceptional circumstances.  (5) Confidentiality protection should be provided to protect information traveling between memory locations in a single or multiple logical  memory block.  BP-T12 Secure boot integrity  Using trusted platform module (TPM) as a hardware root of trust, the measurement of system sensitive components such as platform firmware,  BIOS, bootloader, OS kernel, and other system components can be securely stored and verified. The platform measurement can only be taken when  the system is reset or rebooted; there is no way to write the new platform measurement in TPM during the system run-time. The validation of the  platform measurements can be performed by TPM’s launch control policy (LCP) or through the remote attestation server.  [50], [79], [25]  BP-T13 Data protection and  privacy  For the RAN operator, theft of sensitive or private data may result in churn, fines and loss of business due to compromised business reputation or  regulatory violation. The operator is responsible for ensuring that data in transit, at rest and in use are protected according to the requirements of the  regulatory agency and use case using the following best industry practices:  Data at rest  Sensitive information of a VNF shall be protected during its lifecycle process to avoid leakage of the information to other VNFs reusing the storage  resource.  Data should be backed up, while sensitive data, such as security logs, should be encrypted before storage in the persistent volume. Access control  and monitoring data access and usage are other essential functions for protecting data. A privacy impact assessment (PIA) for personally identifiable  information (PII) should be performed to identify and mitigate privacy risks to data assets.  When VNF moves from one host to another or when VNF is terminated, the system should ensure that resources, privacy sensitive data, and/or keys  are fully cleared.  Security policy which restricts where certain types of data can reside should be defined and implemented by CSPs.  Data in transit  Data must be encrypted, and its integrity protected, when it flows between the different parts of the VNFs and, externally, between NFV nodes to  defend against internal and external attacks. 3GPP 33.501 stipulates mutual authentication with X.509 certificates. In addition, the following security  protocols among others should be used:  • air interface: 5G provides encryption and integrity protection of control signalling and encryption and optional integrity of user data;  • control plane: DTLS 1.2;  • management plane: Mutual TLS using version 1.2 and above.  [47], [25],  [113]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  110  Data-in-use  Depending on the existing protection of the cloud infrastructure, additional protection of data in use could be needed. For instance, the use of trusted  execution environments (TEE) has the potential to increase the security of crypto and key-management operations and protect data in use.  BP-T14 Encrypting VNF  volume/swap areas  The best practice to secure the VNF volumes is by encrypting them and storing the cryptographic keys at safe locations. TPM or HSM modules can  be used to securely store these keys. In addition, the hypervisor or CIS should be configured to securely wipe out the virtual volume disks in the  event a VNF is crashed or intentionally destroyed to prevent it from unauthorised access. VM or container swapping is a memory management  technique used to move memory segments from the main memory to disk, which is used as a secondary memory in order to increase system  performance in case the system runs out of memory. These transferred memory segments can contain sensitive information such as passwords and  certificates. They can be stored on the disk and remain persistent even after system reboot. This enables an attack scenario whereby a VM or  container swap is copied and investigated to retrieve any useful information. One way to avoid this kind of attack is to encrypt VM or container swap  areas. Linux based tools such as dm-crypt can be used for this purpose.  [50], [25],  [133]  BP-T15 Trusted computing  technologies  To provide a trusted hardware platform, the hardware (blade servers) should support Intel TXT, SGX, AMD SEV or ARM Trustzone silicon-based  security functionality implemented with a TPM that stores measurements of the entire hypervisor or CIS stack and boot process.  This measure should be applied to:  • blade clusters supporting VNF that support security critical functions; for example, lawful interception, customer access credential (HSS),  security key management (AuC) or that have external traffic interfaces directly accessed by third parties or customers (Internet, GRX);  • all other MANO and VNF blade clusters to improve base platform security and reduce the complexity of affinity rules and hardware cluster of  differing security trust levels.  A mechanism should be in place to identify any attempt to physically remove the TPM from a system board. If physical tampering has been identified  the blade server should be considered compromised and no longer be used to support VNFs. For example, on HP blades any attempt to remove an  installed TPM from the system board breaks or disfigures the TPM security rivet.  [25]  BP-T16 Hardware security  If hardware is provided by a third party cloud provider, then a dedicated cluster supporting only the operator’s VNFs should be provided to ensure  physical, not logical, segregation from other tenants.  It is also recommended that separate dedicated hardware is used to provide independent NFV management (MANO) and service clusters (NFV). In  addition, separated clusters should be used to provide MANO and NFVI.  The use of HW secure enclave technologies, such as AMD SEV and Intel TDX provide stronger tenant isolation from the cloud provider. The general  commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware may have varying levels of security functionality, such as hardware rooted secure storage, unique  hardware identities, secure boot with software integrity check, and trusted execution environment (TEE), built-in depending on the manufacturer.  TEE refers to a technique of storing or running code in a protected memory area where no other applications or the host have access. An example is  secure enclaves that can be used as a hardware root-of-trust for secure storage of secrets and running sensitive code. A HSM or TPM can be used  to provide hardware rooted protection of keys.  [113]  BP-T17 Centralised log  auditing  All the NFV, SDN and MANO elements should submit security events (e.g. authentication, authorisation and accounting, login attempts,  administration functions and configurations) to a centralised platform, which shall monitor and analyse in real time the messages for possible  attempts at intrusion. It is also recommended that all the elements make use of the same trust time synchronising source (e.g. NTP server) to  support accurate correlation of events across the network.  It is also recommended that all audit logs are transferred to a log management platform outside the NFV to maintain their integrity and remove the  risk of tampering.  [79], [80], [25]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  111  BP-T18  Use and ownership of  ‘root’ administration  credentials  It is recommended that:  • each hypervisor or CIS has a single ‘root’ admin account that is used for local administration and to connect the host to VIM;  • to avoid sharing this common ‘root’ account, across the whole NFVI, at least one local named user account be created and assigned full admin  privileges, and this account should be the primary account for operating the hypervisor or CIS;  • strong access controls, account privileges and security logging are enabled;  • the hypervisor or CIS is configured to support multiple administration roles, and as a minimum there must be an admin role (highest privilege)  and a separate operational role with minimal privileges to complete normal operational support;  • delegated administrator roles be used, with the global administrator role only being used in exceptional cases, e.g. to add permissions for other  high-level administrators;  • all administration login attempts and critical operations must be logged and audited.  [79], [6], [47],  [25]  BP-T19 VNF protection  Protection of VNFs  It should be possible to deploy a VNF to a host that provides specific security resources (e.g. HMEE, secure compute, secure memory) in order to  bind a VNF to a specific host or group of hosts.  Binding should be verified by secure hardware backed attestation of the health and security of the host. Controls should be verified and enforced at  boot time and each time a function is migrated.  The system should manage (e.g. assign or log bindings) key storage and confidential data in a manner that provides protection against data  compromise.  Sensitive data should only be decrypted or handled in an unencrypted format in VNFs on trusted and well-known hosts.  It must be possible to control whether untrusted or less trusted VNFs are allowed to run on the same host as VNFs in a higher trust domain.  It must be possible to further restrict VNFs on a single host depending on whether they handle decrypted sensitive data.  The system should prevent and detect unauthorised or unintended data manipulation and leakage (e.g. modification of VNF images, instantiating  parallel VM(s) or container(s) on the same physical CPU).  Securing internal VNF communication  Where a NFV is composed on multiple VNFs the vendor should demonstrate how it protects the internal communication of its NFV, as it transits  between VMs or containers.  Protection of stored data  NFV vendors should ensure that any security critical (including LI), customer privacy or confidentiality related information is stored securely on any  shared or local storage (e.g. SAN, SSD).  Vendors should be able to clearly state the security mechanisms used to protect this data using industry standard best practice (e.g. encryption).  Protection of LI data and functionality  NFV vendors should demonstrate how they are protecting LI functionality to ensure that it cannot be compromised or weakened by running their VNF  in the NFV environment.  It is recommended that vendors are asked to clearly state how they are compliant in protecting sensitive LI data and interfaces and to specify  whether there are any specific deployment requirements to allow their VNF to operate in a multi-vendor virtualised environment and ensure that the  integrity of their security mechanisms is maintained.  [6], [47], [25],  [123], [17]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  112  BP-T20  Local or removable  blade storage – SAN  protection  Local storage protection  If local blade storage is supported, then it should not store sensitive information such that its theft or removal would enable an attacker to gain a copy  of the stored data.  Mutual authentication between VMs or containers and SAN  Mutual authentication should be implemented between each VM or container and its associated SAN storage using CHAP (e.g. DH-CHAP, FCPAP).  SAN data protection in transit  The operator should consider protecting sensitive data in transit between NFV and SAN using encapsulated security payload (ESP), as specified by  the fibre channel protocol (FC-SP) or equivalent.  SAN physical blade interface  It is recommended that a separate physical interface module is used on each blade or rack mounted server for connectivity to the SAN. It is not  recommended for any SAN connectivity to share common IP interface with other operational traffic.  SAN storage protection  The SAN storage shall protect against tampering and any ability to create unauthorised local copies of any of the stored data.  In the event of tampering or unauthorised copying, an alarm and log event should be generated recording what data has been copied and which user  initiated the action.  Note: it is expected that the SAN security (including backup management) will be addressed through existing IT security controls for the operation,  access, backup and availability of the SAN.  [6], [47], [25],  [114]  BP-T21 Network security  Topology hiding  All internal interfaces between VNF elements, supporting MANO platforms and IT elements (mediation, provisioning) that are not required to publicly  communicate outside the operators network, should use private IP addresses.  It is recommended that all external interfaces are NAT through a firewalling function to provide additional protection of the identity of the elements  within the VNFI.  VNF network security profile  Each VNF supporting VNFC functions should have a predefined network security profile describing its requirements for vNICs, ports, port group,  VLANs and the requirement for internal VXLAN connections.  The security profile shall also define the vNIC firewall rules related to protocols (port numbers) that need to be supported on each VLAN or VXLAN  connection. It is expected that vendors will provide a security profile for their applications, which will have to be aligned with the operators’ zoning  guidelines.  Note: there should never be a requirement for all ports to be open, particularly on external standard based interfaces (e.g. GTP).  Deploy NFVs with separate dedicated interfaces  Ideally, separate physical interfaces should be implemented to maintain different traffic segregation in line with security zoning and X.805 principles.  However, if this is not supported by a vendor then a separate logical interface and VLAN must be used to maintain security zoning.  Production and O&M traffic separation  O&M interfaces should not share the same physical NIC, vNIC, distributed port group (DPG) or port group with other production traffic types (e.g.  BSS, User Plane or Signalling).  [6], [47], [25]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  113  Connectivity from management to production cluster  Any connectivity between the operation and management (MANO) cluster and the production cluster should pass through a firewall. If a virtual  firewall is implemented, it should be implemented within the management cluster.  Note: it is expected that MANO systems would not share the same hypervisor or CIS environment as production NFV elements.  Network resource pools  To prevent a VM or container causing a DoS by monopolising system and network resources, it is recommended that network resource pools should  be configured.  Internal virtual switching control  The internal hypervisor or CIS controlled virtual IP network (vSwitch/VDS) should be controlled to ensure a policy of positive enabling and must not  support default connectivity or ‘any to any’ functionality.  Virtual network monitoring  In some deployments, internal network monitoring functions can be installed on the virtualisation layer. If these are installed, the functions must be  restricted to the administrator only and should not provide a mechanism for compromising the security of the hypervisor or CIS or other VMs or  containers.  Additionally, any operation of this type of monitoring functionality should generate an alarm to the VIM and be recorded in the audit logs.  VLAN and VXLAN zoning  A comprehensive set of common VLAN and VXLANs must be created across each NFVi to ensure traffic separation and security zoning  requirements.  Note: VLAN and VXLAN zoning should ensure that clear vendor separation is maintained.  Only VLAN and VXLANs necessary to support VNFs hosted on a cluster should be configured on the ‘leaf’ and ‘spine’ switching layers. The VLAN IP  infrastructure should follow existing segmentation and zoning rules with the use of firewalls or other security controls to provide protection between  zones.  Existing hardware firewall appliances can continue to be used to provide boundary protection when connecting to untrusted or semi-trusted networks  (e.g. internet or GRX). However, it is recognised that virtualised security appliances may be used in the future.  Use of VPNs  Where possible, VPNs should be created between VNFs and both internal and external non-VNF environments, e.g. interconnectivity between P-GW  and Mediation for EDR transfer or HLR/HSS provisioning interfaces with the BSS Provisioning platform.  Dedicated network infrastructure  If a third party XaaS provider is being used then it is recommended that dedicated local ‘leaf’ switching infrastructure supporting only the operator  VNFs is provided to ensure segregation from other tenants.  Additionally, it is also recommended that dedicated spine switches be provided also but this may not always be practical.  Protect all OAM traffic  Link security can be provided through the use of native traffic encryption such as HTTPS, SFTP, SMNP v3 or using TLS or IPsec tunnelling  protocols.  Note: it is recommended this control should be applied in addition to any security protection provided if, for example, OAM traffic is carried over an  IPsec tunnel.  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  114  BP-T22 SDN security  management  The following controls apply if using a message bus technology for communication between SDN elements. However, it is expected this technology  will be widely used in 5G architectures.  • A strong mechanism to authenticate the integrity of messages must be deployed between the ‘publisher’ and ‘producer’ over the message  bus.  No messages should be accepted or processed by the message broker or ‘consumer’ systems from unknown, ‘fake’ or unauthenticated  users.  It is recommended to that communications be secured using TLS (TLS 1.2 and above) security or certificates where supported (e.g.  Kafka),.  • The message bus should be monitored for any unauthenticated messages or ‘fake’ or default usernames and a security alarm raised for  investigation.  • If an SDN is deployed to support the NFVi then it is recommended that security functionality is deployed that identifies potential attacks on  any SDN elements. Any security functionality should provide automated alarms and the ability to change the network or element  configuration to mitigate the attack.  For example:  o DoS attacks on SDN elements (specifically, NEs and SDN Controllers);  o Access control failures or attempts to use functions or services where the user does not have the correct privileges.  • A high availability architecture should be implemented for key SDN components (e.g. SDN Controllers) to ensure operational service is  maintained. The design should include primary and secondary IP links with, where possible, diverse routing to allow for single point of  network failure.  • It is recommended, in order to maintain operational integrity, that any changes to network, service and virtual environments are restricted  to the orchestrator. Therefore, the SDN Controller and the VNFM and VIM should have additional controls applied to them to restrict such  access for normal operation. Restricting the SDN Controller and the VNFM and VIM will prevent the application of rules and changes that  may break policy and rules during deployment of service templates.  • For operational emergencies a high-level administration account should be created. However such an account must not be available to  support engineers or used during normal operations. The credentials should be stored safely and be maintained by operations  management. Ideally, these should be stored in a safe physical location such as a safe with monitored and recorded access.  • The orchestration layer and SDN must be architected so that SDN networks and NFV environments are not operationally dependent on  the orchestration or MANO layer to maintain operating services under circumstances that may render the orchestration platform  unavailable.  [6], [97], [121]  BP-T23 MANO access control  and management  The MANO components should support a high-level of role granularity to ensure appropriate levels of privilege can be assigned to all users to protect  key processes and the integrity of data.  Ideally, all OAM access should be controlled through a centralised single sign-on or PAM solution with all access (success and failure) recorded in  the audit log mechanism. Multi-factor authentication should be used to log into administrator accounts.  All administration and management should only be permitted from known, attested devices and multi-factor authentication should be enforced.  In ETSI GS NFV-SEC 022, ETSI defines an access token mechanism for the authorisation of access for NFV-MANO APIs and the associated  procedure for the verification of the access token. One solution defined to handle these authorisations for API request and notification is the use of  OAuth 2.0 protocol as defined by IETF RFC 6749100. The confidentiality and data integrity of all messages must be ensured, e.g. by using a  transport-layer mechanism, such as TLS (TLS 1.2 and above), on each interface. The authorisation server database used to authenticate the user  [6], [47],  [123], [134],  [135]  100 https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  115  and store associated user credentials, access tokens and refresh tokens must be stored in a tamper resistant location (e.g. HSM). See ETSI GS  NFV-SOL 013 and ETSI GS NFV-SEC 022 for technical details.  BP-T24 VIM connectivity to  virtualisation layer  The connectivity between the VIM and the virtualisation layer should support a secure access protocol (e.g. IPSec, TLS) to protect against the  eavesdropping of password information. It is also recommended that the secure access should support mutual authentication before allowing any  O&M connectivity.  Additionally, it is advised that any vendor defaults (e.g. self-signed certificates) be removed and replaced with operator generated certificates.  Each operator should develop a certificate policy in accordance with their regional and national requirements as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC  005.  [6], [25], [133]  BP-T25 Recovery and  reinstallation  Recovery mechanisms in NFV must ensure the following:  • The NFVI must be restored completely, with all configurations and settings adjusted correctly. This includes controller nodes pointing to  the right set of components, settings reloaded with correct parameters, and full inter-operability restored. Of particular importance is  restoring the interoperation between NFV, SDN, and MANO systems, in an automated way, without the need for human intervention to  reconfigure these systems to become functional again.  • VNFs must be fully restored. This includes reloading virtual machines, containers and network services and setting the last state in place  correctly.  • In the event of a suspected compromised of a hypervisor or CIS, or a VM or container it should be possible to overwrite a hypervisor or  CIS installation or individual VM or container with minimal need for platform re-configuration.  • Any reload mechanism should be securely controlled and managed remotely by the VIM, or locally using secure access through the LMT,  and also include verification of hardware integrity (e.g. boot disc, UEFI).  • When instantiating a new VM or container instance it is recommended that a different guest operating system ‘root’ administration  credentials or security keys (IPSec, TLS) should be used for each instance.  [49], [38],  [122]  BP-T26  Deploying  VMs/containers of  differing trust levels  The VIM should be configured to ensure that VMs or containers of differing trust levels are not deployed on the same physical host or blade and that  VMs or containers requiring a ‘hardware root of trust’ cannot be installed on a physical host or blade that does not fully support trusted boot (e.g.  Intel-TXT) and TPM.  For example, a VNF that requires a ‘trusted computing’ environment to support LI functions should only be installed on a cluster than can support this  level of security.  [6], [25], [123]  BP-T27 NFVO security  management  A mutual authentication mechanism should exist between the NFVO, VIM and EMS platforms to provide a level of trust and to ensure only the  authorised NFVO can make requests to the VIM and EMS platforms and vice versa.  The NFVO should provide internal workflow rules to prevent accidental changes to the NFVi and NFV services that could have an impact on service  delivery.  A mechanism should exist to provide configuration roll-back in the event of any unauthorised or accidental service changes.  The NFVO should create and maintain a comprehensive audit log of all service changes including the identity of the user making each change.  The NFVO should implement robust transaction management for any NFV management for supporting NFVi changes to ensure that the opportunity  for configuration integrity errors across the orchestration controlled elements and service inventory is eliminated.  Best practice for provisioning platform controls for configuration roll-back and failure alarming must be implemented.  [6], [38],  [122], [123]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  116  BP-T28 Trusted time source  The VNFs should synchronise with trusted time servers such as a GPS or an atomic clock. In 5G networks, high precision time synchronisation  within microseconds will be required. 5G will not only provide personal mobile service, but also massive machine type communications (MTC) and  services where latency and reliability are critical. These critical services require trusted and protected time sources.  ETSI GR NFV-SEC 016 (Draft specification - work in progress) is a study on how the location of sensitive VNFs (e.g. LI functions, VNFs handling  data with restrictions on the location where data protection is handled and network security functions) can be attested. The study considers using  trusted locstamp and timestamp information derived from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), such as Galileo. The study also considers  other binding solutions for physical location. The report outlines several solutions for timestamp-time synchronisation and distribution (e.g. White  Rabbit Network, IEEE® 1588-2019, based on trusted GNSS/ LEOs), for timestamp datacentre time protocol (DTP) and for locstamp (e.g. based on  binding a trusted hardware‘s ID with the location of a vertical hierarchy, indoor positioning such as RFID tagging and trusted GNSS positioning).  [47], [136]  BP-T29 Secure 3rd party  hosting environments  Third party hosting environments that support VNFs should meet 3GPP virtualisation security requirements to enable operators to meet legal or  regulatory requirements.  The system should be able to monitor the attestation of third party hosting environments.  [47]  BP-T30 Redundancy and  backup  Recovery  The system should be deployed in such a way as to provide isolation and redundancy to increase the resiliency and defence against a single point of  failure. MANO functions should include internal health checks to detect potential intrusion and take protective action.  There are a variety of ways operators should consider redundancy. Below are three ways the operator should be thinking about redundancy when it  comes to its recovery plan.  • Network redundancy: network redundancy is the process of adding additional instances of network devices and lines of communication to  help ensure network availability and decrease the risk of failure along the critical data path. Having redundancy by providing additional  pathways through your network via redundant routers or switches would ensure minimal downtime and complete continuity of NFV  services.  • Power redundancy: backup power supply (a generator, for instance) that specifically keeps critical NFV hardware running in colocation  facilities.  • Geographic redundancy: geographic redundancy is important for how sensitive data is backed up. Having a redundant backup in an  entirely different location will allow quicker recovery with little downtime.  • The recovery plan should already identify a fail-over location for the NFV system in the event that the current location is inoperable.  Backup  Backups is the process of creating and storing copies of NFV data to protect against data loss. A backup involves duplicating important data like VNF  code and data, configurations, cryptographic materials, network configurations, audit logs or anything that the NFV system needs to stay operational.  Regardless of the backup solution chosen, offsite backups are a must across all industries. Operators are required to store backups in a secure  location, preferably an off-site facility, such as an alternate or backup site.  Having both backups and redundancy contributes to the NFV system running smoothly. Backups make sure that if something is lost, corrupted or  stolen then a copy of the sensitive NFV data is available. Redundancy makes sure that if something fails, the NFV system is able to work regardless  of the problem.  [47]  BP-T31 Specific container  security controls  Appropriate restrictions on container placement and on the use of container caching should include:  • user handling containers relative to network management containers within a VNF;  • separation of containers belonging to different NFs on different physical servers;  [47]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  117  • special handling of containers implementing interfaces between different trust domains (intra-VNF and inter-VNF).  The virtualisation layer must provide capabilities to limit the impact on co-hosted containers caused by a rogue container escaping its isolation. One  of the commonly practiced security controls is to enforce strict resource limits on container usage, which helps in preventing resource starvation due  to an attack by a rogue container.  The virtualisation layer must enforce the principle of ‘least privilege’ which ensures that no containers run with a privilege higher than what is actually  required.  The VNF images shall not be packaged with embedded secrets such as passwords or credentials, or any other critical configuration data.  NIST SP 800-190101 and ANSSI102, Container security103, Redhat104 and others provide detailed best practices for the security of containers.  BP-T32 OSS/BSS protection  The contrasting attributes of the legacy and virtualised infrastructures should be considered from an overall management perspective. This will be  particularly important during the migration phase while both types of infrastructure are running in parallel. The OSS/BSS would, therefore, need to be  adapted for near-real time operation and be able to support a hybrid network across SDN/NFV and non-SDN, non-NFV domains.  OSS systems should be consistent with the ETSI NFV architectural framework [7] and support the Os-Ma interface between the traditional OSS/BSS  and the NFV management and orchestration (MANO) framework. OSS/BSS systems should delegate fine-grained management of the NFV  Infrastructure and the specific VNFs to the VIM and the VNFM, which in turn are orchestrated by the NFV orchestrator (NFVO). Thus, the OSS/BSS  will be responsible for the high level configuration of the infrastructure and network functions, but the NFV MANO framework will manage the  dynamic aspects of infrastructure and services105.  The integration with the SDN controller and applications will follow a similar approach. The OSS will manage the configuration of the SDN data  plane, configure and set policies for the SDN controller and control SLAs for SDN applications, but the dynamic control of the SDN forwarding plane  will be managed by the SDN controller and the SDN control to data-path interface (CDPI)106 107.  Operators moving to deploy virtualised network architectures based on SDN and NFV are likely to evolve the OSS/BSS systems in stages. Existing  operators have a significant installed base and it is unrealistic to replace all existing infrastructure. The new capability will be deployed first where it  brings the most value or where the legacy network requires upgrades anyway108.  [99], [100],  [101]  BP-T33 LI capabilities  General recommendations involve:  • Dialogue between governments and 5G stakeholders to define clear, modular and transparent LI;  • Efficient LI implementation through regulatory consistency, adoption of existing international technical standards (e.g. 3GPP, ETSI), and  centralised, multi-country LI solutions;  • LI law and regulation that is clear, transparent and judiciously implemented.  The following provides a brief checklist of security measures that 5G stakeholders should consider.  • Passwords and authentication: LI operations should be managed by the principle of least privilege (POLP), which limits each user to the  minimum access privileges needed to perform his or her job. Access controls for the users should use two-factor authentication.  • Encryption: all LI data should be transmitted, both within the network and on the external delivery interface, with strong encryption.  [102], [103],  [127]  101 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf  102 https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/recommandations-de-securite-relatives-au-deploiement-de-conteneurs-docker/  103 https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1665891/Assets/Container%20Security%20by%20Liz%20Rice%20-%20OReilly%20Apr%202020.pdf  104 https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/cl-container-security-openshift-cloud-devops-tech-detail-f7530kc-201705-en.pdf  105 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  106 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  107 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  108 https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/guide/recommandations-de-securite-relatives-au-deploiement-de-conteneurs-docker/ https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1665891/Assets/Container%20Security%20by%20Liz%20Rice%20-%20OReilly%20Apr%202020.pdf https://www.redhat.com/cms/managed-files/cl-container-security-openshift-cloud-devops-tech-detail-f7530kc-201705-en.pdf https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf https://opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sb-OSS-BSS.pdf  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  118  • Host hardening: the LI solution device(s) should be equipped with a robust host intrusion detection system to guard against unauthorised  users.  • Network hardening: the network should contain properly-configured firewalls and use routing methods to keep the LI functionality and data  segregated from all other network activity.  • Network monitoring: a network monitoring system, including a network intrusion prevention system and a network intrusion detection  system, enables you to see which users enter and exit the network and when. The system also monitors uptime and downtime on different  devices and provides visibility into broadband utilisation and link status.  • Dedicated solution: the LI solution should be dedicated to LI purposes only. Trying to leverage the LI device for commercial uses such as  traffic monitoring may expose the equipment to unauthorised use or operational risks.  • Potential breach reporting: any compromise or potential compromise of an LI must be reported to law enforcement.  • Testing: once the LI solution is installed, it must be tested. The communication features to be tested will vary depending on the type of  network (e.g. broadband, wireless, VoIP) and the communication features offered on the given network.  • Periodic testing: communication networks evolve over time. A network change may disable or impair the workings of the LI solution. For  this reason the network operator should schedule periodic testing of the solution.  • Software maintenance: like most forms of software, an LI solution requires maintenance. Any LI licensing agreement should arrange for  patches, updates and upgrades as needed. Specifically, all security patches and updates for all LI platforms must be installed and kept  current.  • Penetration testing: in a penetration test, an external entity searches for cyber vulnerabilities in the LI solution and tries to ‘hack’ into it.  • Security policy: the LI security policy should be included in the operator’s written network security policy, which should implement industry  standards such as ISO 27001, NIST SP 800 series, etc.  BP-T34 User plane security  Additional security controls are needed on the user plane as follows:  • to protect NFV components from attacks sourced from the public internet and cloud;  • to protect the network from attacks sourced from internally attached NFV components;  • to protect the NFVI from attacks sourced from internally attached components and the internet.  Inline detection and mitigation functions in the network can be used at the internet edge to prevent volumetric DDoS attacks from the internet,  including TCP SYN floods, UDP floods, and DNS floods, which can attack the availability of the network or service.  Threat detection or prevention and response using IDS/IPS should also be used to effectively defend against or prevent malware and ransomware  infections on NFVI and network functions.  [113]  BP-T35 MEC security  To address the issue of inadequate isolation, MEC can include network segmentation, resource separation, data segregation, software and network  attestation, etc.  The hardening of MEC needs to ensure that all the default configurations (including OS software, firmware, and applications) are appropriately set  and, further, that these settings can be verified against a reference. Countermeasures such as the filtering of packets heading for the target site  under attack, restriction of the communication port used for DoS/DDoS attacks, and the reduction or suspension of the operations of target  telecommunications facilities need to be considered.  A regular security testing programme or certification of MEC components is required as part of a secure value chain.  Control measures to ensure the security of physically isolated areas of MEC components include earthquake-proofing, automatic fire control  equipment, monitoring by a remote office to detect facility failures, physically secure perimeters, supporting automatic alert function, etc. The physical  [126]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  119  security may not be fully guaranteed in a MEC environment and critical MEC components (e.g. security end points and crypto functions) need to be  implemented in HMEEs (hardware mediated execution environments) e.g. Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone.  SBI (service-based interface) of MEC components should provide adequate protection for access and data in transit. The confidentiality and data  integrity of all messages should be ensured by using TLS on each interface. Appropriate security controls are required for protecting sensitive data  during storage, processing and transfer by MEC applications. The MEC platform should authenticate all MEC application instances and only provide  them with the information for which the application is authorised. OAuth 2.0 based on X.509 client certificates are used for authorisation of access to  RESTful MEC service APIs as defined by ETSI ISG MEC. In the case of service-producing applications defined by third parties, other mechanisms  such as standalone use of JWT (JSON web token) can be used to secure related APIs.  In addition, since MEC is based on virtualised infrastructure, it needs to include real-time security management based on NFV specifications (see  ETSI GS NFV-SEC 013 [38]). Especially when deploying MEC in NFV environments, MEC should be considered as part of a whole system real-time  security monitoring and management strategy. Appropriate mechanisms for the collection and processing of security events should be in place,  where the log functions should upload log files securely to a central location or to an external system. Secure transport protocols should be used.  Access to the security event log should be controlled to allow only privileged users to have access to the log files. Critical event logs must be  enhanced with mechanisms to enable independent third parties to audit them, preserving their arrow of time and their links to the identities of the  elements involved. As part of regulatory issues, the European regulation (NIS-Directive) expects isolation of physical and logical components of  critical services from services with low criticality. The MEC system needs to support regulatory requirements for lawful interception and retained data  based on ETSI and 3GPP standards (e.g. in ETSI TS 101 331109, ETSI TS 102 656110 and 3GPP TS 33.126111).  BP-P1 Zero trust  Treat 5G infrastructure as an untrusted environment and explicitly authenticate and authorise interactions between all assets in all areas - both inside  and outside the network - prior to allowing access. Secure and limit interactions to the minimum necessary, and continuously monitor asset security  posture, adjusting access rights accordingly.  Zero trust represents an overarching access security model that deliberately avoids assuming implicit trust between elements in a network. This is  particularly important in 5G as various external stakeholders may need to access infrastructure components or services for management,  maintenance or monitoring purposes. For example, enterprise users may need to select access to 5G slice management services. Third party  vendors may need access to select components for configuration or troubleshooting. Properly implemented, zero trust can provide appropriate  stakeholder access while securing 5G services against misuse.  Strong digital identities with digital signing from a certificate authority (CA) establishes a root of trust for VNFs while mutual authentication using  transport layer security (TLS) or datagram TLS (DTLS) with public-key infrastructure and X.509 (PKIX) and strong cipher suites ensures trust  between network functions, between the network and NFV, and between application clients and server. (D)TLS with X.509 digital certificates provide  automation and security to ensure that only trusted devices are permitted access to a trusted network and application. 5G also provides strong  mutual authentication using 5G-AKA, EAP-AKA and EAP-TLS.  A zero trust architecture includes automated security configuration for control policies over user access with visibility, monitoring and logging for  alerting and auditing. Multifactor authentication (MFA), an important component of zero trust, should be used to ensure secure human access to  management interfaces and applications in the 5G NFV. NFV components should be assumed to be untrusted and be able to establish trust through  the process of certificate based mutual authentication.  Any of the NFV entities or components should have a certificate and an associated and protected private key to execute cryptographic security  functions with other terminating entities as described in ETSI GR NFV-SEC.  [61], [27],  [113], [131],  [133]  BP-P2  Security assessment  of new or changes to  existing VNF service  templates  New or modified VNF service templates should be validated through proper risk assessment by a security professional. This process ensures that  the template complies with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. It also ensures that the template adheres to specific security policies on  interface security, security affinity/anti-affinity rules, NFV network zoning and application security.  [6], [47], [25],  [123]  109 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101300_101399/101331/01.07.01_60/ts_101331v010701p.pdf  110 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/102656/01.03.01_60/ts_102656v010301p.pdf  111 https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3181  https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/101300_101399/101331/01.07.01_60/ts_101331v010701p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102600_102699/102656/01.03.01_60/ts_102656v010301p.pdf https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3181  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  120  BP-P3 Vulnerability handling  & patch management  NFV/MANO software components will need to be monitored for vulnerabilities and patched as quickly as possible to address evolving risks and  ensure security and functionality. According to the report of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, patch development and distribution—the process  whereby a software developer creates a fix for a vulnerability and distributes it to users—is key to eliminating the risk that a given vulnerability can  pose. The report recommends, among other things, that developers and manufacturers of software and hardware components establish a publicly  accessible process for reporting vulnerabilities, retain records documenting when a vulnerability was made known or discovered by the company,  and maintain a vulnerability disclosure and patching policy for their products. In addition, the report recommends that the US government study the  potential effectiveness of directing NIST to develop guidance or expectations about how quickly patches should be implemented once released.  [60], [25],  [123]  BP-P4 Security testing  assurance  Regular penetration and vulnerability testing should be performed across the NFVI and MANO production environment to identify any known  vulnerabilities or compromise of the network zoning rules.  It is recommended that testing should be carried out if new infrastructure or IP based interconnect elements have been deployed or as a minimum on  an annual basis.  Security assurance testing of a VNF needs to be performed using a standardised NFVI environment used to test all VNFs. When testing the security  assurance of a VNF, the scope of testing should be clarified, including defining the pre-conditions of the virtualised test environment or platform and  defining assumptions made in the process. Where possible, recreate these assumptions in the product deployment, e.g. close ports which do not  need to be open.  Both positive and common vulnerability testing (e.g. negative testing) should be carried out against VNFs and the underlying virtualisation and  hardware layers. This is required to mitigate the increased attack surface which was partly addressed by physical security assurance protections in  physical networks.  VNFs should be checked regularly to see if they are using out-of-date or insecure versions of a library and these libraries should be updated if and  when possible. This is required to mitigate the increased attack surface which was partly addressed by physical security assurance protections in  physical networks.  It is recommended to use certified components (e.g. hypervisors, OSs, TEE, TPM, etc.) according to a recognised scheme such as Common Criteria.  Potential solutions to the above requirements include, among others, the NESAS 3GPP(SCAS)/GSMA and ENISA EU certifications schemes  (Currently, three cybersecurity certification schemes are under development by ENISA. One scheme, covering ICT products and called EUCC, is  almost ready. It is based on an existing international scheme called Common Criteria. There is a second scheme covering cloud services (this is the  EUCS scheme) and a third one on 5G networks (EU5G)).  [6], [47], [25],  [139]  BP-P5 Incident management  Implement defensive security controls and continuous monitoring backed by machine learning capabilities and establish incident response  operations to detect and mitigate threats. Key capabilities include the following.  - Vulnerability management: adopt internationally-accepted standards and best practices on the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities and  handling to effectively identify, mitigate, and remediate security vulnerabilities (e.g. software patching) in a timely manner.  - Denial-of-service defence systems: monitor network traffic to detect and mitigate network flooding attacks.  - Intrusion detection and prevention systems: monitor network traffic to detect and mitigate unauthorised access or attempts to exploit system  vulnerabilities.  - Malicious traffic filtering systems: monitor network traffic to block malicious or unwanted traffic such as spam or attempts to interact with  malicious domains and websites.  - Anti-malware systems: monitor network traffic and endpoint and server devices to detect and block malware files or malware execution.  - Security operations centre: establish a centralised security monitoring, incident response, and threat intelligence organisation responsible for  rapidly detecting and mitigating security breaches. Adopt integrated cybersecurity capabilities and automation tools that simplify and streamline  security operations.  [27]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  121  BP-P6 Secure update  management  The process must consider the ability to update the cryptographic algorithms and to adapt to upcoming 5G security challenges.  Updates must be applied in a timely manner to protect against hardware or software bugs and security flaws, including those which are newly found.  [50], [47]  BP-P7 Restrictions on  installing applications  It should not be possible to install a VNF application into the operational NFV environment without validation and approval by the operator.  Note: this can be a manual control process but it is expected that additional technical security controls will be adopted that allow only signed code to  be installed in the NFV infrastructure.  [1], [50], [6],  [47], [25]  BP-P8 Defence-in-depth  Operators need to use all the layers of security (defence-in-depth) to protect the NFV platforms including firewalls, access control lists, IP tables, rate  limiting, closing all unnecessary ports, disabling all unnecessary services (for example, TLS and remote access service may not be needed all the  time, so therefore it would be a good idea to enable these services only when needed), using strong confidential integrity algorithms, and so forth.  [50], [61]  BP-P9 Strong password  policy  A strong complex password should be configured for each hypervisor or CIS ‘root’ account and secured in a safe location with physical and  procedural controls on its access and use. It is recommended that the ‘root’ account is only used in exceptional operational circumstances by the  hypervisor or CIS administrator and that separate user accounts are configured with less privilege for day-to-day operational management.  Note: in the virtual environment hypervisor or CIS ‘root’ password has a greater significance as it controls multiple VMs or containers and provides  access to security sensitive information.  [50], [6], [123]  BP-P10 Secure supply chain  Trustworthy equipment (all supply chain), resilient system and verification must all be based on standards. Devising the required standards must be  a collaborative effort between private (industry, SME, and research) and public (policy makers, regulators) parties, as no single vendor, operator or  government can do it alone.  Operators should implement effective supply-chain and procurement controls to ensure the services they operate and provide comply with legal  requirements and manage supply-chain threats. Processes should be in place to identify, prioritise and assess suppliers and partners of critical  systems, components and services using a supply chain risk assessment process.  Zero trust principles should be implemented to identify supply chain weaknesses across product creation, manufacturing, testing, and delivery — without the need for disruptions that ultimately can halt operations.  Cybersecurity audits and certifications should be conducted by an independent and accredited body against a defined set of criteria, standards, and  the issuing of a certificate indicating conformance. Globally, there are two international arrangements relevant to assuring 5G product security. The  Network Equipment Security Assurance Scheme (NESAS), developed jointly by GSMA and 3GPP, covers security assessments of 5G vendor  development and product lifecycle processes and security evaluations of network products. Secondly, 5G products can also be certified under the  Common Criteria scheme.  Through collaboration, a shared responsibility model, zero trust principles, and security assurance, supply chains will strengthen as security  improves.  [60], [138],  [139]  BP-P11  Resources inventory  management system  and database  Hardware inventory  It is expected a hardware (blade) for hypervisor or CIS and bare metal installation for inventory shall exist to support operational management.  However, in addition, to providing the ability to complete security investigations and meet possible local regulatory or legal requirements, it is  recommended that the inventory stores:  1. the location of each blade server (e.g. country, datacentre, rack, shelf);  2. mapping VNF to hypervisor or CIS and blade server showing the current and historic records;  3. information as to whether any native installations are sharing the same blade server chassis, associated resources and network infrastructure.  Software inventory  [6], [123]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  122  A mechanism should exist to identify all VNFCs running in each VM or container within each hypervisor or CIS. It should also be possible to identify  which hardware, datacentre, location and country is being used and the assigned IP addresses and types of communication flows, routing tables and  effective security policies and filtering rules are in place. In addition, automatic validation should be completed against the VIM and EMS platforms to  ensure only authorised VNFC applications are running and installed.  Open source inventory  Organisations must set up accurate inventories of open-source software dependencies used by their various applications, or a process to receive  and manage notifications concerning discovered vulnerabilities or available patches from the community supporting the open-source.  Data integrity should be maintained between the NFVi and SDN controller layers and the resource inventory through a robust mechanism  implemented during deployment.  Such mechanism must have the capability to check the SDN and NFV configuration against the one stored on the resource inventory. It must also  have the capability to validate the security policies to ensure they are still being applied correctly, e.g. verifying firewall rules on the orchestration  interface or check location of any VNF.  A detection or audit mechanism must be implemented to identify where a workflow has been initiated requesting changes to the NFV or SDN  environment but where no acknowledgement has been received on its success or failure. Upon detection of such changes an alarm must be raised  so the operational team can investigate the incident.  BP-P12 Apply hardening  policies  For instance, the hypervisor or CIS should be hardened to allow only the minimum services and processes necessary to operate VMs or containers,  and all other services should be removed by default. As a minimum, the following configuration changes must be made among others:  • remove all unused features;  • when a VM or container is deleted the virtual disk should be zeroed to prevent an attacker reconstructing the contents of the VM or  container disk;  • disable the ability to connect external devices to VMs or containers (e.g. CD, serial and parallel ports);  • make sure a VM does not have the ability to run with the full OS privilege level and can only operate at guest level; this can be controlled  using Intel VT-x and AMD-V extensions;  • make sure each VM or container has a predefined set of restricted resources to ensure one VM or container cannot impact the resources  and performance of another in the same hypervisor or CIS;  • disable the ability of a VM to initiate ‘disk shrinking’;  • enable persistent disk mode;  • restrict the visibility of one VM or container to detect another VM or container existing on the same host;  • use zoning and LUN masking to segregate SAN activity with each VM having unique authentication credentials;  • remove direct access to the O&M functionality of the hypervisor or CIS for management only through a secure connection from the VIM;  however, this may not always be operationally feasible, so the hypervisor or CIS installation should limit access to the hypervisor or CIS  ‘root’ operating system to either:  o a dedicated O&M interface supporting a secure protocol (e.g. TLS) with only an IP address,  o ACL restriction on which domain can connect successfully;  • only allow ‘root’ access from the local terminal (LMP);  • where a hardware manufacturer provided monitoring tools that are implemented on the hypervisor or CIS or they utilise embedded  support for industry standard protocols such as Common Information Model (CIM), these functions must be installed and operated on the  hypervisor or CIS with limited privileges.  [37], [79],  [81], [82],  [125]  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  123  BP-P13 Multi-vendor  segregation and trust  Segregation  Multi-vendor segregation is necessary to ensure each vendor can only manage or impact the resources related to their own VM or container across  the NFVI architecture.  Ideally, different vendors should not share the same VM or container.  Note: this can be achieved by following VMware guidelines112 for implementing secure multi-tenancy.  Trust  Select VNF vendors that make their vulnerabilities public so their customers can take appropriate actions and mitigations as quickly as possible.  There is no security in obscurity.  [124]  BP-P14 Security by design  The security-by-design concept should be used to address the protection of NFV resources and components at design time through the integration of  security mechanisms. This should concern the hardware layer, the virtualisation layer, MANO and VNFs.  Use secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) principles to avoid vulnerabilities and thus contribute to developing NFV software applications  and services in a secure manner.  Promote the use of DevSecOps113 methodology. The DevSecOps process aims at merging the security discipline within DevOps, thus considering  security in every stage of the development process. By having security and development teams working together early in the development lifecycle,  security naturally finds itself in the product by design.  [49], [88]  BP-P15 Lifecycle  management  Secure software development principles for VNFs incorporate the following industry best practices:  • validating the removal of unused software modules and execution paths;  • validating the disabling of unused protocols and the closure of unused ports;Run VM or container image and software package scanning  to find known vulnerabilities and fix them before release;  • using container-specific host OSs to reduce risk by limiting the attack surface, as recommended in ENISA 5G threat landscape114, the  ENISA security aspects of virtualisation115, NIST SP 800-190116, NIST guidance117, and others;  • enforcing Centre for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks118 for K8S, docker, and Linux to establish a hardened baseline;  • ensuring that the software supplier practices proper due diligence when using commercial third-party and open-source software in their  projects119;  • validating application performance on the hardened infrastructure.  [6], [113]  BP-P16  Software bill of  materials (SBOM)  A SBOM is a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of various open source and commercial software components,  libraries and modules used in building software. Complex systems such as the 5G NFV might include hundreds or even thousands of software  components that software development and cybersecurity teams must track through all stages of the lifecycle.

The minimum elements an SBOM NTIA describes are organised into these three categories:  • data fields,  • automation support,  • practices and processes.  BP-O1  Secure physical  environment and  geographical location  A datacentre site supporting NFVi and MANO elements should be operated and controlled by the operator and, ideally, not be outsourced using a  third party IaaS supplier.  While not recommended, if the operator chooses to use a third party operated datacentre then additional security controls are necessary to ensure  the third party complies with the operator’s physical and outsourcing security controls.  The geographical location of any hardware supporting the NFV must comply with each operators local regulatory and legal requirements for  operating a telecoms network or handling sensitive data for customers or LI.  Anti-affinity rules should be applied to protect against possible infringement.  Privacy sensitive information of a VNF must be protected from being leaked out of its legal jurisdiction.  The system should manage the physical location of the VNFs and sub-components and SDN routing to provide attestation that the VNFCs provide a  commensurate level of security to match the requirements of the service or to meet legal or regulatory requirements.  [6], [47], [25],  [123]  BP-O2 Training and  awareness  Information sharing between different 5G actors: all 5G stakeholders, including operators, suppliers, etc. should work together to enhance the  security of 5G.  5G stakeholders should participate in international security events and working groups formed to enable discussion, cooperation and intelligence  sharing to improve security awareness.  Adopt a comprehensive approach to security training and awareness among the employees, including employees on all levels. Security training  should cover 5G relevant threats and be tailored to the employees' roles and responsibilities.  Ensure that security trainings are continuous, regular and frequently updated. Training programmes should be updated after new important threats  are disclosed and should be adjusted according to the lessons learned from ongoing incident handling and recovery activities.  [107]  BP-O3 Trust model  Foster security-related information sharing between different 5G stakeholders while protecting intellectual property. Suppliers and service providers  should provide evidence about the implementation of their cybersecurity management system to operators. For transparency purposes, OEMs  should consider providing similar evidence to their suppliers and service providers as well.  Define the relevant cybersecurity aspects of the partnerships along the supply chain and develop security requirements and procurement guidelines  between 5G stakeholders. To prevent security risks and threats that may stem from outsourced services or components or systems provided by third  party suppliers, operators should define procurement guidelines as well as security requirements to be applied to the suppliers to their third parties. A  security SLA may also be established between the operator and its supplier to define the security level that the supplier should meet.  [108]  BP-O4 SLAs establishment  SLAs between 5G stakeholders should consider the security aspects to identify mitigation strategies and how to implement actions in response to  those responsible for the security assessment of the 5G NFV.  The SLAs for security management and maintenance can include plans to mitigate known threats and respond to future threats.  Addressing security in the SLA promotes transparency, facilitates communication between the stakeholders involved, including their internal entities  (e.g. teams for security management and monitoring) and establishes consensus practices to solidify the overall 5G system security.

H.1 OSM  Open-Source MANO (OSM) is an ETSI-hosted open-source community delivering a production- quality MANO stack for NFV, capable of consuming openly published information models,  available to everyone, suitable for all VNFs, operationally significant and VIM-independent.  OSM is aligned to NFV ISG information models while providing first-hand feedback based on its  implementation experience120 121.  OSM Release EIGHT brings several improvements over previous releases. It allows the  flexibility of cloud-native applications to be combined within the same network service with the  predictability of traditional virtual and physical network functions (VNFs and PNFs) and all the  required advanced networking required to build complex E2E telecom services. OSM Release  EIGHT is at the forefront of Edge and 5G operations technology, deploying and operating  containerised network functions on Kubernetes with a complete lifecycle management, and  automated integration.  In addition, OSM extends the SDN framework to support the next generation of SDN solutions  providing higher level primitives and increasing the number of available options for supporting  I/O-intensive applications. Furthermore, the plugin models for intra- and inter-datacentre SDN  have been consolidated, and the management, addition and maintenance of SDN plugins  significantly simplified.  OSM Release EIGHT also brings major enhancements designed to improve the overall user  experience and interoperability choices. This includes an improved workflow for VNF  configuration which allows much faster and complex operations, and the support of additional  types of infrastructures, such as Azure and VMware's vCD 10, complementing the previously  available choices (OpenStack-based VIMs, VMware VIO, VMware vCD, AWS, Fog05 and  OpenVIM). It improves the orchestration of diverse virtualisation environments, including PNFs,  a number of different VIMs for VNFs, and Kubernetes for Cloud native NFs.  H.2 ONAP  Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) is an open-source project hosted by the Linux  Foundation122, officially launched in 2017, enabling telco networks to become increasingly more  autonomous. ONAP is capable of providing a real-time, policy-driven service orchestration and  automation, enabling telco operators and application developers to instantiate and configure  network functions. ONAP, through different releases, supports features such as a) multi-site and  multi-vendor automation capabilities, b) service and resources deployment, thus providing c)  cloud network elements and services instantiation in a dynamic, real-time and closed-loop  manner for several major telco activities, (e.g. design, deployment and operation of services at  design-time and run-time.  120 https://osm.etsi.org/docs/user-guide/02-osm-architecture-and-functions.html  121 https://www.etsi.org/technologies/open-source-mano  122 Open Network Automation Platform, https://docs.onap.org/en/elalto/index.html#  https://osm.etsi.org/docs/user-guide/02-osm-architecture-and-functions.html https://www.etsi.org/technologies/open-source-mano https://docs.onap.org/en/elalto/index.html  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  153  Various edge cloud architectures have already emerged from different communities and  potentially can be plugged into the ONAP architecture for service orchestration. The ONAP  community analyses the orchestration requirements of services over various edge clouds and  how these requirements impact ONAP components in terms of data collection, processing,  policy management, resource management, control loop models and security, as well as  application and network function deployment and control. We invite the reader to read more  detail in this link123.  H.3 OPNFV  It was launched by the Linux Foundation in September 2014 [67]. OPNFV focuses on NFVI and  includes an SDN controller and switch. OPNFV is a platform for implementing NFV and can  provide feedback on the necessary information to the ONAP platform. The four goals of OPNFV  are as follows:  • after testing, to use continuous integration or continuous delivery (CI/CD) to develop an  open-source platform that can build NFV system functions;  • to invite operators of telecommunication services to join the programme and verify that  OPNFV meets user expectations;  • to join other open-source projects that will use OPNFV to ensure consistency,  performance and interoperability.  • To build an ecosystem of NFV solutions based on open source.  H.4 SONATA  The SONATA project124 is a component of an EU-funded project, Horizon 2020, and part of the  5G-PPP initiative. The SONATA [65] service platform is implemented as a modular  microservice, which is very flexible and helps the operator to modify a customised function.  Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) are emerging as  major transformational technologies towards ‘software networks’, a new paradigm that is  furthering the evolution of the telecom sector with new network capabilities and business  opportunities. SONATA addresses the significant challenges associated with both the  development and deployment of the complex services envisioned for 5G networks and  empowered by these technologies. Core objectives include:  • reduced time-to-market of networked services: SONATA streamlines development with  abstract programming models, SDK and a DevOps model that integrates operators,  manufacturers and third-party developers;  • optimised resources and reduced costs of service deployment and operation: SONATA  orchestrates complex services for connectivity, computing and storage resources, and  automatically re-configures running services.  • accelerated industry adoption of software networks: SONATA supports the full service  lifecycle, i.e. development, testing, orchestration, deployment, management and  operations, and will define a roadmap for the uptake of results towards stakeholders'  larger transition to SDN/NFV.  H.5 OPENSTACK TACKER  OpenStack Tacker125 is under the big tent of OpenStack projects and aims at building an open  orchestrator with a general purpose VNF Manager to deploy and operate virtual network  functions on an NFV platform. It is based on the ETSI MANO architectural framework and  provides a full functional stack to orchestrate VNFs end-to-end. Today, Tacker offers features  like a VNF catalogue, a basic VNF lifecycle management, VNF configuration management  123 https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Edge+Automation+through+ONAP+Arch.+Task+Force+-  +Distributed+Management+%28ONAP+etc.%29+components  124 http://sonatanfv.org/content/objectives  125 OpenStack Tacker,” https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Tacker  http://sonatanfv.org/content/objectives https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Tacker  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  154  framework, and a VNF health monitoring framework. The VNF catalogue makes use of the  topology and orchestration specification for cloud applications (TOSCA) language for the  definition of VNF meta-data and OpenStack Glance to store and manage the VNF images.  Tacker VNF lifecycle management takes care of the instantiation and termination of virtual  machines, self-healing and auto-scaling, and VNF image updates. It also takes care of  interfaces to vendor specific element management systems. Like the VNF catalogue, the basic  VNF lifecycle management relies on existing OpenStack services and uses OpenStack Heat to  start and stop virtual machines that contain the VNF. Thus, the TOSCA templates are  automatically translated to OpenStack Heat templates.  H.6 OPENBATON  OpenBaton126 is an open source project by Fraunhofer FOKUS that enables implementation of  the ETSI management and orchestration specification. Its main components are a network  function virtualisation orchestrator, a generic virtual network function manager that manages  VNF lifecycles based on the VNF description, and an SDK comprising a set of libraries that  could be used for building a specific VNF Manager.  The NFV orchestrator, which is the main component of OpenBaton, is written in Java using the  spring.io framework. To interconnect the NFV orchestrator to different VNF managers,  OpenBaton relies on the Java messaging system. The NFV orchestrator is currently using  OpenStack as an integrated virtual infrastructure manager, supporting dynamic registration of  NFV points of presence and deploys in parallel multiple slices consisting of one or multiple  VNFs. Through this functionality the orchestrator provides a multi-tenant environment distributed  on top of multiple cloud instances.  H.7 KUBERNETES  Over the last few years Kubernetes127 (noted as K8s) has become a de facto standard for  container orchestration. As container transformation unfolds in the telecom industry, VM based  VNFs give way to cloud native NFs.  Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling,  and management. In the parlance of ETSI’s NFV architecture, it performs the role of the  container infrastructure service management (CISM) function (which performs equivalent  ‘virtualised resource management’ as VIMs do but for the container deployment case as  described in ETSI GR NFV-IFA 029 and ETSI GS NFV-IFA 040).  ETSI GS NFV-SOL 018128 (Draft specification - work in progress) provides a mapping of the  NFV object model for OS container management and orchestration to managed objects of  Kubernetes® and HelmTM as specified by the CNCF® along with a specification of a mapping  between a common set of input parameters (e.g. derived from VNFD/NSD and/or NFV-MANO  RESTful APIs) and output parameters associated with the management and orchestration of the  managed objects.  It profiles the reference Kubernetes® API as an NFV protocol and data model solution for OS  container management and orchestration. It profiles the reference HelmTM documentation as an  NFV protocol and data model solution for the management of OS container workloads based on  an MCIOP (managed container infrastructure object package). It profiles the reference OCITM  Distribution Specification API (which is based on the DockerTM registry API) as an NFV protocol  126 “OpenBaton” https://openbaton.github.io/  127 https://kubernetes.io  128  https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDis play=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUD E_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STA TUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCI ES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProj ectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY  https://openbaton.github.io/ https://kubernetes.io/ https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/WorkProgram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=62022&curItemNr=77&totalNrItems=80&optDisplay=100000&titleType=all&qSORT=HIGHVERSION&qETSI_ALL=&SearchPage=TRUE&qTB_ID=789%3BNFV&qINCLUDE_SUB_TB=True&qINCLUDE_MOVED_ON=&qSTART_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=0%3BM40&qEND_CURRENT_STATUS_CODE=9+AB%3BN24&qSTOP_FLG=N&qKEYWORD_BOOLEAN=OR&qCLUSTER_BOOLEAN=OR&qFREQUENCIES_BOOLEAN=OR&qSTOPPING_OUTDATED=&butExpertSearch=Search&includeNonActiveTB=FALSE&includeSubProjectCode=FALSE&qREPORT_TYPE=SUMMARY  NFV SECURITY IN 5G  February 2022  155  and data model solution for OS container image management.

Both have the objectives of increasing interoperability, reducing costs and facilitating the establishment of a healthy business ecosystem. The  difference has to do with the method to achieve those goals.  Historically, standards have been developed using consensus-based collaboration in a process that required written documentation of the specific standard  (for example, a specification, protocol, an application protocol interface (API)). This is no different than open-source projects, with the exception that for open  source, contributions are in the form of running code.  Usually, the collaboration process in standards is a very transparent one based on less transparent or even proprietary implementations. Open-source  projects can bring implementation transparency during the harmonisation or standardisation process, as well as after the finalisation of a standard as a way  to establish implementations as reference.  Therefore, open-source projects should be considered complementary to the development of standards, as a way to accelerate and improve the process of  creating interoperable solutions. Figure 21 shows where standards and open-source initiatives work together to benefit vendors, service providers and end  users. Combined with automation tools, continuous testing and integration, as well as broad adoption of DevOps within large organisations, this combination  can be a powerful catalyst for innovation and rapid development130.

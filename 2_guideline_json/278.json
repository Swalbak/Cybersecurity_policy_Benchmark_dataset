CONCLUSIONS 25  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In the EU, telecom operators notify significant security incidents to their national authorities. At  the start of every calendar year, the national authorities send a summary of these reports to  ENISA. This report, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2020, provides anonymised  and aggregated information about major telecom security incidents in 2020.  Security incident reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the  2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)  came into force in 2011. The European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) (2018/1972)  repeals and replaces the Framework Directive. It reinforces the provisions for reporting  incidents, clarifying what incidents fall within its scope and the notification criteria.  STATISTICS EXTRACTED FROM ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORTING  PROCESS 2020  The 2020 annual summary reporting process contains reports of 170 incidents submitted by  national authorities from 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost,  derived by multiplying for each incident the number of users and the number of hours, was 841  million user hours. These numbers are in line with those of previous years, as can be seen in  the following graphic.  Figure 1: Number of incidents and user hours lost per year  THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM 2020 INCIDENTS   Faulty software changes/updates are a major factor in terms of impact: In 2020,  incidents related to faulty software changes/updates resulted in 346M user hours lost,  which corresponds to roughly 40% of the total user hours lost. In this year’s report, we  dive into the numbers relating to faulty software changes (see chapter 4).   System failures continue to dominate in terms of impact: System failures  represent around a half of the total user hours lost (419 million user hours, 50% of  2020  HIGHLIGHTS  In 2020, half of the  total user hours lost  were due to system  failures (50%) and  almost half was lost  due to human errors  (41%).  All reports mention  user hours lost due  to high load caused  by the COVID-19  pandemic.  The total user hours  lost were 841 million  user hours.  Over the course of  10 years, EU  Member States  reported a total of  1263 telecom  security incidents.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  4  total). They are also the most frequent root cause of incidents: 61% of the total  reported incidents.   Incidents caused by human errors remain at the same level as in 2019: More than  a quarter (26%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause and 41% of the  total user hours lost were due human errors.   Third-party failures remain at the same level as 2019: Almost a third of incidents  were also flagged as third-party failures (29%), ie incidents that originated in a third  party, say a utility company, a contractor, a supplier, etc. This number is consistent  with 2019, but has tripled compared to 2018, when it was just 9%.  Figure 2: Share of users’ hours lost per root cause category  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing incidents, which can be used to generate  custom graphs. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity- incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool.  MULTIANNUAL TRENDS OVER THE LAST DECADE  For a decade now, ENISA and the national authorities in EU Member States have been  collecting and analysing telecom security incident reports. Over the course of 10 years, EU  Member States reported 1263 telecom security incidents. ENISA stores these in a tool called  CIRAS and the statistics are accessible online.  Figure 3: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012-2020 period  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  5  Over the last couple of years, we see the following trends:   System failures continue to be the most frequent cause of incidents (61%), but  their average size is trending downwards: Every year system failures have been the  most common category of root causes. Since 2016 the average size of these incidents  has been decreasing; however, between 2019 and 2020 we observe a slight increase  in user hours lost due to system failures, and a corresponding decrease in hours lost  due to natural phenomena as well as due to malicious actions.   Number of incidents stabilizing: The total number of incidents reported is stabilizing  at around 160 annually. Over the period 2014-2020, a consistent number of incidents  have been reported and this is stabilizing at around 160 incidents per year.   User hours lost stabilizing at a new low: User hours lost have been stabilizing over  the last three years at around 900 million a year. During these three years, stabilization  in the number of user hours lost (around 900 million hours lost) was noticeable with the  number of incidents approximating 160 each year.   Malicious actions continue to represent a minority of incidents: Over the reporting  period, the frequency of malicious actions was stable (accounting for approximately 5%  of incidents per year). Their impact in terms of user hours was stable also.   Human errors are trending up: The percentage of incidents caused by human errors  has been trending up since 2016. In 2020 they accounted for 26% of the total number  of incidents.   Especially in 2020 and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, providers had to deal  with major surges and shifts in usage and traffic patterns from the start of the  pandemic. This gradually stabilised to what is now considered the new normal. The  general take away from the pandemic is that services and networks have been resilient  during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and traffic. We should not omit  mentioning, however, that some countries pointed out - in the context of ENISA’s  relevant information-gathering exercise from the NRAs concerning the status of  networks during the first months of 2020 - that there were physical attacks to base  stations, masts or other telecommunication equipment, possibly related to theories that  5G can be harmful and even responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.  Currently the focus of the national authorities for telecom security is on the transposition and  implementation of the EECC, which brings several changes. The incident reporting  requirements in Article 40 of the EECC have a broader scope including explicitly, for example,  breaches of confidentiality. In the context of the new EECC, targeted attacks, involving for  instance those using SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping frauds, attacks using the  Flubot malware or even more extended attacks that cause no outages, such as a wiretap on an  undersea cable or a BGP hijack, would be reportable under Article 40 of the EECC.  It should be noted here also that the Commission recently made a proposal for a revised NIS  Directive, the NIS2 proposal, which incorporates Article 40, and the incident reporting  provisions, of the EECC.  ENISA will continue to work with national authorities as well as the NIS Cooperation group to  find and exploit synergies between different pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes  to incident reporting and cross-border supervision.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents that have a  significant impact on the continuity of electronic communication services to the national telecom  regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary  to ENISA, covering a selection of these incidents, ie the most significant incidents, based on a  set of agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2020,  aggregates the incident reports reported in 2020 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 10th year ENISA is publishing an annual incident report for the telecom sector.  ENISA started publishing such annual reports in 2012. Mandatory incident reporting has been  part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package:  Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  The mandatory incident reporting under Article 13a had a specific focus on security incidents  with a significant impact on the functioning of each category in telecommunication services.  Over the years, the regulatory authorities have agreed to focus mostly on network/service  outages (type A incidents). This would leave out of the scope of these reports targeted attacks,  eg those involving the use of SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping frauds, or even more  extended attacks that nevertheless do not cause outages.  The relevant update of the EU telecom rules, namely the European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC), that was expected to be harmonized in Member States by the end of 2020,  includes a broader scope on the requirements for incident reporting in Article 40. These  requirement explicitly include, for example, breaches of confidentiality. 2020 is the first time  ENISA has also received three type B reports of incidents (breaches of confidentiality).  This document is structured as follows: In section 2, the policy context and background is  provided. The reporting procedure is briefly summarized. In addition, the types of incidents that  get reported are described. We also discuss some specific but anonymized examples of  incidents that occurred in 2020. In Section 3, key facts and statistics about incidents in 2020 are  provided. In Section 4, we take a closer look at faulty software changes and in section 5 we look  at multi-annual trends over the years 2012-2020.  It is important to note that the telecom security incidents that are reported to national authorities  are only the major incidents, those with significant impact. Smaller incidents, for example  targeted DDoS attacks or SIM swapping attacks do not get reported.  Note that conclusions about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with  a degree of caution as national reporting thresholds change over the years. Indeed reporting  thresholds have been lowered in most countries in recent years and, as mentioned, reporting  only covers the most significant incidents (and not smaller incidents which may well be more  frequent).  10TH YEAR OF  REPORTING  This is the 10th  ENISA annual  incident report for  the telecom sector.  Mandatory incident  reporting has been  part of the EU’s  telecom regulatory  framework since  the 2009  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  7  2. BACKGROUND AND POLICY  CONTEXT  We briefly explain the policy context and the main features of the incident reporting process, as  described in Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting1, which was developed in  collaboration with national authorities.  2.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Security incident reporting is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and it is an important  enabler for cybersecurity supervision and policymaking at national and EU level. Since 2016  security incident reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU under Article  19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS Directive (NISD), security incident reporting  became mandatory for Operators of Essential Services in the EU and for Digital Service  Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS directive.  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into effect  across the EU, but was only implemented into national legislation in some EU countries.  Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a broader scope,  including not only outages but also breaches of confidentiality, for instance. In addition, there  are more services within the scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom operators  but also, for example, over-the-top providers of communications services2 (Messaging services  like Viber and WhatsApp, etc.).  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline was updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA. These combine quantitative and qualitative parameters as well as  the notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet  and telephony, but also the number-based interpersonal communications services and/or  number independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services)3.  It is, nevertheless, important to note that the main characteristic of 2020 was the COVID-19  pandemic, which radically transformed the way people around the globe live and work, turning  everything digital. As such, there was extensive supervision from the European Commission on  the reporting by all Member States of incidents of network congestion.  2.2 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a of the Framework Directive and Article 40 of the EECC, provide for three types of  incident reporting:  1) National incident reporting from providers to NRAs,  2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and  3) Annual summary reporting from national authorities to the EC and ENISA.  The different types of reporting are shown in the following diagram.  1 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  2 See Security supervision changes in the new EU telecoms legislation — ENISA (europa.eu)  3 See When & How to Report Security Incidents — ENISA (europa.eu)  EECC  REFORM  Reform of the  telecom package:  Article 13a of the  Framework directive  (2009/140/EC)  further expanded in  the European  Electronic  Communications  Code.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-supervision-changes-in-the-new-eu-telecoms-legislation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/when-how-to-report-security-incidents  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  8  Figure 4: Incident reporting under EECC article 40  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymizing, aggregating and  analysing the incident reports. In the current setup, NRAs can search incidents in the reporting  tool (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making  the overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.3 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  ENISA maintains an incident reporting tool, called CIRAS, for the authorities, where they can  upload reports, and search for and study specific incidents.  For the public, ENISA also offers an online visual tool, which is publicly accessible and can be  used for custom analysis of the data. This tool anonymizes the country or operator involved.  CIRAS  is a free online tool where ENISA stores reported  incidents and provides annual and multiannual  statistics: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ciras  The reporting template starts with an incident type selector and contains three parts:  1. Impact of the incident  ̶  which communication services were impacted and by how  much.  2. Nature of the incident  ̶ what caused the incident?  3. Details about the incident  ̶  detailed information about the incident, a short  description, the types of network, the types of assets, the severity level etc.  The type selector distinguishes six types of cybersecurity incidents. We explain the different  types below.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  9  Figure 5: Types of cybersecurity incidents   Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability). For example, an outage caused  by a cable cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for  building a new road would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity). For  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the  endpoints participating in the shared session. This leads to the interception of the  media (voice, pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This  incident would be categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact on  the service). For example, a malware has been detected on several workstations and  servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be categorised  as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw). For instance, the  discovery of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system). For example, when  one of two redundant submarine cables breaks would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures). For instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would be  categorised as a type F incident.  For more information about the incident reporting process: please refer to ‘Technical Guideline  on Incident Reporting under the EECC’  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  10  2.4 EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS REPORTED  Below we give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the types of incidents  notified to NRAs by operators at a national level:  Incident example 1  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Emergency call routing  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Faulty software change/update  Assets affected Transmission nodes, public safety answering points  Significance factors Impact on economy and society  Comment  A failed software change for IP routing impacted the emergency  call routing of 50 public safety answering points (PSAP)  nationwide. The affected emergency call connections were  rerouted to alternative destinations. After the server failure was  resolved, the connections could be routed back to IP  destinations.  Incident example 2  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Fixed and mobile telecommunications network  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Faulty software change/update  Assets affected Switches and routers  Significance factors Services impacted were mobile and fixed services, broadcasting  services  Comment A planned maintenance gone wrong led to the loss of all  internet-based services fixed and mobile including VoLTE. The  cause was a cascade of human errors. A rollback fixed the  problem. The consequences were not as severe as they might  have been because of the late-night maintenance window.  Media coverage was huge, in large part because we had several  major incidents in the space of a few weeks.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  11  Incident example 3  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Mobile telecommunications network  Root cause Malicious action  Technical causes Arson  Assets affected Mobile base stations and controllers  Significance factors Number of users affected, duration of the incident, impact on  economy and society  Comment Due to an arson attack on a cell phone tower, an outage  occurred on the GSM, UMTS, and LTE services.  Incident example 4  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Fixed Broadband Services  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Software bug  Assets affected Transmission nodes  Significance factors Services impacted were mobile and fixed services, broadcasting  services  Comment The fixed internet service (cable internet) was not available for  130 minutes. It was caused by a software error. The fault was  caused by equipment operating at an international centre. The  error was fixed with a software update. Due to this incident, the  outage affected the whole territory of the country.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  12  There were also some incidents reported that were related to the Covid-19 pandemic:  Incident example 5 - COVID-19 related  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Mobile telephony services  Root cause System failures/third party failures  Technical causes Overload  Assets affected Mobile base stations and controllers  Significance factors Medium  Comment About 40 percent of end-users were unable to make calls to  other networks (the 4G network was uninterrupted, making call  apps available). About 40% of all calls in the network did not  reach the recipient. The problem was caused by an unplanned  load on the communication servers caused by COVID-19  quarantine. As also mentioned in the ENISA report “Telecom  Security during the Pandemic”4, in general the networks were  proven adequately resilient.  Incident example 6 - COVID-19 related  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Fixed and mobile voice services  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Overload  Assets affected Interconnection points  Significance factors Services impacted were mobile and fixed services  Comment Registered customer complaints that one company’s users  were not able to reach other networks users. Interconnect  links were overloaded due to measures taken by the national  government in reaction to the situation caused by the Corona  virus (COVID19). Augmenting interconnection capacity and  implementing gradual configuration changes eventually  ameliorated the problem.  4 See Telecom Security During a Pandemic — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-security-during-a-pandemic  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  13  3. ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENTS  For the year 2020, 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in the annual  reporting process, describing 170 significant incidents. In this section, the 170 reported  incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per root cause category is analysed in  section 3.1. In section 3.2 we focus on the user hours that were lost in each root cause  category. Detailed causes are then examined in Section 3.3, and in Section 3.4 the impact per  service is analysed.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  In 2020, about 26% of security incidents were caused by human errors. This is consistent with  what happened in 2019 (also 26%). In addition, 61% of telecom incidents were system failures,  a slight increase compared to 2019 (56%) (see figure 5).  In 2020, 29% of the incidents were also flagged as third-party failures, which is consistent with  2019 - when it was 32%. Third party failures are fairly equally represented across the four root  cause categories (see figure 6).  Figure 5: Root cause categories – Telecom security  Incidents in 2020  Figure 6: Root cause categories – Telecom security  Incidents in 2020  170  telecom  security  incidents  reported in  2020 by EU  Member  States  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  14  3.2 USER HOURS LOST FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY  Adding up total user hours lost for each root cause category we find that half of the total user  hours lost were due to system failures (50%, 419 million user hours). Human errors account for  approximately 40% (351 million user hours).  This means that system failures are again not only the most frequent but they also cause the  most impact. Human errors remain the second more common cause and this year the share of  natural phenomena is smaller than in 2019, although the number of incidents caused by natural  phenomena has risen.  Figure 7: Share of user hours lost per root cause category  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES AND USER HOURS LOST  In all incidents we keep track of detailed causes, in addition to root cause categories. An  incident is often a chain of events. For instance, an incident may be triggered by a storm, which  tears down power supply infrastructure, power cuts and cable cuts, which in turn leads to a  telecom outage. For this example, the root cause of the incident would be natural phenomena  and the detailed causes would be: Heavy wind, Cable cut, Power cut, Battery depletion.  The most frequent detailed cause appearing in incident reports is faulty software  changes/updates. Secondly, many incident reports mention hardware failures, cable cuts,  software bugs and overloads. The graph below shows the frequency of detailed causes across  incident reports for 2020.  Figure 8: Detailed causes – Telecom security incidents in 2020  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  15  3.3.1.1 Breakdown of System failures  The graphs below break down the main root causes of system failures, in terms of detailed causes  and we show the total number of incidents and user hours lost for each detailed cause.  Figure 9: System failures – detailed causes  Figure 10: System failures vs detailed causes: number of incidents and user hours lost  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  16  3.3.1.2 Break down of Human errors  Figure 11: Human errors detailed causes  Figure 12: Human errors vs detailed causes: number of incidents and user hours lost  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  17  3.3.1.3 Break down of natural phenomena  Figure 13: Natural phenomena – detailed causes  Figure 14: Natural phenomena vs detailed causes: number of incidents and user hours lost  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  18  3.3.1.5 Break down of malicious actions  Figure 15: Malicious actions – detailed causes  Figure 16: Malicious actions vs detailed causes: number of incidents and user hours lost  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  19  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section we look at the services affected by the incidents. For the fifth year in a row, most  of the reported incidents affected mobile services. In 2020, half of the incidents reported had an  impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift observed over the last  few years from fixed telephony, which was most affected as a service only in the early years of  reporting.  Figure 16: Services affected – Telecom security incidents in 2020  Note that for most reported incidents there was an impact on more than one service, which  explains why the percentages in the chart here add up to more than 100%.  3.5 TECHNICAL ASSETS AFFECTED  Each incident report also describes the (secondary) assets affected during the incident. The graph  below shows the assets most affected.  Figure 17: Assets affected – Telecom security incidents in 2020  What we noticed also, taking multinational trends into account, is that switches and routers as  well as mobile base stations and controllers are the two assets affected the most over the last  few years.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  20  4. ANALYSING INCIDENTS  CAUSED BY FAULTY SOFTWARE  CHANGES/UPDATES  In this section we dive into faulty software changes, which have been a major cause of incidents,  not only last year but also in previous years.  4.1 FAULTY SOFTWARE CHANGES/UPDATES IN 2020  In 2020, 24% of total incidents marked as faulty software changes/updates resulted in 346 million  user hours lost (41% of the total).  Figure 18: Faulty software changes/updates in 2020  In 2020, 60% of incidents having faulty software changes/updates as a cause were categorized  under human errors, while the remaining 40% was classified under system failures.  Figure 19: Root cause - Faulty software changes/updates in 2020  346 M  user hours lost  due to faulty  software  changes/update s in 2020, 41%  of the total  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  21  4.2 FAULTY SOFTWARE CHANGES/UPDATES – MULTI-ANNUAL  Over the past 10 years of reporting, ENISA has collected 220 incidents where a faulty software  change/update was a detailed cause. In total, these incidents caused a loss of 2,176M user  hours. The majority of these incidents were categorized under either system failures or under  human errors.

MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section, we  present multiannual trends over the last 10 years, from 2012 to 2020. This dataset contains  1263 reported incidents in total.  5.1 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS – ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Every year from 2012 to 2020, system failures were the most common root cause. In 2020,  however, system failures show stabilization and a slight decrease. In total, system failures  accounted for 826 of incident reports (65% of the total). For this root cause category, over the  last 9 years, the most common causes were hardware failures (36%) and software bugs (28%).  The second most common root cause over the 9 years of reporting is human errors with nearly  a fifth of total incidents (19%, 202 incidents in total). Natural phenomena come third at almost a  tenth of total incidents (9%, 109 incidents in total). Only 5% of the incidents are categorized as  malicious actions. In the period 2012-2020 nearly two thirds of the malicious actions consist of  Denial of Service attacks, and the rest resulted mainly in lasting damage to physical  infrastructure.  Figure 22: Root cause categories - Telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012-  2020  5.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - IMPACT PER SERVICE  In 2020, mobile networks and services were once more the most impacted by incidents. However  there was a decrease compared to 2019 and interestingly the statistics in terms of services  affected are converging for both fixed and mobile.  1263  telecom  security  incidents  reported in 10  years by EU  Member  States.

In 2020, their  share in terms of impact was almost the same as system failures. The overall impact of natural  phenomena has been trending down over the last two years after peaking in 2018 (caused by  extreme weather and wildfires).

CONCLUSIONS  This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2020, covers the incidents  reported by the authorities for the calendar year 2020 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. It marks the 10th time ENISA has published an  annual report for the telecom sector.  We conclude with the main findings and some more  general observations about this process and the broader policy context.  MAIN FINDINGS   Faulty software changes/updates are a major factor in terms of impact. In 2020,  incidents related to faulty software changes/updates resulted in 346M user hours lost,  which corresponds to roughly 40% of the total user hours lost.   System failures continue to dominate in terms of impact. System failures  represent around a half of the total user hours lost (419 million user hours, 50% of  total). They are also the most frequent root cause of incidents: 61% of the total  reported incidents.   Incidents caused by human errors remain at the same level as in 2019. More than  a quarter (26%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause and 41% of the  total user hours have been lost due to this kind of incident.   Third-party failures remain at the same level. Almost a third of the incidents were  also flagged as third-party failures (29%), ie, incidents which originated in a third party,  say a utility company, a contractor, a supplier, etc.  GENERAL OBSERVATION   By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into  effect across the EU. Some countries have already implemented the EECC but many  are still transposing. Transposing the EECC and implementing its provisions will be a  key focus for ENISA and the national authorities this year and in the coming years.   Under Article 40 of the EECC, the incident reporting provisions have changed slightly5.  For instance, under the EECC, mandatory incident reporting also applies to  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).  To address these changes ENISA published a new incident reporting guideline at the  start of 2020. From 2021, we will start to see these changes in the reporting data   One issue already mentioned is the fact that many smaller scale incidents, however  frequent, remain under the radar. Some of these incidents, such as targeted DDoS  attacks, SIM swapping and SS7 attacks, can still have major impacts on individual  customers. In coming years, we would like to analyse this area better and possibly  introduce a summary reporting format for these smaller scale incidents.   The 5G roll out will continue to require a lot of attention, both from authorities and from  the providers. At ENISA, we are focusing on supporting the national authorities in the  ENISA ECASEC group and in the NIS Cooperation group, with technical guidance, but  also by organizing dedicated seminars and panels.  We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with EU Member States, the national  telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe to implement  security incident reporting efficiently and effectively.  5 Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting under the EECC — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  T P  -0 9  -2 1  -2 7  3 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

CONCLUSIONS 25  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  In the EU, telecom operators notify significant security incidents to their national authorities. At  the start of every calendar year, the national authorities send a summary of these reports to  ENISA. This report, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2020, provides anonymised  and aggregated information about major telecom security incidents in 2020.  Security incident reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the  2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC)  came into force in 2011. The European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) (2018/1972)  repeals and replaces the Framework Directive. It reinforces the provisions for reporting  incidents, clarifying what incidents fall within its scope and the notification criteria.  STATISTICS EXTRACTED FROM ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORTING  PROCESS 2020  The 2020 annual summary reporting process contains reports of 170 incidents submitted by  national authorities from 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost,  derived by multiplying for each incident the number of users and the number of hours, was 841  million user hours. These numbers are in line with those of previous years, as can be seen in  the following graphic.  Figure 1: Number of incidents and user hours lost per year  THE KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM 2020 INCIDENTS   Faulty software changes/updates are a major factor in terms of impact: In 2020,  incidents related to faulty software changes/updates resulted in 346M user hours lost,  which corresponds to roughly 40% of the total user hours lost. In this year’s report, we  dive into the numbers relating to faulty software changes (see chapter 4).   System failures continue to dominate in terms of impact: System failures  represent around a half of the total user hours lost (419 million user hours, 50% of  2020  HIGHLIGHTS  In 2020, half of the  total user hours lost  were due to system  failures (50%) and  almost half was lost  due to human errors  (41%).  All reports mention  user hours lost due  to high load caused  by the COVID-19  pandemic.  The total user hours  lost were 841 million  user hours.  Over the course of  10 years, EU  Member States  reported a total of  1263 telecom  security incidents.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  4  total). They are also the most frequent root cause of incidents: 61% of the total  reported incidents.   Incidents caused by human errors remain at the same level as in 2019: More than  a quarter (26%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause and 41% of the  total user hours lost were due human errors.   Third-party failures remain at the same level as 2019: Almost a third of incidents  were also flagged as third-party failures (29%), ie incidents that originated in a third  party, say a utility company, a contractor, a supplier, etc. This number is consistent  with 2019, but has tripled compared to 2018, when it was just 9%.  Figure 2: Share of users’ hours lost per root cause category  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing incidents, which can be used to generate  custom graphs. See: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity- incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool.  MULTIANNUAL TRENDS OVER THE LAST DECADE  For a decade now, ENISA and the national authorities in EU Member States have been  collecting and analysing telecom security incident reports. Over the course of 10 years, EU  Member States reported 1263 telecom security incidents. ENISA stores these in a tool called  CIRAS and the statistics are accessible online.  Figure 3: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012-2020 period  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  5  Over the last couple of years, we see the following trends:   System failures continue to be the most frequent cause of incidents (61%), but  their average size is trending downwards: Every year system failures have been the  most common category of root causes. Since 2016 the average size of these incidents  has been decreasing; however, between 2019 and 2020 we observe a slight increase  in user hours lost due to system failures, and a corresponding decrease in hours lost  due to natural phenomena as well as due to malicious actions.   Number of incidents stabilizing: The total number of incidents reported is stabilizing  at around 160 annually. Over the period 2014-2020, a consistent number of incidents  have been reported and this is stabilizing at around 160 incidents per year.   User hours lost stabilizing at a new low: User hours lost have been stabilizing over  the last three years at around 900 million a year. During these three years, stabilization  in the number of user hours lost (around 900 million hours lost) was noticeable with the  number of incidents approximating 160 each year.   Malicious actions continue to represent a minority of incidents: Over the reporting  period, the frequency of malicious actions was stable (accounting for approximately 5%  of incidents per year). Their impact in terms of user hours was stable also.   Human errors are trending up: The percentage of incidents caused by human errors  has been trending up since 2016. In 2020 they accounted for 26% of the total number  of incidents.   Especially in 2020 and because of the COVID-19 pandemic, providers had to deal  with major surges and shifts in usage and traffic patterns from the start of the  pandemic. This gradually stabilised to what is now considered the new normal. The  general take away from the pandemic is that services and networks have been resilient  during the crisis, despite major changes in usage and traffic. We should not omit  mentioning, however, that some countries pointed out - in the context of ENISA’s  relevant information-gathering exercise from the NRAs concerning the status of  networks during the first months of 2020 - that there were physical attacks to base  stations, masts or other telecommunication equipment, possibly related to theories that  5G can be harmful and even responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.  Currently the focus of the national authorities for telecom security is on the transposition and  implementation of the EECC, which brings several changes. The incident reporting  requirements in Article 40 of the EECC have a broader scope including explicitly, for example,  breaches of confidentiality. In the context of the new EECC, targeted attacks, involving for  instance those using SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping frauds, attacks using the  Flubot malware or even more extended attacks that cause no outages, such as a wiretap on an  undersea cable or a BGP hijack, would be reportable under Article 40 of the EECC.  It should be noted here also that the Commission recently made a proposal for a revised NIS  Directive, the NIS2 proposal, which incorporates Article 40, and the incident reporting  provisions, of the EECC.  ENISA will continue to work with national authorities as well as the NIS Cooperation group to  find and exploit synergies between different pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes  to incident reporting and cross-border supervision.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  6  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents that have a  significant impact on the continuity of electronic communication services to the national telecom  regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary  to ENISA, covering a selection of these incidents, ie the most significant incidents, based on a  set of agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2020,  aggregates the incident reports reported in 2020 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 10th year ENISA is publishing an annual incident report for the telecom sector.  ENISA started publishing such annual reports in 2012. Mandatory incident reporting has been  part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package:  Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  The mandatory incident reporting under Article 13a had a specific focus on security incidents  with a significant impact on the functioning of each category in telecommunication services.  Over the years, the regulatory authorities have agreed to focus mostly on network/service  outages (type A incidents). This would leave out of the scope of these reports targeted attacks,  eg those involving the use of SS7 protocol vulnerabilities, SIM Swapping frauds, or even more  extended attacks that nevertheless do not cause outages.  The relevant update of the EU telecom rules, namely the European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC), that was expected to be harmonized in Member States by the end of 2020,  includes a broader scope on the requirements for incident reporting in Article 40. These  requirement explicitly include, for example, breaches of confidentiality. 2020 is the first time  ENISA has also received three type B reports of incidents (breaches of confidentiality).  This document is structured as follows: In section 2, the policy context and background is  provided. The reporting procedure is briefly summarized. In addition, the types of incidents that  get reported are described. We also discuss some specific but anonymized examples of  incidents that occurred in 2020. In Section 3, key facts and statistics about incidents in 2020 are  provided. In Section 4, we take a closer look at faulty software changes and in section 5 we look  at multi-annual trends over the years 2012-2020.  It is important to note that the telecom security incidents that are reported to national authorities  are only the major incidents, those with significant impact. Smaller incidents, for example  targeted DDoS attacks or SIM swapping attacks do not get reported.  Note that conclusions about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with  a degree of caution as national reporting thresholds change over the years. Indeed reporting  thresholds have been lowered in most countries in recent years and, as mentioned, reporting  only covers the most significant incidents (and not smaller incidents which may well be more  frequent).  10TH YEAR OF  REPORTING  This is the 10th  ENISA annual  incident report for  the telecom sector.  Mandatory incident  reporting has been  part of the EU’s  telecom regulatory  framework since  the 2009  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  7  2. BACKGROUND AND POLICY  CONTEXT  We briefly explain the policy context and the main features of the incident reporting process, as  described in Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting1, which was developed in  collaboration with national authorities.  2.1 POLICY CONTEXT  Security incident reporting is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and it is an important  enabler for cybersecurity supervision and policymaking at national and EU level. Since 2016  security incident reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU under Article  19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS Directive (NISD), security incident reporting  became mandatory for Operators of Essential Services in the EU and for Digital Service  Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS directive.  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into effect  across the EU, but was only implemented into national legislation in some EU countries.  Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a broader scope,  including not only outages but also breaches of confidentiality, for instance. In addition, there  are more services within the scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom operators  but also, for example, over-the-top providers of communications services2 (Messaging services  like Viber and WhatsApp, etc.).  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline was updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA. These combine quantitative and qualitative parameters as well as  the notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet  and telephony, but also the number-based interpersonal communications services and/or  number independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services)3.  It is, nevertheless, important to note that the main characteristic of 2020 was the COVID-19  pandemic, which radically transformed the way people around the globe live and work, turning  everything digital. As such, there was extensive supervision from the European Commission on  the reporting by all Member States of incidents of network congestion.  2.2 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a of the Framework Directive and Article 40 of the EECC, provide for three types of  incident reporting:  1) National incident reporting from providers to NRAs,  2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and  3) Annual summary reporting from national authorities to the EC and ENISA.  The different types of reporting are shown in the following diagram.  1 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  2 See Security supervision changes in the new EU telecoms legislation — ENISA (europa.eu)  3 See When & How to Report Security Incidents — ENISA (europa.eu)  EECC  REFORM  Reform of the  telecom package:  Article 13a of the  Framework directive  (2009/140/EC)  further expanded in  the European  Electronic  Communications  Code.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/security-supervision-changes-in-the-new-eu-telecoms-legislation https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/when-how-to-report-security-incidents  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  8  Figure 4: Incident reporting under EECC article 40  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymizing, aggregating and  analysing the incident reports. In the current setup, NRAs can search incidents in the reporting  tool (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making  the overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.3 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  ENISA maintains an incident reporting tool, called CIRAS, for the authorities, where they can  upload reports, and search for and study specific incidents.  For the public, ENISA also offers an online visual tool, which is publicly accessible and can be  used for custom analysis of the data. This tool anonymizes the country or operator involved.  CIRAS  is a free online tool where ENISA stores reported  incidents and provides annual and multiannual  statistics: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ciras  The reporting template starts with an incident type selector and contains three parts:  1. Impact of the incident  ̶  which communication services were impacted and by how  much.  2. Nature of the incident  ̶ what caused the incident?  3. Details about the incident  ̶  detailed information about the incident, a short  description, the types of network, the types of assets, the severity level etc.  The type selector distinguishes six types of cybersecurity incidents. We explain the different  types below.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  9  Figure 5: Types of cybersecurity incidents   Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability). For example, an outage caused  by a cable cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for  building a new road would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity). For  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the  endpoints participating in the shared session. This leads to the interception of the  media (voice, pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This  incident would be categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact on  the service). For example, a malware has been detected on several workstations and  servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be categorised  as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw). For instance, the  discovery of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system). For example, when  one of two redundant submarine cables breaks would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures). For instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would be  categorised as a type F incident.

The affected emergency call connections were  rerouted to alternative destinations. After the server failure was  resolved, the connections could be routed back to IP  destinations.  Incident example 2  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Fixed and mobile telecommunications network  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Faulty software change/update  Assets affected Switches and routers  Significance factors Services impacted were mobile and fixed services, broadcasting  services  Comment A planned maintenance gone wrong led to the loss of all  internet-based services fixed and mobile including VoLTE. The  cause was a cascade of human errors. A rollback fixed the  problem. The consequences were not as severe as they might  have been because of the late-night maintenance window.  Media coverage was huge, in large part because we had several  major incidents in the space of a few weeks.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  11  Incident example 3  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Mobile telecommunications network  Root cause Malicious action  Technical causes Arson  Assets affected Mobile base stations and controllers  Significance factors Number of users affected, duration of the incident, impact on  economy and society  Comment Due to an arson attack on a cell phone tower, an outage  occurred on the GSM, UMTS, and LTE services.  Incident example 4  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Fixed Broadband Services  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Software bug  Assets affected Transmission nodes  Significance factors Services impacted were mobile and fixed services, broadcasting  services  Comment The fixed internet service (cable internet) was not available for  130 minutes. It was caused by a software error. The fault was  caused by equipment operating at an international centre. The  error was fixed with a software update. Due to this incident, the  outage affected the whole territory of the country.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  12  There were also some incidents reported that were related to the Covid-19 pandemic:  Incident example 5 - COVID-19 related  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Mobile telephony services  Root cause System failures/third party failures  Technical causes Overload  Assets affected Mobile base stations and controllers  Significance factors Medium  Comment About 40 percent of end-users were unable to make calls to  other networks (the 4G network was uninterrupted, making call  apps available). About 40% of all calls in the network did not  reach the recipient. The problem was caused by an unplanned  load on the communication servers caused by COVID-19  quarantine. As also mentioned in the ENISA report “Telecom  Security during the Pandemic”4, in general the networks were  proven adequately resilient.  Incident example 6 - COVID-19 related  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected Fixed and mobile voice services  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Overload  Assets affected Interconnection points  Significance factors Services impacted were mobile and fixed services  Comment Registered customer complaints that one company’s users  were not able to reach other networks users. Interconnect  links were overloaded due to measures taken by the national  government in reaction to the situation caused by the Corona  virus (COVID19). Augmenting interconnection capacity and  implementing gradual configuration changes eventually  ameliorated the problem.  4 See Telecom Security During a Pandemic — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/telecom-security-during-a-pandemic  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  13  3. ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENTS  For the year 2020, 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in the annual  reporting process, describing 170 significant incidents. In this section, the 170 reported  incidents are aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per root cause category is analysed in  section 3.1. In section 3.2 we focus on the user hours that were lost in each root cause  category. Detailed causes are then examined in Section 3.3, and in Section 3.4 the impact per  service is analysed.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  In 2020, about 26% of security incidents were caused by human errors. This is consistent with  what happened in 2019 (also 26%). In addition, 61% of telecom incidents were system failures,  a slight increase compared to 2019 (56%) (see figure 5).  In 2020, 29% of the incidents were also flagged as third-party failures, which is consistent with  2019 - when it was 32%. Third party failures are fairly equally represented across the four root  cause categories (see figure 6).  Figure 5: Root cause categories – Telecom security  Incidents in 2020  Figure 6: Root cause categories – Telecom security  Incidents in 2020  170  telecom  security  incidents  reported in  2020 by EU  Member  States  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  14  3.2 USER HOURS LOST FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY  Adding up total user hours lost for each root cause category we find that half of the total user  hours lost were due to system failures (50%, 419 million user hours). Human errors account for  approximately 40% (351 million user hours).  This means that system failures are again not only the most frequent but they also cause the  most impact. Human errors remain the second more common cause and this year the share of  natural phenomena is smaller than in 2019, although the number of incidents caused by natural  phenomena has risen.  Figure 7: Share of user hours lost per root cause category  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES AND USER HOURS LOST  In all incidents we keep track of detailed causes, in addition to root cause categories. An  incident is often a chain of events. For instance, an incident may be triggered by a storm, which  tears down power supply infrastructure, power cuts and cable cuts, which in turn leads to a  telecom outage. For this example, the root cause of the incident would be natural phenomena  and the detailed causes would be: Heavy wind, Cable cut, Power cut, Battery depletion.  The most frequent detailed cause appearing in incident reports is faulty software  changes/updates. Secondly, many incident reports mention hardware failures, cable cuts,  software bugs and overloads. The graph below shows the frequency of detailed causes across  incident reports for 2020.  Figure 8: Detailed causes – Telecom security incidents in 2020  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  15  3.3.1.1 Breakdown of System failures  The graphs below break down the main root causes of system failures, in terms of detailed causes  and we show the total number of incidents and user hours lost for each detailed cause.

For the fifth year in a row, most  of the reported incidents affected mobile services. In 2020, half of the incidents reported had an  impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift observed over the last  few years from fixed telephony, which was most affected as a service only in the early years of  reporting.  Figure 16: Services affected – Telecom security incidents in 2020  Note that for most reported incidents there was an impact on more than one service, which  explains why the percentages in the chart here add up to more than 100%.  3.5 TECHNICAL ASSETS AFFECTED  Each incident report also describes the (secondary) assets affected during the incident. The graph  below shows the assets most affected.  Figure 17: Assets affected – Telecom security incidents in 2020  What we noticed also, taking multinational trends into account, is that switches and routers as  well as mobile base stations and controllers are the two assets affected the most over the last  few years.

ANALYSING INCIDENTS  CAUSED BY FAULTY SOFTWARE  CHANGES/UPDATES  In this section we dive into faulty software changes, which have been a major cause of incidents,  not only last year but also in previous years.  4.1 FAULTY SOFTWARE CHANGES/UPDATES IN 2020  In 2020, 24% of total incidents marked as faulty software changes/updates resulted in 346 million  user hours lost (41% of the total).  Figure 18: Faulty software changes/updates in 2020  In 2020, 60% of incidents having faulty software changes/updates as a cause were categorized  under human errors, while the remaining 40% was classified under system failures.  Figure 19: Root cause - Faulty software changes/updates in 2020  346 M  user hours lost  due to faulty  software  changes/update s in 2020, 41%  of the total  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  21  4.2 FAULTY SOFTWARE CHANGES/UPDATES – MULTI-ANNUAL  Over the past 10 years of reporting, ENISA has collected 220 incidents where a faulty software  change/update was a detailed cause. In total, these incidents caused a loss of 2,176M user  hours. The majority of these incidents were categorized under either system failures or under  human errors.

MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section, we  present multiannual trends over the last 10 years, from 2012 to 2020. This dataset contains  1263 reported incidents in total.  5.1 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS – ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Every year from 2012 to 2020, system failures were the most common root cause. In 2020,  however, system failures show stabilization and a slight decrease. In total, system failures  accounted for 826 of incident reports (65% of the total). For this root cause category, over the  last 9 years, the most common causes were hardware failures (36%) and software bugs (28%).  The second most common root cause over the 9 years of reporting is human errors with nearly  a fifth of total incidents (19%, 202 incidents in total). Natural phenomena come third at almost a  tenth of total incidents (9%, 109 incidents in total). Only 5% of the incidents are categorized as  malicious actions. In the period 2012-2020 nearly two thirds of the malicious actions consist of  Denial of Service attacks, and the rest resulted mainly in lasting damage to physical  infrastructure.  Figure 22: Root cause categories - Telecom security incidents in the EU reported over 2012-  2020  5.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - IMPACT PER SERVICE  In 2020, mobile networks and services were once more the most impacted by incidents. However  there was a decrease compared to 2019 and interestingly the statistics in terms of services  affected are converging for both fixed and mobile.  1263  telecom  security  incidents  reported in 10  years by EU  Member  States.  TELECOM SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  23  Figure 23: Trends on impact per classic services reported over 2012-2020  5.3 MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS - USER HOURS PER ROOT CAUSE  In terms of overall impact, human errors have been steadily increasing since 2016. In 2020, their  share in terms of impact was almost the same as system failures. The overall impact of natural  phenomena has been trending down over the last two years after peaking in 2018 (caused by  extreme weather and wildfires).

CONCLUSIONS  This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2020, covers the incidents  reported by the authorities for the calendar year 2020 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. It marks the 10th time ENISA has published an  annual report for the telecom sector.  We conclude with the main findings and some more  general observations about this process and the broader policy context.  MAIN FINDINGS   Faulty software changes/updates are a major factor in terms of impact. In 2020,  incidents related to faulty software changes/updates resulted in 346M user hours lost,  which corresponds to roughly 40% of the total user hours lost.   System failures continue to dominate in terms of impact. System failures  represent around a half of the total user hours lost (419 million user hours, 50% of  total). They are also the most frequent root cause of incidents: 61% of the total  reported incidents.   Incidents caused by human errors remain at the same level as in 2019. More than  a quarter (26%) of total incidents have human errors as a root cause and 41% of the  total user hours have been lost due to this kind of incident.   Third-party failures remain at the same level. Almost a third of the incidents were  also flagged as third-party failures (29%), ie, incidents which originated in a third party,  say a utility company, a contractor, a supplier, etc.  GENERAL OBSERVATION   By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) came into  effect across the EU. Some countries have already implemented the EECC but many  are still transposing. Transposing the EECC and implementing its provisions will be a  key focus for ENISA and the national authorities this year and in the coming years.   Under Article 40 of the EECC, the incident reporting provisions have changed slightly5.  For instance, under the EECC, mandatory incident reporting also applies to  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).  To address these changes ENISA published a new incident reporting guideline at the  start of 2020. From 2021, we will start to see these changes in the reporting data   One issue already mentioned is the fact that many smaller scale incidents, however  frequent, remain under the radar. Some of these incidents, such as targeted DDoS  attacks, SIM swapping and SS7 attacks, can still have major impacts on individual  customers. In coming years, we would like to analyse this area better and possibly  introduce a summary reporting format for these smaller scale incidents.   The 5G roll out will continue to require a lot of attention, both from authorities and from  the providers. At ENISA, we are focusing on supporting the national authorities in the  ENISA ECASEC group and in the NIS Cooperation group, with technical guidance, but  also by organizing dedicated seminars and panels.  We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with EU Member States, the national  telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe to implement  security incident reporting efficiently and effectively.  5 Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting under the EECC — ENISA (europa.eu)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-technical-guideline-on-incident-reporting-under-the-eecc  T P  -0 9  -2 1  -2 7  3 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

    "abstract": "Security incident reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework Directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) (2018/1972) repeals and replaces the Framework Directive. It reinforces the provisions for reporting incidents, clarifying what incidents fall within its scope and the notification criteria. The 2020 annual summary reporting process contains reports of 170 incidents submitted by national authorities from 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost, derived by multiplying for each incident the number of users and the number of hours, was 841 million user hours."

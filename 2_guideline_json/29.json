New methodologies are required for the identification, acquisition, preservation, 196  examination, and interpretation of digital evidence in multi-tenant cloud environments that offer 197  rapid provisioning, global elasticity, and broad network accessibility. This is necessary to 198  provide capabilities for incident response, secure internal enterprise operations, and support for 199  the U.S. criminal justice and civil litigation systems.  200  This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA, 201  also referred to as FRA for the sake of brevity), whose goal is to provide support for a cloud 202  system’s forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand the cloud forensic 203  challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies forensic challenges 204  that require mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would apply that to a particular 205  forensic investigation.  206  The CC FRA provides a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze the 207  impacts of cloud forensic challenges previously reported by NIST. It does so by considering each 208  cloud forensic challenge in the context of each functional capability presented in the Cloud 209  Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture. 210  While the CC FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed 211  to allow cloud system architects, cloud engineers, forensic practitioners, and cloud consumers to 212  ask specific questions related to their cloud computing architectures. The CC FRA is both a 213  methodology and an initial implementation, and users are encouraged to customize this initial 214  implementation for their specific situations and needs. 215  216  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  2  Introduction 217  The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) previously 218  published NIST IR 8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges [1], which was 219  the result of collaboration between volunteers from the private and public sector. That document 220  highlighted digital forensic challenges triggered by the specific characteristics and business 221  model of public cloud computing services. 222  The approach to examining digital forensics in the cloud was to first understand cloud computing 223  technology and to identify and elucidate its essential and unique characteristics, which play a 224  significant part in three aspects of operation: normal operations, adverse operations when cloud 225  computing resources are under attack, and operations during criminal exploitation. 226  The second phase of this approach was a close examination of the challenges that were identified 227  in the previous NIST report. This examination involved analyzing the Cloud Security Alliance’s 228  (CSA’s) Enterprise Architecture (EA) [2], its various functional capabilities and processes, and 229  the potential impact of each challenge on performing a forensic investigation if a specific 230  functional capability or process were involved in an attack and breach or were used during 231  criminal exploitation. The analysis presumed fictive use case scenarios that would exploit 232  potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, exposures, or cloud technology for criminal activities. Such 233  elements are of fundamental concern in forensic analysis as they present points that adversaries 234  may seek to exploit or characteristics that can be used by criminals. In either case, there will be 235  evidence of the attack or criminal exploitation for future forensic analysis. The EA is composed 236  of a large number of specific functional capabilities that enable detailed consideration of the 237  effects of each forensic challenge on each of the capabilities.  238  The third phase of this work has been to examine the nature of each challenge (i.e., whether the 239  challenge is technological or non-technological) to determine its role and impact on the forensic 240  examination process. As each challenge was analyzed, the applicability of techniques or 241  technologies became clearer in terms of how they function and ultimately contribute to the 242  forensic processes of identification, acquisition, preservation, examination, and interpretation of 243  evidence.  244  This work brings value by clarifying how forensics in the cloud can achieve the same acceptance 245  as forensics in traditional computing models. This document, the associated research, and NIST 246  IR 8006 [1] proactively address the White House Executive Order of May 12, 2021, entitled 247  Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity [3], which points out the importance 248  of having forensic-ready information systems, including cloud systems, to improve the Nation’s 249  cybersecurity. 250  The Need for a Cloud-specific Forensic Reference Architecture 251  Digital forensics is the application of science and technology to the discovery and examination of 252  digital artifacts within information systems and networks to establish facts and evidence 253  concerning events and conditions that occur within them. Digital forensics is traditionally used 254  for judicial proceedings and regulatory issues but may also be used for other purposes as 255  described below.  256  Digital forensics continues to evolve in step with computer and information science. As these 257  technologies, their implementations, and their operations have changed, digital forensics has 258  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  3  adapted. The number of scenarios that may require the application of digital forensic techniques 259  have increased along with the complexity of the underlying architectures . 260  One common scenario involves the detailed investigation of criminal activities. As computers 261  become widely available and develop greater capabilities, criminal elements worldwide have 262  adopted them as tools to manage their endeavors. These include both “traditional” forms of 263  crime (e.g., violent crime, property crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, white-collar 264  crime) and crimes that occur in cyberspace (e.g., ransomware attacks, data breaches, identity 265  theft, cyber-terrorism, distributed denial of service, illicit cryptocurrency mining, child 266  pornography, and attacks against governments, key corporations, or power grids). Forensic 267  procedures involve locating and analyzing digital traces that can help solve the crime and/or 268  allow for incident response. 269  Forensic procedures are also used to investigate civil actions, such as divorce proceedings, asset 270  discovery, insurance claims, lawsuits, and similar cases that often require forensic methods to 271  determine the presence, absence, and movement of data and funds. 272  An example of how forensic techniques are used involves the collection of a laptop computer 273  while apprehending a presumed perpetrator of an illegal act. The suspected act could involve – 274  for instance –financial exploitation of stolen identities, hacking into a hospital’s records 275  management system to implant ransomware, electronic entry of a corporate system in attempted 276  commercial espionage, or penetrating a government or military computer. Similarly, civil actions 277  can require forensic examination, such as discovering financial assets for a divorce proceeding.  278  In each of these cases, forensics plays an essential role in determining facts; assisting in the 279  analysis, validation, and authentication of data; and enabling documentation of findings to 280  present to a court and attorneys. 281  The application of forensic methods may also be required for normal business operations. For 282  example, forensic methods may be employed to recover data that, at first, appears to be lost or 283  destroyed on computer drives. During incident response, additional goals of using forensic 284  methods may include mitigating future cyberattacks, preventing system failure, or minimizing 285  data loss.  286  In the commercial context, the use of forensics in incident response can help determine the root 287  cause of an outage event, such as a component failure, corrupted software, or intentional 288  sabotage. Other scenarios may involve close examination of system configurations, potentially 289  questionable employee data storage and activities, and operational aspects related to compliance 290  matters. In any of these cases, forensic methods may supply insights that are not available 291  through any other means.  292  For decades, information processing systems have enabled the storage, processing, and 293  transmission of information for public and private organizations and individuals. The 294  maintenance, operations, and protection of these information systems have become paramount 295  concerns since a disruption of sufficient magnitude or specific type could threaten business 296  activities. In addition, the use of these systems in support of criminal activities has been of major 297  concern.  298  Industry and government have an array of authoritative sources that guide the design, 299  engineering, and operations of information systems. Each of the frameworks listed below can 300  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  4  provide core support for the design, implementation, assessment, monitoring, and operations of 301  information systems: 302  • NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] – A focused guide to information system 303  risk management 304  • ISO 27000 Series [5] – A series of standards dealing with a wide range of information 305  security topics, such as: 306  o ISO/IEC 27001 [6] – Information Security Management 307  o ISO/IEC 27002 [7] – Information Security Controls 308  o ISO/IEC 27018 [8] – Security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the 309  Cloud 310  o ISO/IEC 27035 [9] – Incident Response 311  o ISO/IEC 27037 [10] – Digital Evidence Collection and Preservation 312  • IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] – A service-oriented architecture (SOA) 313  • Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12] 314  • The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) [13] – A general security 315  framework 316  • Cloud Security Alliance STAR program [14]  – A progressive security certification 317  The focus of each of these frameworks varies but generally facilitates architecting, 318  implementing, and operating secure and resilient information systems. The RMF is focused on 319  security from a risk identification and management perspective. As varied as the ISO 27000 320  series [5] is, it contains standards that address digital evidence and incident response. 321  Interestingly, however, there is not a readily apparent, in-depth exploration of cloud-system 322  forensics.  323  The endeavor presented here deals with the matter of forensics performed within a cloud 324  computing environment. The advent of cloud computing has simplified business operations and 325  introduced a level of business agility not previously experienced with traditional or on-premises 326  computing. However, cloud computing has also introduced a range of security and forensics 327  challenges. Enhanced capabilities enjoyed by legitimate businesses and friendly governments are 328  often equally available to opposing nation-states, terrorist groups, and international criminal 329  elements and assets. As a result, targets that were once unassailable by nefarious actors may now 330  be vulnerable to attack or exploitation.  331  To a great extent, cloud computing runs on virtualization – that is, the creation of processing 332  resources that have hardware as their basis but run as multiplexed programs and are thus 333  functionally multiplied through it. Cloud forensics involves performing analysis on “virtual 334  machines” using techniques that rely on having “real machines” on which to work. In addition, 335  there is the issue of the information obtained. If the “machine” is essentially “unreal,” what does 336  that say about any evidence derived from it? This evidence is therefore different from traditional 337  digital evidence.  338  Cloud computing has become increasingly pervasive as more entities discover its advantages. 339  These entities include legitimate businesses, governments, and individuals who use SaaS cloud 340  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  5  platforms, as well as criminal and terrorist organizations and opposing nation-states. For 341  legitimate consumers, cloud computing provides capabilities such as: 342  • More rapid business continuity and disaster recovery 343  • More effective incident response 344  • Improved information access, management, and archiving 345  • Easier and more immediate collaboration between widely separated individuals and groups 346  This research has adapted solutions that originated in the on-premises data center to the 347  significant differences presented by the cloud.  348  As important as they are for addressing significant events related to business operations (as 349  described above), forensic methods have at least equal importance when contributing to matters 350  of compliance, legality, and criminal exploitation. Careful treatment has been given to these 351  questions during this research to ensure that the findings do not merely consider technical aspects 352  but also address the broader aspects of their material application. Unquestionably, close 353  examination of these adverse events is required to understand their incipience and progression 354  and – in particular – to ensure that remediation, event reconstruction, and attribution are 355  effectively and credibly realized. 356  Thus, it has been the specific focus and goal of this effort to research these issues, examine and 357  clarify the forensic challenges, and ultimately formulate and validate the capabilities required to 358  apply accepted forensic techniques and technologies to this unique computing environment. The 359  result is the Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture. 360  In as much as a security reference architecture is required to incorporate standards and 361  requirements that will inform system actualization and operation with respect to security, 362  applying the forensic reference architecture will likewise inform that system actualization and 363  operation with the capability to more effectively examine, understand, reconstruct, and remediate 364  the variety of system events and disruptions being experienced.  365  The goal of the CC FRA is to provide support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness. It is meant 366  to help the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s 367  cloud system. It identifies which forensic challenges require mitigation strategies and how a 368  forensic investigator would apply that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA 369  presented here will likely evolve over time with more use and research.  370  The Approach 371  The CC FRA builds on several foundational layers. We begin with the understanding that this 372  reference architecture addresses forensics in the context of a cloud computing environment. 373  Building upon the fundamental relationship between security, incident response, and forensics, 374  the CC FRA is designed as an overlay to NIST SP 500-299/SP 800-200, NIST Cloud Computing 375  Security Reference Architecture (Draft) [15]. This document discusses the Security Reference 376  Architecture (SRA) and leverages the CSA’s Enterprise Architecture (EA). Section 3 provides 377  descriptions of the CSA’s EA and its use in the SRA, while Section 4 elaborates on the overlay 378  approach employed for the CC FRA.  379  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  6  Figure 1 depicts the overlaying approach in which cloud functional capabilities comprising the 380  EA are analyzed using the NIST cloud computing forensic challenges to identify the functional 381  capabilities’ potential for supporting a cloud system’s forensic readiness.  382  383  384  Fig. 1. Forensic Reference Architecture Overlaying Approach 385  The bottom layer in  Figure 1 graphically represents the NIST cloud security reference 386  architecture (SRA). The middle layer represents the NIST cloud forensic challenges. The top 387  layer represents the NIST forensic reference architecture (FRA) described in the current 388  document as an overlay (subset) of the graphical representation of the CSA EA – more precisely, 389  the CSA TCI v1.1, which is the initial version of the CSA’s EA (see Appendix C). 390  In Figure 1, the FRA layer leverages the two layers graphically represented beneath it by 391  analyzing each capability of the SRA (these capabilities being derived from the CSA EA) in the 392  context of the challenges documented in NIST IR 8006 [1]. For each challenge, the analysis 393  determines whether the challenge affects the capability if implemented in a cloud environment as 394  part of a cloud service or solution. If the challenge affects the capability, then the functional 395  capability is considered to have forensic importance, and it is imported to or considered being a 396  capability of the FRA.  397  398  https://github.com/usnistgov/FRA/blob/main/docs/TCI-Reference-Architecture-v1.1.pdf  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  7  Overview of NIST Cloud Forensic Challenges 399  The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) was established to 400  research forensic science challenges and architectures related to the cloud environment. The 401  Working Group surveyed the literature and identified a set of challenges related to cloud 402  computing forensics. These challenges are presented in NIST IR 8006 [1], where each of 62 403  challenges is described along with potential results of overcoming each challenge. In addition, 404  the document provides a preliminary analysis of these challenges by including 1) the relationship 405  between each challenge and the five essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined in 406  the NIST cloud computing model [16]; 2) how the challenges correlate to cloud technology; and 407  3) nine categories to which the challenges belong. The analysis also considers logging data, data 408  in media, and issues associated with time, location, and sensitive data. In addition, the relevance 409  of topics such as rapid elasticity, multi-tenancy, and hypervisor/virtual machine layers is 410  discussed. These 62 challenges support the criminal justice and civil litigation systems, security 411  incident response, and internal enterprise operations. 412  The nine categories to which the challenges belong are reproduced below (from NIST IR 8006 413  [1], pp. 8-9): 414  1.

Dealing with variability in cloud architectures between providers  417  b. Tenant data compartmentalization and isolation during resource provisioning 418  c. Proliferation of systems, locations, and endpoints that can store data 419  d. Accurate and secure provenance for maintaining and preserving chain of custody 420  2.

Correlation of forensic artifacts across and within cloud providers  433  b. Reconstruction of events from virtual images or storage 434  c. Integrity of metadata 435  d. Timeline analysis of log data, including synchronization of timestamps 436  4. Anti-forensics (e.g., obfuscation, data hiding, malware). Anti-forensics are a set of 437  techniques used specifically to prevent or mislead forensic analysis. Anti-forensic challenges 438  in cloud forensics include:  439  a. The use of obfuscation, malware, data hiding, or other techniques to compromise the 440  integrity of evidence 441  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  8  b. Malware may circumvent virtual machine isolation methods 442  5. Incident first responders (e.g., trustworthiness of cloud providers, response time, 443  reconstruction). Incident first responder challenges in cloud forensics include:  444  a. Confidence, competence, and trustworthiness of the cloud providers to act as first 445  responders and perform data collection 446  b. Difficulty in performing initial triage 447  c. Processing a large volume of collected forensic artifacts  448  6. Role management (e.g., data owners, identity management, users, access control). Role 449  management challenges in cloud forensics include: 450  a. Uniquely identifying the owner of an account 451  b. Decoupling between cloud user credentials and physical users  452  c. Ease of anonymity and creating fictitious identities online 453  d. Determining exact ownership of data 454  e. Authentication and access control 455  7. Legal (e.g., jurisdictions, laws, service level agreements, contracts, subpoenas, international 456  cooperation, privacy, ethics). Legal challenges in cloud forensics include:  457  a. Identifying and addressing issues of jurisdictions for legal access to data  458  b. Lack of effective channels for international communication and cooperation during an 459  investigation  460  c. Data acquisition that relies on the cooperation, competence, and trustworthiness of 461  cloud providers  462  d. Missing terms in contracts and service-level agreements 463  e. Issuing subpoenas without knowledge of the physical location of data 464  8. Standards (e.g., standard operating procedures, interoperability, testing, validation). 465  Standards challenges in cloud forensics include:  466  a. Lack of minimum/basic SOPs, practices, and tools 467  b. Lack of interoperability among cloud providers  468  c. Lack of test and validation procedures 469  9. Training (e.g., forensic investigators, cloud providers, qualification, certification). Training 470  challenges in cloud forensics include:  471  a. Misuse of digital forensic training materials that are not applicable to cloud forensics 472  b. Lack of cloud forensic training and expertise for both investigators and instructors 473  c. Limited knowledge about evidence by record-keeping personnel in cloud providers 474  475  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  9  Overview of CSA’s Enterprise Architecture 476  The Cloud Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture (CSA’s EA) [2] is both a methodology 477  and a set of tools that enable security architects, enterprise architects, and risk management 478  professionals to leverage a common set of solutions and controls. These solutions and controls 479  fulfill common requirements that risk managers must assess regarding the operational status of 480  internal IT security and cloud provider controls. These controls are expressed in terms of security 481  capabilities and designed to create a common roadmap to meet the security needs of businesses. 482  CSA designed the EA understanding that business requirements must guide the architecture. In 483  the case of the Enterprise Architecture, these requirements come from a controls matrix partly 484  driven by regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley [17] and Gramm-Leach-Bliley [18], standards 485  frameworks such as ISO-27002 [7], the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards [19], 486  and the IT Audit Frameworks such as COBIT [20], all in the context of cloud service delivery 487  models such as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a 488  service (IaaS). 489  From these requirements, a set of security capabilities have been defined and organized 490  according to the following best practice architecture frameworks. The Sherwood Applied 491  Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12] defines a security model from a business 492  perspective. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] specifies the schema 493  needed to manage a company’s IT services, including the security guidelines to manage those 494  services securely. The Jericho Forum [21] designates technical security specifications that arise 495  from the reality of traditional technology environments in the data center and shift to one where 496  solutions span the internet across multiple data centers, some owned by the business and some 497  purely used as outsourced services. Lastly, The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) 498  [13] provides an enterprise architecture framework and methodology for planning, designing, 499  and governing information architectures, concluding in a common framework to integrate the 500  work of the security architect with the enterprise architecture of an organization. 501  The CSA EA is reproduced in Appendix C, and the domains covered are:  502  1. Business Operation Support Services (BOSS) – These functional capabilities are 503  associated with cloud IT services that support an organization’s business needs. BOSS 504  embodies the direction of the business and objectives of the cloud consumer. BOSS 505  capabilities cover compliance, data governance, operational risk management, human 506  resources security, security monitoring, internal investigations, and legal services.  507  2. Information Technology Operation and Support (ITOS) – These functional capabilities 508  are associated with managing the cloud IT services of an organization. ITOS capabilities 509  cover IT operation, service delivery, and service support. 510  3. Security and Risk Management (S&RM) – These functional capabilities are associated 511  with safeguarding cloud IT assets and detecting, assessing, and monitoring cloud IT risks. 512  S&RM capabilities cover identity and access management, GRC (governance, risk 513  management, and compliance), policies and standards, threat and vulnerability 514  management, and infrastructure and data protection. 515  4. Presentation Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the end user 516  interacting with a cloud IT solution. The capabilities cover presentation modalities and 517  presentation platforms (including end points, handwriting, and speech recognition). 518  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  10  5. Application Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the development 519  and use of cloud applications provided by an organization. The capabilities cover 520  programming interfaces, security knowledge life cycle, development processes, 521  integration middleware, connectivity and delivery, and abstraction.  522  6. Information Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the storage and 523  use of cloud information and data. The capabilities cover service delivery, service 524  support, reporting services, information technology operation and support, business 525  operations and support, data governance, user directory services, risk management, and 526  security monitoring.  527  7. Infrastructure Services – These functional capabilities are associated with core functions 528  that support the cloud IT infrastructure. The capabilities cover facilities, hardware, 529  networks, and virtual environments.  530  Together, there are 347 functional capabilities within these domains. 531  As mentioned above, the CSA’s EA functional capabilities are leveraged by the NIST Cloud 532  Security Reference Architecture (SRA) [15], which is comprised of a formal model designed as a 533  security overlay to the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture [22] and a methodology 534  for architecting and orchestrating a cloud-based solution. The methodology allows cloud 535  architects to identify the system’s functional capabilities. The orchestration employs a risk-based 536  approach that follows the Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] applied to cloud-based 537  systems.  538  The SRA’s risk-based approach for determining a cloud actor’s responsibilities for implementing 539  specific system components supports a clear delineation between the security responsibilities of 540  cloud providers and consumers and a clear understanding of the customer responsibility matrix. 541  Specifically, for each cloud service model, system components are analyzed to identify the level 542  of involvement of each cloud actor when implementing those components. 543  544  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  11  The Forensic Reference Architecture Methodology 545  The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture introduced in this document aims to help 546  the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud 547  systems. When architecting or orchestrating a new cloud system, cloud architects and cloud 548  security and forensic practitioners are encouraged to use the CC FRA to identify which 549  challenges could impact the system and therefore require at least partial mitigation strategies to 550  minimize the risk incurred during operations by, for example, allowing real-time interventions 551  based on the proactively generated forensic data and to eliminate potential negative impacts on 552  digital forensic investigations if the need arises. 553  While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed to 554  help the following target audiences by finding answers for specific questions related to their 555  cloud computing architectures: 556  • Target Audience #1: Cloud System Architects and Engineers. This target audience 557  might ask: “To what extent does the cloud system I’m designing facilitate the use of 558  digital forensics?” The architectural methodology and initial architecture presented in 559  this paper can help this audience identify where there could be potential challenges for 560  conducting forensics and can allow them to focus on areas of potential concern. System 561  trade-offs can be considered as well (e.g., the more that a system facilitates the use of 562  forensics, the greater the negative operational or economic impacts might be, or the 563  greater the chance that privacy might be impacted negatively). 564  • Target Audience #2: Forensic Practitioners. This target audience might ask: “What 565  items do I need to be aware of to conduct digital forensics in the cloud environment 566  versus a traditional or on-premises computing environment?” 567  • Target Audience #3: Consumers Who Want to Procure Cloud Services from Providers. 568  This target audience might ask: “What forensic questions and issues do I need to consider 569  when discussing what a cloud provider has to offer?” 570  The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture provides a useful starting point for all 571  cloud security and forensic stakeholders to analyze the extent to which the cloud forensic 572  challenges identified in NIST IR 8006 [1] are impacting their systems.  573  The 62 forensic challenges and 347 functional capabilities described in Section 2 and Section 3, 574  respectively, provide the basis for determining which capabilities are affected by each of the 575  challenges. All possible pairs of challenges and capabilities are considered. The capabilities help 576  focus possible mitigation efforts as follows. If a challenge affects a capability, there may be 577  mitigation approaches that can be used to perform better forensics with regard to that capability. 578  Such information could prove useful for forensic practitioners, developers, and researchers.  579  The NCC FSWG has developed a mapping between functional capabilities and forensic 580  challenges. For each functional capability, the mapping shows all of the forensic challenges that 581  affect that capability. This has resulted in a Mapping Table of 347 rows (one for each capability) 582  and 62 columns (one for each challenge). An entry in the table is YES if the associated challenge 583  affects the associated capability; otherwise, the entry is NO. (See Figure 3 for an excerpt of this 584  table.) 585  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  12  When the question is asked: does a forensic challenge affect a functional capability, it is defined 586  to mean: if the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic 587  investigation on the considered functional capability? This is the relationship that the mapping 588  between challenges and capabilities is attempting to capture.  589  To help answer this question, the NCC FSWG developed a summary for each of the 62 challenges. 590  This summary answers the following question for each specific challenge: What advantages would 591  be provided to a forensic investigator if this challenge were overcome (or mitigated)? If these 592  advantages imply that the quality of forensics that can be performed on the functional capability 593  could be improved, then the answer is YES, overcoming the challenge could make it easier to 594  perform a forensic investigation on the capability. The summaries for the 62 challenges are found 595  in NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 1. 596  The goal was to provide a narrow, precise mapping between challenges and capabilities. A 597  flowchart was developed that was followed to achieve this mapping, as shown in Fig. 2. 598  599  600  Fig. 2. Mapping Flowchart 601  The flowchart provides users with a uniform method for determining the applicability of a 602  challenge to a particular capability. In conducting the analysis, the NCC FSWG placed each 603  cloud forensic challenge into one of two groups: 1) challenges that are primarily technical in 604  nature (e.g., architecture), or 2) challenges that are primarily non-technical in nature (e.g., legal). 605  This led to the creation of questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d in the flowchart, which perform 606  the placement into the two groups. If a challenge deals primarily with standards, legal issues, 607  contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, 608  qualifications, or certifications, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is 609  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  13  considered technical. This grouping provides a simple and straightforward method for analyzing 610  the high-level characteristics of each challenge.  611  Similarly, the NCC FSWG placed each of the cloud functional capabilities into one of two 612  groups: 1) primarily technical or 2) primarily non-technical in nature. If a capability deals 613  primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, 614  privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification, then the capability is considered 615  non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical. This led to the creation of questions Q3-a 616  and Q3-b. 617  The flowchart attempts to map challenges that are primarily technical only to capabilities that are 618  primarily technical and challenges that are primarily non-technical only to capabilities that are 619  primarily non-technical. This results in a precise and limited mapping. If a challenge and a 620  capability pair are assigned to the same group, the questioned is asked whether overcoming the 621  challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability. The answer determines whether 622  the capability is affected by the challenge. In summary, if the appropriate grouping is done and 623  overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered 624  to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES; otherwise, the mapping is NO). 625  There can, of course, be challenges in one group that affect capabilities in another group, but that 626  does not provide the precise, limited mapping. In such cases, the mapping is considered to be 627  NO. 628  The following is an example of what is meant by a precise, limited mapping. Suppose the 629  challenge deals with training (e.g., Challenge FC-65: There is a lack of training materials that 630  educate investigators on cloud computing technology and cloud forensic operating policies and 631  procedures; see [1], page 52). This is a non-technical challenge. In addition, suppose the 632  capability under consideration is technical. Enhanced training would clearly provide significant 633  benefit to forensic investigators and cloud providers because training is so broadly applicable 634  and would help to perform forensics more easily on most capabilities. However, a cloud forensic 635  architecture in which training affects almost every capability is undesirable because then the 636  architecture applies too broadly; most of the capabilities are not affected by this challenge in an 637  important way. This makes the architecture less useful because the architecture will have many 638  challenges that affect too many capabilities. Rather than this broad mapping of challenges to 639  capabilities, a narrower mapping is preferred. Narrowing the number of capabilities affected by 640  the challenge allows the mapping to be more powerful because the challenge can be used as an 641  effective tool of identifying the capabilities that are more likely to be affected by the challenge in 642  an important way. The architecture with a narrower mapping is also more practical because the 643  fewer YESs in the mappings, the easier for an investigator to apply the mappings in real-world 644  scenarios. 645  As described above and shown in Figure 2, if both the challenge and the capability being 646  evaluated deal with the same type of issue (i.e., technical or non-technical), then the following 647  question is asked: “If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud 648  forensic investigation on the functional capability?”  If the answer is “yes,” then the mapping is 649  YES.  650  However, if the challenge is primarily technical in nature and the capability is non-technical in 651  nature (or vice versa), then an analysis is conducted to determine whether the use of technical or 652  non-technical solutions to implement the capability would significantly enhance the ability of a 653  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  14  forensic investigator to overcome the challenge, as illustrated in questions Q2-c and Q2-d. If the 654  answer to this question is “no,” then no further analysis is required. If the answer to question Q2-655  c or Q2-d is “yes,” then the analysis will continue to determine: “If the challenge were overcome, 656  would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability?” 657  Using this methodology, it is possible to determine in a well-defined, structured fashion whether 658  it would be easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on a functional capability if the 659  forensic challenge were overcome. As a result, the flowchart will help cloud designers, forensic 660  investigators, and other interested parties focus specifically on those functional capabilities that 661  are affected by a specific cloud forensic challenge. 662  The process of traversing the flowchart involves asking questions about the particular challenge 663  and capability pair that is being analyzed. Starting at the top right of the flowchart (labeled “Q2-664  a”), each box asks a question about the challenge or the capability. The answer to each question 665  – YES or NO – then leads to either another box with a question or to one of the circles shown in 666  Table 1. 667  668  Table 1. The meaning of the circles within the flowchart of Fig. 2 669  When following the logical flowchart and answering the guiding  questions, if the final answer is a YES marked with a green circle, then  the challenge DOES affect the capability.  When following the logical flowchart and answering the guiding  questions, if the final answer is a NO marked with an orange circle, then  the challenge DOES NOT affect the capability.  When following the logical flowchart and answering the guiding  questions, if the final answer is a NO marked with a purple circle, then the  challenge DOES NOT affect the capability for reasons explained in  NOTE 1 and NOTE 2, below.  670  To determine whether the forensic challenge affects the functional capability, three fundamental 671  types of questions are asked: 672  1. Question 1 (Q1) – If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a 673  cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability? Note that the term “cloud 674  forensic investigation” means the identification, acquisition, preservation, examination, 675  interpretation, and reporting of potential digital evidence in the cloud. When analyzing 676  Question 1, it is narrowly considered only with regard to the particular functional 677  capability, ignoring all other capabilities as if they do not exist. So, the question really 678  asked is: If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud 679  forensic investigation on this functional capability only while ignoring other capabilities? 680  2. Question 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d) – These questions relate only to the challenges 681  and not capabilities. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the challenge 682  deals with technical or non-technical issues and if either technical solutions or non-683  technical solutions significantly amplify the ability to overcome the challenge. 684  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  15  3. Question 3 (Q3-a and Q3-b) – These questions relate only to the capabilities and not the 685  challenges. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the capability deals 686  primarily with technical or non-technical issues.  687  Questions 2 and 3 ask about the issues that a challenge or capability deals with, which are 688  determined as follows. As discussed in Section 2, the NCC FSWG labeled each of the 62 689  challenges according to the following nine categories: architecture, data collection, analysis, anti-690  forensics, incident first responders, role management, legal, standards, and training. The labels 691  for each challenge may be found in [1], Annex A, Table 2, in the columns labeled “Primary 692  Category” and “Related Category.” These categories and the challenge descriptions are used to 693  determine the type of issue each challenge deals with. If the primary issues are standards, legal 694  issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, 695  qualification, or certification, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is 696  considered technical.  697  Similarly, if a capability deals primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service level 698  agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification, 699  then the capability is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical. 700  The NCC FSWG developed consensus answers for all of the questions related to Question 2 and 701  Question 3 in the flowchart. Therefore, when a particular challenge and capability pair was 702  considered, all questions – except for Question 1 – were already answered. This resulted in much 703  more consistent mappings across all challenges and capabilities. 704  When traversing the flowchart starting at the box labeled “Q2-a,” if a NO node is not reached, 705  then the box labeled “Q1” is eventually reached. For any challenge and capability pair, it may lie 706  in one of two groups when Q1 is reached (see Figure 2). As discussed above, Group 1 is the 707  “Technical Group,” and Group 2 is the “Non-technical Group.” They are defined as follows: 708  • Group 1 (Technical Group) –  709  [The challenge is technical, OR the  challenge is non-technical but requires  technology (at least partially) to overcome  the challenge.]  AND  [The functional capability is technical.]  710  • Group 2 (Non-Technical Group) –  711  712  [The challenge is non-technical, OR the  challenge is technical but requires non- technical solutions (at least partially) to  overcome the challenge.]  AND  [The functional capability is non- technical.]  713  The reason for these groups – to map technical challenges to technical capabilities and non-714  technical challenges to non-technical capabilities – was explained above. Once a challenge and 715  capability pair is assigned to the appropriate group, the question of whether overcoming the 716  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  16  challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability is asked. This determines 717  whether the capability is affected by the challenge. If the grouping is appropriate and 718  overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered 719  to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES). 720  However, suppose a challenge is non-technical but requires technology to overcome the 721  challenge. Examples of non-technical challenges that have both non-technical and technical 722  solutions include the following ([1], Annex A): 723  • FC-56 (Confidentially and PII) deals with legal/privacy issues (a non-technical 724  challenge). Privacy issues can be resolved with a combination of legal steps (e.g., 725  legislation) and technology steps (privacy-enhancing technologies). 726  • FC-64 and FC-65 deal with training (non-technical challenges). Training issues can be 727  resolved with better and more widely available training classes, but they can also be 728  resolved with better technology to perform the training. 729  There are non-technical challenges that require solutions that are non-technical, technical, or a 730  combination of both. If the non-technical challenge requires only a non-technical solution (and 731  the capability is non-technical), it is in Group 2. If it requires only a technical solution (and the 732  capability is technical), it is in Group 1. If it requires both, then it is in Group 1 or Group 2, 733  depending on whether the capability is technical or non-technical. 734  When a challenge is technical but requires a non-technical solution to overcome the challenge 735  (and the capability is non-technical), then this challenge is in Group 2. 736  In Fig. 2, the two purple circles refer to two notes, as follows: 737  • NOTE 1: When this circle is reached, the challenge does not fit in either of the two 738  groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. Fortunately, none of the challenges reach 739  this node as none have this property. This node is included simply for logical 740  completeness of the flowchart, so that every node has both a YES exit path and a NO exit 741  path.  742  • NOTE 2: When this circle is reached, the capability does not fit in either of the two 743  groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. There are a few capabilities that reach 744  this node. However, these capabilities do not deal with issues directly related to digital 745  forensics for cloud computing. Instead, they involve controlling physical access to 746  facilities (e.g., using barriers, security patrols, checking physical ID cards, etc.). They 747  also involve mitigating physical threats to facilities, such as installing fire suppression 748  equipment.  749  The process described in this section, which is employed for the analysis of any pair consisting 750  of a cloud functional capability and a cloud forensic challenge, represents a core component of 751  the CC FRA – the methodology – and can be applied to any set of capability-challenge pairs, 752  either modified from the sets used in this document or adapted from a different architectural 753  framework or empirical data. 754  755  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  17  The Forensic Reference Architecture Data 756  The data that supplements the CC FRA methodology described in Section 4 represents the result 757  of an analysis performed by the NCC FSWG members. The methodology was applied to all 758  possible pairings of cloud forensic challenges (62 total challenges) with cloud functional 759  capabilities (347 capabilities). In total, 21,514 challenge-capability pairings were evaluated using 760  the flowchart in Figure 1.  761  All users of CC FRA data are encouraged to use the data as an initial implementation of the 762  methodology but use their own judgment when employing the CC FRA methodology in the 763  context of their cloud systems and modify or customize NIST’s initial dataset for their specific 764  situations and needs.  765  For example, if the existing capabilities are not appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all 766  can be removed, and new ones can be added. Similarly, new challenges appropriate for the user’s 767  situation can be added, or those challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed. 768  This architectural methodology has the advantage of helping to focus on how challenges can be 769  mitigated because it considers each challenge specifically in the context of affected capabilities. 770  The results of the NCC FSWG’s analysis are summarized in a Mapping Table (MT). An entry in 771  the MT is YES if the associated challenge was identified as affecting the paired capability. 772  Otherwise, the entry is NO.  773  The CC FRA data set provides all interested parties with the responses for every challenge-774  capability pairing based on the analysis performed by the authors and collaborators of this 775  document. A sample excerpt of the table is displayed in Figure 3. The full CC FRA Mapping 776  Table is available for download (see Appendix D for a partial image and a link for downloading 777  the data). 778  The CC FRA data has 62 cloud forensic challenges obtained from NISTIR 8006 [1]. In the CC 779  FRA Mapping Table, each cloud forensic challenge is shown across the top row (i.e., Forensic 780  Challenge 1 [FC01], Forensic Challenge 2 [FC02], etc.). In Figure 3, only FC01-FC09 and 781  FC58-FC65 are shown, and the rest of the challenges are hidden for the sake of readability in the 782  figure. See Appendix D for the full Mapping Table.  783  The CC FRA data has 347 cloud functional capabilities. In the CC FRA Mapping Table, each 784  cloud functional capability is listed on the left column labeled “CAPABILITY” (see Figure 3). 785  The CC FRA data set preserves the grouping of the cloud functional capabilities provided by the 786  CSA EA [2] into “CONTAINERS” and “DOMAINS.”  787  In Figure 3, the first nine capabilities are shown, as are the last nine; the rest are hidden. Each 788  row, therefore, represents a separate capability and includes the following information: the 789  domain of the capability (all of the domains are described in Section 3), the container (the 790  highest-level elements within the architectural diagram in Appendix D1), the name of the 791  capability, and a description of the capability (not shown in Figure 3 but shown in Appendix D).  792  1 The container is a high-level collection of capabilities consisting of related processes and procedures within the domain.  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  18  793  Fig. 3. Excerpt of the Forensic Reference Architecture (Challenges vs. Capabilities Mapping Table). 794  The entry in the table that corresponds to a specific row and column (i.e., a specific challenge-795  capability pair) is either YES or NO based on the result of traversing the mapping flowchart in 796  Figure 2. Traversing the flowchart requires answers to Questions 1 (Q1), 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, 797  Q2-d), and 3 (Q3-a, Q3-b). As described in Section 4, Q1 must be answered for each individual 798  challenge-capability pair that reaches Q1 when the flowchart is traversed. However, Questions 2 799  and 3, which relate only to challenges and capabilities separately, can be answered ahead of time, 800  and consensus answers were developed for these by the NCC FSWG. These answers are shown 801  in the table in Figure 3. The second row in the table has the answers for Q2-a, the third row for 802  Q2-b, the fourth row for Q-2c, and the fifth row for Q2-d. The fifth column in the table has the 803  answers for Q3-a and the sixth column for Q3-b. 804  Each entry in the table is color-coded as follows: 805  • Orange – A NO is obtained before reaching question Q1 in the flowchart. These entries 806  can be filled in automatically once the answers to questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, Q2-d, Q3-807  a, and Q3-b are entered. 808  • Red – A NO is obtained as a result of answering Q1. 809  • Green – A YES is obtained as a result of answering Q1. 810  Analysis of the correlation between the forensic science challenges and the functional 811  capabilities constitutes the foundation for achieving consistent and repeatable answers to the 812  FC 01  FC 02  FC 03  FC 04  FC 05  FC 06  FC 07  FC 08  FC 09  ...H ID  DE N…  FC 58  FC 59  FC 60  FC 61  FC 62  FC 63  FC 64  FC 65  2a No No Ye s  No No Ye s  No No Ye s  Ye s  No Ye s  No Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Components descriptions also available on CSA's inte  2b Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  https://research.cloudsecurityalliance.org/tci/ 2c Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  No Ye s  No Ye s  No  In de  x DOMAIN CONTAINER CAPABILITY  (process or solution) 3a  \\  3b \\  2d  \\  No No No No No No Ye s  Ye s  4 BOSS Compliance Intellectual Property  P t ti  Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO YES YES YES NO NO NO NO NO  5 BOSS Data Handling/ Labeling/  Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO YES YES YES NO NO NO YES YES  6 BOSS Data Clear Desk Policy Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  7 BOSS Data Rules for Information  No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  8 BOSS Human  Employee Awareness No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  9 BOSS Security  Market Threat No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  10 BOSS Security  Knowledge Base No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  11 BOSS Compliance Audit Planning Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO YES YES YES NO NO NO NO NO  12 BOSS Compliance Internal Audits No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO YES YES NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  …HIDDEN… 342 S & RM Infrastructure  Network No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES Yes NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  343 S & RM Data Protection Data Lifecycle No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  344 S & RM Cryptographic Signature Services No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  345 S & RM Governance  IT Risk Management Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* YES NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  346 S & RM InfoSec Risk Portfolio Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* YES NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  347 S & RM Privilege  Authorization Services No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  348 S & RM Privilege  Authorization Services No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  349 S & RM Policies and Information Security Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* YES NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  350 S & RM Privilege  Privilege Usage No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  19  questions identified in the CC FRA methodology. Each challenge is further categorized based on 813  its overall impact on cloud functional capabilities. This categorization is focused on the overall 814  number of affected capabilities, identifying if only a limited set of capabilities is impacted versus 815  most capabilities composing the cloud ecosystem being impacted. The term impact is used to 816  indicate how broadly or narrowly a challenge affects the set of functional capabilities. Therefore, 817  the impact of each challenge was categorized along a generic-to-specific scale as follows (see 818  NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 2, column 4):  819  • Generic (G) – A challenge is labeled generic if it affects most of the capabilities.  820  • Specific (S) – A challenge is labeled specific if it affects a limited set of capabilities.  821  • Quasi (Q) – A challenge is labeled quasi if it falls somewhere between generic and 822  specific.  823  A specific challenge applies narrowly and affects only a limited number of capabilities, while a 824  generic challenge affects a broad set of capabilities. The specific challenge affects a capability in 825  a direct manner that is determined by the particular issues addressed by the capability. This 826  results in the capability being affected in an important and profound way. On the other hand, 827  because the generic challenge affects most of the capabilities, the affect is not tied closely to the 828  issues addressed in each capability, and the capabilities are affected in a much less important and 829  profound way. (See Section 4 in which the “precise, limited mapping” is explained.) Thus, a 830  specific challenge is more impactful overall than a generic one when it comes to conducting a 831  cloud forensic investigation. The generic-to-specific label of each challenge is also part of the 832  Forensic Reference Architecture, as shown in Appendix D. The NCC FSWG developed 833  consensus labels for all of the challenges [1]. 834  835  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  20  Conclusion 836  This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA) 837  comprised of: 838  a) A methodology for analyzing the functional capabilities of an existing architecture – 839  preferably a security architecture like the Cloud Security Alliance’s (CSA’s) Enterprise 840  Architecture (EA) [2] – through a set of cloud forensic challenges, such as the set 841  identified in NIST IR 8006 [1] 842  b) A data set that aggregates the results of the above methodology applied to the CSA’s EA 843  [2] and the NIST IR 8006 [1] set of cloud forensic challenges 844  The goal of the FRA is to enable the analysis of cloud systems to determine the extent to which a 845  system proactively supports digital forensics. More precisely, the FRA is meant to help users 846  understand how the previously identified cloud forensic challenges might impact an 847  organization’s cloud-based system. When developing a new system or analyzing an existing one, 848  the FRA helps identify those cloud forensic challenges that could affect the system’s capabilities 849  and, therefore, require at least partial mitigation strategies to support a complete forensic 850  investigation. The FRA also identifies how a forensic investigator would apply the mitigation 851  strategies to a particular investigation. While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing 852  practitioner, it is specifically designed to enable cloud system architects, cloud engineers, 853  forensic practitioners, and even cloud consumers to analyze and review their cloud computing 854  architectures for forensic readiness.  855  The FRA data provided in this document offers an initial implementation of the FRA 856  methodology and a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze how the 857  NIST cloud forensic challenges presented in NIST IR 8006 [1] affect each functional capability 858  present in the CSA’s EA [2].  859  All users are encouraged to customize this initial implementation (shown in Appendix D) for 860  their specific situations and needs. For example, if the existing functional capabilities are not 861  appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all can be removed, and new ones can be added. 862  Similarly, new forensic challenges appropriate for the user’s situation can be added, and 863  challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed. The FRA methodology 864  promotes analysis of how cloud forensic challenges affect particular functional capabilities and 865  helps determine whether mitigations are necessary to ensure forensic readiness related to the 866  respective capability. This means that users can replace all cloud forensics challenges or 867  functional capabilities used in the current FRA data set with their own. 868  The FRA presented here will likely evolve over time, and methods for quantifying impact will be 869  developed to enhance FRA usability. 870  871  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  21  References 872  [1] Herman M, Iorga M, Salim AS, Jackson R, Hurst M, Leo R, Lee R, Landreville N, 873  Mishra AK, Wang Y, Sardinas R (2020).

New methodologies are required for the identification, acquisition, preservation, 196  examination, and interpretation of digital evidence in multi-tenant cloud environments that offer 197  rapid provisioning, global elasticity, and broad network accessibility. This is necessary to 198  provide capabilities for incident response, secure internal enterprise operations, and support for 199  the U.S. criminal justice and civil litigation systems.  200  This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA, 201  also referred to as FRA for the sake of brevity), whose goal is to provide support for a cloud 202  system’s forensic readiness. The CC FRA is meant to help users understand the cloud forensic 203  challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud system. It identifies forensic challenges 204  that require mitigation strategies and how a forensic investigator would apply that to a particular 205  forensic investigation.  206  The CC FRA provides a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze the 207  impacts of cloud forensic challenges previously reported by NIST. It does so by considering each 208  cloud forensic challenge in the context of each functional capability presented in the Cloud 209  Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture. 210  While the CC FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed 211  to allow cloud system architects, cloud engineers, forensic practitioners, and cloud consumers to 212  ask specific questions related to their cloud computing architectures. The CC FRA is both a 213  methodology and an initial implementation, and users are encouraged to customize this initial 214  implementation for their specific situations and needs. 215  216  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  2  Introduction 217  The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) previously 218  published NIST IR 8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges [1], which was 219  the result of collaboration between volunteers from the private and public sector. That document 220  highlighted digital forensic challenges triggered by the specific characteristics and business 221  model of public cloud computing services. 222  The approach to examining digital forensics in the cloud was to first understand cloud computing 223  technology and to identify and elucidate its essential and unique characteristics, which play a 224  significant part in three aspects of operation: normal operations, adverse operations when cloud 225  computing resources are under attack, and operations during criminal exploitation. 226  The second phase of this approach was a close examination of the challenges that were identified 227  in the previous NIST report. This examination involved analyzing the Cloud Security Alliance’s 228  (CSA’s) Enterprise Architecture (EA) [2], its various functional capabilities and processes, and 229  the potential impact of each challenge on performing a forensic investigation if a specific 230  functional capability or process were involved in an attack and breach or were used during 231  criminal exploitation. The analysis presumed fictive use case scenarios that would exploit 232  potential weaknesses, vulnerabilities, exposures, or cloud technology for criminal activities. Such 233  elements are of fundamental concern in forensic analysis as they present points that adversaries 234  may seek to exploit or characteristics that can be used by criminals. In either case, there will be 235  evidence of the attack or criminal exploitation for future forensic analysis. The EA is composed 236  of a large number of specific functional capabilities that enable detailed consideration of the 237  effects of each forensic challenge on each of the capabilities.  238  The third phase of this work has been to examine the nature of each challenge (i.e., whether the 239  challenge is technological or non-technological) to determine its role and impact on the forensic 240  examination process. As each challenge was analyzed, the applicability of techniques or 241  technologies became clearer in terms of how they function and ultimately contribute to the 242  forensic processes of identification, acquisition, preservation, examination, and interpretation of 243  evidence.  244  This work brings value by clarifying how forensics in the cloud can achieve the same acceptance 245  as forensics in traditional computing models. This document, the associated research, and NIST 246  IR 8006 [1] proactively address the White House Executive Order of May 12, 2021, entitled 247  Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity [3], which points out the importance 248  of having forensic-ready information systems, including cloud systems, to improve the Nation’s 249  cybersecurity. 250  The Need for a Cloud-specific Forensic Reference Architecture 251  Digital forensics is the application of science and technology to the discovery and examination of 252  digital artifacts within information systems and networks to establish facts and evidence 253  concerning events and conditions that occur within them. Digital forensics is traditionally used 254  for judicial proceedings and regulatory issues but may also be used for other purposes as 255  described below.  256  Digital forensics continues to evolve in step with computer and information science. As these 257  technologies, their implementations, and their operations have changed, digital forensics has 258  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  3  adapted. The number of scenarios that may require the application of digital forensic techniques 259  have increased along with the complexity of the underlying architectures . 260  One common scenario involves the detailed investigation of criminal activities. As computers 261  become widely available and develop greater capabilities, criminal elements worldwide have 262  adopted them as tools to manage their endeavors. These include both “traditional” forms of 263  crime (e.g., violent crime, property crime, drug trafficking, human trafficking, white-collar 264  crime) and crimes that occur in cyberspace (e.g., ransomware attacks, data breaches, identity 265  theft, cyber-terrorism, distributed denial of service, illicit cryptocurrency mining, child 266  pornography, and attacks against governments, key corporations, or power grids). Forensic 267  procedures involve locating and analyzing digital traces that can help solve the crime and/or 268  allow for incident response. 269  Forensic procedures are also used to investigate civil actions, such as divorce proceedings, asset 270  discovery, insurance claims, lawsuits, and similar cases that often require forensic methods to 271  determine the presence, absence, and movement of data and funds. 272  An example of how forensic techniques are used involves the collection of a laptop computer 273  while apprehending a presumed perpetrator of an illegal act. The suspected act could involve – 274  for instance –financial exploitation of stolen identities, hacking into a hospital’s records 275  management system to implant ransomware, electronic entry of a corporate system in attempted 276  commercial espionage, or penetrating a government or military computer. Similarly, civil actions 277  can require forensic examination, such as discovering financial assets for a divorce proceeding.  278  In each of these cases, forensics plays an essential role in determining facts; assisting in the 279  analysis, validation, and authentication of data; and enabling documentation of findings to 280  present to a court and attorneys. 281  The application of forensic methods may also be required for normal business operations. For 282  example, forensic methods may be employed to recover data that, at first, appears to be lost or 283  destroyed on computer drives. During incident response, additional goals of using forensic 284  methods may include mitigating future cyberattacks, preventing system failure, or minimizing 285  data loss.  286  In the commercial context, the use of forensics in incident response can help determine the root 287  cause of an outage event, such as a component failure, corrupted software, or intentional 288  sabotage. Other scenarios may involve close examination of system configurations, potentially 289  questionable employee data storage and activities, and operational aspects related to compliance 290  matters. In any of these cases, forensic methods may supply insights that are not available 291  through any other means.  292  For decades, information processing systems have enabled the storage, processing, and 293  transmission of information for public and private organizations and individuals. The 294  maintenance, operations, and protection of these information systems have become paramount 295  concerns since a disruption of sufficient magnitude or specific type could threaten business 296  activities. In addition, the use of these systems in support of criminal activities has been of major 297  concern.  298  Industry and government have an array of authoritative sources that guide the design, 299  engineering, and operations of information systems. Each of the frameworks listed below can 300  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  4  provide core support for the design, implementation, assessment, monitoring, and operations of 301  information systems: 302  • NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] – A focused guide to information system 303  risk management 304  • ISO 27000 Series [5] – A series of standards dealing with a wide range of information 305  security topics, such as: 306  o ISO/IEC 27001 [6] – Information Security Management 307  o ISO/IEC 27002 [7] – Information Security Controls 308  o ISO/IEC 27018 [8] – Security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the 309  Cloud 310  o ISO/IEC 27035 [9] – Incident Response 311  o ISO/IEC 27037 [10] – Digital Evidence Collection and Preservation 312  • IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] – A service-oriented architecture (SOA) 313  • Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12] 314  • The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) [13] – A general security 315  framework 316  • Cloud Security Alliance STAR program [14]  – A progressive security certification 317  The focus of each of these frameworks varies but generally facilitates architecting, 318  implementing, and operating secure and resilient information systems. The RMF is focused on 319  security from a risk identification and management perspective. As varied as the ISO 27000 320  series [5] is, it contains standards that address digital evidence and incident response. 321  Interestingly, however, there is not a readily apparent, in-depth exploration of cloud-system 322  forensics.  323  The endeavor presented here deals with the matter of forensics performed within a cloud 324  computing environment. The advent of cloud computing has simplified business operations and 325  introduced a level of business agility not previously experienced with traditional or on-premises 326  computing. However, cloud computing has also introduced a range of security and forensics 327  challenges. Enhanced capabilities enjoyed by legitimate businesses and friendly governments are 328  often equally available to opposing nation-states, terrorist groups, and international criminal 329  elements and assets. As a result, targets that were once unassailable by nefarious actors may now 330  be vulnerable to attack or exploitation.  331  To a great extent, cloud computing runs on virtualization – that is, the creation of processing 332  resources that have hardware as their basis but run as multiplexed programs and are thus 333  functionally multiplied through it. Cloud forensics involves performing analysis on “virtual 334  machines” using techniques that rely on having “real machines” on which to work. In addition, 335  there is the issue of the information obtained. If the “machine” is essentially “unreal,” what does 336  that say about any evidence derived from it? This evidence is therefore different from traditional 337  digital evidence.  338  Cloud computing has become increasingly pervasive as more entities discover its advantages. 339  These entities include legitimate businesses, governments, and individuals who use SaaS cloud 340  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  5  platforms, as well as criminal and terrorist organizations and opposing nation-states. For 341  legitimate consumers, cloud computing provides capabilities such as: 342  • More rapid business continuity and disaster recovery 343  • More effective incident response 344  • Improved information access, management, and archiving 345  • Easier and more immediate collaboration between widely separated individuals and groups 346  This research has adapted solutions that originated in the on-premises data center to the 347  significant differences presented by the cloud.  348  As important as they are for addressing significant events related to business operations (as 349  described above), forensic methods have at least equal importance when contributing to matters 350  of compliance, legality, and criminal exploitation. Careful treatment has been given to these 351  questions during this research to ensure that the findings do not merely consider technical aspects 352  but also address the broader aspects of their material application. Unquestionably, close 353  examination of these adverse events is required to understand their incipience and progression 354  and – in particular – to ensure that remediation, event reconstruction, and attribution are 355  effectively and credibly realized. 356  Thus, it has been the specific focus and goal of this effort to research these issues, examine and 357  clarify the forensic challenges, and ultimately formulate and validate the capabilities required to 358  apply accepted forensic techniques and technologies to this unique computing environment. The 359  result is the Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture. 360  In as much as a security reference architecture is required to incorporate standards and 361  requirements that will inform system actualization and operation with respect to security, 362  applying the forensic reference architecture will likewise inform that system actualization and 363  operation with the capability to more effectively examine, understand, reconstruct, and remediate 364  the variety of system events and disruptions being experienced.  365  The goal of the CC FRA is to provide support for a cloud system’s forensic readiness. It is meant 366  to help the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s 367  cloud system. It identifies which forensic challenges require mitigation strategies and how a 368  forensic investigator would apply that to a particular forensic investigation. The CC FRA 369  presented here will likely evolve over time with more use and research.  370  The Approach 371  The CC FRA builds on several foundational layers. We begin with the understanding that this 372  reference architecture addresses forensics in the context of a cloud computing environment. 373  Building upon the fundamental relationship between security, incident response, and forensics, 374  the CC FRA is designed as an overlay to NIST SP 500-299/SP 800-200, NIST Cloud Computing 375  Security Reference Architecture (Draft) [15]. This document discusses the Security Reference 376  Architecture (SRA) and leverages the CSA’s Enterprise Architecture (EA). Section 3 provides 377  descriptions of the CSA’s EA and its use in the SRA, while Section 4 elaborates on the overlay 378  approach employed for the CC FRA.  379  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  6  Figure 1 depicts the overlaying approach in which cloud functional capabilities comprising the 380  EA are analyzed using the NIST cloud computing forensic challenges to identify the functional 381  capabilities’ potential for supporting a cloud system’s forensic readiness.  382  383  384  Fig. 1. Forensic Reference Architecture Overlaying Approach 385  The bottom layer in  Figure 1 graphically represents the NIST cloud security reference 386  architecture (SRA). The middle layer represents the NIST cloud forensic challenges. The top 387  layer represents the NIST forensic reference architecture (FRA) described in the current 388  document as an overlay (subset) of the graphical representation of the CSA EA – more precisely, 389  the CSA TCI v1.1, which is the initial version of the CSA’s EA (see Appendix C). 390  In Figure 1, the FRA layer leverages the two layers graphically represented beneath it by 391  analyzing each capability of the SRA (these capabilities being derived from the CSA EA) in the 392  context of the challenges documented in NIST IR 8006 [1]. For each challenge, the analysis 393  determines whether the challenge affects the capability if implemented in a cloud environment as 394  part of a cloud service or solution. If the challenge affects the capability, then the functional 395  capability is considered to have forensic importance, and it is imported to or considered being a 396  capability of the FRA.  397  398  https://github.com/usnistgov/FRA/blob/main/docs/TCI-Reference-Architecture-v1.1.pdf  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  7  Overview of NIST Cloud Forensic Challenges 399  The NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Science Working Group (NCC FSWG) was established to 400  research forensic science challenges and architectures related to the cloud environment. The 401  Working Group surveyed the literature and identified a set of challenges related to cloud 402  computing forensics. These challenges are presented in NIST IR 8006 [1], where each of 62 403  challenges is described along with potential results of overcoming each challenge. In addition, 404  the document provides a preliminary analysis of these challenges by including 1) the relationship 405  between each challenge and the five essential characteristics of cloud computing, as defined in 406  the NIST cloud computing model [16]; 2) how the challenges correlate to cloud technology; and 407  3) nine categories to which the challenges belong. The analysis also considers logging data, data 408  in media, and issues associated with time, location, and sensitive data. In addition, the relevance 409  of topics such as rapid elasticity, multi-tenancy, and hypervisor/virtual machine layers is 410  discussed. These 62 challenges support the criminal justice and civil litigation systems, security 411  incident response, and internal enterprise operations. 412  The nine categories to which the challenges belong are reproduced below (from NIST IR 8006 413  [1], pp. 8-9): 414  1. Architecture (e.g., diversity, complexity, provenance, multi-tenancy, data segregation). 415  Architecture challenges in cloud forensics include: 416  a. Dealing with variability in cloud architectures between providers  417  b. Tenant data compartmentalization and isolation during resource provisioning 418  c. Proliferation of systems, locations, and endpoints that can store data 419  d. Accurate and secure provenance for maintaining and preserving chain of custody 420  2. Data collection (e.g., data integrity, data recovery, data location, imaging). Data collection 421  challenges in cloud forensics include:  422  a. Locating forensic artifacts in large, distributed, and dynamic systems 423  b. Locating and collecting volatile data 424  c. Data collection from virtual machines 425  d. Data integrity in a multi-tenant environment where data is shared among multiple 426  computers in multiple locations and accessible by multiple parties 427  e. Inability to image all of the forensic artifacts in the cloud 428  f. Accessing the data of one tenant without breaching the confidentiality of other tenants 429  g. Recovery of deleted data in a shared and distributed virtual environment 430  3. Analysis (e.g., correlation, reconstruction, time synchronization, logs, metadata, timelines). 431  Analysis challenges in cloud forensics include:  432  a. Correlation of forensic artifacts across and within cloud providers  433  b. Reconstruction of events from virtual images or storage 434  c. Integrity of metadata 435  d. Timeline analysis of log data, including synchronization of timestamps 436  4. Anti-forensics (e.g., obfuscation, data hiding, malware). Anti-forensics are a set of 437  techniques used specifically to prevent or mislead forensic analysis. Anti-forensic challenges 438  in cloud forensics include:  439  a. The use of obfuscation, malware, data hiding, or other techniques to compromise the 440  integrity of evidence 441  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  8  b. Malware may circumvent virtual machine isolation methods 442  5. Incident first responders (e.g., trustworthiness of cloud providers, response time, 443  reconstruction). Incident first responder challenges in cloud forensics include:  444  a. Confidence, competence, and trustworthiness of the cloud providers to act as first 445  responders and perform data collection 446  b. Difficulty in performing initial triage 447  c. Processing a large volume of collected forensic artifacts  448  6. Role management (e.g., data owners, identity management, users, access control). Role 449  management challenges in cloud forensics include: 450  a. Uniquely identifying the owner of an account 451  b. Decoupling between cloud user credentials and physical users  452  c. Ease of anonymity and creating fictitious identities online 453  d. Determining exact ownership of data 454  e. Authentication and access control 455  7. Legal (e.g., jurisdictions, laws, service level agreements, contracts, subpoenas, international 456  cooperation, privacy, ethics). Legal challenges in cloud forensics include:  457  a. Identifying and addressing issues of jurisdictions for legal access to data  458  b. Lack of effective channels for international communication and cooperation during an 459  investigation  460  c. Data acquisition that relies on the cooperation, competence, and trustworthiness of 461  cloud providers  462  d. Missing terms in contracts and service-level agreements 463  e. Issuing subpoenas without knowledge of the physical location of data 464  8. Standards (e.g., standard operating procedures, interoperability, testing, validation). 465  Standards challenges in cloud forensics include:  466  a. Lack of minimum/basic SOPs, practices, and tools 467  b. Lack of interoperability among cloud providers  468  c. Lack of test and validation procedures 469  9. Training (e.g., forensic investigators, cloud providers, qualification, certification). Training 470  challenges in cloud forensics include:  471  a. Misuse of digital forensic training materials that are not applicable to cloud forensics 472  b. Lack of cloud forensic training and expertise for both investigators and instructors 473  c. Limited knowledge about evidence by record-keeping personnel in cloud providers 474  475  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  9  Overview of CSA’s Enterprise Architecture 476  The Cloud Security Alliance’s Enterprise Architecture (CSA’s EA) [2] is both a methodology 477  and a set of tools that enable security architects, enterprise architects, and risk management 478  professionals to leverage a common set of solutions and controls. These solutions and controls 479  fulfill common requirements that risk managers must assess regarding the operational status of 480  internal IT security and cloud provider controls. These controls are expressed in terms of security 481  capabilities and designed to create a common roadmap to meet the security needs of businesses. 482  CSA designed the EA understanding that business requirements must guide the architecture. In 483  the case of the Enterprise Architecture, these requirements come from a controls matrix partly 484  driven by regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley [17] and Gramm-Leach-Bliley [18], standards 485  frameworks such as ISO-27002 [7], the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards [19], 486  and the IT Audit Frameworks such as COBIT [20], all in the context of cloud service delivery 487  models such as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a 488  service (IaaS). 489  From these requirements, a set of security capabilities have been defined and organized 490  according to the following best practice architecture frameworks. The Sherwood Applied 491  Business Security Architecture (SABSA) [12] defines a security model from a business 492  perspective. The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) [11] specifies the schema 493  needed to manage a company’s IT services, including the security guidelines to manage those 494  services securely. The Jericho Forum [21] designates technical security specifications that arise 495  from the reality of traditional technology environments in the data center and shift to one where 496  solutions span the internet across multiple data centers, some owned by the business and some 497  purely used as outsourced services. Lastly, The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) 498  [13] provides an enterprise architecture framework and methodology for planning, designing, 499  and governing information architectures, concluding in a common framework to integrate the 500  work of the security architect with the enterprise architecture of an organization. 501  The CSA EA is reproduced in Appendix C, and the domains covered are:  502  1. Business Operation Support Services (BOSS) – These functional capabilities are 503  associated with cloud IT services that support an organization’s business needs. BOSS 504  embodies the direction of the business and objectives of the cloud consumer. BOSS 505  capabilities cover compliance, data governance, operational risk management, human 506  resources security, security monitoring, internal investigations, and legal services.  507  2. Information Technology Operation and Support (ITOS) – These functional capabilities 508  are associated with managing the cloud IT services of an organization. ITOS capabilities 509  cover IT operation, service delivery, and service support. 510  3. Security and Risk Management (S&RM) – These functional capabilities are associated 511  with safeguarding cloud IT assets and detecting, assessing, and monitoring cloud IT risks. 512  S&RM capabilities cover identity and access management, GRC (governance, risk 513  management, and compliance), policies and standards, threat and vulnerability 514  management, and infrastructure and data protection. 515  4. Presentation Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the end user 516  interacting with a cloud IT solution. The capabilities cover presentation modalities and 517  presentation platforms (including end points, handwriting, and speech recognition). 518  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  10  5. Application Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the development 519  and use of cloud applications provided by an organization. The capabilities cover 520  programming interfaces, security knowledge life cycle, development processes, 521  integration middleware, connectivity and delivery, and abstraction.  522  6. Information Services – These functional capabilities are associated with the storage and 523  use of cloud information and data. The capabilities cover service delivery, service 524  support, reporting services, information technology operation and support, business 525  operations and support, data governance, user directory services, risk management, and 526  security monitoring.  527  7. Infrastructure Services – These functional capabilities are associated with core functions 528  that support the cloud IT infrastructure. The capabilities cover facilities, hardware, 529  networks, and virtual environments.  530  Together, there are 347 functional capabilities within these domains. 531  As mentioned above, the CSA’s EA functional capabilities are leveraged by the NIST Cloud 532  Security Reference Architecture (SRA) [15], which is comprised of a formal model designed as a 533  security overlay to the NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture [22] and a methodology 534  for architecting and orchestrating a cloud-based solution. The methodology allows cloud 535  architects to identify the system’s functional capabilities. The orchestration employs a risk-based 536  approach that follows the Risk Management Framework (RMF) [4] applied to cloud-based 537  systems.  538  The SRA’s risk-based approach for determining a cloud actor’s responsibilities for implementing 539  specific system components supports a clear delineation between the security responsibilities of 540  cloud providers and consumers and a clear understanding of the customer responsibility matrix. 541  Specifically, for each cloud service model, system components are analyzed to identify the level 542  of involvement of each cloud actor when implementing those components. 543  544  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  11  The Forensic Reference Architecture Methodology 545  The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture introduced in this document aims to help 546  the user understand the cloud forensic challenges that might exist for an organization’s cloud 547  systems. When architecting or orchestrating a new cloud system, cloud architects and cloud 548  security and forensic practitioners are encouraged to use the CC FRA to identify which 549  challenges could impact the system and therefore require at least partial mitigation strategies to 550  minimize the risk incurred during operations by, for example, allowing real-time interventions 551  based on the proactively generated forensic data and to eliminate potential negative impacts on 552  digital forensic investigations if the need arises. 553  While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing practitioner, it is specifically designed to 554  help the following target audiences by finding answers for specific questions related to their 555  cloud computing architectures: 556  • Target Audience #1: Cloud System Architects and Engineers. This target audience 557  might ask: “To what extent does the cloud system I’m designing facilitate the use of 558  digital forensics?” The architectural methodology and initial architecture presented in 559  this paper can help this audience identify where there could be potential challenges for 560  conducting forensics and can allow them to focus on areas of potential concern. System 561  trade-offs can be considered as well (e.g., the more that a system facilitates the use of 562  forensics, the greater the negative operational or economic impacts might be, or the 563  greater the chance that privacy might be impacted negatively). 564  • Target Audience #2: Forensic Practitioners. This target audience might ask: “What 565  items do I need to be aware of to conduct digital forensics in the cloud environment 566  versus a traditional or on-premises computing environment?” 567  • Target Audience #3: Consumers Who Want to Procure Cloud Services from Providers. 568  This target audience might ask: “What forensic questions and issues do I need to consider 569  when discussing what a cloud provider has to offer?” 570  The Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture provides a useful starting point for all 571  cloud security and forensic stakeholders to analyze the extent to which the cloud forensic 572  challenges identified in NIST IR 8006 [1] are impacting their systems.  573  The 62 forensic challenges and 347 functional capabilities described in Section 2 and Section 3, 574  respectively, provide the basis for determining which capabilities are affected by each of the 575  challenges. All possible pairs of challenges and capabilities are considered. The capabilities help 576  focus possible mitigation efforts as follows. If a challenge affects a capability, there may be 577  mitigation approaches that can be used to perform better forensics with regard to that capability. 578  Such information could prove useful for forensic practitioners, developers, and researchers.  579  The NCC FSWG has developed a mapping between functional capabilities and forensic 580  challenges. For each functional capability, the mapping shows all of the forensic challenges that 581  affect that capability. This has resulted in a Mapping Table of 347 rows (one for each capability) 582  and 62 columns (one for each challenge). An entry in the table is YES if the associated challenge 583  affects the associated capability; otherwise, the entry is NO. (See Figure 3 for an excerpt of this 584  table.) 585  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  12  When the question is asked: does a forensic challenge affect a functional capability, it is defined 586  to mean: if the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic 587  investigation on the considered functional capability? This is the relationship that the mapping 588  between challenges and capabilities is attempting to capture.  589  To help answer this question, the NCC FSWG developed a summary for each of the 62 challenges. 590  This summary answers the following question for each specific challenge: What advantages would 591  be provided to a forensic investigator if this challenge were overcome (or mitigated)? If these 592  advantages imply that the quality of forensics that can be performed on the functional capability 593  could be improved, then the answer is YES, overcoming the challenge could make it easier to 594  perform a forensic investigation on the capability. The summaries for the 62 challenges are found 595  in NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 1. 596  The goal was to provide a narrow, precise mapping between challenges and capabilities. A 597  flowchart was developed that was followed to achieve this mapping, as shown in Fig. 2. 598  599  600  Fig. 2. Mapping Flowchart 601  The flowchart provides users with a uniform method for determining the applicability of a 602  challenge to a particular capability. In conducting the analysis, the NCC FSWG placed each 603  cloud forensic challenge into one of two groups: 1) challenges that are primarily technical in 604  nature (e.g., architecture), or 2) challenges that are primarily non-technical in nature (e.g., legal). 605  This led to the creation of questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d in the flowchart, which perform 606  the placement into the two groups. If a challenge deals primarily with standards, legal issues, 607  contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, 608  qualifications, or certifications, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is 609  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  13  considered technical. This grouping provides a simple and straightforward method for analyzing 610  the high-level characteristics of each challenge.  611  Similarly, the NCC FSWG placed each of the cloud functional capabilities into one of two 612  groups: 1) primarily technical or 2) primarily non-technical in nature. If a capability deals 613  primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, 614  privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification, then the capability is considered 615  non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical. This led to the creation of questions Q3-a 616  and Q3-b. 617  The flowchart attempts to map challenges that are primarily technical only to capabilities that are 618  primarily technical and challenges that are primarily non-technical only to capabilities that are 619  primarily non-technical. This results in a precise and limited mapping. If a challenge and a 620  capability pair are assigned to the same group, the questioned is asked whether overcoming the 621  challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability. The answer determines whether 622  the capability is affected by the challenge. In summary, if the appropriate grouping is done and 623  overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered 624  to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES; otherwise, the mapping is NO). 625  There can, of course, be challenges in one group that affect capabilities in another group, but that 626  does not provide the precise, limited mapping. In such cases, the mapping is considered to be 627  NO. 628  The following is an example of what is meant by a precise, limited mapping. Suppose the 629  challenge deals with training (e.g., Challenge FC-65: There is a lack of training materials that 630  educate investigators on cloud computing technology and cloud forensic operating policies and 631  procedures; see [1], page 52). This is a non-technical challenge. In addition, suppose the 632  capability under consideration is technical. Enhanced training would clearly provide significant 633  benefit to forensic investigators and cloud providers because training is so broadly applicable 634  and would help to perform forensics more easily on most capabilities. However, a cloud forensic 635  architecture in which training affects almost every capability is undesirable because then the 636  architecture applies too broadly; most of the capabilities are not affected by this challenge in an 637  important way. This makes the architecture less useful because the architecture will have many 638  challenges that affect too many capabilities. Rather than this broad mapping of challenges to 639  capabilities, a narrower mapping is preferred. Narrowing the number of capabilities affected by 640  the challenge allows the mapping to be more powerful because the challenge can be used as an 641  effective tool of identifying the capabilities that are more likely to be affected by the challenge in 642  an important way. The architecture with a narrower mapping is also more practical because the 643  fewer YESs in the mappings, the easier for an investigator to apply the mappings in real-world 644  scenarios. 645  As described above and shown in Figure 2, if both the challenge and the capability being 646  evaluated deal with the same type of issue (i.e., technical or non-technical), then the following 647  question is asked: “If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud 648  forensic investigation on the functional capability?”  If the answer is “yes,” then the mapping is 649  YES.  650  However, if the challenge is primarily technical in nature and the capability is non-technical in 651  nature (or vice versa), then an analysis is conducted to determine whether the use of technical or 652  non-technical solutions to implement the capability would significantly enhance the ability of a 653  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  14  forensic investigator to overcome the challenge, as illustrated in questions Q2-c and Q2-d. If the 654  answer to this question is “no,” then no further analysis is required. If the answer to question Q2-655  c or Q2-d is “yes,” then the analysis will continue to determine: “If the challenge were overcome, 656  would that make it easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability?” 657  Using this methodology, it is possible to determine in a well-defined, structured fashion whether 658  it would be easier to conduct a cloud forensic investigation on a functional capability if the 659  forensic challenge were overcome. As a result, the flowchart will help cloud designers, forensic 660  investigators, and other interested parties focus specifically on those functional capabilities that 661  are affected by a specific cloud forensic challenge. 662  The process of traversing the flowchart involves asking questions about the particular challenge 663  and capability pair that is being analyzed. Starting at the top right of the flowchart (labeled “Q2-664  a”), each box asks a question about the challenge or the capability. The answer to each question 665  – YES or NO – then leads to either another box with a question or to one of the circles shown in 666  Table 1. 667  668  Table 1. The meaning of the circles within the flowchart of Fig. 2 669  When following the logical flowchart and answering the guiding  questions, if the final answer is a YES marked with a green circle, then  the challenge DOES affect the capability.  When following the logical flowchart and answering the guiding  questions, if the final answer is a NO marked with an orange circle, then  the challenge DOES NOT affect the capability.  When following the logical flowchart and answering the guiding  questions, if the final answer is a NO marked with a purple circle, then the  challenge DOES NOT affect the capability for reasons explained in  NOTE 1 and NOTE 2, below.  670  To determine whether the forensic challenge affects the functional capability, three fundamental 671  types of questions are asked: 672  1. Question 1 (Q1) – If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a 673  cloud forensic investigation on the functional capability? Note that the term “cloud 674  forensic investigation” means the identification, acquisition, preservation, examination, 675  interpretation, and reporting of potential digital evidence in the cloud. When analyzing 676  Question 1, it is narrowly considered only with regard to the particular functional 677  capability, ignoring all other capabilities as if they do not exist. So, the question really 678  asked is: If the challenge were overcome, would that make it easier to conduct a cloud 679  forensic investigation on this functional capability only while ignoring other capabilities? 680  2. Question 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, and Q2-d) – These questions relate only to the challenges 681  and not capabilities. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the challenge 682  deals with technical or non-technical issues and if either technical solutions or non-683  technical solutions significantly amplify the ability to overcome the challenge. 684  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  15  3. Question 3 (Q3-a and Q3-b) – These questions relate only to the capabilities and not the 685  challenges. The purpose of these questions is to determine whether the capability deals 686  primarily with technical or non-technical issues.  687  Questions 2 and 3 ask about the issues that a challenge or capability deals with, which are 688  determined as follows. As discussed in Section 2, the NCC FSWG labeled each of the 62 689  challenges according to the following nine categories: architecture, data collection, analysis, anti-690  forensics, incident first responders, role management, legal, standards, and training. The labels 691  for each challenge may be found in [1], Annex A, Table 2, in the columns labeled “Primary 692  Category” and “Related Category.” These categories and the challenge descriptions are used to 693  determine the type of issue each challenge deals with. If the primary issues are standards, legal 694  issues, contracts, service-level agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, 695  qualification, or certification, then the challenge is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is 696  considered technical.  697  Similarly, if a capability deals primarily with standards, legal issues, contracts, service level 698  agreements, jurisdiction issues, privacy, ethical issues, training, qualification, or certification, 699  then the capability is considered non-technical. Otherwise, it is considered technical. 700  The NCC FSWG developed consensus answers for all of the questions related to Question 2 and 701  Question 3 in the flowchart. Therefore, when a particular challenge and capability pair was 702  considered, all questions – except for Question 1 – were already answered. This resulted in much 703  more consistent mappings across all challenges and capabilities. 704  When traversing the flowchart starting at the box labeled “Q2-a,” if a NO node is not reached, 705  then the box labeled “Q1” is eventually reached. For any challenge and capability pair, it may lie 706  in one of two groups when Q1 is reached (see Figure 2). As discussed above, Group 1 is the 707  “Technical Group,” and Group 2 is the “Non-technical Group.” They are defined as follows: 708  • Group 1 (Technical Group) –  709  [The challenge is technical, OR the  challenge is non-technical but requires  technology (at least partially) to overcome  the challenge.]  AND  [The functional capability is technical.]  710  • Group 2 (Non-Technical Group) –  711  712  [The challenge is non-technical, OR the  challenge is technical but requires non- technical solutions (at least partially) to  overcome the challenge.]  AND  [The functional capability is non- technical.]  713  The reason for these groups – to map technical challenges to technical capabilities and non-714  technical challenges to non-technical capabilities – was explained above. Once a challenge and 715  capability pair is assigned to the appropriate group, the question of whether overcoming the 716  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  16  challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics on the capability is asked. This determines 717  whether the capability is affected by the challenge. If the grouping is appropriate and 718  overcoming the challenge makes it easier to conduct forensics, then the challenge is considered 719  to affect the capability (i.e., the mapping is YES). 720  However, suppose a challenge is non-technical but requires technology to overcome the 721  challenge. Examples of non-technical challenges that have both non-technical and technical 722  solutions include the following ([1], Annex A): 723  • FC-56 (Confidentially and PII) deals with legal/privacy issues (a non-technical 724  challenge). Privacy issues can be resolved with a combination of legal steps (e.g., 725  legislation) and technology steps (privacy-enhancing technologies). 726  • FC-64 and FC-65 deal with training (non-technical challenges). Training issues can be 727  resolved with better and more widely available training classes, but they can also be 728  resolved with better technology to perform the training. 729  There are non-technical challenges that require solutions that are non-technical, technical, or a 730  combination of both. If the non-technical challenge requires only a non-technical solution (and 731  the capability is non-technical), it is in Group 2. If it requires only a technical solution (and the 732  capability is technical), it is in Group 1. If it requires both, then it is in Group 1 or Group 2, 733  depending on whether the capability is technical or non-technical. 734  When a challenge is technical but requires a non-technical solution to overcome the challenge 735  (and the capability is non-technical), then this challenge is in Group 2. 736  In Fig. 2, the two purple circles refer to two notes, as follows: 737  • NOTE 1: When this circle is reached, the challenge does not fit in either of the two 738  groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. Fortunately, none of the challenges reach 739  this node as none have this property. This node is included simply for logical 740  completeness of the flowchart, so that every node has both a YES exit path and a NO exit 741  path.  742  • NOTE 2: When this circle is reached, the capability does not fit in either of the two 743  groups. It is neither technical nor non-technical. There are a few capabilities that reach 744  this node. However, these capabilities do not deal with issues directly related to digital 745  forensics for cloud computing. Instead, they involve controlling physical access to 746  facilities (e.g., using barriers, security patrols, checking physical ID cards, etc.). They 747  also involve mitigating physical threats to facilities, such as installing fire suppression 748  equipment.  749  The process described in this section, which is employed for the analysis of any pair consisting 750  of a cloud functional capability and a cloud forensic challenge, represents a core component of 751  the CC FRA – the methodology – and can be applied to any set of capability-challenge pairs, 752  either modified from the sets used in this document or adapted from a different architectural 753  framework or empirical data. 754  755  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  17  The Forensic Reference Architecture Data 756  The data that supplements the CC FRA methodology described in Section 4 represents the result 757  of an analysis performed by the NCC FSWG members. The methodology was applied to all 758  possible pairings of cloud forensic challenges (62 total challenges) with cloud functional 759  capabilities (347 capabilities). In total, 21,514 challenge-capability pairings were evaluated using 760  the flowchart in Figure 1.  761  All users of CC FRA data are encouraged to use the data as an initial implementation of the 762  methodology but use their own judgment when employing the CC FRA methodology in the 763  context of their cloud systems and modify or customize NIST’s initial dataset for their specific 764  situations and needs.  765  For example, if the existing capabilities are not appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all 766  can be removed, and new ones can be added. Similarly, new challenges appropriate for the user’s 767  situation can be added, or those challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed. 768  This architectural methodology has the advantage of helping to focus on how challenges can be 769  mitigated because it considers each challenge specifically in the context of affected capabilities. 770  The results of the NCC FSWG’s analysis are summarized in a Mapping Table (MT). An entry in 771  the MT is YES if the associated challenge was identified as affecting the paired capability. 772  Otherwise, the entry is NO.  773  The CC FRA data set provides all interested parties with the responses for every challenge-774  capability pairing based on the analysis performed by the authors and collaborators of this 775  document. A sample excerpt of the table is displayed in Figure 3. The full CC FRA Mapping 776  Table is available for download (see Appendix D for a partial image and a link for downloading 777  the data). 778  The CC FRA data has 62 cloud forensic challenges obtained from NISTIR 8006 [1]. In the CC 779  FRA Mapping Table, each cloud forensic challenge is shown across the top row (i.e., Forensic 780  Challenge 1 [FC01], Forensic Challenge 2 [FC02], etc.). In Figure 3, only FC01-FC09 and 781  FC58-FC65 are shown, and the rest of the challenges are hidden for the sake of readability in the 782  figure. See Appendix D for the full Mapping Table.  783  The CC FRA data has 347 cloud functional capabilities. In the CC FRA Mapping Table, each 784  cloud functional capability is listed on the left column labeled “CAPABILITY” (see Figure 3). 785  The CC FRA data set preserves the grouping of the cloud functional capabilities provided by the 786  CSA EA [2] into “CONTAINERS” and “DOMAINS.”  787  In Figure 3, the first nine capabilities are shown, as are the last nine; the rest are hidden. Each 788  row, therefore, represents a separate capability and includes the following information: the 789  domain of the capability (all of the domains are described in Section 3), the container (the 790  highest-level elements within the architectural diagram in Appendix D1), the name of the 791  capability, and a description of the capability (not shown in Figure 3 but shown in Appendix D).  792  1 The container is a high-level collection of capabilities consisting of related processes and procedures within the domain.  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  18  793  Fig. 3. Excerpt of the Forensic Reference Architecture (Challenges vs. Capabilities Mapping Table). 794  The entry in the table that corresponds to a specific row and column (i.e., a specific challenge-795  capability pair) is either YES or NO based on the result of traversing the mapping flowchart in 796  Figure 2. Traversing the flowchart requires answers to Questions 1 (Q1), 2 (Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, 797  Q2-d), and 3 (Q3-a, Q3-b). As described in Section 4, Q1 must be answered for each individual 798  challenge-capability pair that reaches Q1 when the flowchart is traversed. However, Questions 2 799  and 3, which relate only to challenges and capabilities separately, can be answered ahead of time, 800  and consensus answers were developed for these by the NCC FSWG. These answers are shown 801  in the table in Figure 3. The second row in the table has the answers for Q2-a, the third row for 802  Q2-b, the fourth row for Q-2c, and the fifth row for Q2-d. The fifth column in the table has the 803  answers for Q3-a and the sixth column for Q3-b. 804  Each entry in the table is color-coded as follows: 805  • Orange – A NO is obtained before reaching question Q1 in the flowchart. These entries 806  can be filled in automatically once the answers to questions Q2-a, Q2-b, Q2-c, Q2-d, Q3-807  a, and Q3-b are entered. 808  • Red – A NO is obtained as a result of answering Q1. 809  • Green – A YES is obtained as a result of answering Q1. 810  Analysis of the correlation between the forensic science challenges and the functional 811  capabilities constitutes the foundation for achieving consistent and repeatable answers to the 812  FC 01  FC 02  FC 03  FC 04  FC 05  FC 06  FC 07  FC 08  FC 09  ...H ID  DE N…  FC 58  FC 59  FC 60  FC 61  FC 62  FC 63  FC 64  FC 65  2a No No Ye s  No No Ye s  No No Ye s  Ye s  No Ye s  No Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Components descriptions also available on CSA's inte  2b Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  https://research.cloudsecurityalliance.org/tci/ 2c Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  Ye s  No Ye s  No Ye s  No  In de  x DOMAIN CONTAINER CAPABILITY  (process or solution) 3a  \\  3b \\  2d  \\  No No No No No No Ye s  Ye s  4 BOSS Compliance Intellectual Property  P t ti  Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO YES YES YES NO NO NO NO NO  5 BOSS Data Handling/ Labeling/  Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO YES YES YES NO NO NO YES YES  6 BOSS Data Clear Desk Policy Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  7 BOSS Data Rules for Information  No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  8 BOSS Human  Employee Awareness No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  9 BOSS Security  Market Threat No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  10 BOSS Security  Knowledge Base No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO NO NO NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  11 BOSS Compliance Audit Planning Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO NO* NO* NO YES YES YES NO NO NO NO NO  12 BOSS Compliance Internal Audits No Yes YES YES NO YES YES YES YES YES NO YES YES NO* NO NO NO* YES NO*  …HIDDEN… 342 S & RM Infrastructure  Network No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES Yes NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  343 S & RM Data Protection Data Lifecycle No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  344 S & RM Cryptographic Signature Services No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  345 S & RM Governance  IT Risk Management Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* YES NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  346 S & RM InfoSec Risk Portfolio Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* YES NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  347 S & RM Privilege  Authorization Services No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  348 S & RM Privilege  Authorization Services No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  349 S & RM Policies and Information Security Yes No NO* NO* NO NO* NO* YES NO* NO* NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  350 S & RM Privilege  Privilege Usage No Yes YES YES YES YES YES YES YES NO NO YES YES NO* YES YES NO* YES NO*  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  19  questions identified in the CC FRA methodology. Each challenge is further categorized based on 813  its overall impact on cloud functional capabilities. This categorization is focused on the overall 814  number of affected capabilities, identifying if only a limited set of capabilities is impacted versus 815  most capabilities composing the cloud ecosystem being impacted. The term impact is used to 816  indicate how broadly or narrowly a challenge affects the set of functional capabilities. Therefore, 817  the impact of each challenge was categorized along a generic-to-specific scale as follows (see 818  NIST IR 8006 [1], Annex A, Table 2, column 4):  819  • Generic (G) – A challenge is labeled generic if it affects most of the capabilities.  820  • Specific (S) – A challenge is labeled specific if it affects a limited set of capabilities.  821  • Quasi (Q) – A challenge is labeled quasi if it falls somewhere between generic and 822  specific.  823  A specific challenge applies narrowly and affects only a limited number of capabilities, while a 824  generic challenge affects a broad set of capabilities. The specific challenge affects a capability in 825  a direct manner that is determined by the particular issues addressed by the capability. This 826  results in the capability being affected in an important and profound way. On the other hand, 827  because the generic challenge affects most of the capabilities, the affect is not tied closely to the 828  issues addressed in each capability, and the capabilities are affected in a much less important and 829  profound way. (See Section 4 in which the “precise, limited mapping” is explained.) Thus, a 830  specific challenge is more impactful overall than a generic one when it comes to conducting a 831  cloud forensic investigation. The generic-to-specific label of each challenge is also part of the 832  Forensic Reference Architecture, as shown in Appendix D. The NCC FSWG developed 833  consensus labels for all of the challenges [1]. 834  835  https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cloud-forensics  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  20  Conclusion 836  This document presents the NIST Cloud Computing Forensic Reference Architecture (CC FRA) 837  comprised of: 838  a) A methodology for analyzing the functional capabilities of an existing architecture – 839  preferably a security architecture like the Cloud Security Alliance’s (CSA’s) Enterprise 840  Architecture (EA) [2] – through a set of cloud forensic challenges, such as the set 841  identified in NIST IR 8006 [1] 842  b) A data set that aggregates the results of the above methodology applied to the CSA’s EA 843  [2] and the NIST IR 8006 [1] set of cloud forensic challenges 844  The goal of the FRA is to enable the analysis of cloud systems to determine the extent to which a 845  system proactively supports digital forensics. More precisely, the FRA is meant to help users 846  understand how the previously identified cloud forensic challenges might impact an 847  organization’s cloud-based system. When developing a new system or analyzing an existing one, 848  the FRA helps identify those cloud forensic challenges that could affect the system’s capabilities 849  and, therefore, require at least partial mitigation strategies to support a complete forensic 850  investigation. The FRA also identifies how a forensic investigator would apply the mitigation 851  strategies to a particular investigation. While the FRA can be used by any cloud computing 852  practitioner, it is specifically designed to enable cloud system architects, cloud engineers, 853  forensic practitioners, and even cloud consumers to analyze and review their cloud computing 854  architectures for forensic readiness.  855  The FRA data provided in this document offers an initial implementation of the FRA 856  methodology and a useful starting point for all cloud forensic stakeholders to analyze how the 857  NIST cloud forensic challenges presented in NIST IR 8006 [1] affect each functional capability 858  present in the CSA’s EA [2].  859  All users are encouraged to customize this initial implementation (shown in Appendix D) for 860  their specific situations and needs. For example, if the existing functional capabilities are not 861  appropriate for the user’s situation, some or all can be removed, and new ones can be added. 862  Similarly, new forensic challenges appropriate for the user’s situation can be added, and 863  challenges that have been adequately mitigated can be removed. The FRA methodology 864  promotes analysis of how cloud forensic challenges affect particular functional capabilities and 865  helps determine whether mitigations are necessary to ensure forensic readiness related to the 866  respective capability. This means that users can replace all cloud forensics challenges or 867  functional capabilities used in the current FRA data set with their own. 868  The FRA presented here will likely evolve over time, and methods for quantifying impact will be 869  developed to enhance FRA usability. 870  871  NIST SP 800-201 ipd (Initial Public Draft)  Cloud Computing Forensic  February 2023  Reference Architecture  21  References 872  [1] Herman M, Iorga M, Salim AS, Jackson R, Hurst M, Leo R, Lee R, Landreville N, 873  Mishra AK, Wang Y, Sardinas R (2020).

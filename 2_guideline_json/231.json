It is aimed at both the public and private  sectors from the EU and EFTA Member States.  The exercises simulate large-scale cybersecurity  incidents that escalate into cyber crises, offering  opportunities to analyse advanced technical  cybersecurity incidents but also test participants on  their capabilities for dealing with complex situations.  The exercises aim to test the participants’  readiness and capacity to tackle challenging and  realistic cyber crises.  The exercises are organised by ENISA together with  planners from participating countries and institutions.  Cyber Europe 2022 aimed to accomplish several Goals  and Objectives which are detailed below.  2 GOALS  Cyber Europe 2022 was designed to fulfil a list  of Goals (G). These Goals were developed to provide  the organisers and the participants with a clear scope  and a purpose for their participation in the event.  The 2022 edition aimed to achieve  the following Goals:  G1.  Test EU-level technical and operational  cooperation during cyber-crises  G2.  Provide opportunities to test local-level incident  response and resilience plans  G3.  Train EU- and local-level technical capabilities.  These Goals were complemented by the following  secondary (also known as implicit) Goals:  Help to build trust  Engage the private sector  Improve situational awareness  Test�the�public�affairs�response  Improve the exercise’s process  and capabilities.  PART I EXERCISE OVERVIEW  6  3 OBJECTIVES  The Goals of Cyber Europe 2022 were designed to  remain broad and all-encompassing. To further  assess the relevance and the added value of the  exercise, specific Objectives (O) were derived  from the Goals. Each Objective was assigned  specific metrics for evaluation purposes in order  to facilitate assessment of the extent to which they  were achieved.  The different Objectives targeted by this exercise are  described below, categorised per Goal.  G1. �Test�EU-level�technical�and�operational� cooperation during cyber-crises  O01. Test the quality of information-sharing O02. Test incident response capability at EU level  O03. Evaluate situational awareness O04.  Test the articulation between the technical and  operational levels O05. �Test the operational coordinated handling of  public communication  G2. �Provide�opportunities�to�test�local-level� incident response and resilience plans  O06.  Provide opportunities to participants to test  their intra-organisational procedures, if they  exist (Business Continuity Plans (BCPs), Crisis  Management Plans, etc.)  O07.  Provide opportunities to participants to test  cross-organisational cooperation  O08.  Provide opportunities to participants to  test local-level cooperation activities and/or  contingency plans, if they exist  G3. �Train�EU-�and�local-level�technical� capabilities  O09. �Provide opportunities to train in a wide variety  of cybersecurity and crisis management skills  O10. �Identify training needs for the future  The aim was to achieve the Goals and Objectives  by means of the main Cyber Europe 2022 scenario  presented in the following subsection.  4 SCENARIO  Cyber Europe 2022 revolved around the healthcare  ecosystem and tested the resilience of several  relevant stakeholders, including national Computer  Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs),  cybersecurity authorities, ministries of health,  healthcare organisations such as hospitals and clinics,  eHealth service providers, and health insurance  providers. The participants had to address an  escalating cyber crisis, tackling multiple incidents  simultaneously.  The scenario aimed at realistically mimicking  technical incidents. These incidents are detailed  in Figure 1 below, which highlight how they covered  several elements, with some aimed at gaining a  foothold and others aimed at tampering with medical  devices. The second figure describes the sectors  targeted by the attacks and their potential impacts.  The objective of the scenario was to enable the  players to react accordingly to each incident  in order to minimise the damage incurred, with  the general objective of testing the operational  and technical layers. The scenario, which spanned  two days, began on the first day by engaging  the participants around a disinformation  campaign�of manipulated�laboratory�results  and a cyberattack targeting the networks  of European hospitals as well as internet  and cloud service�providers.�  CYBER EUROPE 2022: AFTER ACTION REPORT 7  PART I. Exercise overview  Figure 1. Overview�of�the�technical�scenario�  Legend:  Spearphishing  attack  Technical  Drive-by infection  Ransomware  infection  Infected document  Data loss through  unrecoverable  encryption  Attacks through  unsecure wi-fi  Attack through  fileless malware  OSINT incident  Robocall  attacks  Non  Technical  GAIN  FOOTHOLD  IMPACT  DATA LOSS DATA EXFILTRATION/ GDPR VIOLATION/  DATA LOSS  HUMAN�LIFE�  AT�RISK  Vulnerable IOTs  (temperature  control, data leaks)  Multiprotocol data  stealer  Malicious�insider  Type  Medical�device�tampering  Insider threat  Tampered medical  laboratory  instrument  Medical data  server attacks Implantable  cardiac device  cyber-attack  8  Government Industry Networks Helthcare  providers  TARGETS  Sensitive (medical)  or confidential data loss  Compromised integrity  of sensitive medical data  Misuse of resources  (cryptominer)  Mainstream news outlets  covering major attacks/events  Cyberphysical attack  (pharmacy storage)  Sensitive (medical)  or confidential data for sale  on the darknet  Threats of exposing sensitive  (medical) or confidential data  via social media  Figure 2. Targeted�sectors�and�potential�impact�of�the�attacks  Figure 3. Cyber�Europe�2022�planners  CYBER EUROPE 2022: AFTER ACTION REPORT 9  PART I. Exercise overview  Figure 4. Participants�per�Sector  In total, 918 participants (planners, players and  monitors)1 officially registered for the exercise,  representing the 27 EU Member States, 2 EFTA  countries (Norway and Switzerland) and several  EU institutions and agencies (including CERT-EU,  EAAS, EDPS, EUSPA, EUROPOL and the European  Commission). As illustrated in Figure 4, the Healthcare  and Public Health sector was the most widely  represented sector, but participants came from  a wide range of sectors.  1 These figures account only for participants who registered on  the Cyber Exercise Platform. Several organisations chose to  participate using a generic functional mailbox and distributed  exercise information among multiple participants and teams.  As a result, it is safe to assume that the actual real number of  participants was significantly higher.

An observers programme ran in parallel to the  execution of the exercise, with representatives from  EUIBAs (EU Institutions, Bodies and agencies) and the  international cybersecurity community present in the  ENISA offices in Halandri (Athens) during the two days  of the exercise.  The programme was an opportunity for  stakeholders to engage in fruitful discussions,  exchange lessons learnt and discuss opportunities  for future collaboration.  CYBER EUROPE 2022: AFTER ACTION REPORT 11  PART I. Exercise overview  5 TAKEAWAYS�FROM�THE�EXERCISE  Following the completion of Cyber Europe 2022,  a survey was circulated to collect feedback  from the participants. The data collected was  complemented by findings from the planners collected  during the exercise, observations from the ENISA  exercise team and finally analysed by ENISA.  The detailed findings were compiled in a report  shared with the planners.  One key takeaway is that Cyber Europe 2022 can be  regarded as having been a success as all parties  involved�identified�areas�for�improvement. This  proves that Cyber Europe is helpful in identifying  what works, but also where there are shortcomings  and areas for improvement.  The lessons learned from the participants in Cyber  Europe were compiled in the following word cloud.  GENERAL�TAKEAWAYS  Cyber Europe 2022 Goals and Objectives  The Goals and Objectives set by Cyber Europe  2022 (CE2022) were mainly achieved. In a nutshell,  CE2022 provided the testing and training  opportunities to the participants that were stated  in the main Goal.  The�more�detailed�analysis�confirmed�that�the� exercise also achieved secondary (implicit) goals.  Although not every participating entity was able to  engage in all secondary areas, the exercise scenario  offered�the�opportunity to all participating countries  and institutions to do so.  The�uptake�of�the�detailed�findings�at�the� Objectives level, which were shared with the  planners, should result in the improvement of  procedures, communication and coordination  processes that are in place at local, sectoral,  national, cross-border and EU-wide levels.  Figure 6. Cyber�Europe�2022�observers  1212  The future of Cyber Europe  An exercise like Cyber Europe as a training and  testing ground is needed, as it successfully  identifies�gaps�and�development�points� across the board in order to improve the  cybersecurity posture of all participating  stakeholders. Cyber Europe 2022 was notably  able to engage several stakeholders from the  private and public sectors in collaboration and  working together towards achieving a common  goal: improving EU-wide coordination during  major cyber crises.  The ENISA Cyber Exercise Platform (CEP) used  for the planning and execution of the exercise  could�benefit�from�a�refresh in order to be able  to be accommodate future expectations and  improve the user experience for all involved.  � �Cyber�Europe�2022�confirmed�the�importance� of preparing optimally for such a large-scale  exercise, investing more effort in the preparation  of the results in order to produce a more useful  output. The preparation helps to better identify  gaps and areas for improvement, determines the  impact of participating in such an exercise and  facilitates recruiting players with different roles.  The planners agreed with ENISA’s observations  that receiving improved support and training  for their crucial role as planners would help  them get even more out of future Cyber Europe  exercises. It would also help level the playing field  for all players. This would ensure the exercise is  adequately tailored to local-level specificities.

The target group is composed of educators such as trainers, teachers and peers involved in  formal education and non-formal education, including lifelong learning.In our current brokerage  effort we try to connect the nodes in the best way possible by presenting three case studies with  countries perspective, from the Czech Safer Internet Centre (NCBI), ‘Strategy of community  education in project — Prague safe online’, from German partners, the Federal Office for  Information Security (BSI), ‘10th anniversary of the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to  increase awareness’, and from Norwegian partners, ‘Norwegian Centre for Information Security’.  Furthermore we open a discussion about hacking. ‘Hacking for good or for bad’ is a case study  to  advance the use of appropriate terms by the NIS in Education community, taking into account the  particularity of the given ecosystem.  In order to raise awareness of our target group we share the  view that everybody should take part in the discussion and share the responsibility of a secure global  digital community. As recommendations to be taken into account by NIS in Education stakeholders  from Member States we mention:  - Learning experiences on hacking should be organized with a clear focus on educational purpose vs  legal implications of misbehaviour;  - Hacker contests and Cyber Challenges should be focusing on protection and receiving tips on  preventive actions;  - The community education model  should be given further considerations;  - Emphasize on the importance of awareness-raising measures as a continuos cooperation at both  national and international levels;  - Relying on more interdisciplinary solutions.  Regarding the general procees we draw the attention on  the following recommendations:  1. ENISA and EC should address Cyber Security awareness at all levels in different arenas for sharing  information.  2. Awareness organisations should pursue Public-Private partnerships in their Educational attempts towards  the digital users.  3. NIS in Education community members should target specific stakeholders with different methods and  specific content  The brokerage model for education is thus in focus in the three case studies and we are interested in  consulting more partners in the future to identify their brokerage model.  Essential questions: What content in particular should we share? Which stakeholders  do we involve? What are the methods that we deploy?

Introduction  The Brokerage model for Network and Information Security in Education report is a continuation of  Collaborative solutions for network information security in education (4) (2012), and Network  information security in education: consolidated ENISA contribution (5) (2011). In 2012, we argued  that brokerage of information is at the root of the learning cycle and we provided details to justify  this by using practical examples from Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg. Our main  recommendations were that we should all learn from our peers’ best practices and share our own  experiences. We also recommended that a ‘can do attitude’ should be deployed both by educators  and by their students of different age groups.  We started with digital education work at ENISA and in this spirit we have been working, throughout  2013, in order to gather evidence on the newest developments and to share ideas among NIS  communities.  Furthermore, our main goal in publishing this report was to provide material to the target group and  promote digital education on network information security.  The main target group of our report is the same as in previous years. It consists of educators such as  trainers, teachers and peers involved in formal education and non-formal education including  lifelong learning.  The significant role of educators must not be omitted from any ICT stakeholder  map!  We consider cyber security as an enabler and not as a burden, and by concentrating on education  we want to emphasise the need to bring the various competences and capabilities of the EU  Member States up to speed. Our main goals are to achieve ‘Cyber hygiene’, ‘Netiquette’ and being a  ‘good digital citizen’ by involving the users through our partners and specialized communities.  In our current brokerage effort we try to connect the nodes in the best way possible and as a result  we present three case studies with countries perspectives, from Czech partners, ‘Strategy of  community education in project —Prague safe online’, from German partners, ‘10th anniversary of  the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to increase awareness’, and from Norwegian  partners, ‘Norwegian Centre for Information Security’. The brokerage model for education is in the  spotlight in the three case studies and we are interested in consulting more partners in the future  regarding their brokerage model.

As mentioned in current and previous education work our main  goals are to achieve ‘Cyber hygiene’ or ‘Netiquette’ by involving the users through our partners and  specialized communities like this one of educators. In June 2012, 45 EU and US representatives from  the private and public sectors gathered in Brussels to discuss the topic of involving Intermediaries in  Cyber Security awareness, summarized in an ENISA report7. In that event Dr. Timmers the EC  CONNECT’s keynote speaker set the challenge to find ways to make hacking better understood and  more suitable as use. It was mentioned that awareness effort may concentrate on ‘finding ways to  make hacking uncool’. We follow up with a case study on the current use of the term, because we  believe that the education practitioners and all other partners in awareness raising should have a  clear and common understanding of the term and a unified message to transmit.  How many times a week do you read an article on cyber security and hacking? Although both are  popular buzz words and powerful hash tags on social networks, they are also of paramount  importance in our daily life at work or during our spare time. In order to raise awareness we are of  the opinion that everybody should be part of the discussion and share the responsibility of a secure  global digital community. We therefore want to develop on a few considerations about hacking.  ‘Hacking for good or for bad’ is an attempt to advance the use of appropriate terms by the NIS in  Education community, taking into account the particularity of the given ecosystem.  The network and information security world uses technical terms on a daily basis and we might  easily get caught in discussions about ‘botnets’, ‘bullying’, ‘spamming’, ‘identity theft’, ‘denial of  (  6 )Many ENISA colleagues contributed with opinions in a thematic discussion and we thank them all; also  Annex A contains direct links to thematic materials.  (7) Involving Intermediaries in Cyber-security Awareness Raising  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/eu-u.s.-event-on- intermediaries-in-cybersecurity-awareness-raising/involving-intermediaries-in-cyber-security-awareness- raising  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  3  service’, ‘malware’ and ‘grooming’ and find ourselves using the same term for opposite meanings.  Not always do experts or outsiders agree on the definition of these terms – and often terms start to  live a life of their own.  A good example is hacking. Do we use hacking for good or for bad? What do  you think?  Objective  Following the whole debate and reading publications of various actors, we observed that the  controversy about the term ‘hacking’ is still very much alive. It is not a new debate and we do not  think that it will end soon as the term is evolving. However, we felt the need to participate with a  short summary of the current status. It will represent a common ground for the NIS education  community to further transmit a common message to European users. The purpose of the trial is to  emphasize on the contextual meaning of the term ‘hacking’.  Considerations to take into account  Hacking is what hackers do with the high skills and knowledge they possess. However, the term can  have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In ENISA’s education reports  we advocate for good cyber security education in the EU, mentioning labs and hands on experience.  Furthermore, we promote the saying ‘do not learn to hack, but hack to learn’ (8).  The shared opinion is that hacking is a neutral term, and that the discussion about ethical-‘good  hackingֹ’ and unethical- ‘bad hacking’ has to be put into context. For example, hacking is ‘uncool’  when it is done with malicious intent and hacking is ‘cool’ when it is done with good intent (9).  Hacking is neither good nor bad. ‘Cracking’ would be a better term to use when speaking about bad  hacking.  However, it is primarily a mind-set: a way of thinking about security. Its main focus is on attacking  systems, but at the same time it is also invaluable for defending those same systems. Because  computer systems are very complex, defending them often requires experts to think like attackers.  Admittedly, there is a big difference between thinking like an attacker and acting unlawfully; and  also between researching vulnerabilities in fielded systems and exploiting those vulnerabilities for  personal gain.  The terms hackers and hacking should be used, taking into consideration the  context, the background and the community behind it.  Hackers have been around in our society for a long time. Hackers are sometimes described as  curious, analytical, innovation-oriented and open-minded experts. However, the sword is double- edged, in the same way that a locksmith’s skills is used to help people, but his expertise could also  be used to break into somebody’s home. Such skills, which can be used to cause great harm, create  fear and suspicion in people. However they can also be of great educational value. People are all  different. For some it is educational and interesting to see how computers and applications work in  depth, whilst others make a living by finding vulnerabilities in computer software and hardware and  selling them to people who are willing to pay for the ability to easily break into computers.

Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  4  Next steps  In order to clearly set the objective on the learning experience and fill the gaps between the roles of  ethical and unethical hacking in society, we recommend the following for a better use of the term:  - Labs, classes and trainings on hacking should be organized with a clear focus on  understanding the educational purpose vs. legal implications of misbehaviour;  - Hacker contests and Cyber Challenges should be focusing on protection and receiving tips on  preventive actions.  As a conclusion for good cyber security in the EU, MSs should better integrate NIS in public policies  in education meant to enhance the technical skills of users and the general understanding of  concepts. A summary with remarks is depicted in the graph below:  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  5  2. Case studies at country level experience  In this chapter we describe experiences at country level, in the Czech Republic, Germany and  Norway. We are looking for a brokerage model for network and information security in education  that could be shared across European countries to actively educate the digital citizen.  The EU cyber security ‘An open, safe and secure cyberspace’ strategy (10) mentions the development  of a roadmap for a ‘network and information security driving licence’ as a voluntary certification  programme to promote enhanced skills and IT competence and other techniques for user  empowerment such as cyber security championships, ‘Capture the flag’ competitions, the ‘European  Cyber Security Month’ advocacy campaign, aligned with other global efforts. Additionally, the  strategy calls to ‘step up national efforts on NIS education and training’ (11), by introducing training  on NIS in schools by 2014, training on NIS and secure software development and personal data  protection for computer science students, and NIS basic training for staff working in public  administrations. ENISA has started the consultation process in order to involve the relevant  stakeholders and guide the process for quality results during the next years. We are also keen to  search for best practices at country level and pick up the practice to be scaled up to regional,  European and international levels.  Promote cyber security awareness at all levels!  (  10 ) http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 (accessed  in October 2013).

The Czech Republic: strategy of community education in the  ‘Praha bezpecne online‘/‘Prague safe online’ project (12)  Background  The Národní centrum bezpecnejsiho internetu/Czech Safer Internet Centre (NCBI) is a non- governmental, non-profit-making working association established to carry out the tasks related to  knowledge-building, education and exchange of best practice in the field of safer use of the Internet  and new media. It carries out various awareness-raising activities focused on children, their parents  and teachers, and strives to engage Czech stakeholders in the promotion of safer use of the Internet.  Objective  The main objective of educational project ‘Praha bezpecne online‘/‘Prague safe online’ is the social  protection, especially of children and young people, from the risky phenomena arising online and  thus preventing online crime targeting children or committed by the youth themselves. The project  raises awareness about safer use of the Internet and new media, and reduces the risk factors of  online delinquency. The most important risk factors were determined as:   minimum knowledge of elementary school  pupils and high schools students about the  risks of online communication and online-  delinquency;   high level of technical knowledge of pupils  and students concerning information and  communication technologies;   high accessibility of information and  communication devices;   immature personal, social and moral  competences of young Internet users ;   Low awareness of the legal consequences of some acts performed online (criminal  consequences of some patterns of online behaviour, protection of personal rights and  copyrights by the criminal code, etc.);   low (or zero) awareness of educators and prevention school specialists of online risks and  online delinquency;   Low (or zero) knowledge of information and communication technology teachers, especially  about Internet services (social networks, instant messengers, etc.);   absence of education on the safe and ethical use of the Internet and new media in the  elementary and high school curricula;   low awareness of the public, especially parents, about the online risks and delinquency  connected to the use of the Internet and the possibilities of children and youth protection;   Limited time parents spent with their children.

This is the main idea behind the  community education, which focuses on the maximum number of specialists who can solve  crisis situations connected with the online behaviour of pupils. By linking up these  specialists, a ‘safety net’ that can efficiently operate at the local basis, is created. In the same  time frame, they work with the parents of the pupils of all the local elementary schools, and  of course also with the children themselves.  The following groups were involved in the project:  — Elementary school children;  — parents;  — Educators (teachers, headmasters, school prevention specialists);  — Specialists working with children (social workers, pedagogical-psychological  counseling workers);  — The municipality’s prevention specialists;  — police officers from the area (mostly prevention specialists working with schools),  probation and mediation service specialists.  Working with all the above-mentioned groups in the same time frame increases the  motivation and interest about the topics of the particular groups. In a relatively short period  of time, online safety literacy increases in the local community. All the groups involved start  communicating with one another, share their newly gained knowledge and experience, and  recommend further activities. Schools gain concrete partners for solving problematic  situations from the municipality, the police, pedagogical-psychological counseling services;  parents, one of the least easily accessible groups, become aware of the extent of the  problem and their motivation to actively participate increases.  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  8  To target the widest public, the project is accompanied by public awareness campaigns:  — PR in conventional media (articles in newspapers, TV shots, reports from the events,  interviews mostly on local TV, radio broadcasting, etc.);  — Outdoor campaigns (posters, city light screens);  — Internet (http://www.saferinternet.cz) websites and websites of cooperating  institutions (municipality, Ministry of the Interior, information stalls in schools and  other institutions);  — Indoor campaigns (using school facilities, offices of cooperating institutions, etc.).  Every session of the project ends with a national conference. The audience consists of  professionals from the groups mentioned above, and of an interested public. These events  also attract the media and stakeholders.  Results  The ‘Praha bezpecne online’/‘Prague safe online’ educational project is one of the successful  and dynamic developing NCBI projects. In 2011, the pilot of the project started raising the  awareness of all the competent people of the selected Prague districts, the municipality  prevention officers, school representatives, social workers and police officers. The model  gave very good results. This is why, in 2012, the project, focusing on other Prague districts  were run on the basis of community education. In 2013 the project is still running in Prague  with increased number of participants and the same model is also used for the other regions  of the Czech Republic.  The Czech community education model has proved to be an efficient way of involving all the  groups dealing with children and young people at risk of online communication. The  participants’ feedback was very positive, evaluating the activities as very useful and  professional.  http://www.saferinternet.cz/  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  9  Next steps  The NCBI will also pursue its community model of education focusing on the awareness raising and  prevention of online delinquency and crime committed against and by children and young people in  other localities of the Czech Republic.

Germany: the 10th anniversary of the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to  increase awareness (13)  Background  The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is responsible for raising the awareness of German  citizens in the various subjects of Internet and IT security. The BSI provides practical guidance on the  secure handling of electronic communication media. To this end, a series of measures to raise public  awareness are implemented continuously, e.g. regular press activities, events like trade fairs or open  days, material such as brochures and posters, the citizens’ online portal (http://www.bsi-fuer- buerger.de) and the citizen CERT newsletter providing information on general developments and  warnings in case of security incidents and security gaps. Furthermore, since 2010, the BSI runs a  service centre as point of contact for citizens, on all questions regarding IT and Internet security  issues. It offers independent advice and guidance to private users. The service centre is available via  phone and email from Monday to Friday between 8 am and 6 pm. In case of enquiries beyond the  so-called first level, the BSI’s various technical departments are called upon to assist in answering  citizens’ questions.  In addition to these regular activities, the BSI also  makes use of further suitable opportunities to  raise public awareness of IT security, one of these  being the 10th anniversary of the Safer Internet  Day, on 5 February 2013.  Definition of subjects for concrete assistance  In order to provide direct access to private users as a target group and to offer simple and viable  solutions, the activities focused on two main topics:  1. Secure mobile use of the Internet;  2. Strong passwords to increase security.  The PR activities started with a radio feature on mobile Internet. The aim was to make private users  aware that their mobile devices are small computers which need to be protected against  unauthorised access. Another aim was to create awareness that — due to their capability of  providing Internet access — smartphones have the same protection requirements as the PC at  home. A description of the risks was linked to associated information on security.

Do not leave the device unattended  2. Enable all existing locking mechanisms such as PIN and display lock  3. Avoid entering sensitive data using public networks  4. Install apps only from trusted sources and check the rights granted to the application  5. Install all available software updates on your device.  To reach a wide audience, the topic was tackled with the help of a broadcast service provider. In  addition to the inclusion of an expert interview with previously defined questions, an independent  ready-to-broadcast programme was produced. Both elements, radio programme and interview,  were offered in the German-speaking broadcast area in the week prior to and on the Safer Internet  Day on 5 February 2013, and aired around 40 times around the anniversary date. The programmes  thus reached an audience of nearly 4 million radio listeners.  Strong passwords and strong partners  To increase the awareness of password security, the BSI decided to cooperate with a strong partner.  The Police Crime Prevention of the Federal States and the Federal Government (ProPK) supported  the concept and implementation of the activities. A representative survey14 among German Internet  users was conducted by the market research institute, TNS Emnid, in order to obtain up-to-date and  reliable figures regarding the use of passwords by German Internet users.  Password security among German Internet users  The results of the survey allowed some interesting conclusions regarding the way in which the  respondents use their passwords. In order to keep the message on how to generate a secure  password short, the presentation focused on a particularly distinctive fact: the survey showed that  more than half of the Internet users questioned do not assign an individual password for each online  service they use.  14  TNS Emnid BSI  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  12  This fact was used as a message and paired with the most important advice on secure password  generation. While the BSI focused on technical assistance, their cooperation partner, ProPK, outlined  the potential consequences under criminal law. These two perspectives ideally complemented each  other to highlight the importance of a well-chosen password. The message was published via the  various communication channels of the BSI and ProPK on 29 January 2013, one week before the  Safer Internet Day. In addition, the topic was featured in a prominent place and complemented by  additional information and further references on the BSI’s citizens’ portal (http://www.bsi-fuer- buerger.de) and the website of ProPK.  Multipliers increase public awareness  As well as the BSI’s and ProPK’s various newsletters, the message was also sent to different  multiplier groups and journalists. This generated further synergy effects such as subject-related  interview requests by radio stations. Furthermore, BSI successfully addressed women on IT security  matters in the online environment via women-specific media.  The BSI used the International Safer Internet Day to place a number of important IT security topics  attracting media coverage. Thanks to the support of cooperation partner ProPK, it was possible to  address important target groups beyond the BSI channels to make them aware of the relevance of IT  security. The qualitative and quantitative responses to the implemented measures prove that  continuous cooperation at a national and international level is an important component of  awareness-raising measures for private users on IT security.  http://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/ http://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  13  2.3. Norway: Norwegian Centre for Information Security (15)  Background  The Norwegian Centre for Information Security (NorSIS) is part of Norway’s focus on information  security. Their aim is to make information security a natural part of everyone’s daily life.  The primary target groups are small and medium-sized enterprises as well as public authorities. They  also try to accommodate requests from the public. Their ambition is to provide services for every  part of the society. NorSIS will try to reach its objectives through:   raising awareness about information security through training and information;   the compilation and creation of guidelines and tutorials concerning information security  topics;   Establishing an overall awareness towards information security.  NorSIS has over 10 years of experience and has nine employees. NorSIS reports to the Ministry of  Justice (16) and public security.  Our tools to do our job  To reach out with the message, they need to structure their communication and actions through the  media. They have a very good relationship with the Norwegian  press, and are also often contacted by journalists as experts in  matters concerning ‘information security’, trends and threat  reports. Since NorSIS is an independent organisation, their  voice and guiding are valued by journalists from all types of  media (daily press/finance).  They also present new research to the media, together with  the public and the private sector.  ‘Arena that they created’  Since they are asked to assist both the public and private sector, they work hard to create different  arenas for sharing information and knowledge about information security. For instance:  −  organise presentations when requested for businesses, the public or schools;  −  arrange about 15 different conferences each year — some are specific adjusted to different  branches as oil, energy/power industry, maritime and public sector;  −  Arrange ‘Security top meetings’ that are for invited guests only and limited to about 40  participants from the public and the private sector. This meeting is based on the ‘Chatham’s  rules’ and a report is made afterwards for participants only;  −  also communicate through  four different webpages:  1. http://www.norsis.no (about  organisation, what they do, information, updates and how  they work),  2. http://www.sikkert.no (about National Security Month),  3. http://www.slettmeg.no (about help to delete info/pictures/films ),  (  15 ) Birgitte Førsund, Norwegian Centre for Information Security (http://www.norsis.no).

This work is made possible through the sponsor of the program which  invites businesses to join the work. The sponsor program for National Security Month is the  most popular and they had more than 20 sponsors this year.  Examples of what they do and how  1. Internet voting/2013  The government conducted another pilot of Internet voting for the parliamentary election of 2013,  due to the positive experience from the pilot scheme in 2011. The Ministry of Local Government and  Regional Development therefore contacted NorSIS. Their job in this matter is to arrange courses in  each of the 12 municipalities which were chosen for this pilot scheme. NorSIS developed courses  based on guiding from the ministry. This means teaching voters to be ‘digital election observers’.  Recruiting volunteer observers was done together with the municipalities. They used the local press  to get publicity and the municipalities' webpages and social media. In August 2013, NorSIS advisors  travelled around Norway to teach voters how to be ‘digital election observers’ (17). If anyone  experiences anything wrong, they can report to the helpdesk at the ministry.  2. National Security Month/October 2013  NorSIS is responsible for ‘National Security Month’ based on an initiative from ENISA (18).  This is the third year they organise the National Security Month in Norway and interest in the event  has grown — from the government, press, businesses, sponsors and people in general. This year  they already have more sponsors than last year, as for instance, the National Cyber Force and  Norman (http://www.norman.com). More information can be found, but only in Norwegian  (http://www.sikkert.no). They also aimed to sell training packages for employees about information  security to businesses all over the country, and work hard to get media coverage. They arranged a  press conference and a kick-off event. In October, they shared speeches/communications from  voluntary security experts for businesses in Norway.  3. Slettmeg.no (translated to ‘delete me’)  ‘Slettmeg’ (19) is a service from the Norwegian Centre for Information Security (NorSIS). The purpose  of this service is to help people who experience privacy violations online. The service was launched  in March 2010. It is often referred to in the media and young people in particular need this service —  for instance when it comes to Facebook pictures, bullying, or other offensive things.

As an independent organisation,  they continue to create arenas for sharing, education and increased awareness about information  security. The National Security Month has been important for them to create a stronger public– private partnership and to get public attention about a topic that affects us all. Their role as  ‘coordinator’ and ‘facilitator’ in the security branch in Norway has been even more important lately,  since they are now, and will in the future be, relaying on more interdisciplinary solutions to handle  cybercrime.  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  16  3. Conclusion  The Brokerage model for Network and Information security in Education report provides content and  promotes digital education on network and information security at all levels. In an attempt to draw  the conclusions we would like to mention the following:   The terms hackers and hacking should be used taking into consideration the context, the  background and the community behind it;   From the Czech example we found out that online safety literacy increased in local  communities by involving all competent groups and encouraging them to start  communicating with each other, share their newly gained knowledge and experience, and  recommend further activities. The community education model proved to be an efficient  way to involve all the groups dealing with the risks of online communication. The Czech  Safer Internet Centre (NCBI) is going to use the model in other regions too.   From the German example, we note that Safer Internet Day may be used for a larger  purpose, to raise awareness and attract media coverage. With the support of cooperation  partner, ProPK, it was possible to address important target groups beyond the BSI channels  to make them aware of the relevance of IT security. The qualitative and quantitative  responses to the implemented measures prove that continuous cooperation at a national  and international level is an important component of awareness-raising measures for private  users on IT security.   From the Norwegian example we learn the importance of creating different arenas for  sharing information and knowledge about information security. NorSIS, established as a  ‘voice of authority’, continues to generate arenas for sharing and for education. The  National Security Month has been important to build a stronger public–private partnership  and to get public attention. In future, they will be relying on more interdisciplinary solutions.  With these examples we have seen different brokerage models for network and information security  in education that can be shared across European countries to actively educate the ‘digital citizens’.  As recommendations to be taken into account by NIS in Education stakeholders from Member States  we mention:  - Learning experiences on hacking should be organized with a clear focus on educational  purpose vs. legal implications of misbehaviour;  - Hacker contests and Cyber Challenges should be focusing on protection and receiving tips on  preventive actions;  - The community education model  should be given further considerations;  - Emphasize on the importance of awareness-raising measures as a continuous cooperation at  both national and international levels;  - Relying on more interdisciplinary solutions.  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  17  Regarding the general process we draw the attention on the following recommendations:  1. ENISA and EC should address Cyber Security awareness at all levels in different arenas for sharing  information.  2. Awareness organisations should pursue Public-Private partnerships in their Educational attempts  towards the digital users.  3. NIS in Education community members should target specific stakeholders with different methods  and specific content  Stepping up the national effort on network information security education and  training are the main priorities  Our future target will be to search for best practices at country level and pick up top practices to be  scaled up at regional, European and international levels.

The first definition refers to the hobby/profession of  working with computers. The second definition refers to breaking into computer systems.  While the first definition is older and is still used by many computer enthusiasts (who refer  to cyber criminals as ‘crackers’), the second definition is much more commonly used. In  particular, the webpages here refer to ‘hackers’ simply because our web-server logs show  that everyone who reaches these pages are using the second definition as part of their  search criteria.  Internet Security System, Hacking  http://www.iss.net/security_center/advice/Underground/Hacking/default.htm   Hacker is a term used by some to mean ‘a clever programmer’ and by others, especially  those in popular media, to mean ‘someone who tries to break into computer systems’.  (1) Eric Raymond, compiler of The New Hacker’s Dictionary, defines a hacker as a clever  programmer. A ‘good hack’ is a clever solution to a programming problem and ‘hacking’ is the  act of doing it. Raymond lists five possible characteristics that qualify one as a hacker, which we  paraphrase here as:   a person who enjoys learning details of a programming language or system;   a person who enjoys actually doing the programming rather than just theorizing about it;   a person capable of appreciating someone else’s hacking;   a person who picks up programming quickly;   A person who is an expert at a particular programming language or system, as in  ‘UNIX hacker’.  Raymond deprecates the use of this term for someone who attempts to crack someone else’s  system or otherwise uses programming or expert knowledge to act maliciously. He prefers the term  cracker for this meaning.  (2) The term hacker is used in popular media to describe someone who attempts to break into  computer systems. Typically, this kind of hacker would be a proficient programmer or engineer  with sufficient technical knowledge to understand the weak points in a security system. For  more on this usage, see cracker.

The target group is composed of educators such as trainers, teachers and peers involved in  formal education and non-formal education, including lifelong learning.In our current brokerage  effort we try to connect the nodes in the best way possible by presenting three case studies with  countries perspective, from the Czech Safer Internet Centre (NCBI), ‘Strategy of community  education in project — Prague safe online’, from German partners, the Federal Office for  Information Security (BSI), ‘10th anniversary of the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to  increase awareness’, and from Norwegian partners, ‘Norwegian Centre for Information Security’.  Furthermore we open a discussion about hacking. ‘Hacking for good or for bad’ is a case study  to  advance the use of appropriate terms by the NIS in Education community, taking into account the  particularity of the given ecosystem.  In order to raise awareness of our target group we share the  view that everybody should take part in the discussion and share the responsibility of a secure global  digital community. As recommendations to be taken into account by NIS in Education stakeholders  from Member States we mention:  - Learning experiences on hacking should be organized with a clear focus on educational purpose vs  legal implications of misbehaviour;  - Hacker contests and Cyber Challenges should be focusing on protection and receiving tips on  preventive actions;  - The community education model  should be given further considerations;  - Emphasize on the importance of awareness-raising measures as a continuos cooperation at both  national and international levels;  - Relying on more interdisciplinary solutions.  Regarding the general procees we draw the attention on  the following recommendations:  1. ENISA and EC should address Cyber Security awareness at all levels in different arenas for sharing  information.  2. Awareness organisations should pursue Public-Private partnerships in their Educational attempts towards  the digital users.  3. NIS in Education community members should target specific stakeholders with different methods and  specific content  The brokerage model for education is thus in focus in the three case studies and we are interested in  consulting more partners in the future to identify their brokerage model.  Essential questions: What content in particular should we share? Which stakeholders  do we involve? What are the methods that we deploy?

Introduction  The Brokerage model for Network and Information Security in Education report is a continuation of  Collaborative solutions for network information security in education (4) (2012), and Network  information security in education: consolidated ENISA contribution (5) (2011). In 2012, we argued  that brokerage of information is at the root of the learning cycle and we provided details to justify  this by using practical examples from Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg. Our main  recommendations were that we should all learn from our peers’ best practices and share our own  experiences. We also recommended that a ‘can do attitude’ should be deployed both by educators  and by their students of different age groups.  We started with digital education work at ENISA and in this spirit we have been working, throughout  2013, in order to gather evidence on the newest developments and to share ideas among NIS  communities.  Furthermore, our main goal in publishing this report was to provide material to the target group and  promote digital education on network information security.  The main target group of our report is the same as in previous years. It consists of educators such as  trainers, teachers and peers involved in formal education and non-formal education including  lifelong learning.  The significant role of educators must not be omitted from any ICT stakeholder  map!  We consider cyber security as an enabler and not as a burden, and by concentrating on education  we want to emphasise the need to bring the various competences and capabilities of the EU  Member States up to speed. Our main goals are to achieve ‘Cyber hygiene’, ‘Netiquette’ and being a  ‘good digital citizen’ by involving the users through our partners and specialized communities.  In our current brokerage effort we try to connect the nodes in the best way possible and as a result  we present three case studies with countries perspectives, from Czech partners, ‘Strategy of  community education in project —Prague safe online’, from German partners, ‘10th anniversary of  the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to increase awareness’, and from Norwegian  partners, ‘Norwegian Centre for Information Security’. The brokerage model for education is in the  spotlight in the three case studies and we are interested in consulting more partners in the future  regarding their brokerage model.

As mentioned in current and previous education work our main  goals are to achieve ‘Cyber hygiene’ or ‘Netiquette’ by involving the users through our partners and  specialized communities like this one of educators. In June 2012, 45 EU and US representatives from  the private and public sectors gathered in Brussels to discuss the topic of involving Intermediaries in  Cyber Security awareness, summarized in an ENISA report7. In that event Dr. Timmers the EC  CONNECT’s keynote speaker set the challenge to find ways to make hacking better understood and  more suitable as use. It was mentioned that awareness effort may concentrate on ‘finding ways to  make hacking uncool’. We follow up with a case study on the current use of the term, because we  believe that the education practitioners and all other partners in awareness raising should have a  clear and common understanding of the term and a unified message to transmit.  How many times a week do you read an article on cyber security and hacking? Although both are  popular buzz words and powerful hash tags on social networks, they are also of paramount  importance in our daily life at work or during our spare time. In order to raise awareness we are of  the opinion that everybody should be part of the discussion and share the responsibility of a secure  global digital community. We therefore want to develop on a few considerations about hacking.  ‘Hacking for good or for bad’ is an attempt to advance the use of appropriate terms by the NIS in  Education community, taking into account the particularity of the given ecosystem.  The network and information security world uses technical terms on a daily basis and we might  easily get caught in discussions about ‘botnets’, ‘bullying’, ‘spamming’, ‘identity theft’, ‘denial of  (  6 )Many ENISA colleagues contributed with opinions in a thematic discussion and we thank them all; also  Annex A contains direct links to thematic materials.

Not always do experts or outsiders agree on the definition of these terms – and often terms start to  live a life of their own.  A good example is hacking. Do we use hacking for good or for bad? What do  you think?  Objective  Following the whole debate and reading publications of various actors, we observed that the  controversy about the term ‘hacking’ is still very much alive. It is not a new debate and we do not  think that it will end soon as the term is evolving. However, we felt the need to participate with a  short summary of the current status. It will represent a common ground for the NIS education  community to further transmit a common message to European users. The purpose of the trial is to  emphasize on the contextual meaning of the term ‘hacking’.  Considerations to take into account  Hacking is what hackers do with the high skills and knowledge they possess. However, the term can  have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In ENISA’s education reports  we advocate for good cyber security education in the EU, mentioning labs and hands on experience.  Furthermore, we promote the saying ‘do not learn to hack, but hack to learn’ (8).  The shared opinion is that hacking is a neutral term, and that the discussion about ethical-‘good  hackingֹ’ and unethical- ‘bad hacking’ has to be put into context. For example, hacking is ‘uncool’  when it is done with malicious intent and hacking is ‘cool’ when it is done with good intent (9).  Hacking is neither good nor bad. ‘Cracking’ would be a better term to use when speaking about bad  hacking.  However, it is primarily a mind-set: a way of thinking about security. Its main focus is on attacking  systems, but at the same time it is also invaluable for defending those same systems. Because  computer systems are very complex, defending them often requires experts to think like attackers.  Admittedly, there is a big difference between thinking like an attacker and acting unlawfully; and  also between researching vulnerabilities in fielded systems and exploiting those vulnerabilities for  personal gain.  The terms hackers and hacking should be used, taking into consideration the  context, the background and the community behind it.  Hackers have been around in our society for a long time. Hackers are sometimes described as  curious, analytical, innovation-oriented and open-minded experts. However, the sword is double- edged, in the same way that a locksmith’s skills is used to help people, but his expertise could also  be used to break into somebody’s home. Such skills, which can be used to cause great harm, create  fear and suspicion in people. However they can also be of great educational value. People are all  different. For some it is educational and interesting to see how computers and applications work in  depth, whilst others make a living by finding vulnerabilities in computer software and hardware and  selling them to people who are willing to pay for the ability to easily break into computers.

Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  4  Next steps  In order to clearly set the objective on the learning experience and fill the gaps between the roles of  ethical and unethical hacking in society, we recommend the following for a better use of the term:  - Labs, classes and trainings on hacking should be organized with a clear focus on  understanding the educational purpose vs. legal implications of misbehaviour;  - Hacker contests and Cyber Challenges should be focusing on protection and receiving tips on  preventive actions.  As a conclusion for good cyber security in the EU, MSs should better integrate NIS in public policies  in education meant to enhance the technical skills of users and the general understanding of  concepts. A summary with remarks is depicted in the graph below:  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  5  2. Case studies at country level experience  In this chapter we describe experiences at country level, in the Czech Republic, Germany and  Norway. We are looking for a brokerage model for network and information security in education  that could be shared across European countries to actively educate the digital citizen.  The EU cyber security ‘An open, safe and secure cyberspace’ strategy (10) mentions the development  of a roadmap for a ‘network and information security driving licence’ as a voluntary certification  programme to promote enhanced skills and IT competence and other techniques for user  empowerment such as cyber security championships, ‘Capture the flag’ competitions, the ‘European  Cyber Security Month’ advocacy campaign, aligned with other global efforts. Additionally, the  strategy calls to ‘step up national efforts on NIS education and training’ (11), by introducing training  on NIS in schools by 2014, training on NIS and secure software development and personal data  protection for computer science students, and NIS basic training for staff working in public  administrations. ENISA has started the consultation process in order to involve the relevant  stakeholders and guide the process for quality results during the next years. We are also keen to  search for best practices at country level and pick up the practice to be scaled up to regional,  European and international levels.  Promote cyber security awareness at all levels!  (  10 ) http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667 (accessed  in October 2013).

The Czech Republic: strategy of community education in the  ‘Praha bezpecne online‘/‘Prague safe online’ project (12)  Background  The Národní centrum bezpecnejsiho internetu/Czech Safer Internet Centre (NCBI) is a non- governmental, non-profit-making working association established to carry out the tasks related to  knowledge-building, education and exchange of best practice in the field of safer use of the Internet  and new media. It carries out various awareness-raising activities focused on children, their parents  and teachers, and strives to engage Czech stakeholders in the promotion of safer use of the Internet.  Objective  The main objective of educational project ‘Praha bezpecne online‘/‘Prague safe online’ is the social  protection, especially of children and young people, from the risky phenomena arising online and  thus preventing online crime targeting children or committed by the youth themselves. The project  raises awareness about safer use of the Internet and new media, and reduces the risk factors of  online delinquency. The most important risk factors were determined as:   minimum knowledge of elementary school  pupils and high schools students about the  risks of online communication and online-  delinquency;   high level of technical knowledge of pupils  and students concerning information and  communication technologies;   high accessibility of information and  communication devices;   immature personal, social and moral  competences of young Internet users ;   Low awareness of the legal consequences of some acts performed online (criminal  consequences of some patterns of online behaviour, protection of personal rights and  copyrights by the criminal code, etc.);   low (or zero) awareness of educators and prevention school specialists of online risks and  online delinquency;   Low (or zero) knowledge of information and communication technology teachers, especially  about Internet services (social networks, instant messengers, etc.);   absence of education on the safe and ethical use of the Internet and new media in the  elementary and high school curricula;   low awareness of the public, especially parents, about the online risks and delinquency  connected to the use of the Internet and the possibilities of children and youth protection;   Limited time parents spent with their children.

This is the main idea behind the  community education, which focuses on the maximum number of specialists who can solve  crisis situations connected with the online behaviour of pupils. By linking up these  specialists, a ‘safety net’ that can efficiently operate at the local basis, is created. In the same  time frame, they work with the parents of the pupils of all the local elementary schools, and  of course also with the children themselves.  The following groups were involved in the project:  — Elementary school children;  — parents;  — Educators (teachers, headmasters, school prevention specialists);  — Specialists working with children (social workers, pedagogical-psychological  counseling workers);  — The municipality’s prevention specialists;  — police officers from the area (mostly prevention specialists working with schools),  probation and mediation service specialists.  Working with all the above-mentioned groups in the same time frame increases the  motivation and interest about the topics of the particular groups. In a relatively short period  of time, online safety literacy increases in the local community. All the groups involved start  communicating with one another, share their newly gained knowledge and experience, and  recommend further activities. Schools gain concrete partners for solving problematic  situations from the municipality, the police, pedagogical-psychological counseling services;  parents, one of the least easily accessible groups, become aware of the extent of the  problem and their motivation to actively participate increases.  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  8  To target the widest public, the project is accompanied by public awareness campaigns:  — PR in conventional media (articles in newspapers, TV shots, reports from the events,  interviews mostly on local TV, radio broadcasting, etc.);  — Outdoor campaigns (posters, city light screens);  — Internet (http://www.saferinternet.cz) websites and websites of cooperating  institutions (municipality, Ministry of the Interior, information stalls in schools and  other institutions);  — Indoor campaigns (using school facilities, offices of cooperating institutions, etc.).  Every session of the project ends with a national conference. The audience consists of  professionals from the groups mentioned above, and of an interested public. These events  also attract the media and stakeholders.  Results  The ‘Praha bezpecne online’/‘Prague safe online’ educational project is one of the successful  and dynamic developing NCBI projects. In 2011, the pilot of the project started raising the  awareness of all the competent people of the selected Prague districts, the municipality  prevention officers, school representatives, social workers and police officers. The model  gave very good results. This is why, in 2012, the project, focusing on other Prague districts  were run on the basis of community education. In 2013 the project is still running in Prague  with increased number of participants and the same model is also used for the other regions  of the Czech Republic.  The Czech community education model has proved to be an efficient way of involving all the  groups dealing with children and young people at risk of online communication. The  participants’ feedback was very positive, evaluating the activities as very useful and  professional.  http://www.saferinternet.cz/  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  9  Next steps  The NCBI will also pursue its community model of education focusing on the awareness raising and  prevention of online delinquency and crime committed against and by children and young people in  other localities of the Czech Republic.

Germany: the 10th anniversary of the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to  increase awareness (13)  Background  The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is responsible for raising the awareness of German  citizens in the various subjects of Internet and IT security. The BSI provides practical guidance on the  secure handling of electronic communication media. To this end, a series of measures to raise public  awareness are implemented continuously, e.g. regular press activities, events like trade fairs or open  days, material such as brochures and posters, the citizens’ online portal (http://www.bsi-fuer- buerger.de) and the citizen CERT newsletter providing information on general developments and  warnings in case of security incidents and security gaps. Furthermore, since 2010, the BSI runs a  service centre as point of contact for citizens, on all questions regarding IT and Internet security  issues. It offers independent advice and guidance to private users. The service centre is available via  phone and email from Monday to Friday between 8 am and 6 pm. In case of enquiries beyond the  so-called first level, the BSI’s various technical departments are called upon to assist in answering  citizens’ questions.  In addition to these regular activities, the BSI also  makes use of further suitable opportunities to  raise public awareness of IT security, one of these  being the 10th anniversary of the Safer Internet  Day, on 5 February 2013.  Definition of subjects for concrete assistance  In order to provide direct access to private users as a target group and to offer simple and viable  solutions, the activities focused on two main topics:  1. Secure mobile use of the Internet;  2. Strong passwords to increase security.  The PR activities started with a radio feature on mobile Internet. The aim was to make private users  aware that their mobile devices are small computers which need to be protected against  unauthorised access. Another aim was to create awareness that — due to their capability of  providing Internet access — smartphones have the same protection requirements as the PC at  home. A description of the risks was linked to associated information on security.

Do not leave the device unattended  2. Enable all existing locking mechanisms such as PIN and display lock  3. Avoid entering sensitive data using public networks  4. Install apps only from trusted sources and check the rights granted to the application  5. Install all available software updates on your device.  To reach a wide audience, the topic was tackled with the help of a broadcast service provider. In  addition to the inclusion of an expert interview with previously defined questions, an independent  ready-to-broadcast programme was produced. Both elements, radio programme and interview,  were offered in the German-speaking broadcast area in the week prior to and on the Safer Internet  Day on 5 February 2013, and aired around 40 times around the anniversary date. The programmes  thus reached an audience of nearly 4 million radio listeners.  Strong passwords and strong partners  To increase the awareness of password security, the BSI decided to cooperate with a strong partner.  The Police Crime Prevention of the Federal States and the Federal Government (ProPK) supported  the concept and implementation of the activities. A representative survey14 among German Internet  users was conducted by the market research institute, TNS Emnid, in order to obtain up-to-date and  reliable figures regarding the use of passwords by German Internet users.  Password security among German Internet users  The results of the survey allowed some interesting conclusions regarding the way in which the  respondents use their passwords. In order to keep the message on how to generate a secure  password short, the presentation focused on a particularly distinctive fact: the survey showed that  more than half of the Internet users questioned do not assign an individual password for each online  service they use.  14  TNS Emnid BSI  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  12  This fact was used as a message and paired with the most important advice on secure password  generation. While the BSI focused on technical assistance, their cooperation partner, ProPK, outlined  the potential consequences under criminal law. These two perspectives ideally complemented each  other to highlight the importance of a well-chosen password. The message was published via the  various communication channels of the BSI and ProPK on 29 January 2013, one week before the  Safer Internet Day. In addition, the topic was featured in a prominent place and complemented by  additional information and further references on the BSI’s citizens’ portal (http://www.bsi-fuer- buerger.de) and the website of ProPK.  Multipliers increase public awareness  As well as the BSI’s and ProPK’s various newsletters, the message was also sent to different  multiplier groups and journalists. This generated further synergy effects such as subject-related  interview requests by radio stations. Furthermore, BSI successfully addressed women on IT security  matters in the online environment via women-specific media.  The BSI used the International Safer Internet Day to place a number of important IT security topics  attracting media coverage. Thanks to the support of cooperation partner ProPK, it was possible to  address important target groups beyond the BSI channels to make them aware of the relevance of IT  security. The qualitative and quantitative responses to the implemented measures prove that  continuous cooperation at a national and international level is an important component of  awareness-raising measures for private users on IT security.  http://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/ http://www.bsi-fuer-buerger.de/  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  13  2.3. Norway: Norwegian Centre for Information Security (15)  Background  The Norwegian Centre for Information Security (NorSIS) is part of Norway’s focus on information  security. Their aim is to make information security a natural part of everyone’s daily life.  The primary target groups are small and medium-sized enterprises as well as public authorities. They  also try to accommodate requests from the public. Their ambition is to provide services for every  part of the society. NorSIS will try to reach its objectives through:   raising awareness about information security through training and information;   the compilation and creation of guidelines and tutorials concerning information security  topics;   Establishing an overall awareness towards information security.  NorSIS has over 10 years of experience and has nine employees. NorSIS reports to the Ministry of  Justice (16) and public security.  Our tools to do our job  To reach out with the message, they need to structure their communication and actions through the  media. They have a very good relationship with the Norwegian  press, and are also often contacted by journalists as experts in  matters concerning ‘information security’, trends and threat  reports. Since NorSIS is an independent organisation, their  voice and guiding are valued by journalists from all types of  media (daily press/finance).  They also present new research to the media, together with  the public and the private sector.  ‘Arena that they created’  Since they are asked to assist both the public and private sector, they work hard to create different  arenas for sharing information and knowledge about information security. For instance:  −  organise presentations when requested for businesses, the public or schools;  −  arrange about 15 different conferences each year — some are specific adjusted to different  branches as oil, energy/power industry, maritime and public sector;  −  Arrange ‘Security top meetings’ that are for invited guests only and limited to about 40  participants from the public and the private sector. This meeting is based on the ‘Chatham’s  rules’ and a report is made afterwards for participants only;  −  also communicate through  four different webpages:  1. http://www.norsis.no (about  organisation, what they do, information, updates and how  they work),  2. http://www.sikkert.no (about National Security Month),  3. http://www.slettmeg.no (about help to delete info/pictures/films ),  (  15 ) Birgitte Førsund, Norwegian Centre for Information Security (http://www.norsis.no).

This work is made possible through the sponsor of the program which  invites businesses to join the work. The sponsor program for National Security Month is the  most popular and they had more than 20 sponsors this year.  Examples of what they do and how  1. Internet voting/2013  The government conducted another pilot of Internet voting for the parliamentary election of 2013,  due to the positive experience from the pilot scheme in 2011. The Ministry of Local Government and  Regional Development therefore contacted NorSIS. Their job in this matter is to arrange courses in  each of the 12 municipalities which were chosen for this pilot scheme. NorSIS developed courses  based on guiding from the ministry. This means teaching voters to be ‘digital election observers’.  Recruiting volunteer observers was done together with the municipalities. They used the local press  to get publicity and the municipalities' webpages and social media. In August 2013, NorSIS advisors  travelled around Norway to teach voters how to be ‘digital election observers’ (17). If anyone  experiences anything wrong, they can report to the helpdesk at the ministry.  2. National Security Month/October 2013  NorSIS is responsible for ‘National Security Month’ based on an initiative from ENISA (18).  This is the third year they organise the National Security Month in Norway and interest in the event  has grown — from the government, press, businesses, sponsors and people in general. This year  they already have more sponsors than last year, as for instance, the National Cyber Force and  Norman (http://www.norman.com). More information can be found, but only in Norwegian  (http://www.sikkert.no). They also aimed to sell training packages for employees about information  security to businesses all over the country, and work hard to get media coverage. They arranged a  press conference and a kick-off event. In October, they shared speeches/communications from  voluntary security experts for businesses in Norway.  3. Slettmeg.no (translated to ‘delete me’)  ‘Slettmeg’ (19) is a service from the Norwegian Centre for Information Security (NorSIS). The purpose  of this service is to help people who experience privacy violations online. The service was launched  in March 2010. It is often referred to in the media and young people in particular need this service —  for instance when it comes to Facebook pictures, bullying, or other offensive things.

As an independent organisation,  they continue to create arenas for sharing, education and increased awareness about information  security. The National Security Month has been important for them to create a stronger public– private partnership and to get public attention about a topic that affects us all. Their role as  ‘coordinator’ and ‘facilitator’ in the security branch in Norway has been even more important lately,  since they are now, and will in the future be, relaying on more interdisciplinary solutions to handle  cybercrime.  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  16  3. Conclusion  The Brokerage model for Network and Information security in Education report provides content and  promotes digital education on network and information security at all levels. In an attempt to draw  the conclusions we would like to mention the following:   The terms hackers and hacking should be used taking into consideration the context, the  background and the community behind it;   From the Czech example we found out that online safety literacy increased in local  communities by involving all competent groups and encouraging them to start  communicating with each other, share their newly gained knowledge and experience, and  recommend further activities. The community education model proved to be an efficient  way to involve all the groups dealing with the risks of online communication. The Czech  Safer Internet Centre (NCBI) is going to use the model in other regions too.   From the German example, we note that Safer Internet Day may be used for a larger  purpose, to raise awareness and attract media coverage. With the support of cooperation  partner, ProPK, it was possible to address important target groups beyond the BSI channels  to make them aware of the relevance of IT security. The qualitative and quantitative  responses to the implemented measures prove that continuous cooperation at a national  and international level is an important component of awareness-raising measures for private  users on IT security.   From the Norwegian example we learn the importance of creating different arenas for  sharing information and knowledge about information security. NorSIS, established as a  ‘voice of authority’, continues to generate arenas for sharing and for education. The  National Security Month has been important to build a stronger public–private partnership  and to get public attention. In future, they will be relying on more interdisciplinary solutions.  With these examples we have seen different brokerage models for network and information security  in education that can be shared across European countries to actively educate the ‘digital citizens’.  As recommendations to be taken into account by NIS in Education stakeholders from Member States  we mention:  - Learning experiences on hacking should be organized with a clear focus on educational  purpose vs. legal implications of misbehaviour;  - Hacker contests and Cyber Challenges should be focusing on protection and receiving tips on  preventive actions;  - The community education model  should be given further considerations;  - Emphasize on the importance of awareness-raising measures as a continuous cooperation at  both national and international levels;  - Relying on more interdisciplinary solutions.  Brokerage model for network information security in education  Case studies  2013  Page  17  Regarding the general process we draw the attention on the following recommendations:  1. ENISA and EC should address Cyber Security awareness at all levels in different arenas for sharing  information.  2. Awareness organisations should pursue Public-Private partnerships in their Educational attempts  towards the digital users.  3. NIS in Education community members should target specific stakeholders with different methods  and specific content  Stepping up the national effort on network information security education and  training are the main priorities  Our future target will be to search for best practices at country level and pick up top practices to be  scaled up at regional, European and international levels.

The first definition refers to the hobby/profession of  working with computers. The second definition refers to breaking into computer systems.  While the first definition is older and is still used by many computer enthusiasts (who refer  to cyber criminals as ‘crackers’), the second definition is much more commonly used. In  particular, the webpages here refer to ‘hackers’ simply because our web-server logs show  that everyone who reaches these pages are using the second definition as part of their  search criteria.  Internet Security System, Hacking  http://www.iss.net/security_center/advice/Underground/Hacking/default.htm   Hacker is a term used by some to mean ‘a clever programmer’ and by others, especially  those in popular media, to mean ‘someone who tries to break into computer systems’.  (1) Eric Raymond, compiler of The New Hacker’s Dictionary, defines a hacker as a clever  programmer. A ‘good hack’ is a clever solution to a programming problem and ‘hacking’ is the  act of doing it. Raymond lists five possible characteristics that qualify one as a hacker, which we  paraphrase here as:   a person who enjoys learning details of a programming language or system;   a person who enjoys actually doing the programming rather than just theorizing about it;   a person capable of appreciating someone else’s hacking;   a person who picks up programming quickly;   A person who is an expert at a particular programming language or system, as in  ‘UNIX hacker’.  Raymond deprecates the use of this term for someone who attempts to crack someone else’s  system or otherwise uses programming or expert knowledge to act maliciously. He prefers the term  cracker for this meaning.  (2) The term hacker is used in popular media to describe someone who attempts to break into  computer systems. Typically, this kind of hacker would be a proficient programmer or engineer  with sufficient technical knowledge to understand the weak points in a security system. For  more on this usage, see cracker.

    "abstract": "By publishing the Brokerage model for Network & Information Security (NIS) in Education report, we aim to provide content and promote digital education on network and information security at all levels. The target group is composed of educators such as trainers, teachers and peers involved in formal education and non-formal education, including lifelong learning.In our current brokerage effort we try to connect the nodes in the best way possible by presenting three case studies with countries perspective, from the Czech Safer Internet Centre (NCBI), ‘Strategy of community education in project — Prague safe online’, from German partners, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), ‘10th anniversary of the Safer Internet Day provides an opportunity to increase awareness’, and from Norwegian partners, ‘Norwegian Centre for Information Security’. Furthermore we open a discussion about hacking. ‘Hacking for good or for bad’ is a case study to advance the use of appropriate terms by the NIS in Education community, taking into account the particularity of the given ecosystem. In order to raise awareness of our target group we share the view that everybody should take part in the discussion and share the responsibility of a secure global digital community."

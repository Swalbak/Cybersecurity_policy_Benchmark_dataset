The content of this report is based on an analysis of current publications on the establishment of  CSIRTs (the analysis is summarised in Annex B); a field questionnaire (Annex A), which was  completed by 40 CSIRTs and SOCs; and the authors’ experiences in establishing and  improving CSIRTs as part of numerous projects carried out in Europe, Asia, Africa and South  America.  A results-driven approach is taken throughout the publication to provide guidance on the  different stages involved in the establishment of a CSIRT or SOC organisation:   Assessment for readiness   Design   Implementation   Operations   Improvement.  The reader will receive practical guidance on what to focus on during the individual phases of  establishment and improvement.  Up to July 2020, ENISA had published 61 reports and 21 translated versions of reports  supporting CSIRTs on its website (1). ENISA’s training package (2) provides online training  materials, training courses and exercise materials for cybersecurity specialists, based on the  ‘Train the Trainer’ philosophy. This document aims to enhance ENISA’s existing body of  knowledge on the establishment of CSIRTs.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c8=CSIRTs  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c8=CSIRTs https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT OF THE WORK  Cybersecurity threats are increasing and becoming more complex. One of the most effective  ways to counter these threats is by creating a global ecosystem of computer security incident  response teams (CSIRTs) and security operations centres (SOCs) that can communicate, share  information and respond to cyberthreats effectively. This can be facilitated by providing relevant  frameworks and increasing the number of CSIRTs and SOCs around the world and the maturity  of existing CSIRTs and SOCs.  In Europe, ENISA is assisting Member States with their incident response capabilities by  providing them with various resources, such as documents, tools, materials and guidance. For  example, ENISA hosts a European CSIRT inventory – an interactive map on ENISA’s website  that gives an overview of publicly listed CSIRTs in Europe. In addition, the Study on CSIRT  landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025(3) looks at the overall status of CSIRTs’ incident  handling and response capabilities, while the EU Member States incident response  development status report(4) provides an insight into the NIS Directive(5) (Directive (EU)  2016/1148 on security of network and information systems) sectoral incident response  capabilities. ENISA has also carried out work in the field of national and governmental CSIRTs’  capabilities and incident response capabilities, including providing training material covering  some aspects of the development of CSIRTs.  To provide additional resources, a decision was made to publish guidelines and produce an  interactive online information repository to guide the establishment of different types of CSIRTs  and SOCs by building on the existing work of ENISA, especially in the areas of maturity and  training.  1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK  This publication provides results-driven guidance for those who are interested in establishing a  CSIRT or SOC or modernising a CSIRT or SOC in a structured way.  A results-driven approach is taken throughout the publication to provide guidance on the  different stages involved in the establishment of a CSIRT organisation: assessment for  readiness, design, implementation, operation and improvement.  The expectation is that the reader will use this publication as a practical guide during the  individual phases involved in the establishment of CSIRTs. Readers may be stakeholders of  CSIRTs that are to be established.  This report aims to encourage the establishment of CSIRTs and SOCs and provide practical  techniques to ensure that the establishment and improvement process is effective.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  A more mature  ecosystem of  CSIRTs and  SOCs enables  better  cooperation and  collective actions  to respond to  cyber security  threats  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  6  1.3 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  Existing documents on CSIRT establishment focus on activities to do, without elaborating much  on the resulting outcome. This publication aims to build a recurring process of improvement and  related deliverables during the growth and development of a CSIRT. It was designed in a way  that provides guidance for all CSIRTs no matter what development stage they are in or their  current maturity.  To achieve this result data gathering methods such as analysis of current publications on the  establishment of CSIRTs (the analysis is summarised in Annex B); a field questionnaire aimed  at established CSIRTs and SOCs (Annex A); and the authors’ and reviewers’ practical  experience in establishing and improving CSIRTs, were used. The objective was to make this  publication as close to real life as possible. For this reason citations from various CSIRT teams  as well as realistic costing and timing were included.  FIRST.org CSIRT Services Framework, as well as SIM3 assessment model are referred to as  companions in the process because they are widely respected when defining an initial service  catalogue for new CSIRT teams and for the assessment and development of CSIRT maturity.  1.4 DEFINITIONS OF CSIRT AND SOC  The most common terms used to describe the teams responsible for incident response handling  are CSIRT, CERT(6), and SOC.  1.4.1 Computer security incident response teams  The term CSIRT, or computer security incident response team, was established in the 1990s.  CSIRTs are also known as CIRTs (Computer incident response teams), CERTs (Computer  emergency response teams), SIRTs (Security incident response teams) among others. National  teams may also be called national cyber security centres (NCSCs), which by law are usually  assigned the CSIRT role as well as providing additional services for the nation (e.g. handling a  country’s information classification schemes). Each team chooses its name based on the  preference of the organisation.  CSIRT has become a generic name for a team that provides a set of services: information and  cybersecurity incident handling (core service), security monitoring, vulnerability management,  situational awareness and cybersecurity knowledge management.  In simpler terms, a CSIRT7 is a team that is assigned to handle computer security (thus, often,  cybersecurity) incidents. Often this includes additional responsibilities, from detection to  analysis, and even hands-on fixing, as well as different situational awareness, knowledge  transfer and vulnerability management activities. Over the years, the role of a CSIRT has  evolved from providing incident monitoring and handling services to coordinating and  communicating with different stakeholders, countries and specific sectors.  Currently, FIRST.org hosts and continuously improves a CSIRT Services Framework (8), which  is a high-level document that describes the activities carried out by CSIRTs. These activities are  organised into five main service areas, which are further split into services, functions and sub-  functions. A CSIRT can choose which of the services and functions are relevant to their  mandate and organise them into their own services structure. Although this framework does not  define a SOC framework, services from some of the areas can also be applicable to SOC  6 CERT, or computer emergency response team, is the oldest term and has been trademarked by the Software Engineering  Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  7 See CSIRT definition for example at “Baseline capabilities for national / governmental CERTs”  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs  8 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  7  teams. The CSIRT Services Framework is supported by ENISA, the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU) and many other organisations.  Typically, a minimal set of services for CSIRTs usually includes those those in bold below in  accordance with the FIRST services framework.  1.4.2 Security operations centres  A SOC, or security operations centre, provides an incident detection service by observing  technical events in networks and systems and can also be responsible for incident  response and handling. In large enterprises, SOCs sometimes focus only on monitoring and  detection services and then hand over incident handling to a separate CSIRT. In smaller  organisations, CSIRTs and SOCs are often considered to be synonymous.  Typically, SOC teams operate from SOC rooms, where analysts sit at their workstations in  front of a video wall that projects a summary of the current situation (Figure 2). SOC teams  typically evolve from information technology (IT) security teams automating their work using  security information and event management (SIEM) and other security automation and  orchestration technology for security monitoring. SOC teams usually focus their key  performance indicators (KPIs) around quality indicators – detection speed, detection  breadth, coverage, false-positive rates – as well as incidents handled, the ratio of  alerts/events/incidents, number of escalations and workload per incident.  ‘SOC is the first line,  they receive all alerts,  whereas IRT would  only receive escalated  alerts or be involved  in the coordination.  SOC is the  responsibility of our  members as we are a  sector CERT’  (sectorial CSIRT)  Figure 1: FIRST services framework – typical CSIRT services  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  8  As well as operating physically, SOCs can consist of virtual and outsourced staff, or a hybrid  model of internal and outsourced staff. It is common practice that, over time, SOCs alternate  between outsourced and internal operations.  As both CSIRT and SOC organisations adhere to the same CSIRT Services framework, both  CSIRTs and SOCs are referred to this report as CSIRTs.  Typically, a minimal set of services for SOCs usually includes those in bold below in accordance  with the FIRST services framework.

The foundational document on the establishment of a CSIRT is the CSIRT Setting up  Guide (10), published in 2006. It was translated into more than 20 languages, including  Chinese and Hindi. This 86-page publication covers the step-by-step process of creating a  CSIRT and is still valid today.  ENISA’s Good Practice Guide for Incident Management (11), published in 2010, provides  guidelines for establishing incident handling management structures and capabilities; it can  be used as a reference for establishment topics including incident handling processes and  workflows.  ENISA’s training package (12) provides online training materials, training courses and exercise  materials for cybersecurity specialists, based on the ‘Train the Trainer’ philosophy.  ENISA has also published a body of knowledge for national and governmental CSIRTs on, for  example, baseline capabilities (13) and maturity profiles (14), as well as a self-assessment tool.  In the past few years, ENISA has published a guidance document on CSIRT and law  enforcement partnerships (15), including an analysis of partnership models, technical  cooperation, electronic evidence analysis (16) and training modules. In addition, further  information on how to choose a CSIRT cooperation model and the technical implementation  of cooperation models is available from the ENISA website.  This report aims to enhance ENISA’s existing body of knowledge on the establishment of  CSIRTs. The content of this report is based on an analysis of previous publications on the  establishment of CSIRTs (the analysis is summarised in Annex B); a field questionnaire  (Annex A), which was completed by 40 CSIRTs and SOCs; and the authors’ experiences in  establishing and improving CSIRTs as part of numerous projects carried out in Europe,  Asia, Africa and South America.  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c8=CSIRTs  10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-setting-up-guide  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity  15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/support-the-fight-against-cybercrime-roadmap-on-csirt-le-cooperation  16 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/electronic-evidence-a-basic-guide-for-first-responders  ‘ENISA has excellent  publications which  are well organised  and easy to read and  understand’  (Unicom CSIRT)  ‘Most of the  publications and  guidance from  ENISA is relevant to  our effective work.

GUIDELINES FOR  ESTABLISHING CSIRTS  2.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDELINES  The guidelines for establishing CSIRTs are organised according to the different phases of the  CSIRT establishment (17) process:   Assessment for readiness   Design   Implementation   Operations   Improvement.  The establishment of a new CSIRT starts with the ‘assessment for readiness’ phase, which  begins with a discussion about the reasons and necessity for establishing a CSIRT and ends  with the approval of an initial budget and shaping requirements for the design phase.  During the ‘design’ phase, detailed plans for the implementation phase are developed.  The ‘implementation’ phase covers organisational matters: governance, people, processes,  services and technology.  In the ‘operations’ phase, a CSIRT delivers the CSIRT services.  Existing CSIRTs can follow the guidelines from the ‘improvement’ phase rather than from the  ‘assessment for readiness’ phase.  During the ‘improvement’ phase, a CSIRT formulates requests for improvements, prioritises  initiatives and receives an approved budged for following the ‘design–implementation–  operation–improvement’ cycle.  17 In this report ‘establishment’ refers to a CSIRT’s path from a conceptual idea to a strong and mature CSIRT several years  later or to advancing an existing CSIRT into further development stages.  Figure 4: Lifecycle of CSIRT  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  11  These guidelines are organised based on the outcomes of each phase.  1.

The percentages in Figure 6 represent the workload/time required for the different roles. For  example, ‘1 x Project manager 50 %’ means that one project manager is required and that the  required tasks will take up to 50 % of their maximum workload/time.  2.2 ASSESSMENT FOR READINESS  In the assessment for readiness phase, the following outcomes are expected.   Preliminary mandate   Governance structure   Identification of the CSIRT hosting organisation   High-level roadmap and budget   Detailed requirements for the design stage  Figure 6: Sample of CSIRT establishment phases and required efforts  Figure 7: Implementation phases  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  14  2.2.1 Preliminary mandate  A CSIRT begins with a purpose – the initial idea and reasons why a CSIRT is needed. The  establishment of a CSIRT must be justified.  The expectations of stakeholders and constituencies should be carefully considered before  deciding to establish a CSIRT. In practice, this means considering the following aspects.  1. Identifying all major stakeholders and understanding their needs and expectations of a  CSIRT. Depending on the stakeholder, their needs can include identification of  incidents, security awareness, resolution of incidents and compliance with certain  standards.  2. Identifying constituencies. This could be a small group of companies for a sectorial  CSIRT, the residents of a city or even a whole country. Evaluating and meeting the  needs and expectations of a specific constituency are extremely important for the  success of a CSIRT.  A series of workshops should be planned with the main stakeholders and representatives of  constituencies in order to obtain their support for the establishment of a CSIRT and to start a  conversation about the real value that a CSIRT could bring. This can then be used as input for  justifying the establishment of a CSIRT and for its mandate and budgeting.  Common justifications for establishing a CSIRT include:  1. The need to organise cybersecurity incident handing in a professional way to minimise  the impact of incidents.  2. The need to have a professional team to respond to cybersecurity incidents using  internationally accepted incident handling methods.  3. The need to be trusted by other CSIRTs around the world during incident  investigations.  4. The need to have a coordinating team for cybersecurity incident handling, vulnerability  handling, situational and security awareness rising and analysis of threats.  A team’s purpose is determined in a CSIRT mandate, which must include the authority and  responsibilities given to the team.  A mandate usually includes:  1. The authority given to a CSIRT to serve and act in a constituency.  2. The responsibilities of the CSIRT.  3. Requirements, objectives and tasks.  For a CSIRT with internal-only constituencies in an organisation or a managed security service  provider (MSSP) set-up, the mandate is usually expressed in a single document of one of the  following types:  1. An office order (in a government agency).  2. A decision or resolution by the board or executive management (in a private  enterprise).  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  15  For sectoral or national CSIRTs, the mandate is usually expressed in at least two documents,  namely:  1. A cybersecurity strategy, law or by-law, or government order assigning authority and  overall responsibility (the only way to establish authority over a country’s different  organisations).  2. An office order of the CSIRT hosting organisation, outlining the detailed requirements,  objectives and tasks and a list of services.  The following additional guidance on the mandate should also be followed.  1. The responsibilities of a CSIRT must be stated. Simply stating that a CSIRT is being  established is not enough; the mandate should also indicate what its responsibilities  are and why it is needed.  2. The responsibilities should indicate which overall constituency a CSIRT will serve, for  example a CSIRT for the financial sector for cyberthreat management, threat  information sharing and critical incident coordination, or a CSIRT for internal business  divisions for cybersecurity monitoring and incident handling.  3. An authorised body must issue authority to a CSIRT. For sectoral or national CSIRTs  this might be the national government, the parliament or a ministry.  4. An organisation or a business unit must be assigned to establish a CSIRT. Sometimes  this might be a new organisation.  For national governments or sectoral regulators, the development of a mandate usually begins  with drafting of a law, bill, cybersecurity strategy or cybersecurity plan.  For organisational CSIRTs, the development of a mandate usually begins after receiving  approval to establish a CSIRT from the management board or C-level executives, starting with  the purpose why it is being established.  An approved mandate of authority and responsibility usually indicates a person, unit or  organisation that will lead the establishment of a CSIRT.  Examples of phrases typically used in mandate documents include the following.  1. Cybersecurity has become very important; thus, a CSIRT is being established to  increase the resilience of information systems to cyberattacks; manage cyberthreats;  work on lowering the costs of the impact of incidents by establishing strong incident  management controls; improve know-how; foster collaboration between stakeholders;  and ensure cyber situational awareness and cyber situational visibility.  2. A sectoral (national, organisational) CSIRT is being established by modernising the  current IT security unit to provide effective cyber resilience, organise incident  responses, enable cyber situational awareness and establish cyber information  exchange channels with partner organisations.  For EU Member States, NIS Directive  Annexes I and II present the requirements, tasks and  mandatory constituencies of national CSIRTs; the high-level responsibility of CSIRTs is  described as follows: ‘responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well-  defined process’.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  16  Examples of mandates for the establishment of a CSIRT include:   btCIRT (18) – national CIRT of Bhutan, established by government order.   BGD e-GOV CIRT (19) – Bangladesh government sectorial CSIRT, established by office  order.  Additional guidance on mandates and responsibilities can be found in ENISA’s Good Practice  Guide for Incident Management (2010), Section 5.4.  2.2.2 Governance structure  The governance structure defines the responsibilities of the CSIRT’s stakeholders. It can be  presented as a planning document or even as part of the mandate.  The governance structure document should provide answers to a number of questions.  1. Who will provide funding for the establishment and operations of a CSIRT and on what  grounds?  2. Who will provide direction, monitoring and oversight of the CSIRT?  3. What types of agreements should the CSIRT have and with which stakeholders (e.g.  law enforcement, intelligence agencies, international organisations, technology  partners, academia)?  4. Who will the CSIRT report to, how often and in what form?  The owner of the CSIRT governance structure is usually the hosting organisation.  The governance structure is usually clarified during the workshops held to discuss the mandate  with various stakeholders.  2.2.3 Identification of the CSIRT hosting organisation  The CSIRT hosting organisation is usually mentioned in the preliminary mandate. The hosting  organisation might already exist or might need to be set up.  If a new hosting organisation is being established, the CSIRT budget can be approved only after  the organisation is functional in terms of setting up management and legal processes, meaning  that additional time will be required at this stage.  When choosing an organisation to host a CSIRT, the organisation’s authority to deliver the  services in accordance with the CSIRT’s mandate must be evaluated.  2.2.4 High-level roadmap and budget  After the mandate is defined, a high-level roadmap and budget must be approved.  The roadmap should include an expected timeline for the CSIRT establishment phases –  design, implementation and operations – and further improvement initiatives.  18 https://www.btcirt.bt/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BtCIRT-Mandatep2.pdf  19 https://www.cirt.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Government-Mandate-of-BGD-e-GOV-CIRT.pdf  https://www.btcirt.bt/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BtCIRT-Mandatep2.pdf https://www.cirt.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Government-Mandate-of-BGD-e-GOV-CIRT.pdf  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  17  Commonly, it takes 2–3 years from development of the preliminary mandate to initial mandate  approval when a CSIRT becomes fully operational. This includes the following steps:  1. Budget approval, setting up of facilities, organisation establishment and initial hiring  can take up to 1 year.  2. Design and implementation usually take 1–2 years, especially if the assistance of  external consultants and technology has to be acquired through public tenders.  The budget for the initial year, which is spent on the establishment of the CSIRT and initial  services, should cover at least:  1. Initial staff salaries – at least for the minimum required personnel (CSIRT manager,  CSIRT establishment project manager, administrative assistant).  2. Facility establishment costs.  3. Salaries or consultancy service fees for creating the design stage results (legal  processes, CSIRT-related expertise, technology deployment).  4. CSIRT skills acquisition recruitment and training.  5. Preliminary technology and licences.  The budget should be adjusted according to the roadmap, mandate, stakeholder  commitment and requirements for how quickly the CSIRT should be established.  The budget should be adjusted again once the design phase has finished and when the detailed  plans are prepared for the implementation and operations phases. For example, if the budget is  insufficient, some aspects can be moved to the further improvement phase in the roadmap.  The following notes provide indicative costings for 2020. Cost estimates are done for illustrative  purposes only and does not depict any particular country.  1. In EU countries, a CSIRT staff member (including managers) costs on average  EUR 40 000–60 000 per year.  2. Small CSIRT operations with three staff members (manager, two incident handlers)  should budget around EUR 120 000–180 000 annually.  3. If a CSIRT is required to provide operations 24/7 for 365 days a year, it needs at least  12 additional employees (six teams of two staff members to cover 24/7, with each shift  covering 8 hours). This will add EUR 480 000 annually to the budget.  4. CSIRTs typically employ the following numbers of staff: small – 3–7, medium – 10–15,  large – 30–60, depending on the constituency size and mandate.  5. The cost of office rental is normally around EUR 3 000–4 000 per staff member per  year.  ‘We operate 24/7’  (national CSIRT)  Figure 8: Roadmap example  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  18  6. It is common to spend EUR 3 000–10 000 on staff training per person per year.  Attending conferences is highly recommended (one event per person per year).  7. Depending on the scope, consultancy services for the establishment of a CSIRT  (design and implementation) can cost from EUR 75 000 to EUR 1 000 000 over a 1- to  3-year period.  8. It is common to spend EUR 100 000–300 000 on technology: hardware (at least two  servers with virtualisation, backup solutions, firewalls, computers, printers), networking  and specialised equipment for performing specific CSIRT operations (digital forensics,  reverse engineering, vulnerability assessment, etc.). Using cloud services can be an  effective way to limit initial investments in hardware, by allowing spending only on what  is actually being used.  9. With regard to software components, CSIRTs might begin by using mostly open-  source20 solutions, using commercial tools only if there are no comparative alternatives  or for their better effectiveness. In this case, the budget for software and software  services should start at EUR 50 000. If CSIRTs are focusing on commercial  technology, the budget should be increased; however, focusing on commercial  technology can result in higher productivity, i.e. fewer staff members are required.  The initial amounts in the budget and the time period over which the budget should be spent  may change over time. Design phase activities will be bound by the approved budget available.  The approved budget will impact the final detailed mandate, as an organisation can achieve the  anticipated results only when a sufficient budget is made available. The discrepancy between  the detailed mandate and the budget is a common reason why CSIRTs do not fulfil their  mandate.  It may take 3 years for a CSIRT to become operational, so the budget should reflect the  expected intensity of the CSIRT establishment process.  2.2.5 Detailed requirements for the design stage  The design phase activities will be based on the requirements and constraints of the CSIRT,  such as:  1. The agreed mandate.  2. The roadmap and budget.  3. The people, competences and resources allocated to the design phase.  These must be validated and approved.  When external consultancy work is involved, the detailed requirements are often expressed  as the consultancy project terms of reference (ToR) for a competitive tender (request for  information (RFI)/request for proposal (RFP)).  When preparing the ToR for such work, it is relevant to include:  1. The mandate definition of the CSIRT.  2. A clear statement of the expected results.  3. The expected delivery plan.  4. The experience required from the consultants from delivering similar activities.  20 When using Open source solutions CSIRT needs to take into consideration who is managing and updating particular  solution  ‘We buy some  specific services  from vendors on  behalf of the  whole sector, e.g.  TI for specific  geographical  regions/actors;  sandboxes,  takedown of  domains, etc.’  (sectorial CSIRT)  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  19  2.3  DESIGN  The design phase prerequisites are all of the outcomes from the assessment for readiness  phase.  The design phase recommendations are aligned with SIM3 (security incident management  maturity model which estimates how well a team governs, documents, performs and measures  their function), covering all four areas – organisation, human, tools and processes – in  sequence, as presented below. This guidance does not provide specific advice on how to reach  the maturity levels, as this information can be found in the SIM3 assessment tools from  ENISA (21) or the Open CSIRT Foundation (22).  In the design phase, the following outcomes are expected, in the form of either separate  approved documents or one approved document.  1. Approved detailed mandate  2. CSIRT services plan  3. CSIRT processes and workflows plan  4. CSIRT organisation, skills and training structure plan  5. CSIRT facilities plan  6. CSIRT technologies and processes automation plan  7. CSIRT cooperation plan  8. CSIRT IT and information security management plan  9. Detailed requirements for the implementation stage  In addition, the resulting design structure is often published in RFC 2350 format (23) – this is the  de facto format for the formal presentation of a CSIRT, covering the team name, contact  information, the time zone, PGP (pretty good privacy) keys, the mandate (charter), policies and  services, etc. It is good practice for a CSIRT to publish the RFC 2350 document on its own  website.  2.3.1 Approved detailed mandate  The design phase is based on the requirements of the CSIRT mandate, which might still be in  final discussions or might include some broad overarching statements. In this phase it must be  ensured that final approval has been granted (e.g. the mandate has been signed by the  minister, or board of directors, or executive) and that the mandate is clear and easy to  understand and sets out:  1. The authority given to a CSIRT to serve and act in its constituency.  2. The responsibilities of the CSIRT.  3. The requirements, objectives and tasks.  The approval of the mandate, together with the budget constraints and the initial roadmap for  establishment of the CSIRT, allows for successful preparation of the design.  A detailed mandate might indicate how to name a CSIRT, as described below.  1. The name of the organisation should reflect the mandate, ensuring that it is clearly  formulated and includes the role of the CSIRT.  2. The type of constituency covered is often reflected in the name; for example, national  CSIRTs are often named using the two-letter country code and the CSIRT/CIRT/CERT  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  22 https://sim3-check.opencsirt.org/  23 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey https://sim3-check.opencsirt.org/ https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  20  abbreviation, joined by a dash, a dot or some other symbol, e.g. CERT-LV, CERT-MU,  SK-CERT. The sector is often included too in a shortened form; for example, the  financial sector would be FinCIRT or FS-CSIRT, with the country additionally named  using the two-letter country code, e.g. EG (EG-FinCIRT).  3. Often, a name is chosen based on a short company or organisation name and adding  CSIRT, for example Adidas CSIRT, CSIRT BNP Paribas.  4. A CSIRT is often referred to as a CIRT, CERT or SIRT. Such organisations must  provide an incident handling (response) service.  5. The SOC name is usually used for organisations that monitor operations for the  security of networks and data centres, for example NestleSOC, TDC SOC. Recently,  names such as iSOC (24) and gSOC (25) have also been used.  6. When the primary function of an incident response team is to handle the vulnerabilities  of the products of a certain company, it is usually referred to as a PSIRT (26), for  example Adobe PSIRT, NVIDIA PSIRT, Fujitsu PSIRT. Separate guidance on PSIRTs  has been created by FIRST.org (27).  7. Examples of existing team names are available on the FIRST.org (28), Trusted  Introducer (29) and ENISA CSIRTs Map30.  8. If the chosen name includes the CERT abbreviation, a request for approval must be  submitted to the CERT trademark owner SEI (31) (the SEI policy may be amended in  the future).  2.3.2 CSIRT services plan  The CSIRT services plan explains which services a CSIRT organisation will provide to a  constituency to fulfil the roles and responsibilities defined in the mandate and adhere to the  roadmap and budget constraints.  24 An iSOC is an integrated SOC, for example in the energy sector, combining an operational technology (OT) SOC and an IT SOC.  25 A gSOC is a global or government SOC.  26 A PSIRT is a product security incident response team.  27 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/psirts/psirt_services_framework_v1.1  28 https://www.first.org/members/teams/  29 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams.html  30 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  31 https://www.sei.cmu.edu/education-outreach/license-sei-materials/authorization-to-use-cert-mark/  Figure 9: FIRST services framework  https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/psirts/psirt_services_framework_v1.1 https://www.first.org/members/teams/ https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map https://www.sei.cmu.edu/education-outreach/license-sei-materials/authorization-to-use-cert-mark/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  21  The following guidelines are provided for preparation of the CSIRT services plan.  1. CSIRT should take a look at the latest version of the FIRST.org CSIRT Services  Framework (32). This document is now available in several languages. This document  presents the conceptual CSIRT services map, as presented below.  2. Choose which service areas (out of five) and which exact services the CSIRT should  provide to fulfil the specific mandate stipulations.  3. Select and adjust the names of the service areas as the names provided in the CSIRT  Services Framework may be too detailed initially. For example, when looking at the  information security event management service area for SOCs, one might decide to  consolidate both services (monitoring and detection and event analysis) into one entity  and to rename the service area as security monitoring. Similarly, within the information  security incident management service area, one might choose to include two services:  incident handling service and artefact analysis.  4. Validate the list of resulting services to ensure that all of the mandate requirements are  covered and that it does not include more services than the mandate requires. The  resources of CSIRTs are limited; therefore, it is reasonable to concentrate on what is  mandatory to ensure the provision of good-quality services for which proper authority  has been provided.  The list of chosen CSIRT services should be listed in a CSIRT services catalogue. ITIL  (information technology infrastructure library) methodology may be of value to organise the  delivery of services. It is important to clearly understand the distinction between the different  meanings of the word ‘incident’ – in CSIRTs, ‘incident handling’ is the name of the service,  while in ITIL methodology ‘incident’ means a disturbance to service delivery, i.e. that the  service cannot be delivered, with the ‘incident’ being closed when the service is recovered.  Realistically, CSIRTs must ensure that good-quality services are delivered and, if these  services are disrupted, they are rapidly recovered. For example, if a CSIRT IT system fails,  this could be recovered using an internal IT support process according to ITIL33 principles.  2.3.3 CSIRT processes and workflows plan  CSIRT processes are needed to implement and support agreed CSIRT services.  Typically, each type of service delivery is implemented using at least one process. More than  one process may be required to deliver a service if, for example, service provisioning requires  several working groups to be involved, or specific intermediate goals must be reached.  Some processes may be established as supportive processes, for example, an IT support  process for maintaining and updating CSIRT IT infrastructure. This process can be handled  using ITIL methodology, using a separate IT services catalogue (not to be confused with a  CSIRT services catalogue).  The interrelationships between the identified processes should be analysed and documented.  For example, the output from the security monitoring process is an identified incident that is  handed over to the incident handling process as input; the artefact analysis process can be  initiated from the incident handling process when needed.  32 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/  33 https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil  On activities:  ‘incident response,  monitoring sensor  network, dispatching  notifications,  constituency  building, awareness  raising and  education, training  and cyber exercises’  (national CSIRT)  https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/ https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  22  Each process consists of one or more workflows, represented by workflow diagrams, depicting  each step from the start until the final phase of activity. In addition, it is common to provide a  tabular description of each step.  An example of a security incident handling workflow diagram, taken from ENISA’s Good  Practice Guide for Incident Management (2010), is provided below.  An example of an interrelationship diagram for different services and processes is presented in  Figure 11.  When designing processes and workflows, the human parameters of SIM3, the ENISA CSIRT  maturity assessment model (34) and the SOC capability and maturity model (SOC-CMM) (35)  might be relevant tools for validating their completeness and coverage.  34 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity  35https://www.soc-cmm.com/  Figure 10: Incident handling workflow example  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity https://www.soc-cmm.com/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  23  Examples of security incident handling and security monitoring processes, which are used for  implementing security incident management and security monitoring services, are provided in  Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Process definitions are adapted to the needs of CSIRTs.  Table 1: Examples of security incident handling processes  Process name Security incident management  Description Security incident management covers incident report registration, triage,  incident resolving and incident closing  Process owner Security incident manager  Purpose To ensure that every incident detected is handled according to defined  quality requirements and that response activities are carried out to  mitigate any incidents, followed by actions to improve security measures;  and to increase the maturity of the constituent’s security processes so  that it is more resilient to cyberthreats in the future  Service input/triggers 1.

Table 3: Example guidelines for intrusion incident handling  Section Description  Containment guidelines Objective: Advise the constituency and coordinate its efforts and participate in  investigations of critical incidents  1. Advise the constituency to involve law enforcement authorities in the investigation  2. For incidents with a high level of criticality, consider sending the CSIRT to  conduct an investigation in place or ask for logs to be shared and conduct the  investigation at the CSIRT’s premises. Share the findings with the constituency  3. Advise the constituency to:  3.1. Analyse logs  3.2. Find out the incident root cause  3.3. Assess for damage  3.4. Block malicious IP and DNS addresses  3.5. Implement quick workarounds  4. Evaluate the risk to other infrastructures and share anonymised incident details  with the constituency  5. Look for recent similar incidents, evaluate the situation and, if necessary, raise  the criticality level. Inform management about suspicious repeated intrusions  Mitigation guidelines Objective: Help the constituency to find and fix the root cause of the incident,  preserving any forensic evidence  1. Advise the constituency to:  1.1. Apply patches  1.2. Replace outdated and unsupported systems  1.3. Implement permanent workarounds  1.4. Implement best security practices  2. For high criticality incidents, request detailed investigation reports or offer  resources to ensure proper incident analysis  Recovery guidelines Objective: Support constituencies when returning to normal operations after the  incident and lift temporary preventive measures  1. In the case of a high criticality incident, conduct a security assessment to evaluate  the effectiveness of mitigation measures  2. Organise seminars for security personnel and explain common intrusion methods  and mitigation strategies  3. Once a year conduct a technical cybersecurity exercise or training in a real-life  environment  Figure 13: A simple security monitoring process workflow diagram  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  26  2.3.4 CSIRT organisation, skills and training structure plan  The CSIRT processes are run by CSIRT staff, who are organised into particular organisational  structures.  Smaller CSIRTs of up to five to seven people are mostly organised as one unit run by a unit  manager (Figure 15). In this case, staff roles may be based on the NIST NICE framework’s  Cyber Defence Incident Responder work roles (PR-CIR-001) (36).  For larger CSIRT organisations of over 10 people, the structural units should be designed  according to the services structure or the activities run or other organisational practices  (Figure 16). Again, the NIST NICE37  roles may serve as a starting point for defining staff roles.  36 https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-  framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder  37 National Institute of Standards and Technology National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice  Staff training:  ‘TRANSITS I and II  for all plus internal  policies/procedures  to use tools and  communicate with  rest of the team’  (ISP CSIRT)  Figure 15: Example of organisational units for a bigger CSIRT  Figure 14: Example of a small CSIRT structure  https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  27  It should be noted that 24/7 shift work can become very expensive, as six teams are required to  cover the 8-hour shifts, including holidays. Thus, CSIRTs often use one of following operating  procedures:  1. Operate only during normal business hours.  2. Have someone on duty to monitor calls or emergency escalations.  3. Outsource night and weekend registration monitoring to an external party for initial  triage.  4. Rely on existing 24/7 network operations centre operations to process initial calls  according to typical basic standard operating procedures (SOPs) and call experts if  needed if a duty phone is in operation.  ENISA has developed around 50 training courses on CSIRT-related topics, which are provided  for free on their website (38). These training materials cover technical and operational aspects,  setting up a CSIRT, legal and cooperation aspects, and guidance on, for example, proactive  training for CSIRTs and training methodologies. All of the training materials are licensed under  a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, i.e. they are open for use by anyone under  attribution to ENISA. However, the training materials are non-commercial and thus are most  useful for internal training delivered by CSIRT senior staff members.  Similarly, FIRST.org provides an increasing number of training courses on its website  education pages (39), under the same licence terms.  Also GEANT provides training for CSIRTs  TRANSITS I and TRANSITS II40  Suggested technical training courses and laboratories for incident handlers are provided in  Tables 4 and 5.

In addition, each CSIRT must develop comprehensive professional,  leadership and operational skills during the implementation phase using the following means.  1. Knowledge transfer by implementation experts in the form of workshops, training,  mentoring and post-implementation support.  2. Visits to other CSIRTs to learn about their operations. At least two to three visits to  CSIRTs in other countries should be planned. Visits usually last for a few hours and  are focused on sharing operational experience. Some CSIRTs carry out staff  exchanges to build knowledge.  All CSIRT staff members must develop professional competences, as described in the NIST  NICE framework (where KSA stands for knowledge, skills, and abilities) (Table 6).  When hiring:  ‘Typically we  ask for CISSP’  (CSIRT)  https://www.sans.org/course/cyber-threat-intelligence https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-threat-intelligence-analyst-ctia/ https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-threat-intelligence-analyst-ctia/ https://school.threatintel.academy/collections https://store.eccouncil.org/product/ilabs-ceh https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU_7zKypJZI https://store.eccouncil.org/product/ilabs-ctia/ https://nexus.isaca.org/products http://www.dvwa.co.uk/ https://www.networkdefense.io/library/the-analyst-mindset/110302/about/ https://www.networkdefense.io/library/the-analyst-mindset/110302/about/ https://www.networkdefense.co/courses/elk/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  30  Table 6: Essential professional competences for CSIRT staff members  Competency Description  Conflict  management  KSAs that relate to managing and resolving conflicts, grievances, confrontations or  disagreements in a constructive manner to minimise negative personal impacts;  collaborates with others to encourage cooperation and teamwork  Critical thinking KSAs that relate to the objective analysis of facts to form a judgment  Interpersonal  skills  KSAs that relate to developing and maintaining effective relationships with others, and  relating well to people from varied backgrounds and different situations; considering and  responding appropriately to the needs, feelings and capabilities of subordinates, peers and  seniors  Oral  communication  KSAs that relate to the process of expressing information or ideas by word of mouth  Presenting  effectively  KSAs that relate to activities in which someone shows, describes or explains something to  an audience  Written  communication  KSAs that relate to process of expressing information or ideas by word of mouth  CSIRT management and administrative staff must develop their leadership and operational  competences, for example as indicated in the NIST NICE framework (Tables 7 and 8).

For example, Coursera.org provides more than 1 000  courses on leadership.  2.3.5 CSIRT facilities plan  Secure facilities with separate workspaces and clear physical rules and regulations are  essential for the efficient functioning of CSIRTs.  At a minimum the CSIRT facilities should include a data room to house any technology, an  office room for incident handling staff, and a guest reception or meeting room.  To enable business continuity, the continuity of the CSIRT infrastructure should be ensured. To  this end, redundant systems and backup working space should be available.  The following must be taken into consideration when planning facilities.  1. Physical security should be considered and proper access control and monitoring  should be established. In addition, a risk assessment should be performed based on  neighbouring facilities.  2. The data room must provide a level of physical and environmental security that is  appropriate to the data that the CSIRT will possess and manage.  3. The office room for incident handling staff must provide an appropriate, convenient and  secure working environment by ensuring the ‘least required privilege’ access for  personnel.  CSIRTs must implement appropriate physical security measures, such as ensuring perimeter  control of the premises and providing access controls for entry into the different rooms for  reasons of confidentiality.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  32  Additional sources of information on physical security requirements are the ISO 2700141  standard from the International Organization for Standardization, Field Manual FM 3-19.3042  and national regulations. Organisations should refer to their internal safety or physical security  teams for further advice on implementation of security measures.  Larger CSIRTs may have separate zones for a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)  laboratory, security monitoring (a SOC room), a crisis room and a visitors’ room.  2.3.6 CSIRT technologies and processes automation plan  A CSIRT’s success depends heavily on the automation of its processes. Generic IT automation  processes are used for workplaces and office work. There are also specific CSIRT processes  related to automation.  A typical CSIRT should adhere to the following practices with regard to its technical  infrastructure.  1. As an on-premises data centre solution, a CSIRT must have at least two virtualisation  servers to ensure high availability and recovery. In case one fails, backups are  performed on a third server using tapes or an alternative solution, located in a different  room.  2. Network segmentation must ensure that data centre production systems, the LAN  (local area network), the guest network, the laboratory and the DMZ (demilitarised  zone) are separated accordingly via firewall rules.  3. CSIRTs and SOCs are often cautious about using cloud systems extensively, as  shown by the survey responses. Cloud services are mandatory at least for SaaS  (software-as-a-service) services, for example data feeds from external dataset  providers or websites used for interaction. Use of cloud services often results in  availability, cost and operational efficiencies, with less data governance. Depending on  a CSIRT’s data security needs and risk appetite, different cloud services may be  utilised.  41 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  42 https://www.wbdg.org/FFC/ARMYCOE/FIELDMAN/fm31930.pdf  On tools:  ‘MISP for threat  information sharing.  Elastic to analyze data.  matrix.org as internal  communications  platform. Gitlab for  internal projects  management. BBB for  video conferencing.  Commercial feeds and  tools for specific tasks  if no viable open  source alternative  exists.’  (national CSIRT)  Figure 16: Example layout of the internal rooms for a CSIRT  https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.wbdg.org/FFC/ARMYCOE/FIELDMAN/fm31930.pdf  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  33  Often, automation needs fall into the following areas:  1. ticketing systems for incident report registration and handling – typically, CSIRTs use  RTIR, OTRS, ServiceNow and Jira, among other ticketing technologies.  2. data feed processing and routing – feed routers, threat intelligence platforms or  dataset repositories are used.  3. alert and awareness bulletin publishing platforms – these include website portals,  publishing platforms and social media channels.  2.3.7 CSIRT cooperation plan  A CSIRT’s success depends heavily on implementing effective working partnerships with  different stakeholders and the international CSIRT community.  After establishment, a CSIRT might not be known by all stakeholders and constituencies;  thus, it must actively approach stakeholders and constituencies and build cooperation  arrangements. Some of these cooperation initiatives will result in the signing of formal  memorandums of understanding (MoUs) or partnership agreements, or in formal and informal  memberships of associations and information sharing communities.  Trust-based and long-lasting partnerships require planning, including clear objectives from  each partnership and strategies for how to maintain the relationships.  The guidelines set out below should be followed.  1. A proactive approach to building partnerships with local and international law  enforcement and intelligence agencies might help to handle cybercrime incidents or  advanced persistent threats (APTs) more effectively in crisis situations.  2. Regional and national (if any) CSIRT initiatives for improving cooperation should be  considered. The Trusted Introducer listed status (43) (44),is relatively easy to achieve for  a CSIRT that is already operational and that has the support of other CSIRTs and  participates in CSIRT-related events and conferences. CSIRTs should subsequently  focus on attaining accredited status (45) or even certified status (46), The Trusted  Introducer scheme is the only certification scheme currently available for CSIRTs and  Trusted Introducer services are more focused to CSIRTs operating in Europe.  3. It is strongly advised that CSIRTs join the FIRST.org association as this is the major  global association for CSIRTs.  4. Proactively approaching different ISAC(47)s for partnering and exploring the value of  such partnerships is often a good way to determine what partnerships will be valuable.  5. The structure of MoUs and partnership agreements can usually be divided into three  parts:  a. the objectives of partnering – this can reflect the mandates of both parties;  b. what each of the parties will be doing in relation to each other, for example invite  each other to training sessions, share knowledge, participate in workshops and  exercises, share indicators, respond to inquiries about collaboration on incidents;  c. an initial action plan and timeline, to be executed after signing of the MoU or  agreement, which includes a joint evaluation of the agreement and planning of the  following year’s activities.  43 https://tf-csirt.org/membership/why-listed/  44https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/registration.html  45 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  46 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  47 Information Sharing and Analysis Centres  see  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-  strategies/information-sharing  ‘Anyrun for  sandboxing,  Recorded Future  for threat stream’  (MSSP SOC)  ‘Automation makes  the analysis of a big  incident easier and  more efficient.

For cooperation to work, related activities, for example organising, travel, hosting,  workshops and informal socialising, must have a dedicated budget as part of the  annual budget.  2.3.8 CSIRT IT and information security management plan  CSIRTs should implement an IT and information security management plan or adopt and adapt  the IT security framework from the hosting organisation.  It is recommended that CSIRTs adhere to industry good practices, for example  ISO 27001-based information security management systems (ISMS).  The IT management plan might adhere to COBIT(48) (control objectives for information and  related technology) and ITIL principles and methods.  2.3.9 Detailed requirements for the implementation stage  The results of the design plans should be included in the requirements for implementation,  explaining in more detail:  1. What the requirements are and how they should be implemented.  2. What precise outcomes should be achieved.  The detailed requirements might be included as ToR.  2.4 IMPLEMENTATION  The implementation phase focuses on rolling out all services, enabling processes, preparing  detailed procedures and training staff members.  At the end of the implementation phase, the CSIRT is ready to deliver services to its  constituency and start the operations phase.  In the implementation phase, the following outcomes are expected.  1. Approval and implementation of the organisational structure.  2. Hiring and appointing of staff.  3. Execution of a training plan for different staff roles.  4. Preparation of facilities.  5. Development and implementation of detailed processes and procedures.  6. Implementation of technology for the automation of processes.  7. Implementation of IT and information security management procedures.  8. Training of staff for CSIRT operations.  9. Signing of relevant agreements with the constituency, stakeholders and partners.  10. Test run of CSIRT services and tuning of results.  11. Launch of CSIRT communications and celebrations.  2.4.1 Approval and implementation of the organisational structure  For a CSIRT to become operational, the designed organisational structure must be approved  and the different positions defined.  48 https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit  https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  35  Sometimes this process can take months; thus, an organisation might begin work using an  interim structure, to enable work to progress without it being dependent on the CSIRT  establishment process.  For example, hiring can begin using an existing structure, with a clear plan of how resources will  be moved later, or by adjusting the initial services plan if a smaller number of staff are available.  2.4.2 Hiring and appointing of staff  The new structure must be filled with competent and skilled staff. It is highly likely that  only a few positions will be filled with current staff; thus, additional staff members must  be hired.  Usually, there is a lot of interest from those wanting to work for a newly established  CSIRT and gain professional experience; however, potential recruits often lack the  required competences.  As for other positions, it is important to hire staff showing a determination and  willingness to provide services in a professional manner.  2.4.3 Execution of a training plan for different staff roles  All CSIRT staff must have the initial skills needed for their roles. To upskill staff, the  designed training plan should support implementation of, and participation by staff  members in, standard training sessions, conferences and workshops.  Additional training for CSIRT operations – processes, and SOPs – must also be run.  2.4.4 Preparation of facilities  CSIRT facilities must be prepared according to the approved plan, taking into account physical  security and appropriate accesss rights.  Some teams choose to brand their facilities with logos and recognisable marks, whereas other  teams, especially if hosted in a national security area, do not provide any markings on their  buildings; the CSIRT is visible only inside the premises.  2.4.5 Development and implementation of detailed processes and  procedures  Planned CSIRT processes are implemented in the form of established procedures.  Some of the typical activities that are repeated are defined in SOPs and automated using  technology.  2.4.6 Implementation of technology for the automation of processes  Technology implementation is carried out by installing, configuring, documenting and testing  technologies.  CSIRTs use open-source software extensively, often written or contributed by other CSIRT  members.  2.4.7 Implementation of IT and information security management  procedures  CSIRTs must define and implement detailed procedures for IT and information security  management.  ‘SEI has a number of  open source tools on its  github site. These  include SiLK,  Cyberticket Studio,  Cyobstract, and others.  We have a network  situational awareness  suite of tools:  https://tools.netsa.cert.o  rg/ We also use MISP’  (CERT/CC)  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  36  A common challenge is that core CSIRT services and processes are a priority in the  implementation phase, while IT support and internal security management processes and  procedures usually receive less attention initially. Thus, it is expected that these processes and  procedures will require further improvements.  When a CSIRT is part of a larger organisation, the hosting organisation’s IT processes and  information security management system can be adopted into practice.  2.4.8 Training of staff for CSIRT operations  Extensive hands-on and theoretical knowledge transfer to CSIRT members with regard to  implemented technologies and procedures is crucial for establishment success.  Knowledge transfer activities are usually run in the form of hands-on workshops, where all  processes and procedures are explained and practised.  Further training can be carried out and identification of skills gaps achieved using crisis drills  and blue–red–purple teaming exercises.  2.4.9 Signing of relevant agreements with the constituency, stakeholders  and partners  During the execution of a CSIRT partnership plan, there might be a need for the implementation  of additional policies and procedures.  FIRST.org and Trusted Introducer membership applications should be submitted as soon as  they are ready and the requirements for functional and operational readiness have been  fulfilled. It may take a few months for the membership applications to be approved.  The building up and maintenance of partnerships require active participation and  communication and should be overseen by the CSIRT manager or, in case of larger CSIRTs,  the partnership manager.  2.4.10 Test run of CSIRT services and tuning of results  Once the processes and technologies have been implemented it is important to run tests for at  least a day and provide notifications of any deficiencies in processes and technologies in the  test run report. Tuning actions should then be carried out, that is, adjustments should be made  to processes, workflows and technology implementation as appropriate.  Irrespective of the initial preparations and planning, the results often reveal that some design  presumptions were not correct and some implementation activities must be modified.  2.4.11 Launch of CSIRT communications and celebrations  Once implementation has been completed, the CSIRT’s operations can begin. It is important to  communicate properly about the new CSIRT services, the CSIRT’s mode of operations, the  practical value it will provide and the responsibilities of the constituency and the CSIRT.  Typically, this communication is aligned with a CSIRT launch celebration and press release.  The launch celebration usually includes a small presentation, a visit to the facilities by the  constituency, stakeholders and journalists, and printed materials.  A successful launch can inspire and give positive momentum to the entire CSIRT.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  37  Similarly, other improvements are worth celebrating in order to draw positive stakeholder  attention to the CSIRT, for example inauguration of a CSIRT laboratory or cyber gym facilities,  launch of an annual report or any other major event in the life of the CSIRT.  2.5 OPERATIONS  The operations phase focuses on effective and efficient delivery of services, i.e. executing  the CSIRT mandate daily.  In the operations phase, the following outcomes are expected.  1. Measurement of KPIs.  2. Annual operations performance review.  3. Annual stakeholder needs review.  4. Approval of the annual budget.  5. Collection of improvement initiatives.  2.5.1 Measurement of key performance indicators  KPIs are used for management and governance purposes and quality monitoring. Not all  CSIRTs are KPI driven. It has been observed that many CSIRTs are overburdened and run  their overall operations without a sharp focus on the quality management of CSIRT  services.  The following guidelines are provided for the use of KPIs.  1. KPIs should be measured monthly. For mature organisations, weekly indicators might  also be of relevance. Annual KPIs are usually the sum of monthly KPIs.  2. KPIs should be linked to service delivery, i.e. they should be linked to each service and  should facilitate an understanding of whether or not a service is of a good quality and  meets service objectives.  3. Some KPIs are used only for statistical analysis whereas others are used for  implementing actions for improvement. For example, the number of incidents, analysed  monthly, is useful for statistical analysis – bigger or smaller numbers rarely produce  actions for improvement – whereas the number of visitors to the CSIRT website, where  alerts and awareness information is shared, indicates trends of relevance, which might  result in actions for improvement.  Examples of KPIs include:  1. The number of meetings with the constituency each month for awareness raising  (target: at least one).  2. Incident handling service-level agreement (SLA) breaches for critical incidents  (target: less than 5 %).  3. Number of monthly visitors to a website (target: an increase from the previous  month).  4. Number of awareness-raising campaigns carried out (target: at least one every  second month).  5. Trends in incident statistics (target: priority incidents must be handled according to  SLAs).  On KPIs:  ‘Time to respond and  mitigate ongoing DDoS  incidents via e-mail  (1.5 hours), respond  and mitigate ongoing  DDoS incidents (45  minutes)’  (ISP CSIRT)  On KPIs:  ‘incident statistics,  vulnerability  management statistics  (monthly and quarterly)  including number of  vulnerabilities detected  and remediated (only  critical and high for  now)’  (university CSIRT)  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  38  2.5.2 Annual operations performance review  The management team of an operational CSIRT should conduct the annual CSIRT performance  review, to identify successes to celebrate and areas for improvement.  During the internal phase of the review, staff skills and individual performances are assessed,  CSIRT processes are checked, automation is evaluated and KPIs are analysed.  The review of operations is commonly presented in the CSIRT annual report..  2.5.3 Annual stakeholder needs review  It is good practice to set up an annual workshop or meeting with CSIRT stakeholders where the  performance of the CSIRT and stakeholders’ priorities for and expectations of the CSIRT are  presented.  These priorities contribute to the planning of subsequent improvements for the CSIRT.  2.5.4 Approval of the annual budget  As for any organisation, CSIRTs must develop and gain approval for their annual budget each  year. The budget outlines which initiatives will receive additional funding.  The budget must be prepared in agreement with local laws, rules and regulations.  2.5.5 Collection of improvement initiatives  The internal annual review, stakeholder needs analysis and daily operations allow identification  of CSIRT requirements that may need to be improved. These are analysed as part of the  improvement phase.  Ideas for improvements may also come from the operations review. All improvement initiatives  should be presented in a table, including justifications and explanations of need.  2.6  IMPROVEMENT  The improvement phase focuses on selecting and approving CSIRT enhancement initiatives.  After approval, these initiatives are moved to the design, implementation and operations  phases. Improvement process should be continuous during existence of CSIRT.  In the improvement phase, the following outcomes are expected.  1. List of improvement initiatives.  2. Detailed plans for improvement initiatives for the design stage.  3. Preliminary budget for improvement initiatives.  2.6.1 List of improvement initiatives  It is often difficult initially to execute the CSIRT mandate at an excellent level of quality because  of a lack of skills, automation, processes and resources; thus, balancing improvement priorities  is a common activity for CSIRTs.  Improvement initiatives come from the operations phase as areas requiring improvement; from  a high-level roadmap; from additional guidance from stakeholders; or from the demands of  CSIRT management to improve the maturity and capability of the CSIRT.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  39  Guidance on maturity improvement is available from frameworks such as SIM3 and SOC-CMM  and from ENISA, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), the CERT Coordination Center  (CERT/CC) and FIRST.org, among others.  With the knowledge of existing resources available for improvement initiatives, the management  team of a CSIRT decides which initiatives to prioritise and approve and what resources to  allocate, e.g. the budget and number of people. Examples of improvement initiatives for  prioritisation are provided in Table 9.  Table 9: Examples of improvement initiatives for prioritisation  Initiative  Budget  required(49)  (EUR)  Duration  (months)  Justification Approved  Automation of  incident  detection  150 000  4  CSIRT requires  automation of registration  and routing of incidents  from public sources and  internal networks  Yes  Honeypot  initiative  80 000  6  Honeypots provide  visibility into who is  attacking networks and  how  Yes  Design,  implementation  and 1-year  operation of an  awareness  service  75 000  3  Constituency lacks timely  and focused awareness of  contextual information;  thus, it has limited  resilience to social and  technical attacks  Yes  ISO 27001  certification  50 000  8  CSIRT handles sensitive  data and thus must ensure  that internal information  security processes are  operating well  Yes  DFIR laboratory 250 000  12  Required for a few  incidents  Postponed until the  following year as the  number of cases  requiring digital  forensic analysis is  low  SOP  development  60 000  4  Clear and detailed  procedural instructions  result in fewer errors in  operations and faster  learning for new personnel  Postponed until the  following year  because of lack of  resources  Threat  intelligence  automation and  commercial  provider of  information  60 000  3  Improve quality with  regard to the detection  and analysis of incidents  Postponed until the  following year;  unable to currently  consume data  properly because of  lack of staff  Attaining SIM3  ENISA/Global  CSIRT Maturity  Framework  (GCMF)  intermediate  level  40 000  5  Increased maturity allows  the provision of better-  quality services in a more  streamlined and uniform  way and a reduction in  defect rates, and  increases trust and the  reputation of the CSIRT  Postponed until the  following year as  allocation of key  internal expert  resources is  required to carry out  the improvements  49 Figures for illustrative purpose only.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  40  2.6.2 Detailed plans for improvement initiatives for the design stage  After the improvement initiatives have been approved, the next step is to prepare detailed plans  for the design stage.  In the case of external consultancy involvement, detailed requirements are often expressed as  improvement project ToR in competitive tenders (RFI/RFP).  Requirements for the design stage outcomes must be specifically listed.  At this stage it is relevant to consider:  1. The objectives of the improvement initiatives.  2. The clearly stated expectations of any improvements.  3. The expected implementation plan.  4. The experience required of experts carrying out similar work.  2.6.3 Preliminary budget for improvement initiatives  The annual budget must incorporate any approved preliminary budget for improvement  initiatives. This may be needed to cover the costs of internal staff, additional facilities,  technology, external consultancy, administration, cooperation and marketing, and additional  training.  The preliminary budget will guide resource and design constraints for the design phase  activities during planning.  It is normal to expect that at least 15 % of the annual CSIRT budget will be spent on  improvement initiatives for mature CSIRTs. For CSIRTs with a lower level of maturity,  improvement initiatives usually make up at least 30 % of the CSIRT budget.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  41  3. CONCLUSIONS  This report presents guidelines for the establishment of CSIRTs and SOCs using a phased  outcomes-driven approach, including many examples from established CSIRTs of the different  phases of implementation.  Establishment is a continuous process. It is possible to identify the beginning of the  process; however, the end stage consists of a continuous improvement cycle – to better  serve the constituency, be more effective in operations and respond better to  stakeholder needs.  The authors hope that this publication will inspire better CSIRT and SOC project management  and provide clearer descriptions of the intermediate steps involved in the establishment of  CSIRTs and SOCs.  Some challenges related to the establishment of CSIRTs and SOCs are not covered in this  report and require additional work.  1. This publication focuses on the establishment of a single CSIRT. However, a single  CSIRT is usually part of an ecosystem of CSIRTs. Future research might focus on  ecosystem buildout and value creation through partnerships and specialisation.  2. Sectorial CSIRTs are emerging in different sectors in many countries; however, there  are currently too few data points and good practice guidelines available for guidance to  be provided for different sector-specific CSIRTs.  3. There is too little relevant and practical guidance on blueprints for technology  orchestration and automation of CSIRTs and SOCs.  4. The do-it-yourself approach to creating a CSIRT is still challenging because of the  relevant expertise required, which is not easily available in many countries. It will be  important to determine in the future how this can be overcome.  ENISA continues to support incident response teams by creating relevant content for CSIRTs..

The content of this report is based on an analysis of current publications on the establishment of  CSIRTs (the analysis is summarised in Annex B); a field questionnaire (Annex A), which was  completed by 40 CSIRTs and SOCs; and the authors’ experiences in establishing and  improving CSIRTs as part of numerous projects carried out in Europe, Asia, Africa and South  America.  A results-driven approach is taken throughout the publication to provide guidance on the  different stages involved in the establishment of a CSIRT or SOC organisation:   Assessment for readiness   Design   Implementation   Operations   Improvement.  The reader will receive practical guidance on what to focus on during the individual phases of  establishment and improvement.  Up to July 2020, ENISA had published 61 reports and 21 translated versions of reports  supporting CSIRTs on its website (1). ENISA’s training package (2) provides online training  materials, training courses and exercise materials for cybersecurity specialists, based on the  ‘Train the Trainer’ philosophy. This document aims to enhance ENISA’s existing body of  knowledge on the establishment of CSIRTs.  1 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c8=CSIRTs  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c8=CSIRTs https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  5  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 CONTEXT OF THE WORK  Cybersecurity threats are increasing and becoming more complex. One of the most effective  ways to counter these threats is by creating a global ecosystem of computer security incident  response teams (CSIRTs) and security operations centres (SOCs) that can communicate, share  information and respond to cyberthreats effectively. This can be facilitated by providing relevant  frameworks and increasing the number of CSIRTs and SOCs around the world and the maturity  of existing CSIRTs and SOCs.  In Europe, ENISA is assisting Member States with their incident response capabilities by  providing them with various resources, such as documents, tools, materials and guidance. For  example, ENISA hosts a European CSIRT inventory – an interactive map on ENISA’s website  that gives an overview of publicly listed CSIRTs in Europe. In addition, the Study on CSIRT  landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025(3) looks at the overall status of CSIRTs’ incident  handling and response capabilities, while the EU Member States incident response  development status report(4) provides an insight into the NIS Directive(5) (Directive (EU)  2016/1148 on security of network and information systems) sectoral incident response  capabilities. ENISA has also carried out work in the field of national and governmental CSIRTs’  capabilities and incident response capabilities, including providing training material covering  some aspects of the development of CSIRTs.  To provide additional resources, a decision was made to publish guidelines and produce an  interactive online information repository to guide the establishment of different types of CSIRTs  and SOCs by building on the existing work of ENISA, especially in the areas of maturity and  training.  1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE WORK  This publication provides results-driven guidance for those who are interested in establishing a  CSIRT or SOC or modernising a CSIRT or SOC in a structured way.  A results-driven approach is taken throughout the publication to provide guidance on the  different stages involved in the establishment of a CSIRT organisation: assessment for  readiness, design, implementation, operation and improvement.  The expectation is that the reader will use this publication as a practical guide during the  individual phases involved in the establishment of CSIRTs. Readers may be stakeholders of  CSIRTs that are to be established.  This report aims to encourage the establishment of CSIRTs and SOCs and provide practical  techniques to ensure that the establishment and improvement process is effective.  3 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report  5 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  A more mature  ecosystem of  CSIRTs and  SOCs enables  better  cooperation and  collective actions  to respond to  cyber security  threats  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/study-on-csirt-landscape-and-ir-capabilities-in-europe-2025 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eu-ms-incident-response-development-status-report https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  6  1.3 OVERVIEW OF THE METHODOLOGY  Existing documents on CSIRT establishment focus on activities to do, without elaborating much  on the resulting outcome. This publication aims to build a recurring process of improvement and  related deliverables during the growth and development of a CSIRT. It was designed in a way  that provides guidance for all CSIRTs no matter what development stage they are in or their  current maturity.  To achieve this result data gathering methods such as analysis of current publications on the  establishment of CSIRTs (the analysis is summarised in Annex B); a field questionnaire aimed  at established CSIRTs and SOCs (Annex A); and the authors’ and reviewers’ practical  experience in establishing and improving CSIRTs, were used. The objective was to make this  publication as close to real life as possible. For this reason citations from various CSIRT teams  as well as realistic costing and timing were included.  FIRST.org CSIRT Services Framework, as well as SIM3 assessment model are referred to as  companions in the process because they are widely respected when defining an initial service  catalogue for new CSIRT teams and for the assessment and development of CSIRT maturity.  1.4 DEFINITIONS OF CSIRT AND SOC  The most common terms used to describe the teams responsible for incident response handling  are CSIRT, CERT(6), and SOC.  1.4.1 Computer security incident response teams  The term CSIRT, or computer security incident response team, was established in the 1990s.  CSIRTs are also known as CIRTs (Computer incident response teams), CERTs (Computer  emergency response teams), SIRTs (Security incident response teams) among others. National  teams may also be called national cyber security centres (NCSCs), which by law are usually  assigned the CSIRT role as well as providing additional services for the nation (e.g. handling a  country’s information classification schemes). Each team chooses its name based on the  preference of the organisation.  CSIRT has become a generic name for a team that provides a set of services: information and  cybersecurity incident handling (core service), security monitoring, vulnerability management,  situational awareness and cybersecurity knowledge management.  In simpler terms, a CSIRT7 is a team that is assigned to handle computer security (thus, often,  cybersecurity) incidents. Often this includes additional responsibilities, from detection to  analysis, and even hands-on fixing, as well as different situational awareness, knowledge  transfer and vulnerability management activities. Over the years, the role of a CSIRT has  evolved from providing incident monitoring and handling services to coordinating and  communicating with different stakeholders, countries and specific sectors.  Currently, FIRST.org hosts and continuously improves a CSIRT Services Framework (8), which  is a high-level document that describes the activities carried out by CSIRTs. These activities are  organised into five main service areas, which are further split into services, functions and sub-  functions. A CSIRT can choose which of the services and functions are relevant to their  mandate and organise them into their own services structure. Although this framework does not  define a SOC framework, services from some of the areas can also be applicable to SOC  6 CERT, or computer emergency response team, is the oldest term and has been trademarked by the Software Engineering  Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).  7 See CSIRT definition for example at “Baseline capabilities for national / governmental CERTs”  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs  8 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental-certs https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/csirts/csirt_services_framework  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  7  teams. The CSIRT Services Framework is supported by ENISA, the International  Telecommunications Union (ITU) and many other organisations.  Typically, a minimal set of services for CSIRTs usually includes those those in bold below in  accordance with the FIRST services framework.  1.4.2 Security operations centres  A SOC, or security operations centre, provides an incident detection service by observing  technical events in networks and systems and can also be responsible for incident  response and handling. In large enterprises, SOCs sometimes focus only on monitoring and  detection services and then hand over incident handling to a separate CSIRT. In smaller  organisations, CSIRTs and SOCs are often considered to be synonymous.  Typically, SOC teams operate from SOC rooms, where analysts sit at their workstations in  front of a video wall that projects a summary of the current situation (Figure 2). SOC teams  typically evolve from information technology (IT) security teams automating their work using  security information and event management (SIEM) and other security automation and  orchestration technology for security monitoring. SOC teams usually focus their key  performance indicators (KPIs) around quality indicators – detection speed, detection  breadth, coverage, false-positive rates – as well as incidents handled, the ratio of  alerts/events/incidents, number of escalations and workload per incident.  ‘SOC is the first line,  they receive all alerts,  whereas IRT would  only receive escalated  alerts or be involved  in the coordination.  SOC is the  responsibility of our  members as we are a  sector CERT’  (sectorial CSIRT)  Figure 1: FIRST services framework – typical CSIRT services  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  8  As well as operating physically, SOCs can consist of virtual and outsourced staff, or a hybrid  model of internal and outsourced staff. It is common practice that, over time, SOCs alternate  between outsourced and internal operations.  As both CSIRT and SOC organisations adhere to the same CSIRT Services framework, both  CSIRTs and SOCs are referred to this report as CSIRTs.  Typically, a minimal set of services for SOCs usually includes those in bold below in accordance  with the FIRST services framework.

The foundational document on the establishment of a CSIRT is the CSIRT Setting up  Guide (10), published in 2006. It was translated into more than 20 languages, including  Chinese and Hindi. This 86-page publication covers the step-by-step process of creating a  CSIRT and is still valid today.  ENISA’s Good Practice Guide for Incident Management (11), published in 2010, provides  guidelines for establishing incident handling management structures and capabilities; it can  be used as a reference for establishment topics including incident handling processes and  workflows.  ENISA’s training package (12) provides online training materials, training courses and exercise  materials for cybersecurity specialists, based on the ‘Train the Trainer’ philosophy.  ENISA has also published a body of knowledge for national and governmental CSIRTs on, for  example, baseline capabilities (13) and maturity profiles (14), as well as a self-assessment tool.  In the past few years, ENISA has published a guidance document on CSIRT and law  enforcement partnerships (15), including an analysis of partnership models, technical  cooperation, electronic evidence analysis (16) and training modules. In addition, further  information on how to choose a CSIRT cooperation model and the technical implementation  of cooperation models is available from the ENISA website.  This report aims to enhance ENISA’s existing body of knowledge on the establishment of  CSIRTs. The content of this report is based on an analysis of previous publications on the  establishment of CSIRTs (the analysis is summarised in Annex B); a field questionnaire  (Annex A), which was completed by 40 CSIRTs and SOCs; and the authors’ experiences in  establishing and improving CSIRTs as part of numerous projects carried out in Europe,  Asia, Africa and South America.  9 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications#c8=CSIRTs  10 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/csirt-setting-up-guide  11 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/good-practice-guide-for-incident-management  12 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-governmental-certs-enisas-recommendations-on-baseline-capabilities  14 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity  15 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/support-the-fight-against-cybercrime-roadmap-on-csirt-le-cooperation  16 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/electronic-evidence-a-basic-guide-for-first-responders  ‘ENISA has excellent  publications which  are well organised  and easy to read and  understand’  (Unicom CSIRT)  ‘Most of the  publications and  guidance from  ENISA is relevant to  our effective work.

GUIDELINES FOR  ESTABLISHING CSIRTS  2.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE GUIDELINES  The guidelines for establishing CSIRTs are organised according to the different phases of the  CSIRT establishment (17) process:   Assessment for readiness   Design   Implementation   Operations   Improvement.  The establishment of a new CSIRT starts with the ‘assessment for readiness’ phase, which  begins with a discussion about the reasons and necessity for establishing a CSIRT and ends  with the approval of an initial budget and shaping requirements for the design phase.  During the ‘design’ phase, detailed plans for the implementation phase are developed.  The ‘implementation’ phase covers organisational matters: governance, people, processes,  services and technology.  In the ‘operations’ phase, a CSIRT delivers the CSIRT services.  Existing CSIRTs can follow the guidelines from the ‘improvement’ phase rather than from the  ‘assessment for readiness’ phase.  During the ‘improvement’ phase, a CSIRT formulates requests for improvements, prioritises  initiatives and receives an approved budged for following the ‘design–implementation–  operation–improvement’ cycle.  17 In this report ‘establishment’ refers to a CSIRT’s path from a conceptual idea to a strong and mature CSIRT several years  later or to advancing an existing CSIRT into further development stages.  Figure 4: Lifecycle of CSIRT  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  11  These guidelines are organised based on the outcomes of each phase.  1.

The percentages in Figure 6 represent the workload/time required for the different roles. For  example, ‘1 x Project manager 50 %’ means that one project manager is required and that the  required tasks will take up to 50 % of their maximum workload/time.  2.2 ASSESSMENT FOR READINESS  In the assessment for readiness phase, the following outcomes are expected.   Preliminary mandate   Governance structure   Identification of the CSIRT hosting organisation   High-level roadmap and budget   Detailed requirements for the design stage  Figure 6: Sample of CSIRT establishment phases and required efforts  Figure 7: Implementation phases  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  14  2.2.1 Preliminary mandate  A CSIRT begins with a purpose – the initial idea and reasons why a CSIRT is needed. The  establishment of a CSIRT must be justified.  The expectations of stakeholders and constituencies should be carefully considered before  deciding to establish a CSIRT. In practice, this means considering the following aspects.  1. Identifying all major stakeholders and understanding their needs and expectations of a  CSIRT. Depending on the stakeholder, their needs can include identification of  incidents, security awareness, resolution of incidents and compliance with certain  standards.  2. Identifying constituencies. This could be a small group of companies for a sectorial  CSIRT, the residents of a city or even a whole country. Evaluating and meeting the  needs and expectations of a specific constituency are extremely important for the  success of a CSIRT.  A series of workshops should be planned with the main stakeholders and representatives of  constituencies in order to obtain their support for the establishment of a CSIRT and to start a  conversation about the real value that a CSIRT could bring. This can then be used as input for  justifying the establishment of a CSIRT and for its mandate and budgeting.  Common justifications for establishing a CSIRT include:  1. The need to organise cybersecurity incident handing in a professional way to minimise  the impact of incidents.  2. The need to have a professional team to respond to cybersecurity incidents using  internationally accepted incident handling methods.  3. The need to be trusted by other CSIRTs around the world during incident  investigations.  4. The need to have a coordinating team for cybersecurity incident handling, vulnerability  handling, situational and security awareness rising and analysis of threats.  A team’s purpose is determined in a CSIRT mandate, which must include the authority and  responsibilities given to the team.  A mandate usually includes:  1. The authority given to a CSIRT to serve and act in a constituency.  2. The responsibilities of the CSIRT.  3. Requirements, objectives and tasks.  For a CSIRT with internal-only constituencies in an organisation or a managed security service  provider (MSSP) set-up, the mandate is usually expressed in a single document of one of the  following types:  1. An office order (in a government agency).  2. A decision or resolution by the board or executive management (in a private  enterprise).  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  15  For sectoral or national CSIRTs, the mandate is usually expressed in at least two documents,  namely:  1. A cybersecurity strategy, law or by-law, or government order assigning authority and  overall responsibility (the only way to establish authority over a country’s different  organisations).  2. An office order of the CSIRT hosting organisation, outlining the detailed requirements,  objectives and tasks and a list of services.  The following additional guidance on the mandate should also be followed.  1. The responsibilities of a CSIRT must be stated. Simply stating that a CSIRT is being  established is not enough; the mandate should also indicate what its responsibilities  are and why it is needed.  2. The responsibilities should indicate which overall constituency a CSIRT will serve, for  example a CSIRT for the financial sector for cyberthreat management, threat  information sharing and critical incident coordination, or a CSIRT for internal business  divisions for cybersecurity monitoring and incident handling.  3. An authorised body must issue authority to a CSIRT. For sectoral or national CSIRTs  this might be the national government, the parliament or a ministry.  4. An organisation or a business unit must be assigned to establish a CSIRT. Sometimes  this might be a new organisation.  For national governments or sectoral regulators, the development of a mandate usually begins  with drafting of a law, bill, cybersecurity strategy or cybersecurity plan.  For organisational CSIRTs, the development of a mandate usually begins after receiving  approval to establish a CSIRT from the management board or C-level executives, starting with  the purpose why it is being established.  An approved mandate of authority and responsibility usually indicates a person, unit or  organisation that will lead the establishment of a CSIRT.  Examples of phrases typically used in mandate documents include the following.  1. Cybersecurity has become very important; thus, a CSIRT is being established to  increase the resilience of information systems to cyberattacks; manage cyberthreats;  work on lowering the costs of the impact of incidents by establishing strong incident  management controls; improve know-how; foster collaboration between stakeholders;  and ensure cyber situational awareness and cyber situational visibility.  2. A sectoral (national, organisational) CSIRT is being established by modernising the  current IT security unit to provide effective cyber resilience, organise incident  responses, enable cyber situational awareness and establish cyber information  exchange channels with partner organisations.  For EU Member States, NIS Directive  Annexes I and II present the requirements, tasks and  mandatory constituencies of national CSIRTs; the high-level responsibility of CSIRTs is  described as follows: ‘responsible for risk and incident handling in accordance with a well-  defined process’.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  16  Examples of mandates for the establishment of a CSIRT include:   btCIRT (18) – national CIRT of Bhutan, established by government order.   BGD e-GOV CIRT (19) – Bangladesh government sectorial CSIRT, established by office  order.  Additional guidance on mandates and responsibilities can be found in ENISA’s Good Practice  Guide for Incident Management (2010), Section 5.4.  2.2.2 Governance structure  The governance structure defines the responsibilities of the CSIRT’s stakeholders. It can be  presented as a planning document or even as part of the mandate.  The governance structure document should provide answers to a number of questions.  1. Who will provide funding for the establishment and operations of a CSIRT and on what  grounds?  2. Who will provide direction, monitoring and oversight of the CSIRT?  3. What types of agreements should the CSIRT have and with which stakeholders (e.g.  law enforcement, intelligence agencies, international organisations, technology  partners, academia)?  4. Who will the CSIRT report to, how often and in what form?  The owner of the CSIRT governance structure is usually the hosting organisation.  The governance structure is usually clarified during the workshops held to discuss the mandate  with various stakeholders.  2.2.3 Identification of the CSIRT hosting organisation  The CSIRT hosting organisation is usually mentioned in the preliminary mandate. The hosting  organisation might already exist or might need to be set up.  If a new hosting organisation is being established, the CSIRT budget can be approved only after  the organisation is functional in terms of setting up management and legal processes, meaning  that additional time will be required at this stage.  When choosing an organisation to host a CSIRT, the organisation’s authority to deliver the  services in accordance with the CSIRT’s mandate must be evaluated.  2.2.4 High-level roadmap and budget  After the mandate is defined, a high-level roadmap and budget must be approved.  The roadmap should include an expected timeline for the CSIRT establishment phases –  design, implementation and operations – and further improvement initiatives.  18 https://www.btcirt.bt/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BtCIRT-Mandatep2.pdf  19 https://www.cirt.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Government-Mandate-of-BGD-e-GOV-CIRT.pdf  https://www.btcirt.bt/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BtCIRT-Mandatep2.pdf https://www.cirt.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Government-Mandate-of-BGD-e-GOV-CIRT.pdf  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  17  Commonly, it takes 2–3 years from development of the preliminary mandate to initial mandate  approval when a CSIRT becomes fully operational. This includes the following steps:  1. Budget approval, setting up of facilities, organisation establishment and initial hiring  can take up to 1 year.  2. Design and implementation usually take 1–2 years, especially if the assistance of  external consultants and technology has to be acquired through public tenders.  The budget for the initial year, which is spent on the establishment of the CSIRT and initial  services, should cover at least:  1. Initial staff salaries – at least for the minimum required personnel (CSIRT manager,  CSIRT establishment project manager, administrative assistant).  2. Facility establishment costs.  3. Salaries or consultancy service fees for creating the design stage results (legal  processes, CSIRT-related expertise, technology deployment).  4. CSIRT skills acquisition recruitment and training.  5. Preliminary technology and licences.  The budget should be adjusted according to the roadmap, mandate, stakeholder  commitment and requirements for how quickly the CSIRT should be established.  The budget should be adjusted again once the design phase has finished and when the detailed  plans are prepared for the implementation and operations phases. For example, if the budget is  insufficient, some aspects can be moved to the further improvement phase in the roadmap.  The following notes provide indicative costings for 2020. Cost estimates are done for illustrative  purposes only and does not depict any particular country.  1. In EU countries, a CSIRT staff member (including managers) costs on average  EUR 40 000–60 000 per year.  2. Small CSIRT operations with three staff members (manager, two incident handlers)  should budget around EUR 120 000–180 000 annually.  3. If a CSIRT is required to provide operations 24/7 for 365 days a year, it needs at least  12 additional employees (six teams of two staff members to cover 24/7, with each shift  covering 8 hours). This will add EUR 480 000 annually to the budget.  4. CSIRTs typically employ the following numbers of staff: small – 3–7, medium – 10–15,  large – 30–60, depending on the constituency size and mandate.  5. The cost of office rental is normally around EUR 3 000–4 000 per staff member per  year.  ‘We operate 24/7’  (national CSIRT)  Figure 8: Roadmap example  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  18  6. It is common to spend EUR 3 000–10 000 on staff training per person per year.  Attending conferences is highly recommended (one event per person per year).  7. Depending on the scope, consultancy services for the establishment of a CSIRT  (design and implementation) can cost from EUR 75 000 to EUR 1 000 000 over a 1- to  3-year period.  8. It is common to spend EUR 100 000–300 000 on technology: hardware (at least two  servers with virtualisation, backup solutions, firewalls, computers, printers), networking  and specialised equipment for performing specific CSIRT operations (digital forensics,  reverse engineering, vulnerability assessment, etc.). Using cloud services can be an  effective way to limit initial investments in hardware, by allowing spending only on what  is actually being used.  9. With regard to software components, CSIRTs might begin by using mostly open-  source20 solutions, using commercial tools only if there are no comparative alternatives  or for their better effectiveness. In this case, the budget for software and software  services should start at EUR 50 000. If CSIRTs are focusing on commercial  technology, the budget should be increased; however, focusing on commercial  technology can result in higher productivity, i.e. fewer staff members are required.  The initial amounts in the budget and the time period over which the budget should be spent  may change over time. Design phase activities will be bound by the approved budget available.  The approved budget will impact the final detailed mandate, as an organisation can achieve the  anticipated results only when a sufficient budget is made available. The discrepancy between  the detailed mandate and the budget is a common reason why CSIRTs do not fulfil their  mandate.  It may take 3 years for a CSIRT to become operational, so the budget should reflect the  expected intensity of the CSIRT establishment process.  2.2.5 Detailed requirements for the design stage  The design phase activities will be based on the requirements and constraints of the CSIRT,  such as:  1. The agreed mandate.  2. The roadmap and budget.  3. The people, competences and resources allocated to the design phase.  These must be validated and approved.  When external consultancy work is involved, the detailed requirements are often expressed  as the consultancy project terms of reference (ToR) for a competitive tender (request for  information (RFI)/request for proposal (RFP)).  When preparing the ToR for such work, it is relevant to include:  1. The mandate definition of the CSIRT.  2. A clear statement of the expected results.  3. The expected delivery plan.  4. The experience required from the consultants from delivering similar activities.  20 When using Open source solutions CSIRT needs to take into consideration who is managing and updating particular  solution  ‘We buy some  specific services  from vendors on  behalf of the  whole sector, e.g.  TI for specific  geographical  regions/actors;  sandboxes,  takedown of  domains, etc.’  (sectorial CSIRT)  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  19  2.3  DESIGN  The design phase prerequisites are all of the outcomes from the assessment for readiness  phase.  The design phase recommendations are aligned with SIM3 (security incident management  maturity model which estimates how well a team governs, documents, performs and measures  their function), covering all four areas – organisation, human, tools and processes – in  sequence, as presented below. This guidance does not provide specific advice on how to reach  the maturity levels, as this information can be found in the SIM3 assessment tools from  ENISA (21) or the Open CSIRT Foundation (22).  In the design phase, the following outcomes are expected, in the form of either separate  approved documents or one approved document.  1. Approved detailed mandate  2. CSIRT services plan  3. CSIRT processes and workflows plan  4. CSIRT organisation, skills and training structure plan  5. CSIRT facilities plan  6. CSIRT technologies and processes automation plan  7. CSIRT cooperation plan  8. CSIRT IT and information security management plan  9. Detailed requirements for the implementation stage  In addition, the resulting design structure is often published in RFC 2350 format (23) – this is the  de facto format for the formal presentation of a CSIRT, covering the team name, contact  information, the time zone, PGP (pretty good privacy) keys, the mandate (charter), policies and  services, etc. It is good practice for a CSIRT to publish the RFC 2350 document on its own  website.  2.3.1 Approved detailed mandate  The design phase is based on the requirements of the CSIRT mandate, which might still be in  final discussions or might include some broad overarching statements. In this phase it must be  ensured that final approval has been granted (e.g. the mandate has been signed by the  minister, or board of directors, or executive) and that the mandate is clear and easy to  understand and sets out:  1. The authority given to a CSIRT to serve and act in its constituency.  2. The responsibilities of the CSIRT.  3. The requirements, objectives and tasks.  The approval of the mandate, together with the budget constraints and the initial roadmap for  establishment of the CSIRT, allows for successful preparation of the design.  A detailed mandate might indicate how to name a CSIRT, as described below.  1. The name of the organisation should reflect the mandate, ensuring that it is clearly  formulated and includes the role of the CSIRT.  2. The type of constituency covered is often reflected in the name; for example, national  CSIRTs are often named using the two-letter country code and the CSIRT/CIRT/CERT  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  22 https://sim3-check.opencsirt.org/  23 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey https://sim3-check.opencsirt.org/ https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2350  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  20  abbreviation, joined by a dash, a dot or some other symbol, e.g. CERT-LV, CERT-MU,  SK-CERT. The sector is often included too in a shortened form; for example, the  financial sector would be FinCIRT or FS-CSIRT, with the country additionally named  using the two-letter country code, e.g. EG (EG-FinCIRT).  3. Often, a name is chosen based on a short company or organisation name and adding  CSIRT, for example Adidas CSIRT, CSIRT BNP Paribas.  4. A CSIRT is often referred to as a CIRT, CERT or SIRT. Such organisations must  provide an incident handling (response) service.  5. The SOC name is usually used for organisations that monitor operations for the  security of networks and data centres, for example NestleSOC, TDC SOC. Recently,  names such as iSOC (24) and gSOC (25) have also been used.  6. When the primary function of an incident response team is to handle the vulnerabilities  of the products of a certain company, it is usually referred to as a PSIRT (26), for  example Adobe PSIRT, NVIDIA PSIRT, Fujitsu PSIRT. Separate guidance on PSIRTs  has been created by FIRST.org (27).  7. Examples of existing team names are available on the FIRST.org (28), Trusted  Introducer (29) and ENISA CSIRTs Map30.  8. If the chosen name includes the CERT abbreviation, a request for approval must be  submitted to the CERT trademark owner SEI (31) (the SEI policy may be amended in  the future).  2.3.2 CSIRT services plan  The CSIRT services plan explains which services a CSIRT organisation will provide to a  constituency to fulfil the roles and responsibilities defined in the mandate and adhere to the  roadmap and budget constraints.  24 An iSOC is an integrated SOC, for example in the energy sector, combining an operational technology (OT) SOC and an IT SOC.  25 A gSOC is a global or government SOC.  26 A PSIRT is a product security incident response team.  27 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/psirts/psirt_services_framework_v1.1  28 https://www.first.org/members/teams/  29 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams.html  30 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  31 https://www.sei.cmu.edu/education-outreach/license-sei-materials/authorization-to-use-cert-mark/  Figure 9: FIRST services framework  https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/psirts/psirt_services_framework_v1.1 https://www.first.org/members/teams/ https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams.html https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map https://www.sei.cmu.edu/education-outreach/license-sei-materials/authorization-to-use-cert-mark/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  21  The following guidelines are provided for preparation of the CSIRT services plan.  1. CSIRT should take a look at the latest version of the FIRST.org CSIRT Services  Framework (32). This document is now available in several languages. This document  presents the conceptual CSIRT services map, as presented below.  2. Choose which service areas (out of five) and which exact services the CSIRT should  provide to fulfil the specific mandate stipulations.  3. Select and adjust the names of the service areas as the names provided in the CSIRT  Services Framework may be too detailed initially. For example, when looking at the  information security event management service area for SOCs, one might decide to  consolidate both services (monitoring and detection and event analysis) into one entity  and to rename the service area as security monitoring. Similarly, within the information  security incident management service area, one might choose to include two services:  incident handling service and artefact analysis.  4. Validate the list of resulting services to ensure that all of the mandate requirements are  covered and that it does not include more services than the mandate requires. The  resources of CSIRTs are limited; therefore, it is reasonable to concentrate on what is  mandatory to ensure the provision of good-quality services for which proper authority  has been provided.  The list of chosen CSIRT services should be listed in a CSIRT services catalogue. ITIL  (information technology infrastructure library) methodology may be of value to organise the  delivery of services. It is important to clearly understand the distinction between the different  meanings of the word ‘incident’ – in CSIRTs, ‘incident handling’ is the name of the service,  while in ITIL methodology ‘incident’ means a disturbance to service delivery, i.e. that the  service cannot be delivered, with the ‘incident’ being closed when the service is recovered.  Realistically, CSIRTs must ensure that good-quality services are delivered and, if these  services are disrupted, they are rapidly recovered. For example, if a CSIRT IT system fails,  this could be recovered using an internal IT support process according to ITIL33 principles.  2.3.3 CSIRT processes and workflows plan  CSIRT processes are needed to implement and support agreed CSIRT services.  Typically, each type of service delivery is implemented using at least one process. More than  one process may be required to deliver a service if, for example, service provisioning requires  several working groups to be involved, or specific intermediate goals must be reached.  Some processes may be established as supportive processes, for example, an IT support  process for maintaining and updating CSIRT IT infrastructure. This process can be handled  using ITIL methodology, using a separate IT services catalogue (not to be confused with a  CSIRT services catalogue).  The interrelationships between the identified processes should be analysed and documented.  For example, the output from the security monitoring process is an identified incident that is  handed over to the incident handling process as input; the artefact analysis process can be  initiated from the incident handling process when needed.  32 https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/  33 https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil  On activities:  ‘incident response,  monitoring sensor  network, dispatching  notifications,  constituency  building, awareness  raising and  education, training  and cyber exercises’  (national CSIRT)  https://www.first.org/standards/frameworks/ https://www.axelos.com/best-practice-solutions/itil  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  22  Each process consists of one or more workflows, represented by workflow diagrams, depicting  each step from the start until the final phase of activity. In addition, it is common to provide a  tabular description of each step.  An example of a security incident handling workflow diagram, taken from ENISA’s Good  Practice Guide for Incident Management (2010), is provided below.  An example of an interrelationship diagram for different services and processes is presented in  Figure 11.  When designing processes and workflows, the human parameters of SIM3, the ENISA CSIRT  maturity assessment model (34) and the SOC capability and maturity model (SOC-CMM) (35)  might be relevant tools for validating their completeness and coverage.  34 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity  35https://www.soc-cmm.com/  Figure 10: Incident handling workflow example  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity https://www.soc-cmm.com/  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  23  Examples of security incident handling and security monitoring processes, which are used for  implementing security incident management and security monitoring services, are provided in  Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Process definitions are adapted to the needs of CSIRTs.  Table 1: Examples of security incident handling processes  Process name Security incident management  Description Security incident management covers incident report registration, triage,  incident resolving and incident closing  Process owner Security incident manager  Purpose To ensure that every incident detected is handled according to defined  quality requirements and that response activities are carried out to  mitigate any incidents, followed by actions to improve security measures;  and to increase the maturity of the constituent’s security processes so  that it is more resilient to cyberthreats in the future  Service input/triggers 1.

Table 3: Example guidelines for intrusion incident handling  Section Description  Containment guidelines Objective: Advise the constituency and coordinate its efforts and participate in  investigations of critical incidents  1. Advise the constituency to involve law enforcement authorities in the investigation  2. For incidents with a high level of criticality, consider sending the CSIRT to  conduct an investigation in place or ask for logs to be shared and conduct the  investigation at the CSIRT’s premises. Share the findings with the constituency  3. Advise the constituency to:  3.1. Analyse logs  3.2. Find out the incident root cause  3.3. Assess for damage  3.4. Block malicious IP and DNS addresses  3.5. Implement quick workarounds  4. Evaluate the risk to other infrastructures and share anonymised incident details  with the constituency  5. Look for recent similar incidents, evaluate the situation and, if necessary, raise  the criticality level. Inform management about suspicious repeated intrusions  Mitigation guidelines Objective: Help the constituency to find and fix the root cause of the incident,  preserving any forensic evidence  1. Advise the constituency to:  1.1. Apply patches  1.2. Replace outdated and unsupported systems  1.3. Implement permanent workarounds  1.4. Implement best security practices  2. For high criticality incidents, request detailed investigation reports or offer  resources to ensure proper incident analysis  Recovery guidelines Objective: Support constituencies when returning to normal operations after the  incident and lift temporary preventive measures  1. In the case of a high criticality incident, conduct a security assessment to evaluate  the effectiveness of mitigation measures  2. Organise seminars for security personnel and explain common intrusion methods  and mitigation strategies  3. Once a year conduct a technical cybersecurity exercise or training in a real-life  environment  Figure 13: A simple security monitoring process workflow diagram  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  26  2.3.4 CSIRT organisation, skills and training structure plan  The CSIRT processes are run by CSIRT staff, who are organised into particular organisational  structures.  Smaller CSIRTs of up to five to seven people are mostly organised as one unit run by a unit  manager (Figure 15). In this case, staff roles may be based on the NIST NICE framework’s  Cyber Defence Incident Responder work roles (PR-CIR-001) (36).  For larger CSIRT organisations of over 10 people, the structural units should be designed  according to the services structure or the activities run or other organisational practices  (Figure 16). Again, the NIST NICE37  roles may serve as a starting point for defining staff roles.  36 https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-  framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder  37 National Institute of Standards and Technology National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education  https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice  Staff training:  ‘TRANSITS I and II  for all plus internal  policies/procedures  to use tools and  communicate with  rest of the team’  (ISP CSIRT)  Figure 15: Example of organisational units for a bigger CSIRT  Figure 14: Example of a small CSIRT structure  https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder https://niccs.us-cert.gov/workforce-development/cyber-security-workforce-framework/workroles?name=Cyber+Defense+Incident+Responder https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  27  It should be noted that 24/7 shift work can become very expensive, as six teams are required to  cover the 8-hour shifts, including holidays. Thus, CSIRTs often use one of following operating  procedures:  1. Operate only during normal business hours.  2. Have someone on duty to monitor calls or emergency escalations.  3. Outsource night and weekend registration monitoring to an external party for initial  triage.  4. Rely on existing 24/7 network operations centre operations to process initial calls  according to typical basic standard operating procedures (SOPs) and call experts if  needed if a duty phone is in operation.  ENISA has developed around 50 training courses on CSIRT-related topics, which are provided  for free on their website (38). These training materials cover technical and operational aspects,  setting up a CSIRT, legal and cooperation aspects, and guidance on, for example, proactive  training for CSIRTs and training methodologies. All of the training materials are licensed under  a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license, i.e. they are open for use by anyone under  attribution to ENISA. However, the training materials are non-commercial and thus are most  useful for internal training delivered by CSIRT senior staff members.  Similarly, FIRST.org provides an increasing number of training courses on its website  education pages (39), under the same licence terms.  Also GEANT provides training for CSIRTs  TRANSITS I and TRANSITS II40  Suggested technical training courses and laboratories for incident handlers are provided in  Tables 4 and 5.

In addition, each CSIRT must develop comprehensive professional,  leadership and operational skills during the implementation phase using the following means.  1. Knowledge transfer by implementation experts in the form of workshops, training,  mentoring and post-implementation support.  2. Visits to other CSIRTs to learn about their operations. At least two to three visits to  CSIRTs in other countries should be planned. Visits usually last for a few hours and  are focused on sharing operational experience. Some CSIRTs carry out staff  exchanges to build knowledge.  All CSIRT staff members must develop professional competences, as described in the NIST  NICE framework (where KSA stands for knowledge, skills, and abilities) (Table 6).

For example, Coursera.org provides more than 1 000  courses on leadership.  2.3.5 CSIRT facilities plan  Secure facilities with separate workspaces and clear physical rules and regulations are  essential for the efficient functioning of CSIRTs.  At a minimum the CSIRT facilities should include a data room to house any technology, an  office room for incident handling staff, and a guest reception or meeting room.  To enable business continuity, the continuity of the CSIRT infrastructure should be ensured. To  this end, redundant systems and backup working space should be available.  The following must be taken into consideration when planning facilities.  1. Physical security should be considered and proper access control and monitoring  should be established. In addition, a risk assessment should be performed based on  neighbouring facilities.  2. The data room must provide a level of physical and environmental security that is  appropriate to the data that the CSIRT will possess and manage.  3. The office room for incident handling staff must provide an appropriate, convenient and  secure working environment by ensuring the ‘least required privilege’ access for  personnel.  CSIRTs must implement appropriate physical security measures, such as ensuring perimeter  control of the premises and providing access controls for entry into the different rooms for  reasons of confidentiality.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  32  Additional sources of information on physical security requirements are the ISO 2700141  standard from the International Organization for Standardization, Field Manual FM 3-19.3042  and national regulations. Organisations should refer to their internal safety or physical security  teams for further advice on implementation of security measures.  Larger CSIRTs may have separate zones for a digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)  laboratory, security monitoring (a SOC room), a crisis room and a visitors’ room.  2.3.6 CSIRT technologies and processes automation plan  A CSIRT’s success depends heavily on the automation of its processes. Generic IT automation  processes are used for workplaces and office work. There are also specific CSIRT processes  related to automation.  A typical CSIRT should adhere to the following practices with regard to its technical  infrastructure.  1. As an on-premises data centre solution, a CSIRT must have at least two virtualisation  servers to ensure high availability and recovery. In case one fails, backups are  performed on a third server using tapes or an alternative solution, located in a different  room.  2. Network segmentation must ensure that data centre production systems, the LAN  (local area network), the guest network, the laboratory and the DMZ (demilitarised  zone) are separated accordingly via firewall rules.  3. CSIRTs and SOCs are often cautious about using cloud systems extensively, as  shown by the survey responses. Cloud services are mandatory at least for SaaS  (software-as-a-service) services, for example data feeds from external dataset  providers or websites used for interaction. Use of cloud services often results in  availability, cost and operational efficiencies, with less data governance. Depending on  a CSIRT’s data security needs and risk appetite, different cloud services may be  utilised.  41 https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  42 https://www.wbdg.org/FFC/ARMYCOE/FIELDMAN/fm31930.pdf  On tools:  ‘MISP for threat  information sharing.  Elastic to analyze data.  matrix.org as internal  communications  platform. Gitlab for  internal projects  management. BBB for  video conferencing.  Commercial feeds and  tools for specific tasks  if no viable open  source alternative  exists.’  (national CSIRT)  Figure 16: Example layout of the internal rooms for a CSIRT  https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html https://www.wbdg.org/FFC/ARMYCOE/FIELDMAN/fm31930.pdf  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  33  Often, automation needs fall into the following areas:  1. ticketing systems for incident report registration and handling – typically, CSIRTs use  RTIR, OTRS, ServiceNow and Jira, among other ticketing technologies.  2. data feed processing and routing – feed routers, threat intelligence platforms or  dataset repositories are used.  3. alert and awareness bulletin publishing platforms – these include website portals,  publishing platforms and social media channels.  2.3.7 CSIRT cooperation plan  A CSIRT’s success depends heavily on implementing effective working partnerships with  different stakeholders and the international CSIRT community.  After establishment, a CSIRT might not be known by all stakeholders and constituencies;  thus, it must actively approach stakeholders and constituencies and build cooperation  arrangements. Some of these cooperation initiatives will result in the signing of formal  memorandums of understanding (MoUs) or partnership agreements, or in formal and informal  memberships of associations and information sharing communities.  Trust-based and long-lasting partnerships require planning, including clear objectives from  each partnership and strategies for how to maintain the relationships.  The guidelines set out below should be followed.  1. A proactive approach to building partnerships with local and international law  enforcement and intelligence agencies might help to handle cybercrime incidents or  advanced persistent threats (APTs) more effectively in crisis situations.  2. Regional and national (if any) CSIRT initiatives for improving cooperation should be  considered. The Trusted Introducer listed status (43) (44),is relatively easy to achieve for  a CSIRT that is already operational and that has the support of other CSIRTs and  participates in CSIRT-related events and conferences. CSIRTs should subsequently  focus on attaining accredited status (45) or even certified status (46), The Trusted  Introducer scheme is the only certification scheme currently available for CSIRTs and  Trusted Introducer services are more focused to CSIRTs operating in Europe.  3. It is strongly advised that CSIRTs join the FIRST.org association as this is the major  global association for CSIRTs.  4. Proactively approaching different ISAC(47)s for partnering and exploring the value of  such partnerships is often a good way to determine what partnerships will be valuable.  5. The structure of MoUs and partnership agreements can usually be divided into three  parts:  a. the objectives of partnering – this can reflect the mandates of both parties;  b. what each of the parties will be doing in relation to each other, for example invite  each other to training sessions, share knowledge, participate in workshops and  exercises, share indicators, respond to inquiries about collaboration on incidents;  c. an initial action plan and timeline, to be executed after signing of the MoU or  agreement, which includes a joint evaluation of the agreement and planning of the  following year’s activities.  43 https://tf-csirt.org/membership/why-listed/  44https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/registration.html  45 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  46 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  47 Information Sharing and Analysis Centres  see  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-  strategies/information-sharing  ‘Anyrun for  sandboxing,  Recorded Future  for threat stream’  (MSSP SOC)  ‘Automation makes  the analysis of a big  incident easier and  more efficient.

For cooperation to work, related activities, for example organising, travel, hosting,  workshops and informal socialising, must have a dedicated budget as part of the  annual budget.  2.3.8 CSIRT IT and information security management plan  CSIRTs should implement an IT and information security management plan or adopt and adapt  the IT security framework from the hosting organisation.  It is recommended that CSIRTs adhere to industry good practices, for example  ISO 27001-based information security management systems (ISMS).  The IT management plan might adhere to COBIT(48) (control objectives for information and  related technology) and ITIL principles and methods.  2.3.9 Detailed requirements for the implementation stage  The results of the design plans should be included in the requirements for implementation,  explaining in more detail:  1. What the requirements are and how they should be implemented.  2. What precise outcomes should be achieved.  The detailed requirements might be included as ToR.  2.4 IMPLEMENTATION  The implementation phase focuses on rolling out all services, enabling processes, preparing  detailed procedures and training staff members.  At the end of the implementation phase, the CSIRT is ready to deliver services to its  constituency and start the operations phase.  In the implementation phase, the following outcomes are expected.  1. Approval and implementation of the organisational structure.  2. Hiring and appointing of staff.  3. Execution of a training plan for different staff roles.  4. Preparation of facilities.  5. Development and implementation of detailed processes and procedures.  6. Implementation of technology for the automation of processes.  7. Implementation of IT and information security management procedures.  8. Training of staff for CSIRT operations.  9. Signing of relevant agreements with the constituency, stakeholders and partners.  10. Test run of CSIRT services and tuning of results.  11. Launch of CSIRT communications and celebrations.  2.4.1 Approval and implementation of the organisational structure  For a CSIRT to become operational, the designed organisational structure must be approved  and the different positions defined.  48 https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit  https://www.isaca.org/resources/cobit  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  35  Sometimes this process can take months; thus, an organisation might begin work using an  interim structure, to enable work to progress without it being dependent on the CSIRT  establishment process.  For example, hiring can begin using an existing structure, with a clear plan of how resources will  be moved later, or by adjusting the initial services plan if a smaller number of staff are available.  2.4.2 Hiring and appointing of staff  The new structure must be filled with competent and skilled staff. It is highly likely that  only a few positions will be filled with current staff; thus, additional staff members must  be hired.  Usually, there is a lot of interest from those wanting to work for a newly established  CSIRT and gain professional experience; however, potential recruits often lack the  required competences.  As for other positions, it is important to hire staff showing a determination and  willingness to provide services in a professional manner.  2.4.3 Execution of a training plan for different staff roles  All CSIRT staff must have the initial skills needed for their roles. To upskill staff, the  designed training plan should support implementation of, and participation by staff  members in, standard training sessions, conferences and workshops.  Additional training for CSIRT operations – processes, and SOPs – must also be run.  2.4.4 Preparation of facilities  CSIRT facilities must be prepared according to the approved plan, taking into account physical  security and appropriate accesss rights.  Some teams choose to brand their facilities with logos and recognisable marks, whereas other  teams, especially if hosted in a national security area, do not provide any markings on their  buildings; the CSIRT is visible only inside the premises.  2.4.5 Development and implementation of detailed processes and  procedures  Planned CSIRT processes are implemented in the form of established procedures.  Some of the typical activities that are repeated are defined in SOPs and automated using  technology.  2.4.6 Implementation of technology for the automation of processes  Technology implementation is carried out by installing, configuring, documenting and testing  technologies.  CSIRTs use open-source software extensively, often written or contributed by other CSIRT  members.  2.4.7 Implementation of IT and information security management  procedures  CSIRTs must define and implement detailed procedures for IT and information security  management.  ‘SEI has a number of  open source tools on its  github site. These  include SiLK,  Cyberticket Studio,  Cyobstract, and others.  We have a network  situational awareness  suite of tools:  https://tools.netsa.cert.o  rg/ We also use MISP’  (CERT/CC)  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  36  A common challenge is that core CSIRT services and processes are a priority in the  implementation phase, while IT support and internal security management processes and  procedures usually receive less attention initially. Thus, it is expected that these processes and  procedures will require further improvements.  When a CSIRT is part of a larger organisation, the hosting organisation’s IT processes and  information security management system can be adopted into practice.  2.4.8 Training of staff for CSIRT operations  Extensive hands-on and theoretical knowledge transfer to CSIRT members with regard to  implemented technologies and procedures is crucial for establishment success.  Knowledge transfer activities are usually run in the form of hands-on workshops, where all  processes and procedures are explained and practised.  Further training can be carried out and identification of skills gaps achieved using crisis drills  and blue–red–purple teaming exercises.  2.4.9 Signing of relevant agreements with the constituency, stakeholders  and partners  During the execution of a CSIRT partnership plan, there might be a need for the implementation  of additional policies and procedures.  FIRST.org and Trusted Introducer membership applications should be submitted as soon as  they are ready and the requirements for functional and operational readiness have been  fulfilled. It may take a few months for the membership applications to be approved.  The building up and maintenance of partnerships require active participation and  communication and should be overseen by the CSIRT manager or, in case of larger CSIRTs,  the partnership manager.  2.4.10 Test run of CSIRT services and tuning of results  Once the processes and technologies have been implemented it is important to run tests for at  least a day and provide notifications of any deficiencies in processes and technologies in the  test run report. Tuning actions should then be carried out, that is, adjustments should be made  to processes, workflows and technology implementation as appropriate.  Irrespective of the initial preparations and planning, the results often reveal that some design  presumptions were not correct and some implementation activities must be modified.  2.4.11 Launch of CSIRT communications and celebrations  Once implementation has been completed, the CSIRT’s operations can begin. It is important to  communicate properly about the new CSIRT services, the CSIRT’s mode of operations, the  practical value it will provide and the responsibilities of the constituency and the CSIRT.  Typically, this communication is aligned with a CSIRT launch celebration and press release.  The launch celebration usually includes a small presentation, a visit to the facilities by the  constituency, stakeholders and journalists, and printed materials.  A successful launch can inspire and give positive momentum to the entire CSIRT.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  37  Similarly, other improvements are worth celebrating in order to draw positive stakeholder  attention to the CSIRT, for example inauguration of a CSIRT laboratory or cyber gym facilities,  launch of an annual report or any other major event in the life of the CSIRT.  2.5 OPERATIONS  The operations phase focuses on effective and efficient delivery of services, i.e. executing  the CSIRT mandate daily.  In the operations phase, the following outcomes are expected.  1. Measurement of KPIs.  2. Annual operations performance review.  3. Annual stakeholder needs review.  4. Approval of the annual budget.  5. Collection of improvement initiatives.  2.5.1 Measurement of key performance indicators  KPIs are used for management and governance purposes and quality monitoring. Not all  CSIRTs are KPI driven. It has been observed that many CSIRTs are overburdened and run  their overall operations without a sharp focus on the quality management of CSIRT  services.  The following guidelines are provided for the use of KPIs.  1. KPIs should be measured monthly. For mature organisations, weekly indicators might  also be of relevance. Annual KPIs are usually the sum of monthly KPIs.  2. KPIs should be linked to service delivery, i.e. they should be linked to each service and  should facilitate an understanding of whether or not a service is of a good quality and  meets service objectives.  3. Some KPIs are used only for statistical analysis whereas others are used for  implementing actions for improvement. For example, the number of incidents, analysed  monthly, is useful for statistical analysis – bigger or smaller numbers rarely produce  actions for improvement – whereas the number of visitors to the CSIRT website, where  alerts and awareness information is shared, indicates trends of relevance, which might  result in actions for improvement.  Examples of KPIs include:  1. The number of meetings with the constituency each month for awareness raising  (target: at least one).  2. Incident handling service-level agreement (SLA) breaches for critical incidents  (target: less than 5 %).  3. Number of monthly visitors to a website (target: an increase from the previous  month).  4. Number of awareness-raising campaigns carried out (target: at least one every  second month).  5. Trends in incident statistics (target: priority incidents must be handled according to  SLAs).  On KPIs:  ‘Time to respond and  mitigate ongoing DDoS  incidents via e-mail  (1.5 hours), respond  and mitigate ongoing  DDoS incidents (45  minutes)’  (ISP CSIRT)  On KPIs:  ‘incident statistics,  vulnerability  management statistics  (monthly and quarterly)  including number of  vulnerabilities detected  and remediated (only  critical and high for  now)’  (university CSIRT)  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  38  2.5.2 Annual operations performance review  The management team of an operational CSIRT should conduct the annual CSIRT performance  review, to identify successes to celebrate and areas for improvement.  During the internal phase of the review, staff skills and individual performances are assessed,  CSIRT processes are checked, automation is evaluated and KPIs are analysed.  The review of operations is commonly presented in the CSIRT annual report..  2.5.3 Annual stakeholder needs review  It is good practice to set up an annual workshop or meeting with CSIRT stakeholders where the  performance of the CSIRT and stakeholders’ priorities for and expectations of the CSIRT are  presented.  These priorities contribute to the planning of subsequent improvements for the CSIRT.  2.5.4 Approval of the annual budget  As for any organisation, CSIRTs must develop and gain approval for their annual budget each  year. The budget outlines which initiatives will receive additional funding.  The budget must be prepared in agreement with local laws, rules and regulations.  2.5.5 Collection of improvement initiatives  The internal annual review, stakeholder needs analysis and daily operations allow identification  of CSIRT requirements that may need to be improved. These are analysed as part of the  improvement phase.  Ideas for improvements may also come from the operations review. All improvement initiatives  should be presented in a table, including justifications and explanations of need.  2.6  IMPROVEMENT  The improvement phase focuses on selecting and approving CSIRT enhancement initiatives.  After approval, these initiatives are moved to the design, implementation and operations  phases. Improvement process should be continuous during existence of CSIRT.  In the improvement phase, the following outcomes are expected.  1. List of improvement initiatives.  2. Detailed plans for improvement initiatives for the design stage.  3. Preliminary budget for improvement initiatives.  2.6.1 List of improvement initiatives  It is often difficult initially to execute the CSIRT mandate at an excellent level of quality because  of a lack of skills, automation, processes and resources; thus, balancing improvement priorities  is a common activity for CSIRTs.  Improvement initiatives come from the operations phase as areas requiring improvement; from  a high-level roadmap; from additional guidance from stakeholders; or from the demands of  CSIRT management to improve the maturity and capability of the CSIRT.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  39  Guidance on maturity improvement is available from frameworks such as SIM3 and SOC-CMM  and from ENISA, the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), the CERT Coordination Center  (CERT/CC) and FIRST.org, among others.  With the knowledge of existing resources available for improvement initiatives, the management  team of a CSIRT decides which initiatives to prioritise and approve and what resources to  allocate, e.g. the budget and number of people. Examples of improvement initiatives for  prioritisation are provided in Table 9.  Table 9: Examples of improvement initiatives for prioritisation  Initiative  Budget  required(49)  (EUR)  Duration  (months)  Justification Approved  Automation of  incident  detection  150 000  4  CSIRT requires  automation of registration  and routing of incidents  from public sources and  internal networks  Yes  Honeypot  initiative  80 000  6  Honeypots provide  visibility into who is  attacking networks and  how  Yes  Design,  implementation  and 1-year  operation of an  awareness  service  75 000  3  Constituency lacks timely  and focused awareness of  contextual information;  thus, it has limited  resilience to social and  technical attacks  Yes  ISO 27001  certification  50 000  8  CSIRT handles sensitive  data and thus must ensure  that internal information  security processes are  operating well  Yes  DFIR laboratory 250 000  12  Required for a few  incidents  Postponed until the  following year as the  number of cases  requiring digital  forensic analysis is  low  SOP  development  60 000  4  Clear and detailed  procedural instructions  result in fewer errors in  operations and faster  learning for new personnel  Postponed until the  following year  because of lack of  resources  Threat  intelligence  automation and  commercial  provider of  information  60 000  3  Improve quality with  regard to the detection  and analysis of incidents  Postponed until the  following year;  unable to currently  consume data  properly because of  lack of staff  Attaining SIM3  ENISA/Global  CSIRT Maturity  Framework  (GCMF)  intermediate  level  40 000  5  Increased maturity allows  the provision of better-  quality services in a more  streamlined and uniform  way and a reduction in  defect rates, and  increases trust and the  reputation of the CSIRT  Postponed until the  following year as  allocation of key  internal expert  resources is  required to carry out  the improvements  49 Figures for illustrative purpose only.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  40  2.6.2 Detailed plans for improvement initiatives for the design stage  After the improvement initiatives have been approved, the next step is to prepare detailed plans  for the design stage.  In the case of external consultancy involvement, detailed requirements are often expressed as  improvement project ToR in competitive tenders (RFI/RFP).  Requirements for the design stage outcomes must be specifically listed.  At this stage it is relevant to consider:  1. The objectives of the improvement initiatives.  2. The clearly stated expectations of any improvements.  3. The expected implementation plan.  4. The experience required of experts carrying out similar work.  2.6.3 Preliminary budget for improvement initiatives  The annual budget must incorporate any approved preliminary budget for improvement  initiatives. This may be needed to cover the costs of internal staff, additional facilities,  technology, external consultancy, administration, cooperation and marketing, and additional  training.  The preliminary budget will guide resource and design constraints for the design phase  activities during planning.  It is normal to expect that at least 15 % of the annual CSIRT budget will be spent on  improvement initiatives for mature CSIRTs. For CSIRTs with a lower level of maturity,  improvement initiatives usually make up at least 30 % of the CSIRT budget.  HOW TO SETUP UP CSIRT AND SOC  December 2020  41  3. CONCLUSIONS  This report presents guidelines for the establishment of CSIRTs and SOCs using a phased  outcomes-driven approach, including many examples from established CSIRTs of the different  phases of implementation.  Establishment is a continuous process. It is possible to identify the beginning of the  process; however, the end stage consists of a continuous improvement cycle – to better  serve the constituency, be more effective in operations and respond better to  stakeholder needs.  The authors hope that this publication will inspire better CSIRT and SOC project management  and provide clearer descriptions of the intermediate steps involved in the establishment of  CSIRTs and SOCs.  Some challenges related to the establishment of CSIRTs and SOCs are not covered in this  report and require additional work.  1. This publication focuses on the establishment of a single CSIRT. However, a single  CSIRT is usually part of an ecosystem of CSIRTs. Future research might focus on  ecosystem buildout and value creation through partnerships and specialisation.  2. Sectorial CSIRTs are emerging in different sectors in many countries; however, there  are currently too few data points and good practice guidelines available for guidance to  be provided for different sector-specific CSIRTs.  3. There is too little relevant and practical guidance on blueprints for technology  orchestration and automation of CSIRTs and SOCs.  4. The do-it-yourself approach to creating a CSIRT is still challenging because of the  relevant expertise required, which is not easily available in many countries. It will be  important to determine in the future how this can be overcome.  ENISA continues to support incident response teams by creating relevant content for CSIRTs..

This field questionnaire (presented below) was published using the European Commission  Questionnaire platform (the direct link to the questionnaire was  https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/HowtosetupCSIRTandSOC) and distributed to various  CSIRTs and SOCs in different parts of the world, via sharing networks, as well as individually  encouraging to participate. CSIRT and SOC teams were invited to fill it in via personal  invitations as well as Trusted Introducer member and CIRTs Network communication.  During the set time for the questionnaire detailed responses were received from over 40 CSIRT  and SOC teams from different geographic locations including various types of CSIRTs and  SOCs (national, sectorial, internal to organization and other).  The questionnaire used  The objective of the questionnaire is to serve ENISA’s study on Guidelines to setup CSIRTs and  SOCs. Responses are expected from at least 40 organizations and the received data will be  processed and integrated with other methods of research. Some of the gathered data will be  used in the ENISA CSIRT and SOC Setup Guidelines publication as a case study, an example,  or statistically processed data.  The data is gathered in the European Commission Questionnaire platform, and will not be used,  sold, or processed in any other way except for direct ENISA analysis, to serve its target:  “Since 2009, ENISA has carried out a considerable amount of work in CSIRT Capabilities and  Maturity area, and this work contributes by shaping the role of ENISA in helping CSIRTs on their  way to a higher maturity standard and advanced capabilities.”  To be filled by CSIRT or SOC team manager or assigned person.

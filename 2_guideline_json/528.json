The reform, was transposed by most EU Member States halfway 2011.  Article 13a concerns the security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services. The first  part of Article 13a requires that providers of networks and services manage security risks and take  appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) of these  networks and services. The second part of Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to report about  significant security breaches and losses of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of  networks or services to competent national regulatory authorities, who should report about these security  incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Ministries and Telecommunication National Regulatory  Authorities (NRAs), initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve an efficient and  harmonised implementation of Article 13a across the EU. The Article 13a Expert Group now comprises  experts from NRAs of most EU countries, and several EFTA and EU candidate countries. Meetings (telephonic  or physical) are organized and chaired by technical experts from ENISA. The European Commission acts as  an observer in these meetings.  The Article 13a Expert Group reached consensus on two non-binding technical guidelines for NRAs: the  “Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting” and the “Technical Guideline on Security Measures”. This  document complements the other two guides by providing a list of assets and a list of threats. This document  provides a full list of threat types, the relation between threats and root cause categories (used in incident  reporting), a full list of asset types, and it introduces asset groups and component layers.  The primary goal of this document is to improve pan-EU annual summary reporting. NRAs could also use this  document for cross-checking risk assessments by providers, for supervising the security measures taken by  providers, and for their national incident reporting frameworks.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  05  1. Introduction  In this document, we provide guidance to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) about the risk assessment  mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as  amended by Directive 2009/140/EC).  This document is drafted by a working group comprising experts from NRAs and representatives of the EC,  supported by technical experts from ENISA (see Executive Summary): the Article 13a Working Group.  1.1 Target audience  This document is addressed to national ministries and NRAs in European Member States, the authorities  tasked with the implementation of Article 13a.  This document may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications sector and for  experts working in the information security field.  1.2 Goal  This document is published by ENISA to provide NRAs with a vocabulary/glossary of terms to speak about  threats and assets. This can directly be used in incident reporting (which is mandated by paragraph 3 of  Article 13a) or used by NRAs to discuss with providers about their (internal) risk assessment (which is  mandated by paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a).  1.3 Updates  ENISA will update this guideline periodically, when necessary and in agreement with the NRAs.  1.4 Structure of this document  In Section 2 we introduce the relevant parts of Article 13a and some terminology used in this document. In  Section 3 we position this document vis-à-vis the supervision tasks of regulators. In Section 4 we provide a  list of detailed threat types, and we explain the five (broader) root causes categories. In Section 5 we provide  a list of asset types, which are commonly used in fixed and mobile telecommunications networks and we  introduce a model off asset groups and component layers.  In Annex A we provide a glossary of terms and  acronyms commonly used to describe specific assets.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  Guideline on Threats and Assets  06  2. Article 13a  In this section we introduce Article 13a and the terminology used in this document.  2.1 Paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a  For the sake of reference, we reproduce the text of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a here.  “1. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or publicly  available electronic communications services take appropriate technical and organisational measures to  appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services. Having regard to the state of the  art, these measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented. In particular, measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks.  2. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks take all  appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of  services provided over those networks. […]”  In the interest of brevity, we use the following abbreviations:   The term “provider” is used to refer to an “undertaking providing public communications networks or  publicly available electronic communications services”.   The term NRA is used to refer to competent “national regulatory authority” as mentioned in Article 13a,  which could be a ministry, or a government agency, depending on the national situation.   The term “networks and communication services” is used to refer to “public communications networks  or publicly available electronic communications services” as mentioned in Article 13a. This includes  mobile networks, public switched telephone networks, all -IP networks, mobile/fixed telephony and  mobile/fixed internet access, etc.  2.2 Appropriate security measures  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a contain two different requirements:   Paragraph 1 requires providers to “take appropriate technical and organisational measures to  appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services”, and to take measures “to  prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks” .   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their networks,  and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.  The use of the term integrity (of networks) in the article text may be confusing to some readers. We refer  the reader to the definition in technical literature about networks and network inter-connections1, which  defines integrity “as the ability of the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and  functionality”. Integrity of networks would be called availability or continuity in most information security  literature.  We use the term ‘appropriate security measures’ to indicate the ‘appropriate technical and organisational  measures’ and the ‘appropriate steps’ mentioned in the two paragraphs.  1 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  07  The technical guideline on security measures provides an overview of different security measures that NRAs  should take into account when assessing compliance of providers to these two paragraphs.  Both requirements use the term appropriate, and this means that providers should do a risk assessment. In  this document we focus on the risk assessment.  2.3 Security incidents  Article 13a mentions ‘security incidents’, ‘security breaches’ and ‘integrity losses’:   Paragraph 1 requires “that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security  incidents on users and interconnected networks”.   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their networks,  and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security or  loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services”.  We use one term for these incidents:  Security incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the operation  of electronic communication networks and services.  This definition is in line with the definition used in the document ‘Technical Guidelines on Incident  Reporting’2, which focusses on the process of incident reporting.  2 Note that only a subset of these incidents have to be reported to ENISA and the EC, that is, those incidents that have  had a significant impact on the continuity of services.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  08  3. Risk assessment in Article 13a  Article 13a describes three main processes:  1) Provider assesses the risks, for its users and for the connected networks,  2) Provider takes “appropriate” security measures and  3) Provider reports about incidents to the NRA, should something go wrong.  The three processes are depicted in the diagram below.  Figure 3-1: The three security processes mandated by Article 13a.  Risk assessment  Security Measures Incident reporting  RA  SM IR  Article 13a basically asks NRAs to supervise that these three processes are implemented adequately by the  provider. Incidents could trigger an update of the risk assessment, and in this way lead to a change of security  measures. So the processes feed into each other: Following a risk assessment a provider might want to take  certain security measures. The opposite is also true, security measures which are in place, decrease certain  risks. Incident reports provide feedback about the effectiveness of security measures, and they might lead  to changes in the risk assessment.  This document is the third of three different guidelines, covering different aspects of this triangle:   The Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting is a guideline for NRAs about how to  implement incident reporting   The Article 13a Technical Guideline on Security Measures is a guideline for NRAs about how to supervise  that providers take appropriate security measures,   This guideline addresses the top of the triangle by providing a glossary or dictionary of the most common  threat types and asset types. Our primary goal is to use this dictionary for incident reporting. Secondly,  because threats and assets are the key components of risk assessments, this document may be used  when making or evaluating risk assessments.  Remark about risk assessments and asset owners: This guideline does not explain how providers can  perform a risk assessment, nor does it rate the likelihood or impact of threats. Assessing risks is the  responsibility of asset owners. Note that there are many different methods for performing risk  assessments inside an organisation. Providers should use appropriate methods for performing risk  assessments internally, depending on the type of organisation, the assets involved, the complexity of  systems etc. Risk assessments need to be updated regularly, because risks change over time.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  09  Remark about using incident reporting to improve risk assessment: Incident reporting (one of the  obligations under Article 13a) could be used by NRAs to feed information about common threats and  vulnerabilities back to the sector. For instance, NRAs could aggregate the received incident reports  periodically and inform providers about common threats. In this way providers can improve their risk  assessments, even before they experience a certain type of incident.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  10  4. Threats and causes  This section introduces a terminology (or dictionary) to speak about threats and causes.  We define a threat as follows3:  Threat: A threat is an event or a circumstance which could cause a security incident.  This definition is based on the definition of a security incident as defined in the incident reporting guideline  (see also Section 2). The word “cause” is used to speak about a threat when it has already caused an incident  (in the past).  The next section lists threat types. To explain what we mean with a threat type we give an example: A threat  type would be “heavy wind”. The Gudrun storm (also called Erwin) of 2005, was a threat when it was  forecasted to hit Denmark, Sweden and Estonia. When speaking about the security incident we call “heavy  wind” (the Gudrun storm in this case) the cause of the incident.  4.1 Threat types  In this section we take a so-called “all-hazards” approach, i.e. all threats which could have an impact on the  security of networks and services are in scope.  Note that this list of threat types is not exhaustive. We do not claim to make a taxonomy of threats here.  There are a lot of threat lists or taxonomies out there, that can be more or less useful, depending on the  situation, but this particular list has been defined within the Art. 13a expert group, and represents the most  common threat types used by the telecom sector, in regard to the mandatory incident reporting activities.  We have not used a specific order for these threats, but grouped them according to similarities. For example  we grouped natural phenomena together.  4.1.1 Heavy snow and ice  Heavy snowfall or ice can impact physical infrastructure, such as overland cables, base stations, overland  power supply lines, et cetera.  4.1.2 Heavy wind  Heavy wind can impact physical infrastructure, such as overland cables, base stations, overland power supply  lines, et cetera.  Note that in some cases incidents are caused by “bad weather”, i.e. a combination of “heavy wind” and  “flood”.  4.1.3 Flood  Floods can impact physical infrastructure, such as server rooms, collocation sites, et cetera.  4.1.4 Earthquake  Earthquakes can impact physical infrastructure, such as power supply lines, underground and overland  cables, sites, et cetera.  3 This definition is similar to the definition in ISO27K5, which defines a threat as the cause of an incident.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  11  4.1.5 Wildfire  Wildfire can impact physical infrastructure, such as overland cables, overland power supply lines, collocation  sites, et cetera.  4.1.6 Fire  Fire4 can damage physical infrastructure, such as cables, routers, server rooms, et cetera.  Note that this cause only covers accidental, unintentional instances of fire. For arson, see below.  Note that fire could also have an indirect impact, for example, when firefighters spray water or foam, or  when they give orders to turn off power generators.  4.1.7 Arson  Arson (a fire started intentionally) could damage physical infrastructure, such as cables, servers, sites, street  cabinets, et cetera.  Note there could also be an indirect impact, for example, when firefighters spray water or foam, or when  they give orders to turn off power generators.  4.1.8 Electromagnetic interference  Electrical circuits and radio signals can be affected by electromagnetic interference. This kind of interference  can be malicious (for example EMP guns), accidental (for example by a faulty transmitter) or part of a natural  phenomenon (e.g. solar storms).  4.1.9 Denial of Service attack  A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to overload network or information systems with traffic. DoS attacks  can have an impact on the continuity of networks or services.  4.1.10 Network traffic hijack  Attackers could change network routing or network addressing tables, which could have an impact on the  security of the services ,for example by altering BGP tables (BGP hijacks) or altering DNS zone files (DNS  poisoning).  4.1.11 Malware and viruses  Malware and viruses can affect network and information systems, such as servers and applications For  example, there have been cases where malware was used to attack routers which impacted the network  traffic of thousands of subscribers.  4.1.12 Advanced persistent threat  Advanced persistent threats, or APTs, are cyber attacks which are persistent (and stealthy, conspicuous),  which target a range of different systems, often moving from one system to the other. APTs usually involve  the manipulation of many different networks and information systems. For example an APT could target first  a webserver, then the desktop computers of system administrators, and finally the firmware of core routers.  4.1.13 Hardware theft  Hardware theft could have an impact on networks and services, for example because thieves damage  systems. Particularly multi-purpose IT equipment, or valuable items, such as large batteries, can be attractive  for thieves.  4 Not to be confused with wildfire which is l isted as separate cause.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  12  4.1.14 Cable theft  Cable theft can have an impact on networks or services. For example, optical fiber cables could be cut when  copper thieves dig up the cable searching for copper.  4.1.15 Cable cut  Cable cuts, for example by an excavation machine or ship anchorage, can have an impact on networks or  services.  4.1.16 Power cut  Power cuts of the (public) power grid, can have an impact on infrastructure which relies on power, for  example base stations, sites, et cetera.  4.1.17 Power surge  Power surges, in the power supply of the main (public) power grid, could have an impact on electronic  devices connected to it.  4.1.18 Cooling outage  An outage of cooling systems can cause damage or malfunctioning of infrastructure.  4.1.19 Hardware failure  Hardware failures (when physical hardware breaks) could affect physical infrastructure such as servers,  routers, base stations, et cetera, and in this way have an impact on networks and services.  4.1.20 Software bug  Software bugs could have an impact on ICT systems, such as routers, servers, databases, et cetera, and in  this way impact networks or services. This type of threat also includes complex failures like network failures  when several systems fail to connect or otherwise work together.  4.1.21 Design error  Design errors could have an impact on the security of networks and services. For example, an HLR handling  3G and 4G traffic could be designed wrong causing outages.  4.1.22 Faulty hardware change/update  A change or update of hardware, for example, for maintenance, replacement, or renewal, could go wrong  and have a negative impact on networks or services.  4.1.23 Faulty software change/update  Software changes or updates, for example the installation of new software or software patches, could go  wrong and have a negative impact on the networks or services. Note that this threat includes software like  ‘configuration files’.  4.1.24 Overload  Overload of traffic and usage could impact the networks and services.  4.1.25 Fuel exhaustion  Backup power generators can run out of fuel, which could have an impact on electronic devices.  Note this is typically a secondary cause for an incident, when the primary cause is power cut.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  13  4.1.26 Policy or procedure flaw  A flaw in a policy or procedure, or the absence of a policy or a procedure, could have a negative impact on  the networks or services.  4.1.27 Security shutdown  Security risks could force a provider to shut down a service, for example to have the time to patch a software  vulnerability.  4.2 Root cause categories  In this section we define 5 root cause categories. Unlike the detailed threats/causes (defined in the previous  section), root cause categories are broad categories describing the underlying problem.  Note that categorization of an incident in a specific root cause category often depends on the details and on  the judgement of the NRA. For example, suppose a storm causes a power cut of several hours, which causes  an outage because the fuel ran out in a backup power generators. Depending on the circumstances this may  be categorized as natural phenomena (storm), human error (forgot to refill the fuel), or a system failure  (refill procedure flawed).  Note that this list of root causes types is not exhaustive. We do not claim to make a taxonomy of root causes  here. There are a lot of root causes lists or taxonomies out there, that can be more or less useful, depending  on the situation, but this particular list has been defined within the Art. 13a expert group, and represents  the most common root causes used by the telecom sector, in regard to the mandatory incident reporting  activities.  4.2.1 Human errors  The category “human errors” includes the incidents caused by human errors during the operation of  equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of procedures, et cetera.  For example, suppose an employee of a provider made an error in following prescribed equipment  maintenance procedures. The maintenance error caused an outage. In this case the incident would be  categorized under ‘Human errors’.  4.2.2 System failures  The category “system failures” includes the incidents caused by failures of a system, for example hardware  failures, software failures or errors in procedures or policies.  For example, if an HLR suddenly stops operating because of a software bug, which prevents all  subscribers from connecting, then this incident would be categorized as “System failures”.  4.2.3 Natural phenomena  The category “natural phenomena” includes the incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  wildfires, and so on.  For example, heavy winds cause a cable cut, causing outages, then the incident would be in the root  cause category “natural phenomena”.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  14  4.2.4 Malicious actions  The category “malicious actions” includes the incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation.  For example, incidents which have a root cause like a fire started by employees as an act of sabotage,  the poisoning of the provider’s DNS systems by criminals, the hacking of the provider’s computer  systems, vandalism directed at street cabinets, and so on.  4.2.5 Third party failures  The category “third party failure” includes the incidents where the cause was not under direct control of  the provider, but some third-party5.  For example, an outage caused by a cable cut caused by a mistake by the operator of an excavation  machine used for a building a new road, would be categorized in the root cause category “human error”  and “third-party failure”.  5 In the incident reporting this category is now used as a flag, in combination with another root cause category.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  15  5. Assets and asset components  An asset is basically anything of value. Assets could be abstract assets (like processes or reputation), virtual  assets (data for instance), physical assets (cables, a piece of equipment), human resources, money, et  cetera.  In this guideline we focus on the following assets:  Scope: The assets in scope are those assets which support the provision of electronic communication  networks and services.  This means that abstract assets like ‘money’ or ‘reputation’ are out of scope. Similarly, suppose a provider  has an online store for selling smartphones and subscriptions. The shopping cart system is an asset, but it is  out of scope of this guideline because it does not directly support the provisioning of network and  communication services.  Remark on primary and secondary assets: Often in literature (e.g. ISO/IEC 27005) there is a distinction  between primary assets and secondary assets. For an electronic communications provider, services offered  as well as the subscriber data are primary assets. But cables, routers, cooling systems, servers or HR processes  are really secondary (or supporting) assets. Secondary assets are supporting the primary assets. As seen in  the definition of scope, in this guideline the secondary/supporting assets are simply referred to as assets. In  this guideline we do not use the word “primary assets” and instead we refer more specifically to electronic  communication networks and/or services.  Figure 5-1: Assets in scope  Networks and services provisioning  asset asset asset  asset  asset asset  asset asset asset asset asset  Secondary/supporting assets  asset  Different providers use different assets, depending on the networks and services they provide, and  depending on technical and architectural choices. Sometimes two similar assets can be used in a very  different way by different providers. Sometimes the same asset is being called differently by different  providers. This guideline introduces a vocabulary for speaking about the assets of providers. First of all this  vocabulary is used for EU incident reporting from NRAs to ENISA and the EC. Secondly, because threats and  Guideline on Threats and Assets  16  assets are the main ingredients of a risk assessment, this allows NRAs and providers to evaluate and discuss  the scope and outcome of risk assessments, and to discuss issues with specific assets, for example with  providers, with other NRAs and ENISA.  5.1 Asset types  In this section we provide a list of asset types. The term asset type is used to indicate a set of similar assets  for providers. For example an asset type would be “mobile base stations and controllers”. A specific base  station (of a specific provider) is called an asset. Below, for the sake of clarity, we indicate for each asset  type if it supports mobile or fixed networks, between square brackets.  Note that the list of asset types in this section is not exhaustive. Note also that a glossary of common terms,  abbreviations and acronyms is included as an annex.  5.1.1 Subscriber equipment  [Mobile, Fixed]  Subscriber equipment, also known as user equipment (UE) or customer premise equipment (CPE), are  systems at the subscriber’s premises, which are either fully or partially under control of the subscr iber. This  asset type is included here because in some settings the provider retains some control (and responsibility)  over this equipment, for example, in the case of a managed PBX. See also Section A.1.  5.1.2 Switches and routers  [Mobile, Fixed]  Switches and routers are systems for switching and routing network traffic.  Examples: IP switches, routers, DSLAM, Hosted IP PBX, core (Tera-Giga) routers, Edge routers, SBC. See also  Section A.2.  5.1.3 Mobile user and location registers  [Mobile]  Mobile user and location registers, like HLRs and VLRs, are systems which keep records of subscribers, their  subscriptions, their locations in mobile networks, etc.  Examples: HLR, AuC, HSS. See also Section A.3.  5.1.4 Mobile base stations and controllers  [Mobile]  Mobile base stations and mobile base station controllers are systems which provide subscribers access to  the mobile networks of the providers.  Examples: BTS, BSC, NodeB and eNodeB, RNC, MME ANDSF, PCRF. See also Section A.4.  5.1.5 PSTN switches  [Fixed]  PSTN switches are systems which switch traffic in legacy fixed voice networks (PSTN).

For more details see Section A.7.  5.1.8 Addressing servers  [Mobile, Fixed]  Addressing servicers are used for look-up and addressing, like IP address allocation, domain name services,  etc.  Examples: DHCP, DNS. For more details see Section A.9.  5.1.9 Interconnection points  [Mobile, Fixed]  Interconnection points are used for exchanging traffic between the provider’s network and networks of  other providers.  Examples: IXPs, POP. For more details see Section A.10.  5.1.10 Submarine cables  [Mobile, Fixed]  Submarine cables are cables and optical fibres rolled out on the sea bed between two points on land, to  carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. A landing point is the location where a submarine  or other underwater cable makes landfall.  5.1.11 Underground cables  [Mobile, Fixed]  Underground cables are underground physical network connections between active equipment (switches,  routers, et cetera).  Examples: twisted copper pair, optical fibre, optical cable aggregation, cable aggregation. See also Section  A.11.  5.1.12 Over-the-air cables  [Mobile, Fixed]  Over-the-air cables are physical network connections between active equipment (switches, routers, et  cetera).  Guideline on Threats and Assets  18  5.1.13 Mobile messaging centre  [Mobile]  Mobile messaging centres are the assets providing messaging services in mobile networks.  Examples: SMS-C, MMS-C. See also Section A.14.  5.1.14 Billing and mediation systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Billing and mediation systems are the assets which perform billing in fixed and mobile networks. Mediation  is the term used for converting usage and consumption data (length of calls, amount of data transferred)  into billing and payment information.  5.1.15 Power supplies  [Mobile, Fixed]  Power supplies are the assets providing electrical energy to active equipment. Note this does not include  the backup power supply.  Examples: Transformers, power lines, power connectors to the main grid, solar cells, etc.  5.1.16 Backup power supplies  [Mobile, Fixed]  Backup power supplies are the assets which ensure power backup functionality in case of power cut.  Examples: Diesel generators, batteries. See also Section A.13.  5.1.17 Cooling systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Cooling systems are the assets providing cooling or ventilation to network and information systems.  5.1.18 Street cabinets  [Fixed]  Street cabinets are assets which aggregate fixed connections. A street cabinet can hold passive and active  network equipment, for copper, fibre or a combination of copper-fibre connections) and is typically located  in the ‘street’ where it concentrates/aggregates local loop cables from subscribers.  5.1.19 Buildings and physical security systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Buildings and physical security systems are the assets used by providers to protect other assets from physical  and environmental threats.  Examples: Sites, data centres, fences, walls, doors, locks, et cetera.  5.1.20 Logical security systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Guideline on Threats and Assets  19  Systems providing logical protection of provider's network perimeter, including authentication, and  authorization, encryption, and supporting services (e.g. directory information -LDAP).  Examples: firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN servers, Radius, AAA systems, and LDAP. See also Section A.15.  5.1.21 Operational support systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  ICT systems which support the operation of telecommunication networks. The term typically refers to  systems managing the network and supporting processes such as maintaining a network inventory,  configuring network components, managing faults, etc.  5.1.22  Intelligent network devices  [Fixed]  Intelligent network devices, typically in an SS7 architecture, provide additional services to the network assets  allowing telecom operators to provide value-added services in addition to the standard communication  services (e.g. number portability, green numbers, et cetera).  Examples: STP, SCP, SS7. See also Section A.14.  5.2 Asset groups  Assets play a different role depending on their role and location in the provider’s network. For example, a  cable connecting two providers plays a very different role than a cable between a base station and a base  station controller.  For the sake of clarity we group assets in 4 groups, depending on where the asset is located in the provider’s  network:   Peering points – Assets in the group “Peering points” support the communications between the  subscribers of one provider and the subscribers of another provider. For example, an IXP or a submarine  cable, connecting several providers would be in this group.   Core network – Assets in the group “Core network” support the bulk of the communications of the  subscribers. For example, a backbone connecting two major cities in a country, or a central site would  be in this group.   Area network – Assets in the group “Area network” support a large part of the communications of the  subscribers.  For example, the cables between different parts of a large city or a regional site would be  in this group.   Access network – Assets in the group “Access network” support access of individual subscribers to the  networks and communication services of the provider. For example, base  stations or fiber-to-the-home  infrastructure would be in this group.  The different asset groups are depicted below.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  20  Figure 5-2: Assets are grouped in 4 main groups  Note that not all providers have assets in all groups. For example, some providers may just offer access  network infrastructure, for others operators to use when offering services.  5.3 Asset components  For some assets, especially complex ICT assets, it can be useful to split them in several components.  For example, the components of a mobile base station include the base station’s operating system, the  transceiver baseband unit, power amplifiers, power supply, its antennas, batteries and connection to the  power grid.  For the sake of clarity we group these components in three different layers.   Supplies layer – The Supplies layer consists of components such as power supply from the grid, or fuel  supply from energy firms.   Hardware layer –The hardware layer consists of hardware components.   Software layer – The software layer consists of software components.  Figure 5-3: Assets consist of components at three different layers  Asset  Component Component Component  Component Component Component  Component Component  Software  layer  Hardware layer  Supplies layer  Guideline on Threats and Assets  21  Note that not all assets have components in all layers. For example, a basic diesel generator, which has to  be started manually, does not have components at the logical layer. A solar-cell powered base station does  not have components at the supplies layer.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  22  6.

The reform, was transposed by most EU Member States halfway 2011.  Article 13a concerns the security and integrity of electronic communication networks and services. The first  part of Article 13a requires that providers of networks and services manage security risks and take  appropriate security measures to guarantee the security (paragraph 1) and integrity (paragraph 2) of these  networks and services. The second part of Article 13a (paragraph 3) requires providers to report about  significant security breaches and losses of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of  networks or services to competent national regulatory authorities, who should report about these security  incidents to ENISA and the European Commission (EC) annually.  In 2010, ENISA, the European Commission (EC), Ministries and Telecommunication National Regulatory  Authorities (NRAs), initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve an efficient and  harmonised implementation of Article 13a across the EU. The Article 13a Expert Group now comprises  experts from NRAs of most EU countries, and several EFTA and EU candidate countries. Meetings (telephonic  or physical) are organized and chaired by technical experts from ENISA. The European Commission acts as  an observer in these meetings.  The Article 13a Expert Group reached consensus on two non-binding technical guidelines for NRAs: the  “Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting” and the “Technical Guideline on Security Measures”. This  document complements the other two guides by providing a list of assets and a list of threats. This document  provides a full list of threat types, the relation between threats and root cause categories (used in incident  reporting), a full list of asset types, and it introduces asset groups and component layers.  The primary goal of this document is to improve pan-EU annual summary reporting. NRAs could also use this  document for cross-checking risk assessments by providers, for supervising the security measures taken by  providers, and for their national incident reporting frameworks.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  05  1. Introduction  In this document, we provide guidance to National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) about the risk assessment  mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a of the Framework directive (Directive 2002/21/EC as  amended by Directive 2009/140/EC).  This document is drafted by a working group comprising experts from NRAs and representatives of the EC,  supported by technical experts from ENISA (see Executive Summary): the Article 13a Working Group.  1.1 Target audience  This document is addressed to national ministries and NRAs in European Member States, the authorities  tasked with the implementation of Article 13a.  This document may be useful also for experts working in the EU’s electronic communications sector and for  experts working in the information security field.  1.2 Goal  This document is published by ENISA to provide NRAs with a vocabulary/glossary of terms to speak about  threats and assets. This can directly be used in incident reporting (which is mandated by paragraph 3 of  Article 13a) or used by NRAs to discuss with providers about their (internal) risk assessment (which is  mandated by paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a).  1.3 Updates  ENISA will update this guideline periodically, when necessary and in agreement with the NRAs.  1.4 Structure of this document  In Section 2 we introduce the relevant parts of Article 13a and some terminology used in this document. In  Section 3 we position this document vis-à-vis the supervision tasks of regulators. In Section 4 we provide a  list of detailed threat types, and we explain the five (broader) root causes categories. In Section 5 we provide  a list of asset types, which are commonly used in fixed and mobile telecommunications networks and we  introduce a model off asset groups and component layers.  In Annex A we provide a glossary of terms and  acronyms commonly used to describe specific assets.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/  Guideline on Threats and Assets  06  2. Article 13a  In this section we introduce Article 13a and the terminology used in this document.  2.1 Paragraph 1 and 2 of Article 13a  For the sake of reference, we reproduce the text of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a here.  “1. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks or publicly  available electronic communications services take appropriate technical and organisational measures to  appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services. Having regard to the state of the  art, these measures shall ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk presented. In particular, measures  shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks.  2. Member States shall ensure that undertakings providing public communications networks take all  appropriate steps to guarantee the integrity of their networks, and thus ensure the continuity of supply of  services provided over those networks. […]”  In the interest of brevity, we use the following abbreviations:   The term “provider” is used to refer to an “undertaking providing public communications networks or  publicly available electronic communications services”.   The term NRA is used to refer to competent “national regulatory authority” as mentioned in Article 13a,  which could be a ministry, or a government agency, depending on the national situation.   The term “networks and communication services” is used to refer to “public communications networks  or publicly available electronic communications services” as mentioned in Article 13a. This includes  mobile networks, public switched telephone networks, all -IP networks, mobile/fixed telephony and  mobile/fixed internet access, etc.  2.2 Appropriate security measures  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13a contain two different requirements:   Paragraph 1 requires providers to “take appropriate technical and organisational measures to  appropriately manage the risks posed to security of networks and services”, and to take measures “to  prevent and minimise the impact of security incidents on users and interconnected networks” .   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their networks,  and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.  The use of the term integrity (of networks) in the article text may be confusing to some readers. We refer  the reader to the definition in technical literature about networks and network inter-connections1, which  defines integrity “as the ability of the system to retain its specified attributes in terms of performance and  functionality”. Integrity of networks would be called availability or continuity in most information security  literature.  We use the term ‘appropriate security measures’ to indicate the ‘appropriate technical and organisational  measures’ and the ‘appropriate steps’ mentioned in the two paragraphs.  1 Ward, K, 1995, ‘The Impact of Network Interconnection on Network Integrity’. British Telecommunications  Engineering, 13:296–303.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  07  The technical guideline on security measures provides an overview of different security measures that NRAs  should take into account when assessing compliance of providers to these two paragraphs.  Both requirements use the term appropriate, and this means that providers should do a risk assessment. In  this document we focus on the risk assessment.  2.3 Security incidents  Article 13a mentions ‘security incidents’, ‘security breaches’ and ‘integrity losses’:   Paragraph 1 requires “that measures shall be taken to prevent and minimise the impact of security  incidents on users and interconnected networks”.   Paragraph 2 requires providers to “take all appropriate steps to guarantee integrity of their networks,  and thus ensure the continuity of supply of services”.   Paragraph 3 requires “to notify the competent national regulatory authority of a breach of security or  loss of integrity that has had a significant impact on the operation of networks or services”.  We use one term for these incidents:  Security incident: A breach of security or a loss of integrity that could have an impact on the operation  of electronic communication networks and services.  This definition is in line with the definition used in the document ‘Technical Guidelines on Incident  Reporting’2, which focusses on the process of incident reporting.  2 Note that only a subset of these incidents have to be reported to ENISA and the EC, that is, those incidents that have  had a significant impact on the continuity of services.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  08  3. Risk assessment in Article 13a  Article 13a describes three main processes:  1) Provider assesses the risks, for its users and for the connected networks,  2) Provider takes “appropriate” security measures and  3) Provider reports about incidents to the NRA, should something go wrong.  The three processes are depicted in the diagram below.  Figure 3-1: The three security processes mandated by Article 13a.  Risk assessment  Security Measures Incident reporting  RA  SM IR  Article 13a basically asks NRAs to supervise that these three processes are implemented adequately by the  provider. Incidents could trigger an update of the risk assessment, and in this way lead to a change of security  measures. So the processes feed into each other: Following a risk assessment a provider might want to take  certain security measures. The opposite is also true, security measures which are in place, decrease certain  risks. Incident reports provide feedback about the effectiveness of security measures, and they might lead  to changes in the risk assessment.  This document is the third of three different guidelines, covering different aspects of this triangle:   The Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting is a guideline for NRAs about how to  implement incident reporting   The Article 13a Technical Guideline on Security Measures is a guideline for NRAs about how to supervise  that providers take appropriate security measures,   This guideline addresses the top of the triangle by providing a glossary or dictionary of the most common  threat types and asset types. Our primary goal is to use this dictionary for incident reporting. Secondly,  because threats and assets are the key components of risk assessments, this document may be used  when making or evaluating risk assessments.  Remark about risk assessments and asset owners: This guideline does not explain how providers can  perform a risk assessment, nor does it rate the likelihood or impact of threats. Assessing risks is the  responsibility of asset owners. Note that there are many different methods for performing risk  assessments inside an organisation. Providers should use appropriate methods for performing risk  assessments internally, depending on the type of organisation, the assets involved, the complexity of  systems etc. Risk assessments need to be updated regularly, because risks change over time.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  09  Remark about using incident reporting to improve risk assessment: Incident reporting (one of the  obligations under Article 13a) could be used by NRAs to feed information about common threats and  vulnerabilities back to the sector. For instance, NRAs could aggregate the received incident reports  periodically and inform providers about common threats. In this way providers can improve their risk  assessments, even before they experience a certain type of incident.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  10  4. Threats and causes  This section introduces a terminology (or dictionary) to speak about threats and causes.  We define a threat as follows3:  Threat: A threat is an event or a circumstance which could cause a security incident.  This definition is based on the definition of a security incident as defined in the incident reporting guideline  (see also Section 2). The word “cause” is used to speak about a threat when it has already caused an incident  (in the past).  The next section lists threat types. To explain what we mean with a threat type we give an example: A threat  type would be “heavy wind”. The Gudrun storm (also called Erwin) of 2005, was a threat when it was  forecasted to hit Denmark, Sweden and Estonia. When speaking about the security incident we call “heavy  wind” (the Gudrun storm in this case) the cause of the incident.  4.1 Threat types  In this section we take a so-called “all-hazards” approach, i.e. all threats which could have an impact on the  security of networks and services are in scope.  Note that this list of threat types is not exhaustive. We do not claim to make a taxonomy of threats here.  There are a lot of threat lists or taxonomies out there, that can be more or less useful, depending on the  situation, but this particular list has been defined within the Art. 13a expert group, and represents the most  common threat types used by the telecom sector, in regard to the mandatory incident reporting activities.  We have not used a specific order for these threats, but grouped them according to similarities. For example  we grouped natural phenomena together.  4.1.1 Heavy snow and ice  Heavy snowfall or ice can impact physical infrastructure, such as overland cables, base stations, overland  power supply lines, et cetera.  4.1.2 Heavy wind  Heavy wind can impact physical infrastructure, such as overland cables, base stations, overland power supply  lines, et cetera.  Note that in some cases incidents are caused by “bad weather”, i.e. a combination of “heavy wind” and  “flood”.  4.1.3 Flood  Floods can impact physical infrastructure, such as server rooms, collocation sites, et cetera.  4.1.4 Earthquake  Earthquakes can impact physical infrastructure, such as power supply lines, underground and overland  cables, sites, et cetera.  3 This definition is similar to the definition in ISO27K5, which defines a threat as the cause of an incident.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  11  4.1.5 Wildfire  Wildfire can impact physical infrastructure, such as overland cables, overland power supply lines, collocation  sites, et cetera.  4.1.6 Fire  Fire4 can damage physical infrastructure, such as cables, routers, server rooms, et cetera.  Note that this cause only covers accidental, unintentional instances of fire. For arson, see below.  Note that fire could also have an indirect impact, for example, when firefighters spray water or foam, or  when they give orders to turn off power generators.  4.1.7 Arson  Arson (a fire started intentionally) could damage physical infrastructure, such as cables, servers, sites, street  cabinets, et cetera.  Note there could also be an indirect impact, for example, when firefighters spray water or foam, or when  they give orders to turn off power generators.  4.1.8 Electromagnetic interference  Electrical circuits and radio signals can be affected by electromagnetic interference. This kind of interference  can be malicious (for example EMP guns), accidental (for example by a faulty transmitter) or part of a natural  phenomenon (e.g. solar storms).  4.1.9 Denial of Service attack  A Denial of Service (DoS) attack aims to overload network or information systems with traffic. DoS attacks  can have an impact on the continuity of networks or services.  4.1.10 Network traffic hijack  Attackers could change network routing or network addressing tables, which could have an impact on the  security of the services ,for example by altering BGP tables (BGP hijacks) or altering DNS zone files (DNS  poisoning).  4.1.11 Malware and viruses  Malware and viruses can affect network and information systems, such as servers and applications For  example, there have been cases where malware was used to attack routers which impacted the network  traffic of thousands of subscribers.  4.1.12 Advanced persistent threat  Advanced persistent threats, or APTs, are cyber attacks which are persistent (and stealthy, conspicuous),  which target a range of different systems, often moving from one system to the other. APTs usually involve  the manipulation of many different networks and information systems. For example an APT could target first  a webserver, then the desktop computers of system administrators, and finally the firmware of core routers.  4.1.13 Hardware theft  Hardware theft could have an impact on networks and services, for example because thieves damage  systems. Particularly multi-purpose IT equipment, or valuable items, such as large batteries, can be attractive  for thieves.  4 Not to be confused with wildfire which is l isted as separate cause.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  12  4.1.14 Cable theft  Cable theft can have an impact on networks or services. For example, optical fiber cables could be cut when  copper thieves dig up the cable searching for copper.  4.1.15 Cable cut  Cable cuts, for example by an excavation machine or ship anchorage, can have an impact on networks or  services.  4.1.16 Power cut  Power cuts of the (public) power grid, can have an impact on infrastructure which relies on power, for  example base stations, sites, et cetera.  4.1.17 Power surge  Power surges, in the power supply of the main (public) power grid, could have an impact on electronic  devices connected to it.  4.1.18 Cooling outage  An outage of cooling systems can cause damage or malfunctioning of infrastructure.  4.1.19 Hardware failure  Hardware failures (when physical hardware breaks) could affect physical infrastructure such as servers,  routers, base stations, et cetera, and in this way have an impact on networks and services.  4.1.20 Software bug  Software bugs could have an impact on ICT systems, such as routers, servers, databases, et cetera, and in  this way impact networks or services. This type of threat also includes complex failures like network failures  when several systems fail to connect or otherwise work together.  4.1.21 Design error  Design errors could have an impact on the security of networks and services. For example, an HLR handling  3G and 4G traffic could be designed wrong causing outages.  4.1.22 Faulty hardware change/update  A change or update of hardware, for example, for maintenance, replacement, or renewal, could go wrong  and have a negative impact on networks or services.  4.1.23 Faulty software change/update  Software changes or updates, for example the installation of new software or software patches, could go  wrong and have a negative impact on the networks or services. Note that this threat includes software like  ‘configuration files’.  4.1.24 Overload  Overload of traffic and usage could impact the networks and services.  4.1.25 Fuel exhaustion  Backup power generators can run out of fuel, which could have an impact on electronic devices.  Note this is typically a secondary cause for an incident, when the primary cause is power cut.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  13  4.1.26 Policy or procedure flaw  A flaw in a policy or procedure, or the absence of a policy or a procedure, could have a negative impact on  the networks or services.  4.1.27 Security shutdown  Security risks could force a provider to shut down a service, for example to have the time to patch a software  vulnerability.  4.2 Root cause categories  In this section we define 5 root cause categories. Unlike the detailed threats/causes (defined in the previous  section), root cause categories are broad categories describing the underlying problem.  Note that categorization of an incident in a specific root cause category often depends on the details and on  the judgement of the NRA. For example, suppose a storm causes a power cut of several hours, which causes  an outage because the fuel ran out in a backup power generators. Depending on the circumstances this may  be categorized as natural phenomena (storm), human error (forgot to refill the fuel), or a system failure  (refill procedure flawed).  Note that this list of root causes types is not exhaustive. We do not claim to make a taxonomy of root causes  here. There are a lot of root causes lists or taxonomies out there, that can be more or less useful, depending  on the situation, but this particular list has been defined within the Art. 13a expert group, and represents  the most common root causes used by the telecom sector, in regard to the mandatory incident reporting  activities.  4.2.1 Human errors  The category “human errors” includes the incidents caused by human errors during the operation of  equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of procedures, et cetera.  For example, suppose an employee of a provider made an error in following prescribed equipment  maintenance procedures. The maintenance error caused an outage. In this case the incident would be  categorized under ‘Human errors’.  4.2.2 System failures  The category “system failures” includes the incidents caused by failures of a system, for example hardware  failures, software failures or errors in procedures or policies.  For example, if an HLR suddenly stops operating because of a software bug, which prevents all  subscribers from connecting, then this incident would be categorized as “System failures”.  4.2.3 Natural phenomena  The category “natural phenomena” includes the incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  wildfires, and so on.  For example, heavy winds cause a cable cut, causing outages, then the incident would be in the root  cause category “natural phenomena”.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  14  4.2.4 Malicious actions  The category “malicious actions” includes the incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation.  For example, incidents which have a root cause like a fire started by employees as an act of sabotage,  the poisoning of the provider’s DNS systems by criminals, the hacking of the provider’s computer  systems, vandalism directed at street cabinets, and so on.  4.2.5 Third party failures  The category “third party failure” includes the incidents where the cause was not under direct control of  the provider, but some third-party5.  For example, an outage caused by a cable cut caused by a mistake by the operator of an excavation  machine used for a building a new road, would be categorized in the root cause category “human error”  and “third-party failure”.  5 In the incident reporting this category is now used as a flag, in combination with another root cause category.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  15  5. Assets and asset components  An asset is basically anything of value. Assets could be abstract assets (like processes or reputation), virtual  assets (data for instance), physical assets (cables, a piece of equipment), human resources, money, et  cetera.  In this guideline we focus on the following assets:  Scope: The assets in scope are those assets which support the provision of electronic communication  networks and services.  This means that abstract assets like ‘money’ or ‘reputation’ are out of scope. Similarly, suppose a provider  has an online store for selling smartphones and subscriptions. The shopping cart system is an asset, but it is  out of scope of this guideline because it does not directly support the provisioning of network and  communication services.  Remark on primary and secondary assets: Often in literature (e.g. ISO/IEC 27005) there is a distinction  between primary assets and secondary assets. For an electronic communications provider, services offered  as well as the subscriber data are primary assets. But cables, routers, cooling systems, servers or HR processes  are really secondary (or supporting) assets. Secondary assets are supporting the primary assets. As seen in  the definition of scope, in this guideline the secondary/supporting assets are simply referred to as assets. In  this guideline we do not use the word “primary assets” and instead we refer more specifically to electronic  communication networks and/or services.  Figure 5-1: Assets in scope  Networks and services provisioning  asset asset asset  asset  asset asset  asset asset asset asset asset  Secondary/supporting assets  asset  Different providers use different assets, depending on the networks and services they provide, and  depending on technical and architectural choices. Sometimes two similar assets can be used in a very  different way by different providers. Sometimes the same asset is being called differently by different  providers. This guideline introduces a vocabulary for speaking about the assets of providers. First of all this  vocabulary is used for EU incident reporting from NRAs to ENISA and the EC. Secondly, because threats and  Guideline on Threats and Assets  16  assets are the main ingredients of a risk assessment, this allows NRAs and providers to evaluate and discuss  the scope and outcome of risk assessments, and to discuss issues with specific assets, for example with  providers, with other NRAs and ENISA.  5.1 Asset types  In this section we provide a list of asset types. The term asset type is used to indicate a set of similar assets  for providers. For example an asset type would be “mobile base stations and controllers”. A specific base  station (of a specific provider) is called an asset. Below, for the sake of clarity, we indicate for each asset  type if it supports mobile or fixed networks, between square brackets.  Note that the list of asset types in this section is not exhaustive. Note also that a glossary of common terms,  abbreviations and acronyms is included as an annex.  5.1.1 Subscriber equipment  [Mobile, Fixed]  Subscriber equipment, also known as user equipment (UE) or customer premise equipment (CPE), are  systems at the subscriber’s premises, which are either fully or partially under control of the subscr iber. This  asset type is included here because in some settings the provider retains some control (and responsibility)  over this equipment, for example, in the case of a managed PBX. See also Section A.1.  5.1.2 Switches and routers  [Mobile, Fixed]  Switches and routers are systems for switching and routing network traffic.  Examples: IP switches, routers, DSLAM, Hosted IP PBX, core (Tera-Giga) routers, Edge routers, SBC. See also  Section A.2.  5.1.3 Mobile user and location registers  [Mobile]  Mobile user and location registers, like HLRs and VLRs, are systems which keep records of subscribers, their  subscriptions, their locations in mobile networks, etc.  Examples: HLR, AuC, HSS. See also Section A.3.  5.1.4 Mobile base stations and controllers  [Mobile]  Mobile base stations and mobile base station controllers are systems which provide subscribers access to  the mobile networks of the providers.

For more details see Section A.7.  5.1.8 Addressing servers  [Mobile, Fixed]  Addressing servicers are used for look-up and addressing, like IP address allocation, domain name services,  etc.  Examples: DHCP, DNS. For more details see Section A.9.  5.1.9 Interconnection points  [Mobile, Fixed]  Interconnection points are used for exchanging traffic between the provider’s network and networks of  other providers.  Examples: IXPs, POP. For more details see Section A.10.  5.1.10 Submarine cables  [Mobile, Fixed]  Submarine cables are cables and optical fibres rolled out on the sea bed between two points on land, to  carry telecommunication signals across stretches of ocean. A landing point is the location where a submarine  or other underwater cable makes landfall.  5.1.11 Underground cables  [Mobile, Fixed]  Underground cables are underground physical network connections between active equipment (switches,  routers, et cetera).  Examples: twisted copper pair, optical fibre, optical cable aggregation, cable aggregation. See also Section  A.11.  5.1.12 Over-the-air cables  [Mobile, Fixed]  Over-the-air cables are physical network connections between active equipment (switches, routers, et  cetera).  Guideline on Threats and Assets  18  5.1.13 Mobile messaging centre  [Mobile]  Mobile messaging centres are the assets providing messaging services in mobile networks.  Examples: SMS-C, MMS-C. See also Section A.14.  5.1.14 Billing and mediation systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Billing and mediation systems are the assets which perform billing in fixed and mobile networks. Mediation  is the term used for converting usage and consumption data (length of calls, amount of data transferred)  into billing and payment information.  5.1.15 Power supplies  [Mobile, Fixed]  Power supplies are the assets providing electrical energy to active equipment. Note this does not include  the backup power supply.  Examples: Transformers, power lines, power connectors to the main grid, solar cells, etc.  5.1.16 Backup power supplies  [Mobile, Fixed]  Backup power supplies are the assets which ensure power backup functionality in case of power cut.  Examples: Diesel generators, batteries. See also Section A.13.  5.1.17 Cooling systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Cooling systems are the assets providing cooling or ventilation to network and information systems.  5.1.18 Street cabinets  [Fixed]  Street cabinets are assets which aggregate fixed connections. A street cabinet can hold passive and active  network equipment, for copper, fibre or a combination of copper-fibre connections) and is typically located  in the ‘street’ where it concentrates/aggregates local loop cables from subscribers.  5.1.19 Buildings and physical security systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Buildings and physical security systems are the assets used by providers to protect other assets from physical  and environmental threats.  Examples: Sites, data centres, fences, walls, doors, locks, et cetera.  5.1.20 Logical security systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  Guideline on Threats and Assets  19  Systems providing logical protection of provider's network perimeter, including authentication, and  authorization, encryption, and supporting services (e.g. directory information -LDAP).  Examples: firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPN servers, Radius, AAA systems, and LDAP. See also Section A.15.  5.1.21 Operational support systems  [Mobile, Fixed]  ICT systems which support the operation of telecommunication networks. The term typically refers to  systems managing the network and supporting processes such as maintaining a network inventory,  configuring network components, managing faults, etc.  5.1.22  Intelligent network devices  [Fixed]  Intelligent network devices, typically in an SS7 architecture, provide additional services to the network assets  allowing telecom operators to provide value-added services in addition to the standard communication  services (e.g. number portability, green numbers, et cetera).  Examples: STP, SCP, SS7. See also Section A.14.  5.2 Asset groups  Assets play a different role depending on their role and location in the provider’s network. For example, a  cable connecting two providers plays a very different role than a cable between a base station and a base  station controller.  For the sake of clarity we group assets in 4 groups, depending on where the asset is located in the provider’s  network:   Peering points – Assets in the group “Peering points” support the communications between the  subscribers of one provider and the subscribers of another provider. For example, an IXP or a submarine  cable, connecting several providers would be in this group.   Core network – Assets in the group “Core network” support the bulk of the communications of the  subscribers. For example, a backbone connecting two major cities in a country, or a central site would  be in this group.   Area network – Assets in the group “Area network” support a large part of the communications of the  subscribers.  For example, the cables between different parts of a large city or a regional site would be  in this group.   Access network – Assets in the group “Access network” support access of individual subscribers to the  networks and communication services of the provider. For example, base  stations or fiber-to-the-home  infrastructure would be in this group.  The different asset groups are depicted below.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  20  Figure 5-2: Assets are grouped in 4 main groups  Note that not all providers have assets in all groups. For example, some providers may just offer access  network infrastructure, for others operators to use when offering services.  5.3 Asset components  For some assets, especially complex ICT assets, it can be useful to split them in several components.  For example, the components of a mobile base station include the base station’s operating system, the  transceiver baseband unit, power amplifiers, power supply, its antennas, batteries and connection to the  power grid.  For the sake of clarity we group these components in three different layers.   Supplies layer – The Supplies layer consists of components such as power supply from the grid, or fuel  supply from energy firms.   Hardware layer –The hardware layer consists of hardware components.   Software layer – The software layer consists of software components.  Figure 5-3: Assets consist of components at three different layers  Asset  Component Component Component  Component Component Component  Component Component  Software  layer  Hardware layer  Supplies layer  Guideline on Threats and Assets  21  Note that not all assets have components in all layers. For example, a basic diesel generator, which has to  be started manually, does not have components at the logical layer. A solar-cell powered base station does  not have components at the supplies layer.  Guideline on Threats and Assets  22  6.

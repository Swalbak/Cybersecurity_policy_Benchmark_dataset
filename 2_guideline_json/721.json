The introduction includes steps you should take before you begin, including:  1. Check that you have a compatible Microsoft 365 subscription. This technical  example requires a subscription to Microsoft 365 Business Premium (or equivalent).  2. Enable security defaults in Azure Active Directory. Microsoft has published guidance  on enabling Security defaults.   3. Enrol your compatible devices in Intune. Microsoft has published guidance  on enrolling Windows devices in Intune.  The steps taken in this technical example require an account with Intune  Administrator or Global Administrator privileges.  Why you should implement application patching controls Patching applications is one of the most effective controls an organisation can implement to  prevent cyber criminals from gaining access to their devices and sensitive information. Patches  improve the security of applications by fixing known vulnerabilities. Cyber criminals exploit  vulnerabilities as soon as they are publicly disclosed so organisations should patch their  applications as a priority.  Cyber criminals scan internet-facing services with automated tools that gather information about  potentially vulnerable systems. This information can be used by cyber-criminals to target at-risk  businesses. Regular vulnerability scanning can identify gaps in your organisation’s attack surface  that require patching.  Requirements for application patching This technical example is adapted from Essential Eight maturity level one. It is designed to meet  the following requirements:  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/small-business-cyber-security/small-business-cloud-security-guide/small-business-cloud-security-guides-introduction https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#enabling-security-defaults https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods  Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services  are applied within two weeks of release, or within 48 hours if an exploit exists.  Patches, updates or vendor mitigations for security vulnerabilities in office productivity suites,  web browsers and their extensions, email clients, PDF software, and security products are  applied within one month of release.  A vulnerability scanner is used at least daily to identify missing patches or updates for  security vulnerabilities in internet-facing services.  A vulnerability scanner is used at least fortnightly to identify missing patches or updates for  security vulnerabilities in office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email  clients, PDF software, and security products.  Internet-facing services, office productivity suites, web browsers and their extensions, email  clients, PDF software, Adobe Flash Player, and security products that are no longer supported  by vendors are removed.  What this technical example covers This technical example demonstrates one way to configure automatic updates for Microsoft 365  applications. It applies to devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune that are running Windows 10 or  Windows 11. This technical example does not cover applications that are outside of the Microsoft  365 ecosystem. Your organisation should implement controls that ensure any other applications  it uses are also patched promptly, particularly any hosting services on the internet. Many  applications will have their own mechanisms for regular patching. Guidance on patching should  be available on the website of each application vendor.    Technical example  Ensuring applications are kept up-to-date  Note: This technical example deploys Microsoft 365 applications using Microsoft Intune.  This allows IT staff to specify that updates and patches to Microsoft applications are  applied automatically  1. Log into the Microsoft Intune admin center. Select Apps in the main menu then select All Apps.  Select Add from the menu items at the top of the page.  2. In the pane that appears, select the dropdown menu and select Windows 10 and later under  Microsoft 365 Apps. Press Select at the bottom of the panel to continue to the next step.  https://endpoint.microsoft.com/  3. Configure the app suite information according to your organisation’s needs then select Next. In  this technical example, the default configuration was used.  4. In the Configure app suite tab, select a default file format, select an Update channel, select  Yes under Remove other versions and select Latest under version to install. In this technical  example, ‘Current Channel’ was selected as the update channel, consult Microsoft’s overview of  update channels to determine which channel is best for your organisation. On this screen you can  also configure which Office apps need to be deployed. If you intend to have multiple user’s  sharing a common computer, you should enable Use shared computer activation. Select Next.  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-au/deployoffice/overview-update-channels  5. In the Assignments tab, press Add all devices to deploy Office applications to all enrolled  devices. Select Next.  Note: This technical example deploys Office applications to all enrolled devices. Your  organisation may prefer a different deployment strategy.  6. In the Review + create tab, ensure you are happy with your settings and press Create to begin  deployment of apps.  7. To verify that apps are being deployed successfully, administrators can check the dashboard.  From the Microsoft Intune main menu, select Apps then Monitor.  8. Select App install status. This will also show failed updates and can be used to verify device  update compliance.  Identify missing patches with a vulnerability scanner  This technical example uses Microsoft’s in-built vulnerability scanning to scan internet-facing  services. Microsoft automatically scans production assets daily with the most recent vulnerability  signatures to identify potential security risks and remediate them.  Microsoft’s in-built auto-update tool is sufficient in identifying when Office products are out of  date and have security vulnerabilities. If the above steps were followed, Office apps will be  sufficiently protected.  Your organisation may wish to deploy an agent-based vulnerability scanner to scan any  applications that are outside of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. There are commercial solutions  available that can be deployed via Microsoft Intune.  Alternatively, administrators may wish to  opt-in for Microsoft’s 'Block vulnerable applications' public preview which scans enrolled devices  for applications which contain security vulnerabilities. This feature is still in beta and may not be  sufficiently capable of replacing existing agent-based vulnerability scanning tools.  Remove unsupported products It is up to IT staff to consider the configuration of their organisation and determine what installed  applications are and are not supported. Any apps deployed via Microsoft Intune should be  verified to ensure they are still supported by the vendor. If an unsupported application is required,  IT staff should consider additional mitigations to maintain security, for example, using conditional  access to only permit the application to run on accounts with reduced privileges.

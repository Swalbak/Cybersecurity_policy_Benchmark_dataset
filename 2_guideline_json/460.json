The  capabilities from this framework underscore NII as Critical Infrastructure of the EU and its Member States.  This report recognizes the work already addressed by a number of European bodies including the  designated European Standardization Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) and the Cyber Security Focus  Group (CSCG), the European Reference Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection (ERNCIP), and  individual Member States who have already taken steps to facilitate information sharing between  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). The recommendations of this report include  extending the technical basis for information sharing in the following ways:   Adopting open standards in threat exchange based on the globally accepted STIX/TAXII/CyBOX  platform to be prepared as an European Norm (EN) defining the syntax and semantics of the data  and the necessary transfer protocol, and an accompanying guide to the implementation of the  standard   Extending the risk analysis and defensive measures capabilities defined in current standards to  allow Member States to address the NII and NIS provisions necessary to mitigate risk both at  national and regional level. This should be prepared as an EN extending the capabilities already  described in ETSI TS 102 165-1, ETSI TR 103 305, ISO/IEC 15408 and in relevant ISO/IEC JTC1 2700x  series standards.  In making the recommendations above, it is noted that it is not possible to separate provisions for NIS  from general provisions for cyber security which have been developed by a broad array of ICT standards  bodies and implemented to varying extents by the entities subject to the NIS Directive. A significant  concern consists in the fact that EU Regulation No 1025/2012 referenced by the NIS Directive only defines  a small handful of organisations as constituting standardization bodies. This is not an accurate reflection of  the current state of the market, nor those used within the highly specialized sectors to which the Directive  applies.  Furthermore, NII, NIS and Cyber security cannot be geographically isolated and applied only to the  European Union. This distributed complexity should be considered in implementing of the necessary  information sharing required for effective NIS. Thus many of the capabilities of the NII, of commercial  necessity, will be implemented using software and hardware from a global market and not a market  restricted to the EU.  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  05  1. Landscape of the European NIS-related standardisation  The context for NIS  The Network Information Security (NIS) domain is one of the many dimensions of the multi-dimensional  cyber-security landscape that can be visualised as a set of linked questions:  1. What is cyber security?  2. Who or what is affected? i.e. What is the cyber environment?  3. What measures enable protection?  4. What measures enable threat detection?  5. What measures enable thwarting and other remedies?  6. What legal remedies exist?  The NIS scope and the scope of what is cyber-security have considerable overlap and whilst the focus of  the NIS Directive may be considered as relating to questions 3, 4 and 5 the reality is that the entire set of 6  questions needs to be considered in giving an assurance of NIS as required through the detail to be found  in the articles of the NIS Directive. The visual model of the scope of the NIS Directive within Cyber-Security  is shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1:  Visualisation of the relationship of NIS Directive to Cyber-security  Defense against attack of Network Information Systems shares the same set of fundamental building  blocks as any other system. The well-known CIA paradigm (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  leads to  well-known and understood triples of {threat, security-dimension, countermeasure} such as {interception,  confidentiality, encryption}.  The role of the CIA paradigm is most often seen in 2 areas: Risk analysis; and,  Countermeasure deployment. The CIA paradigm applies equally to NIS as to any other domain in cyber- security.  Focus of the Directive  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  06  European and global efforts in NIS standardisation  Standards are developed for global markets, and whilst there are some regional localisations that are  addressed by the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) designated in Regulation (EU) No  1025/2012, the state of the global standards market in the NIS and Cyber-security domain is complex and  highly specialized within ICT sectors. Practically the formal recognition processes for technical  standardisation has been progressively side-lined by the rapid growth over the past twenty years of what  may be termed alternative standards development bodies.  The following list enumerates the bodies involved in global cyber security standards whilst a more  complete list of bodies is maintained by ETSI in ETSI TR 103 306 and a similar list has been captured in  report number 3 of the Cyber Security Focus Group (CSCG).  3GPP  CCRA ETSI ISI IIC  OAA Platform Industrie  4.0  3GPP SA2 CEN  ETSI LI InfluxDB  OASIS  RIOT  3GPP SA3 CENELEC  ETSI MTS-SIG IO-Link  OASIS CTI ROS  3GPP SA5 CEPOL  ETSI NFV IoT Security  Foundation  ODVA  SAE International  3GPP CT CERT-EU  ETSI NTECH IoTivity  OGC  SensiNact  ACDC  CIA  ETSI SAGE IPEN  OIC-CERT  SGIP  ACEA:  CIIAII  FIDO Alliance  IPSO  OM2M  Sofia2  AEF  CIS  FIRST  ISA  OMA  TCG  AIOTI  CLEPA  Fi-ware  ISF  OMG  The KNX  Association  AllJoyn  Contiki  GlobalPlatform  ISO  OneM2M  The Open Group  Allseen  Alliance  Continua: Health  Alliance  GSMA  ISO JTC1/SC27 ONOS  The ULE Alliance  Apache  Spark  CSA  GSMA FASG ISO JTC1/SC6 OPC Foundation  The ZigBee  Alliance  APCERT  CSC  H2020  ISO JTC1/SC7 Open Connectivity  Forum  ThingSpeak  Arduino:  CSCG  HGI  ITU ITU-D OpenDaylight  Thread group  ASHRAE  DICOM  HL7 International  ITU ITU-R openHAB  TMForum  Automation  ML  easyway  HYPER/CAT  ITU ITU-T OpenIoT  UDG Alliance  AVNU  eCl@ss  ICANN  ITU  OpenRemote  UniverSaal  BEREC  EclipseIoT  IEC  LinuxIoTDM  OpenStack  UPnP  Bluetooth  ECRG  IEEE  LoRa Alliance  OpenWSN  W3C  Broadband  Forum  ENISA  IEEE 802 LAN/MAN  Standards  Committee  MITRE  OPFNV  Weightless  C2C-CC  Enocean Alliance  IEEE P2413  Mosquitto  OSCE  Wi-Fi Alliance  CA/B Forum  ERTICO - ITS Europe  IETF  NATO OSGi Alliance  WWRF  Cable Labs  ETSI  IETF IRTF NATO CCDCOE OWASP  Calypso  ETSI CYBER IETF MILE NATO LIBGUIDE Paho  CCC ETSI E2NA IETF SACM NIST  Particle  CC-Link  ETSI ESI IHE Node-RED  PI International  Table 1: Significant Cyber Security Standards fora  The actual global cyber security standards ecosystem today used by the ICT industry is depicted in Table 1.  This ecosystem is, however, so complex and rapidly evolving that it is probably incomplete.  The Table  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  07  reflects the recognition in Recital (32) of the NIS Directive that “standardisation of security requirements is  a market-driven process.”  Unfortunately, the definition of what constitutes a standard or a specification in the Directive is  fundamentally at odds with this recognition by referencing Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 which excludes  almost all the bodies cited in Table 1. (Only CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, ISO/IEC and ITU are recognized as  standards bodies).  An immediate consequence of the diversity of the current standardisation ecosystem, and because of the  extremely rapid pace of change, is that it is increasingly difficult to authoritatively determine if gaps in  standardization or in capability exist. Any failure to recognize the reality of the ecosystem and the  constituent members will gravely harm the aims of the NIS Directive and the harmonization of NII/NIS.  1.2.1 Critical Infrastructure Protection initiative support to NIS  The ERNCIP (European Reference Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection) initiative has identified a  set of Cyber Security and Network protection standards. However, the ERNCIP work has not addressed NII  as a domain in its own right and this needs to be revised. The NII is increasingly a component of all other  Critical Infrastructures and this trend is expected to continue to the point that all CI shall have an NII  component.  Work of Cybersecurity Focus Group (CSCG)  Within the EU the core standards bodies (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) have set up the Cybersecurity  Coordination Group (CSCG), transformed into Cybersecurity Focus Group (keeping the same acronym)  after withdrawal of ETSI, which main goals include giving strategic advice to the technical committees of  European standards developing organisations and EU Institution. In this frame, the CSCG has undertaken  extended work emanating from the White Paper \"Recommendations for a Strategy on European Cyber  Security Standardisation\" resulting in a further set of documents aimed at defining the term Cyber Security  and the stakeholders involved. As noted above, it is not possible to distinguish capabilities for NII/NIS from  the provisions for the general ICT/Cybersecurity domains and thus many of the recommendations of the  CSCG apply equally to NIS.  New context – NIS Directive  Whilst it may be suggested that the NIS Directive imposes new requirements, it is probably more correct to  state that the NIS Directive imposes essential requirements for harmonization and interoperability of the  attack and defense context. The illustration in Figure 2 identifies the interfaces and operations to be made  common for NIS Directive conformance.   NOTE 1: Each Member State will designate one or more CSIRTs.  If multiple, the Competent  Authority will coordinate   NOTE 2:  Processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive shall be carried out in accordance  with Directive 95/46/EC; processing of personal data by Union institutions and bodies pursuant to  this Directive shall be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 [Article 1a]  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  08  Figure 2: Interfaces of NIS Directive  As indicated in Table 1, above, there are many bodies proposing standardisation in these areas. The key  aspects identified in the NIS Directive are those dealing, as shown in Figure 2, with reporting between a  service provider and the CSIRT (variously named as ESP-CSIRT, DSP-CSIRT, PECN-CSIRT, and other-CSIRT)  and between the CSIRTs and the Competent Authorities.  Internally to the service provider domain are two key sets of actions to be undertaken:   Monitor and defence of the information system   Privacy compliance processing  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  09  2. Analysis of the NIS Directive against standards requirements  This document provides an analysis of gaps in the standards landscape for Network and Information  Security and provides recommendations for further standards development to allow the NIS Directive to  be fulfilled and for the wider domain of NII to give assurances of security. An article by article summary of  the analysis is given in \"Annex B: Summary of NIS Directive technical requirements\".  The analysis of gaps and subsequent recommendations are derived from an analysis of the NIS Directive to  identify where standards are explicitly called for or are mentioned as requirements.  The research, however extends beyond the core standardisation requirements of the NIS Directive, but  takes into account other areas mentioned in the directive, where standards might be considered helpful,  but also reviews where requirements from other areas may potentially overlap or even contradict  requirements exposed by the NIS Directive.  The analysis of requirements has been mapped against existing standards to identify if such existing  standards may form the basis of a NIS framework.  Where possible, draft standards and projects at earlier stages have been considered. This is particularly  important as the NII and general networking world are continuously evolving and the role of network  virtualization, of the greater use of cryptography, and of the evolution in the role of virtual operators of  networks and services, has been taken into account in identifying the broad set of requirements for NIS.  In line with the objectives of the NIS Directive, a strong focus was given to generic process-oriented  standards for cyber security in organizations (risk management, information sharing, etc.). Conversely,  cybersecurity standards in NIS Directive Art. 14 essential services sectors (energy, transport, banking,  financial markets, etc) were not significantly examined. In other cases, such as NIS Directive Art. 15 Digital  Services (cloud computing, IoT, embedded systems, big data, etc.), dedicated cyber security standards (e.g.  public key infrastructure) were taken into account.  The highly disparate sectors made it infeasible to take  into account all the standards in a comprehensive fashion within a single focused analysis.  Within the recommendations, attention was given to the existing initiatives that could benefit from  synergies with work in standards, especially involving contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs) and  Horizon 2020 (H2020).  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  10  3. NIS Directive requirements  Overview  As a result of performed deconstruction of NIS Directive, several distinct areas have been identified, where  specific requirements can be reflected in standards. A more in depth review is given below that expands  upon the article-by-article review of Annex B.  Risk management for networks and information systems  Articles 14 and 15 of the NISD require “appropriate and proportionate technical and organizational  measures to manage the risks posed to the security of networks and information systems” for operators of  essential services and digital service providers respectively. With regards to the latter, the NISD specifically  requires to take into account:   security of systems and facilities,   incident management,    business continuity management,    monitoring, auditing and testing,    compliance with international standards.  Recent activity in ETSI has led to the publication of ETSI TR 103 305 addressing the role of ICT in Critical  Infrastructure. It contains detailed consideration of the role of business continuity management, risk  analysis and incident management. Whilst ETSI, in its Technical Committee CYBER, has committed to the  extension of this work, there is still no formal plan in place to accomplish this task.  Some work has also  been done in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27, which addresses risk and security management in the ISO 27000 series of  management documents.  Furthermore, ETSI has published a modified set of controls for cyber security. In a similar fashion to the ICT  for CI work, they will be further refined in normative specifications in due course. Additional work that  addresses event detection within the context of risk analysis and incident management can be found in the  following specifications:   ETSI GS ISI 004 V1.1.1 (2013-12): Information Security Indicators (ISI); Guidelines for event  detection implementation   ETSI GS ISI 002 V1.2.1 (2015-11): Information Security Indicators (ISI); Event Model A security event  classification model and taxonomy  As part of the rapid evolution and extension of the existing specifications for Structured Threat Information  Expression (STIX), Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) and Cyber Observable  eXpression (CybOX) within the OASIS (standardisation body with which ETSI cooperates closely), additional  risk and event categorizations are being added.  Impact prevention and minimisation  As noted, Articles 14 and 15 of the NISD require appropriate technical and operational measures \"to  prevent and minimise the impact of incidents affecting the security of the networks and information  systems\" for operators of essential services and digital service providers respectively.  The Critical Security  Controls specified in TR 103 305 are especially relevant, and efforts are underway to adjust the controls  very quickly in response to threat conditions.  The topic of risk management is also addressed by ETSI in TS  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  11  102 165-1 and ISO/IEC 15408 in the context of security assurance, as well as by some of the ISO/IEC JTC1  27000 series of specifications.  There is a significant issue arising from impact prevention, surrounding recovery to an equivalent stable  state. This has been addressed in ETSI TR 103 303 with a summary of the concern stated as follows: \"If an  attacker has exploited systems using \"strategy A\" which have been successfully immunised against, it is  essential that all connected and stakeholder systems that are vulnerable to the same \"strategy A\" have to  be similarly immunised in order to defend against future attacks where \"strategy A\" is used as a side- channel attack at a related stakeholder\". The reporting of an attack and the means used to immunize the  system thus have to be shared, in order to prevent the form of side channel attack indicated.  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), Competent Authorities, and  Single Points of Contact  In Article 7, the NISD requires Member States to designate one or more Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs) \"for handling incidents and risks according to a well-defined process, which shall  comply with the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I.\" Where there are multiple CSIRTs, a  Competent Authority within the Member State and a designated Single Point of Contact are also key  entities that are part of the structured exchange of information.  Annex I further provides an extensive list  of required capabilities, such as:   high availability of communications services by avoiding single points of failure and providing  several means for being contacted and for contacting others at all times   communication channels clearly specified and well known to the constituency and cooperative  partners.   appropriate system for managing and routing requests, in order to facilitate handovers   infrastructure whose continuity of operation is ensured  The complete set of entities and associated information exchange architecture resulting from Art. 7 is very  complex – as depicted in Figure 2, above.  Not only can there be multiple entities within each Member  State, among whom information must be exchanged, but there are also equivalent entities in every other  Member and Non-Member State that have to be accommodated. It is also foreseeable that some Member  States for highly specialized Essential Services will designate third party entities collectively representing  the operators (e.g., Information Sharing and Analysis Centres).  In addition, foreign providers of digital  services must designate domestic representatives for purpose of the NISD requirements.  Identification of Operators  Article 3a (5) of the NISD requires the Cooperation Group to support a consistent approach among  Member States to identify (cf. lit. a-d ) operators of essential services.  In identifying NII as a component of CI, the guidance of ETSI TR 103 303 and succeeding work should be  considered as the base for future standardization. In particular, ETSI TR 103 303 recommends that  organisations should be familiar with the definition(s) of CI in their sector(s) and the government body  acting as a point of contact in this area. Any organisation believing that they either meet the relevant  definition of CI or will do so in the near future should notify the relevant government body. In the context  of NISD, the Competent Authority for NIS may also be considered as the Competent Authority for CI.  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  12  4. Recommendations  The NISD analysis given in Annex B has identified a small number of gaps in standardisation and some  areas of overlap where there is no clear best practice to be adopted. The standardisation analysis has  considered a very much wider spectrum of Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) than is implied by  the text of Article 16 of the NSID which refers to \"internationally accepted standards\". The interpretation  of this Article for the purpose of presented analysis has been to include standards that have acceptance in  the industry from a wide set of bodies. This includes those established under Regulation (EU) No  1025/2012, but should be also extended to the recognised de-facto and industrial groups, thus including  groups such as IETF, W3C, OASIS, and established national bodies with international recognition, like FIPS,  NIST, BSI and others. A list of such standards bodies with particular roles in Cyber Security, and by  inference in Network Information Security, has been published recently as ETSI TR 103 306. It is strongly  recommended that this source is adopted as a list of bodies preparing \"internationally accepted  standards\". It is further noted that this list has been summarised in the Cybersecurity Focus Group (CSCG)  report number 3 and is presented in Table 1 of this document.  The immediate priority is to simplify the standards for NIS that enable interoperability of event reporting  and information sharing. The controls for cyber security have been transposed for the EU context in ETSI  TR 103 305. Specific recommendations include:   Reach consensus among Member States and major partners on  o Architectures, interfaces, and information exchange expressions  o Standards and specifications   Given the strong similarities of the NIS Directive and USA Cybersecurity Act, the two  implementations should be harmonized to the extent possible, including common architectures,  interfaces, structured information expressions and privacy filters   Develop a means for Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Information Sharing and  Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) to fit into the NIS Directive model and architecture   Develop means for Public Electronic Communication Networks or Publicly Available Electronic  Communication Service Providers under EU Directive 2002/21/EC and Trust Providers to fit into  the NIS Directive model and architecture   Develop additional border gateway defence and threat exchange standards for one Essential  Service (Digital Infrastructure Internet Exchange Points)   Develop a means for NFV, SDN, MEC and other virtualised infrastructures and services to fit into  the NIS Directive model and architecture  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  13  Annex A: Definitions and abbreviations  Definitions  The following definitions from the NIS Directive apply in the present document:   Network and information system: (a) an electronic communications network within the meaning  of Directive 2002/21/EC, and (b) any device or group of inter-connected or related devices, one or  more of which, pursuant to a program, perform automatic processing of computer data, as well as  (c) computer data stored, processed, retrieved or transmitted by elements covered under point (a)  and (b) for the purposes of their operation, use, protection and maintenance.   Security: The ability of a network and information system to resist, at a given level of confidence,  accident or malicious action that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and  confidentiality of stored or transmitted data or the related services offered by or accessible via  that network and information system;   Risk: any circumstance or event having a potential adverse effect on security;   Incident: any circumstance or event having an actual adverse effect on security;   information society service: service within the meaning of point (2) of Article 1 of Directive  98/34/EC;   NIS cooperation plan: a plan establishing the framework for organisational roles, responsibilities  and procedures to maintain or restore the operation of networks and information systems, in the  event of a risk or an incident affecting them;   incident handling: all procedures supporting the analysis, containment and response to an  incident;   market operator: (a) provider of information society services which enable the provision of other  information society services, a non-exhaustive list of which is set out in Annex II of the NIS  Directive; (b) operator of critical infrastructure that are essential for the maintenance of vital  economic and societal activities in the fields of energy, transport, banking, stock exchanges and  health, a non-exhaustive list of which is set out in Annex II of the NIS directive.   Standard: a standard referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012;   Specification: a specification referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012;   Trust service provider: a natural or legal person who provides any electronic service consisting in  the creation, verification, validation, handling and preservation of electronic signatures, electronic  seals, electronic time stamps, electronic documents, electronic delivery services, website  authentication, and electronic certificates, including certificates for electronic signature and for  electronic seals.

ENISA works with these groups to develop advice and recommendations on good practice in information  security. It assists EU member states in implementing relevant EU legislation and works to improve the  resilience of Europe’s critical information infrastructure and networks. ENISA seeks to enhance existing  expertise in EU member states by supporting the development of cross-border communities committed to  improving network and information security throughout the EU.

The  capabilities from this framework underscore NII as Critical Infrastructure of the EU and its Member States.  This report recognizes the work already addressed by a number of European bodies including the  designated European Standardization Organisations (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) and the Cyber Security Focus  Group (CSCG), the European Reference Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection (ERNCIP), and  individual Member States who have already taken steps to facilitate information sharing between  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). The recommendations of this report include  extending the technical basis for information sharing in the following ways:   Adopting open standards in threat exchange based on the globally accepted STIX/TAXII/CyBOX  platform to be prepared as an European Norm (EN) defining the syntax and semantics of the data  and the necessary transfer protocol, and an accompanying guide to the implementation of the  standard   Extending the risk analysis and defensive measures capabilities defined in current standards to  allow Member States to address the NII and NIS provisions necessary to mitigate risk both at  national and regional level. This should be prepared as an EN extending the capabilities already  described in ETSI TS 102 165-1, ETSI TR 103 305, ISO/IEC 15408 and in relevant ISO/IEC JTC1 2700x  series standards.  In making the recommendations above, it is noted that it is not possible to separate provisions for NIS  from general provisions for cyber security which have been developed by a broad array of ICT standards  bodies and implemented to varying extents by the entities subject to the NIS Directive. A significant  concern consists in the fact that EU Regulation No 1025/2012 referenced by the NIS Directive only defines  a small handful of organisations as constituting standardization bodies. This is not an accurate reflection of  the current state of the market, nor those used within the highly specialized sectors to which the Directive  applies.  Furthermore, NII, NIS and Cyber security cannot be geographically isolated and applied only to the  European Union. This distributed complexity should be considered in implementing of the necessary  information sharing required for effective NIS. Thus many of the capabilities of the NII, of commercial  necessity, will be implemented using software and hardware from a global market and not a market  restricted to the EU.  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  05  1. Landscape of the European NIS-related standardisation  The context for NIS  The Network Information Security (NIS) domain is one of the many dimensions of the multi-dimensional  cyber-security landscape that can be visualised as a set of linked questions:  1. What is cyber security?  2. Who or what is affected? i.e. What is the cyber environment?  3. What measures enable protection?  4. What measures enable threat detection?  5. What measures enable thwarting and other remedies?  6. What legal remedies exist?  The NIS scope and the scope of what is cyber-security have considerable overlap and whilst the focus of  the NIS Directive may be considered as relating to questions 3, 4 and 5 the reality is that the entire set of 6  questions needs to be considered in giving an assurance of NIS as required through the detail to be found  in the articles of the NIS Directive. The visual model of the scope of the NIS Directive within Cyber-Security  is shown in Figure 1.  Figure 1:  Visualisation of the relationship of NIS Directive to Cyber-security  Defense against attack of Network Information Systems shares the same set of fundamental building  blocks as any other system. The well-known CIA paradigm (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  leads to  well-known and understood triples of {threat, security-dimension, countermeasure} such as {interception,  confidentiality, encryption}.  The role of the CIA paradigm is most often seen in 2 areas: Risk analysis; and,  Countermeasure deployment. The CIA paradigm applies equally to NIS as to any other domain in cyber- security.  Focus of the Directive  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  06  European and global efforts in NIS standardisation  Standards are developed for global markets, and whilst there are some regional localisations that are  addressed by the European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) designated in Regulation (EU) No  1025/2012, the state of the global standards market in the NIS and Cyber-security domain is complex and  highly specialized within ICT sectors. Practically the formal recognition processes for technical  standardisation has been progressively side-lined by the rapid growth over the past twenty years of what  may be termed alternative standards development bodies.  The following list enumerates the bodies involved in global cyber security standards whilst a more  complete list of bodies is maintained by ETSI in ETSI TR 103 306 and a similar list has been captured in  report number 3 of the Cyber Security Focus Group (CSCG).  3GPP  CCRA ETSI ISI IIC  OAA Platform Industrie  4.0  3GPP SA2 CEN  ETSI LI InfluxDB  OASIS  RIOT  3GPP SA3 CENELEC  ETSI MTS-SIG IO-Link  OASIS CTI ROS  3GPP SA5 CEPOL  ETSI NFV IoT Security  Foundation  ODVA  SAE International  3GPP CT CERT-EU  ETSI NTECH IoTivity  OGC  SensiNact  ACDC  CIA  ETSI SAGE IPEN  OIC-CERT  SGIP  ACEA:  CIIAII  FIDO Alliance  IPSO  OM2M  Sofia2  AEF  CIS  FIRST  ISA  OMA  TCG  AIOTI  CLEPA  Fi-ware  ISF  OMG  The KNX  Association  AllJoyn  Contiki  GlobalPlatform  ISO  OneM2M  The Open Group  Allseen  Alliance  Continua: Health  Alliance  GSMA  ISO JTC1/SC27 ONOS  The ULE Alliance  Apache  Spark  CSA  GSMA FASG ISO JTC1/SC6 OPC Foundation  The ZigBee  Alliance  APCERT  CSC  H2020  ISO JTC1/SC7 Open Connectivity  Forum  ThingSpeak  Arduino:  CSCG  HGI  ITU ITU-D OpenDaylight  Thread group  ASHRAE  DICOM  HL7 International  ITU ITU-R openHAB  TMForum  Automation  ML  easyway  HYPER/CAT  ITU ITU-T OpenIoT  UDG Alliance  AVNU  eCl@ss  ICANN  ITU  OpenRemote  UniverSaal  BEREC  EclipseIoT  IEC  LinuxIoTDM  OpenStack  UPnP  Bluetooth  ECRG  IEEE  LoRa Alliance  OpenWSN  W3C  Broadband  Forum  ENISA  IEEE 802 LAN/MAN  Standards  Committee  MITRE  OPFNV  Weightless  C2C-CC  Enocean Alliance  IEEE P2413  Mosquitto  OSCE  Wi-Fi Alliance  CA/B Forum  ERTICO - ITS Europe  IETF  NATO OSGi Alliance  WWRF  Cable Labs  ETSI  IETF IRTF NATO CCDCOE OWASP  Calypso  ETSI CYBER IETF MILE NATO LIBGUIDE Paho  CCC ETSI E2NA IETF SACM NIST  Particle  CC-Link  ETSI ESI IHE Node-RED  PI International  Table 1: Significant Cyber Security Standards fora  The actual global cyber security standards ecosystem today used by the ICT industry is depicted in Table 1.  This ecosystem is, however, so complex and rapidly evolving that it is probably incomplete.  The Table  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  07  reflects the recognition in Recital (32) of the NIS Directive that “standardisation of security requirements is  a market-driven process.”  Unfortunately, the definition of what constitutes a standard or a specification in the Directive is  fundamentally at odds with this recognition by referencing Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 which excludes  almost all the bodies cited in Table 1. (Only CEN, CENELEC, ETSI, ISO/IEC and ITU are recognized as  standards bodies).  An immediate consequence of the diversity of the current standardisation ecosystem, and because of the  extremely rapid pace of change, is that it is increasingly difficult to authoritatively determine if gaps in  standardization or in capability exist. Any failure to recognize the reality of the ecosystem and the  constituent members will gravely harm the aims of the NIS Directive and the harmonization of NII/NIS.  1.2.1 Critical Infrastructure Protection initiative support to NIS  The ERNCIP (European Reference Network for Critical Infrastructure Protection) initiative has identified a  set of Cyber Security and Network protection standards. However, the ERNCIP work has not addressed NII  as a domain in its own right and this needs to be revised. The NII is increasingly a component of all other  Critical Infrastructures and this trend is expected to continue to the point that all CI shall have an NII  component.  Work of Cybersecurity Focus Group (CSCG)  Within the EU the core standards bodies (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) have set up the Cybersecurity  Coordination Group (CSCG), transformed into Cybersecurity Focus Group (keeping the same acronym)  after withdrawal of ETSI, which main goals include giving strategic advice to the technical committees of  European standards developing organisations and EU Institution. In this frame, the CSCG has undertaken  extended work emanating from the White Paper \"Recommendations for a Strategy on European Cyber  Security Standardisation\" resulting in a further set of documents aimed at defining the term Cyber Security  and the stakeholders involved. As noted above, it is not possible to distinguish capabilities for NII/NIS from  the provisions for the general ICT/Cybersecurity domains and thus many of the recommendations of the  CSCG apply equally to NIS.  New context – NIS Directive  Whilst it may be suggested that the NIS Directive imposes new requirements, it is probably more correct to  state that the NIS Directive imposes essential requirements for harmonization and interoperability of the  attack and defense context. The illustration in Figure 2 identifies the interfaces and operations to be made  common for NIS Directive conformance.   NOTE 1: Each Member State will designate one or more CSIRTs.  If multiple, the Competent  Authority will coordinate   NOTE 2:  Processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive shall be carried out in accordance  with Directive 95/46/EC; processing of personal data by Union institutions and bodies pursuant to  this Directive shall be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 [Article 1a]  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  08  Figure 2: Interfaces of NIS Directive  As indicated in Table 1, above, there are many bodies proposing standardisation in these areas. The key  aspects identified in the NIS Directive are those dealing, as shown in Figure 2, with reporting between a  service provider and the CSIRT (variously named as ESP-CSIRT, DSP-CSIRT, PECN-CSIRT, and other-CSIRT)  and between the CSIRTs and the Competent Authorities.  Internally to the service provider domain are two key sets of actions to be undertaken:   Monitor and defence of the information system   Privacy compliance processing  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  09  2. Analysis of the NIS Directive against standards requirements  This document provides an analysis of gaps in the standards landscape for Network and Information  Security and provides recommendations for further standards development to allow the NIS Directive to  be fulfilled and for the wider domain of NII to give assurances of security. An article by article summary of  the analysis is given in \"Annex B: Summary of NIS Directive technical requirements\".  The analysis of gaps and subsequent recommendations are derived from an analysis of the NIS Directive to  identify where standards are explicitly called for or are mentioned as requirements.  The research, however extends beyond the core standardisation requirements of the NIS Directive, but  takes into account other areas mentioned in the directive, where standards might be considered helpful,  but also reviews where requirements from other areas may potentially overlap or even contradict  requirements exposed by the NIS Directive.  The analysis of requirements has been mapped against existing standards to identify if such existing  standards may form the basis of a NIS framework.  Where possible, draft standards and projects at earlier stages have been considered. This is particularly  important as the NII and general networking world are continuously evolving and the role of network  virtualization, of the greater use of cryptography, and of the evolution in the role of virtual operators of  networks and services, has been taken into account in identifying the broad set of requirements for NIS.  In line with the objectives of the NIS Directive, a strong focus was given to generic process-oriented  standards for cyber security in organizations (risk management, information sharing, etc.). Conversely,  cybersecurity standards in NIS Directive Art. 14 essential services sectors (energy, transport, banking,  financial markets, etc) were not significantly examined. In other cases, such as NIS Directive Art. 15 Digital  Services (cloud computing, IoT, embedded systems, big data, etc.), dedicated cyber security standards (e.g.  public key infrastructure) were taken into account.  The highly disparate sectors made it infeasible to take  into account all the standards in a comprehensive fashion within a single focused analysis.  Within the recommendations, attention was given to the existing initiatives that could benefit from  synergies with work in standards, especially involving contractual Public-Private Partnerships (cPPPs) and  Horizon 2020 (H2020).  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  10  3. NIS Directive requirements  Overview  As a result of performed deconstruction of NIS Directive, several distinct areas have been identified, where  specific requirements can be reflected in standards. A more in depth review is given below that expands  upon the article-by-article review of Annex B.  Risk management for networks and information systems  Articles 14 and 15 of the NISD require “appropriate and proportionate technical and organizational  measures to manage the risks posed to the security of networks and information systems” for operators of  essential services and digital service providers respectively. With regards to the latter, the NISD specifically  requires to take into account:   security of systems and facilities,   incident management,    business continuity management,    monitoring, auditing and testing,    compliance with international standards.  Recent activity in ETSI has led to the publication of ETSI TR 103 305 addressing the role of ICT in Critical  Infrastructure. It contains detailed consideration of the role of business continuity management, risk  analysis and incident management. Whilst ETSI, in its Technical Committee CYBER, has committed to the  extension of this work, there is still no formal plan in place to accomplish this task.  Some work has also  been done in ISO/IEC JTC1 SC27, which addresses risk and security management in the ISO 27000 series of  management documents.  Furthermore, ETSI has published a modified set of controls for cyber security. In a similar fashion to the ICT  for CI work, they will be further refined in normative specifications in due course. Additional work that  addresses event detection within the context of risk analysis and incident management can be found in the  following specifications:   ETSI GS ISI 004 V1.1.1 (2013-12): Information Security Indicators (ISI); Guidelines for event  detection implementation   ETSI GS ISI 002 V1.2.1 (2015-11): Information Security Indicators (ISI); Event Model A security event  classification model and taxonomy  As part of the rapid evolution and extension of the existing specifications for Structured Threat Information  Expression (STIX), Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) and Cyber Observable  eXpression (CybOX) within the OASIS (standardisation body with which ETSI cooperates closely), additional  risk and event categorizations are being added.  Impact prevention and minimisation  As noted, Articles 14 and 15 of the NISD require appropriate technical and operational measures \"to  prevent and minimise the impact of incidents affecting the security of the networks and information  systems\" for operators of essential services and digital service providers respectively.  The Critical Security  Controls specified in TR 103 305 are especially relevant, and efforts are underway to adjust the controls  very quickly in response to threat conditions.  The topic of risk management is also addressed by ETSI in TS  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  11  102 165-1 and ISO/IEC 15408 in the context of security assurance, as well as by some of the ISO/IEC JTC1  27000 series of specifications.  There is a significant issue arising from impact prevention, surrounding recovery to an equivalent stable  state. This has been addressed in ETSI TR 103 303 with a summary of the concern stated as follows: \"If an  attacker has exploited systems using \"strategy A\" which have been successfully immunised against, it is  essential that all connected and stakeholder systems that are vulnerable to the same \"strategy A\" have to  be similarly immunised in order to defend against future attacks where \"strategy A\" is used as a side- channel attack at a related stakeholder\". The reporting of an attack and the means used to immunize the  system thus have to be shared, in order to prevent the form of side channel attack indicated.  Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), Competent Authorities, and  Single Points of Contact  In Article 7, the NISD requires Member States to designate one or more Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs) \"for handling incidents and risks according to a well-defined process, which shall  comply with the requirements set out in point (1) of Annex I.\" Where there are multiple CSIRTs, a  Competent Authority within the Member State and a designated Single Point of Contact are also key  entities that are part of the structured exchange of information.  Annex I further provides an extensive list  of required capabilities, such as:   high availability of communications services by avoiding single points of failure and providing  several means for being contacted and for contacting others at all times   communication channels clearly specified and well known to the constituency and cooperative  partners.   appropriate system for managing and routing requests, in order to facilitate handovers   infrastructure whose continuity of operation is ensured  The complete set of entities and associated information exchange architecture resulting from Art. 7 is very  complex – as depicted in Figure 2, above.  Not only can there be multiple entities within each Member  State, among whom information must be exchanged, but there are also equivalent entities in every other  Member and Non-Member State that have to be accommodated. It is also foreseeable that some Member  States for highly specialized Essential Services will designate third party entities collectively representing  the operators (e.g., Information Sharing and Analysis Centres).  In addition, foreign providers of digital  services must designate domestic representatives for purpose of the NISD requirements.  Identification of Operators  Article 3a (5) of the NISD requires the Cooperation Group to support a consistent approach among  Member States to identify (cf. lit. a-d ) operators of essential services.  In identifying NII as a component of CI, the guidance of ETSI TR 103 303 and succeeding work should be  considered as the base for future standardization. In particular, ETSI TR 103 303 recommends that  organisations should be familiar with the definition(s) of CI in their sector(s) and the government body  acting as a point of contact in this area. Any organisation believing that they either meet the relevant  definition of CI or will do so in the near future should notify the relevant government body. In the context  of NISD, the Competent Authority for NIS may also be considered as the Competent Authority for CI.  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  12  4. Recommendations  The NISD analysis given in Annex B has identified a small number of gaps in standardisation and some  areas of overlap where there is no clear best practice to be adopted. The standardisation analysis has  considered a very much wider spectrum of Standards Development Organisations (SDOs) than is implied by  the text of Article 16 of the NSID which refers to \"internationally accepted standards\". The interpretation  of this Article for the purpose of presented analysis has been to include standards that have acceptance in  the industry from a wide set of bodies. This includes those established under Regulation (EU) No  1025/2012, but should be also extended to the recognised de-facto and industrial groups, thus including  groups such as IETF, W3C, OASIS, and established national bodies with international recognition, like FIPS,  NIST, BSI and others. A list of such standards bodies with particular roles in Cyber Security, and by  inference in Network Information Security, has been published recently as ETSI TR 103 306. It is strongly  recommended that this source is adopted as a list of bodies preparing \"internationally accepted  standards\". It is further noted that this list has been summarised in the Cybersecurity Focus Group (CSCG)  report number 3 and is presented in Table 1 of this document.  The immediate priority is to simplify the standards for NIS that enable interoperability of event reporting  and information sharing. The controls for cyber security have been transposed for the EU context in ETSI  TR 103 305. Specific recommendations include:   Reach consensus among Member States and major partners on  o Architectures, interfaces, and information exchange expressions  o Standards and specifications   Given the strong similarities of the NIS Directive and USA Cybersecurity Act, the two  implementations should be harmonized to the extent possible, including common architectures,  interfaces, structured information expressions and privacy filters   Develop a means for Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and Information Sharing and  Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) to fit into the NIS Directive model and architecture   Develop means for Public Electronic Communication Networks or Publicly Available Electronic  Communication Service Providers under EU Directive 2002/21/EC and Trust Providers to fit into  the NIS Directive model and architecture   Develop additional border gateway defence and threat exchange standards for one Essential  Service (Digital Infrastructure Internet Exchange Points)   Develop a means for NFV, SDN, MEC and other virtualised infrastructures and services to fit into  the NIS Directive model and architecture  Gaps in NIS standardisation  v. 1.0  |  November 2016  13  Annex A: Definitions and abbreviations  Definitions  The following definitions from the NIS Directive apply in the present document:   Network and information system: (a) an electronic communications network within the meaning  of Directive 2002/21/EC, and (b) any device or group of inter-connected or related devices, one or  more of which, pursuant to a program, perform automatic processing of computer data, as well as  (c) computer data stored, processed, retrieved or transmitted by elements covered under point (a)  and (b) for the purposes of their operation, use, protection and maintenance.   Security: The ability of a network and information system to resist, at a given level of confidence,  accident or malicious action that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and  confidentiality of stored or transmitted data or the related services offered by or accessible via  that network and information system;   Risk: any circumstance or event having a potential adverse effect on security;   Incident: any circumstance or event having an actual adverse effect on security;   information society service: service within the meaning of point (2) of Article 1 of Directive  98/34/EC;   NIS cooperation plan: a plan establishing the framework for organisational roles, responsibilities  and procedures to maintain or restore the operation of networks and information systems, in the  event of a risk or an incident affecting them;   incident handling: all procedures supporting the analysis, containment and response to an  incident;   market operator: (a) provider of information society services which enable the provision of other  information society services, a non-exhaustive list of which is set out in Annex II of the NIS  Directive; (b) operator of critical infrastructure that are essential for the maintenance of vital  economic and societal activities in the fields of energy, transport, banking, stock exchanges and  health, a non-exhaustive list of which is set out in Annex II of the NIS directive.   Standard: a standard referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012;   Specification: a specification referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012;   Trust service provider: a natural or legal person who provides any electronic service consisting in  the creation, verification, validation, handling and preservation of electronic signatures, electronic  seals, electronic time stamps, electronic documents, electronic delivery services, website  authentication, and electronic certificates, including certificates for electronic signature and for  electronic seals.

Conclusion 32  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  05  Executive Summary  This study details trends about the recent and current evolution of CSIRTs and Incident Response (IR)  capabilities in Europe towards 2025 at a strategic and policy level. As stressed in the 2016 Directive  concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the  Union1 (NIS Directive), CSIRTs play a vital role in cyber resilience in a context of increasing dependency on  digital infrastructures. They perform an important function throughout the crisis management process, from  identifying security incidents, protecting organisations against attacks, disseminating information on threats  and recovering from incidents. The analysis framework included the following aspects:   Technology trends   Legal and regulatory landscape   Actors at the policy, strategic and operational levels   Changing threat environment.  These trends and findings were identified by mapping new and less visible CSIRTs recently created and by  investigating policies across Europe and their impact outside Europe. Eighty-one (81) new CSIRTs were  identified and a corpus of 36 policy, regulatory, and strategic documents related to the development of  cyber incident response capabilities were analysed. An overview of the findings of the raw data is presented  in Chapter 4.  Finding 1 – The implementation of the NIS Directive fosters the adoption of a holistic approach towards  IR and an upward alignment of national capabilities  The recent updates of some Member States’ national cybersecurity strategies and of the transposition into  national law of the NIS Directive show a harmonisation in terms of strategic objectives, structures and  practices in the fields of IR and CSIRTs. With regard to international and European cooperation, the national  cybersecurity agencies – an increasing number of them integrating the national/governmental CSIRT in their  organization – tend to play a central role. With much of the detailed application of the NIS Directive left to  the national implementing laws of Member States, there remains a risk of fragmentation in terms of  capabilities. The role and scope of action of CSIRTs may indeed also vary from one country to the other.  Finding 2 - The NIS Directive may have a positive effect at the international level and provides the EU with  a status of ‘norm setter’  In Europe's neighbouring regions and to a lesser extent internationally, there is an emerging trend of  harmonization of domestic legal frameworks with the EU legal framework in the field of cybersecurity.  Together with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)2 implemented since May 2018, the impact  of the NIS Directive outside the EU may illustrate the ability of the EU to reach political and normative  consensus between nations on cybersecurity-related issues, and to act as a standard setter in areas such as  data protection, privacy and transparency.  Finding 3 – IR capability development of national administration and operators of essential services  emphasizes the relevance of collaboration at national and European level  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 - http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 - http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/2016-05-04  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/2016-05-04  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  06  Operators of essential services in the seven sectors identified in the NIS Directive, as well as national  administrations, accelerate their effort to build or upgrade their IRC. This effort includes the development  of sector-specific CSIRTs and IR collaboration mechanisms and fora, both at EU and national levels. At a  national level, the growing number of sector-specific and sector-wide CSIRTs could initiate a move towards  the organisation of IR cooperation according to a vertical model, as a complement to the horizontal and  centralized model built around the national government CSIRTs.  Finding 4 - Successful cooperation initiatives in the field of Incident Response Capabilities at an  international level are driven by public-private partnerships  On the international stage, two main kinds of cooperation initiatives were identified in the field of IRC and  cybersecurity at large: cooperation among global actors of the same sector, and the effort of the  international community to address the international challenges of digital technology and security. These  initiatives show a move toward more public-private partnerships in the field of cybersecurity is necessary at  the international level, although security is a sovereign domain and states are reluctant to agree on binding  measures. Addressing digital security indeed requires involving technology giants to define common norms  in the governance of digital infrastructures and data.  Finding 5 – There is an important development of IR services in the European private sector; however,  new vulnerabilities tend to target the hardware layer of devices manufactured outside Europe  In the longer term, the NIS Directive also has the objective to stimulate the competitiveness and innovation  capacities of the digital industry in Europe by increasing the demand for cybersecurity and to support the  development of a sustained supply of innovative cybersecurity products and services in Europe3. It seems  that the NIS Directive and the overall recent increase in security requirements may have a positive effect on  the European private sector by stimulating the supply of innovative cybersecurity services and products.  However, supply chain attacks and the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities suggest that new vulnerabilities  and the corresponding threats are surfacing within the hardware layer. The difficulties associated with  detecting and mitigating these types of vulnerabilities raises a question on the role and benefit of both  national governmental CSIRTs and European cybersecurity services providers in the IR value chain, should  vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks increasingly affect devices directly in the future.  Finding 6 – Acknowledging their exposure to cyber risks, military players tend to follow the same dynamics  as the civilian sector when developing their IR capabilities  As demonstrated by the growing number of cyber defence commands in European armies, cybersecurity is  now considered as an integral component of modern defence. It seems however that there are limited  specificities for the military domain in the digital era: armed forces are undergoing a similar digitalisation  trend as civilian actors, use similar tools, and therefore face similar security challenges. Taking into account  the recognition that they may face the same threats as civilian actors, European armed forces are increasing  and rationalise the organisation of their IR and offensive capabilities at a rather rapid pace, as witnessed by  the establishment of new cyber units and components in European armies such as Czech Republic4, Germany  and France in 2017. In this endeavour, armed forces however must address additional challenges given the  3https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing- competitiveness  4In 2018, Czech Republic published a national cyber defense strategy to increase its capabilities during the 2018-2023 period:  https://ccdcoe.org/cyber-security-strategy-documents.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://ccdcoe.org/cyber-security-strategy-documents.html  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  07  complexity and longer duration of their systems in a context of a fast-moving ICT (and cyber threat)  landscape..  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  08  1. Overview and scope of the study  Context  In 2018, ENISA is concentrating its efforts on assisting Member States with their incident response  capabilities by providing a state-of-the-art view of the CSIRT landscape and development in Europe. One of  the main objectives of this work is to further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for the CSIRT  capability development.  ENISA has a European CSIRT inventory on its public website5, providing an overview of the current situation  concerning CSIRT teams in Europe. This inventory provides a list of publicly listed incident response teams  that can be visualised via an interactive mapping tool.  The CSIRT and Incident Response (IR) fields are fast changing by nature. The current drivers of these changes  are for example:   Creation of NSA-type and or Military CSIRTs;   New types of sectoral CSIRTs are or must be created due to the NIS Directive;   Organisations like the EU itself and NATO also have their own IR-CSIRT capabilities;   In some EU member states, the National Cyber Security Centre has absorbed the National or  Governmental CSIRT(s);   The private sector and digital device manufacturers play an increasing role in incident response.  Objective of the study  The objective of this study is to help ENISA to identify and draw conclusions about the recent and current  evolution of CSIRTs and IR capabilities in Europe towards 2025. Building on the existing knowledge gathered  in the European CSIRT inventory, this study aims to dive deeper into the \"blind spots\" that may exist in this  mapping.  The specific objectives of this study are:   To do a mapping on an operational level of new and less visible CSIRTs created recently.   To investigate on a strategic and policy level what is happening across Europe and outside the EU in  order to reveal new structures that are emerging and to investigate the policies that drive these  changes.   To deliver insightful recommendations to ENISA capturing the key aspects of a state-of-the-art view  of the CSIRT-IR landscape and development in Europe.  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  09  Scope of the work and definitions  In addition to supporting the update of the ENISA European CSIRT Inventory, this study provides data and  an analysis of the main developments in the field of Incident Response (IR) capabilities at strategic and policy  levels.  The analysis focuses on providing insights on whether cooperation between the different players – in  particular CSIRTs – is spontaneous or driven by regulation.  The prospective vision of the analysis tries to identify the key evolutions in the CSIRT-IRC landscape within a  5-year timeframe.  Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) landscape  “A CSIRT is a team of IT security experts whose main business is to respond to computer security incidents. It  provides the necessary services to handle them and support their constituents to recover from breaches”6.  Other widely accepted terms exist for CSIRTs, such as CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team), IRT  (Incident Response Team), CIRT (Computer Incident Response Team) or SERT (Security Emergency Response  Team).  This study extends the concept of CSIRT to cover formal entities performing this work, but not necessarily  called CSIRT. The objective is to capture the latest trends in this field by also covering the most recent and  emerging entities created which provide similar core services and coordinate the effort to respond to cyber  threat.  The landscape focuses on entities operating on a large scale (countrywide capabilities, bigger players) and  in strategic sectors. In this study, the concept of ‘strategic sectors’ covers:   The seven sectors identified in the NIS Directive: healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial  market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and water supply.   Sectors directly related to national security and sovereignty: defence, justice and security.  The geographical focus of the CSIRT landscape is on the European Union (EU) Member States and the  remaining European countries in Continental Europe (i.e. the Balkan region, the countries applying for EU  membership).  Incident Response (IR) Capabilities  Incident response and management is the protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an incident response process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications,  management oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and then effectively contain the damage,  eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems7.  6 A step-by-step approach on how to set-up a CSIRT, ENISA, 2006.  7 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  10  This study focuses on the current and future dynamics in the field of IR capabilities in Europe at a strategic  and policy level. As with the CSIRT landscape, the research and analysis focus on strategic and sovereign  sectors, and also includes international players such as NATO  The geographical focus in on the EU Member States and on the regions influencing or being influenced by  the European Union legislation in this domain.

Methodology and data collection  Step 1 – Identification of CSIRT inventory’s mapping of blind spots  The ENISA’s inventory tool was used as the starting point to identify blind spots to avoid duplication of efforts  when researching and analysing new entities. In addition to addressing the specific objectives of the study,  the following blind sports were proposed and validated with ENISA at the beginning of the work:    Constituency type: among the 344 CSIRTS identified, there was a majority of Commercial Sector,  NREN, Governmental sector and Financial sector CSIRTs, while entities in Military organisations,  CIP/CIIP sector, Law enforcement agencies, and non-commercial organisations were less  represented;   Geographical coverage: 15 Member States had less than 8 CSIRTs identified in the inventory.  o All EU Members States have a national and/or government CSIRT  o No EU Member State has CSIRTs for all critical sectors  o 3 Member States have a CSIRT for the energy sector (Poland, Italy, and Austria)  o 13 Member States have a CSIRT for the financial sector (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, and the UK)  o 10 Member States have a CSIRT focusing on Critical Information Protection and / or Critical  Information and Infrastructure protection (Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,  Slovakia, Spain, and the UK)  Step 2 – Definition of data classification criteria  This step was dedicated to building an analysis grid to be used to classify the newly identified CSIRTs, by  defining a set of analysis criteria.  The list of criteria was defined:   Using the criteria of the ENISA CSIRT inventory: Country, CSIRT/Team name, Constituency, Contact.   Adding additional criteria pertaining to the specific data sought in the context of this study (e.g.  cooperation aspects, date of creation, etc.).  A list of criteria was also established for the collection of data pertaining to the IRC.  This step was conducted in close cooperation with the ENISA team to collect criteria that seemed important  to them.  For detailed information on the selected criteria, see part 5.1 on Data classification and structuring.  Step 3 – Design of the data classification grid  During this step, the research team used the pre-defined classification criteria and the validated blind spots  to build an analysis grid. The purpose of this analysis grid was to:  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  12   To facilitate the data collection step by focusing the research work on the key topics of interest for  ENISA;   To present the raw data in a structured way.  Step 4 - Data collection  This step consisted in conducting a literature review to identify relevant resources to collect data on new  CSIRTs and recent trends in the field of IRC. The research methodology was lean, efficient, and employed  techniques to ensure an incremental data collection and research process.  The following resources were used:   Policy documents;   White papers and national security strategies;   Publicly available reports from CSIRT’s, National Cybersecurity Centres, Ministries and  regional/international organisations;   Operational and strategical Publications from research centres and academia;   Publications from subject matter experts.  During a preliminary data collection phase, the relevant data were gathered in the data classification grid by  a first team of analysts.  The preliminary data was then validated and further enriched by a second team of analysts.  Step 5 – Raw Data Analysis and trends evaluation  The methodology used in this step was based on a qualitative use of the Delphi Method8, which ensures  that the data collection team and the data analysis team benefit from and build on each other’s expertise,  and that the final analysis addresses all aspects of the request presented in a concise, coherent and  comprehensive way.  “The Delphi method is a structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic,  interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of analysts. The analysts answer questionnaires in at  least two rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts’ forecasts  from the previous round. Thus, analysts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies  of other members of the panel. It is believed that during this process, the range of the answers will decrease  and the group will converge towards the \"correct\" answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a pre-defined  stop criterion (e.g. number of rounds, achievement of consensus, and stability of results).\"9  Relying on the expertise of senior experts and analysts, the Delphi method was applied in a qualitative way  to ensure that these different areas of expertise contributed to a comprehensive analysis. The objective was  to:   Validate that the full scope of study has been covered;  8 https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3558.html  9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method  https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3558.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  13   Validate the quality of the collected data;   Discuss emerging trends for each specific domain (CSIRTs and IRC);   Discuss the benefits of existing initiatives undertaken at the EU level in these domains;   Identify additional information and topics that should be further explored.  Environment scanning techniques were also used to identify the strategic and operational trends that will  affect CSIRT and IRC by 2025. Environmental scanning is conducted in order to:   Broaden one’s vision and perspective;   Anticipate change;   Understand emerging patterns and trends;   Inform strategic perception, thought and anticipation.  A dedicated scanning framework was set up to guide the analysis. This framework included the following  categories, such as:   Nature of the threats;   Technologies;   Legislation and regulations;   Policy actors.  These categories helped identify:   The driving forces pushing or informing the main trends in the field of CSIRT/IR;   Early signs or indicators to measure the CSIRT/IR developments;   Potential impacts on the field of CSIRT/IR.  Once these analysis methods were applied, a first version of the key findings of the study was drafted and  submitted to ENISA for validation and further discussion.  Final Reporting  This final step consisted in further developing findings of specific interest to ENISA and in drafting the final  report of the study.  Close interactions and exchanges with ENISA ensured that the final recommendations of the study were in  line with the need and expectations of ENISA.

Key findings  Finding 1 – The implementation of the NIS Directive fosters the adoption of a holistic  approach towards IR and an upward alignment of national capabilities  As highlighted in the recently published United Nations e-government survey 201810, all European countries  have cybersecurity legislation and regulations in place.  Figure 1 - Total number of Member States with laws related to cybercrime in 2017 (Source: UN)  The mapping and analysis of some of the recent updates of some Member States’ national cybersecurity  strategies and the NIS Directive's transposition into national law – some of them presented in the table  below – show a harmonisation in terms of strategic objectives, structures and practices in the fields of IR  and CSIRTs.  Concerning international and European cooperation, national cybersecurity agencies – an increasing number  of them integrating the national and governmental CSIRTs into their organisation – tend to play a central  role.  10 https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018  https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  15  MEMBER STATES IR AND CSIRT RELATED ASPECTS  Bulgaria: (Draft) Law on  Cybersecurity11  Organisation, management and control of cybersecurity incident  response;  Designation of competent authorities in the field of cybersecurity, as  well as their functions;  Designation of competent authorities regulating the activities  necessary measures to achieve a high level of network security and  information systems.  Cyprus: Security of  Networks and  Information Systems Law  Creation of a National Digital Security Authority (NDSA);  Inauguration of the Cyprus national CSIRT (CSIRT-CY) on 25 June 2018,  which will be part of the NDSA;  CSIRT-CY was established with the support of the ITU;  CSIRT-CY is responsible for responding to incidents in all critical  infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus, such as the energy and  water providers, ports, hospitals and financial institutions;  Until 2018, there was no national computer-related incident response  organisation with operational ability and the establishment of a  national CSIRT was a long overdue  CSIRT-CY has managed to secure EC CEF funding for further  enhancements in 2019.  Estonia: Cyber Security  Act  The national cybersecurity agency (RIA) is assigned the central role of  organising cybersecurity at the state level;  RIA is assigned the function of the cyber incident resolution unit;  RIA fulfils the role of international point of contact, and is responsible  for coordinating cross-border exchanges of information and IR  measures taken at the EU level.  Italy: NIS Directive  Implementing Decree  Identification of the NIS competent Authorities and their respective  tasks;  Replacement of the national CSIRT by merging the national CERT-N  (Private sector) and the CERT-PA (Public Administration);  Reinforcement of the cooperation both at national and at EU levels.  Netherlands: National  Cyber Security Agenda  (NCSA) 2018  The incident response capabilities of the intelligence and security  services, Defence Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Rijkswaterstaat  (Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management) are  being enhanced to be able to deal with ICT breaches that threaten  national security;  11 https://www.e-gov.bg/bg/212  https://www.e-gov.bg/bg/212  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  16  Situational awareness at the national level will be enhanced by the  creation of a cooperation platform to offer more information and a  swifter perspective for action with relevant organisations.  United Kingdom: NIS  Regulations 2018  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC – part of GCHQ) acts as the  UK’s CSIRT and as the UK’s single point of contact;  NCSC remit is to provide support, expert advice and incident response  assistance, and to develop cybersecurity guidance and standards, as  well as holding an advisory role in relation to UK CSIRTs;  In 2018, NCSC produced guidance and developed a framework, which  supports the assessment of the level of cybersecurity achieved by OES  in relation to NIS requirements.  These recent policy and regulatory orientations do not however indicate if this harmonisation of legislations  will lead to an actual harmonisation and upgrade of the actual national IR capacities.  As illustrated in the table above, the implementation of the NIS Directive varies from one country to another,  based on the experience of the country in the domain of cybersecurity and the degree of maturity of its  national incident response capabilities, in particular CSIRT.  With much of the detailed application of the NIS Directive left to national implementing laws, there is a risk  of fragmentation in terms of capabilities and of lack of visibility of the newly created national CSIRT and its  actual capabilities. Their role and scope of action vary from one country to the other, and affect the  cooperation with national law enforcement, judicial and military bodies.  As an example, the UK NCSC acts as the UK’s CSIRT under the NIS regulation and will have a significant  supporting and advisory role in providing IRC to cyber-attacks; however ultimate authority and responsibility  for any regulatory decision with regard to cybersecurity in a specific sector lie solely with the competent  sectoral authority.  Furthermore, since the NIS directive is a recent regulation, its full implementation will take time, and some  countries still lack maturity and capacities in the field of IR.  At national level, there is also a strong trend of private-public partnerships, which seems to be a key success  factor of IR. A recent example is the Belgian Cyber Security Coalition12 set up in 2015, which brings together  cybersecurity specialists from government organisations, companies and academia with a view to improving  the protection of government organisations, the business world and private citizens against cybercrime in  Belgium. To this end, the Coalition counts on the exchange of experiences between members as well as  publications offering advice to companies and awareness campaigns aimed at the general public. The  Coalition is also set to advise the government and the business world in drawing up guidelines on to  cybersecurity.  12 https://www.cybersecuritycoalition.be  https://www.cybersecuritycoalition.be/  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  17  Finding 2 – The NIS Directive may have a positive effect at the international level and  provides the EU with a status of ‘norm setter’  In Europe's neighbouring regions and to a lesser extent internationally, there is an emerging trend of  harmonization of domestic legal directives and regulations with the ones created by the EU. As in the recent  case of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the impact of the NIS Directive outside the EU  may illustrate the ability of the EU:   To develop political and normative consensus between countries on security-related issues;   To act as a standard-setter in cybersecurity.  This leading role relates to areas such as data protection, privacy and transparency, e.g. by setting incident  reporting obligations.  Some candidate countries for EU membership, in particular in the Balkans, have increased their  cybersecurity legislation in recent years with specific references to the NIS Directive and relevant EU  regulations.  Serbia, which was officially granted candidate country status for EU membership in 2012, provides an  interesting illustrative case:  in the process of developing its national information security regulatory  framework – and more specifically in its Law on Information Security adopted in 20161314 - Serbia takes into  account existing EU legislation. Referring to European standards and directives, the Law introduced the  National Centre for the Prevention of Security Risks in ICT Systems (National CERT), the CERT republic  authorities, and the possibility of establishing special centres for the prevention of security risks in the ICT  systems (Special CERT)15.  Beyond candidate countries, Ukraine also provides a recent case of national cybersecurity regulations  influenced by European standards. Its 2016 National Cybersecurity Strategy16 acknowledges that “the  primary concerns of development of secure, stable and reliable cyberspace are to be as follows:  - Formation and operational adaptation of state cybersecurity policy on the cyberspace development,  achieving compatibility with the relevant EU and NATO standards;  - Creating a national regulatory framework and term base in this area, harmonization of regulatory  documents for electronic communications, information protection, information security and  cybersecurity in accordance with international standards and standards of the EU and NATO”.  While highlighting the different approaches adopted by the United States (U.S.) and the EU in their  endeavour to strengthen cyber-resilience, the reactions in the U.S. to the GDPR and the NIS Directive also  suggest an increasing interest towards EU-led initiatives. The primary reason is that U.S. private companies  doing business or with subsidiaries in the EU will have to update their cybersecurity practices and policies to  ensure compliance with these new and expanding legal requirements. It is worth noting that lessons from  NIS Directive compliance and from a more binding approach to cybersecurity will also be carefully assessed  13 http://mtt.gov.rs/en/releases-and-announcements/two-laws-adopted-on-advertising-and-information-security/  14 https://www.amcham.rs/upload/Zakon%20o%20informacionoj%20bezbednosti.pdf  15 http://www.ubs-asb.com/Portals/0/Casopis/2017/4/UBS-Bankarstvo-4-2017-DarkoSehovic.pdf  16 https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy_Ukraine.pdf  http://mtt.gov.rs/en/releases-and-announcements/two-laws-adopted-on-advertising-and-information-security/ https://www.amcham.rs/upload/Zakon%20o%20informacionoj%20bezbednosti.pdf http://www.ubs-asb.com/Portals/0/Casopis/2017/4/UBS-Bankarstvo-4-2017-DarkoSehovic.pdf https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy_Ukraine.pdf  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  18  by U.S. stakeholders, while experts judge that ‘the likelihood of the US government adopting similar  legislation grows’17.  Finding 3 – IR capability developments of national administrations and operators of  essential services emphasize the relevance of collaboration at national and  European level  The above-mentioned  (3.1) United Nations e-government survey 201818 identifies Europe as the region in  the world with the highest presence of national, government and sectoral CSIRTs.  Figure 2 - Regional view of  CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  In the EU, operators of essential services in the seven sectors identified in the NIS Directive as well as national  administration are accelerating their efforts to build or upgrade their IRC. This effort includes the  development of sector-specific IR collaboration mechanisms and fora, both at an EU and national level.  At national level, the trend towards sector-specific IRC may cause a reorganisation of IR cooperation towards  a vertical model (rather than a horizontal and centralized model built around the national CSIRT).  Strengthening IR capability development of operators of essential services  The NIS Directive states “Member States shall ensure that operators of essential services take appropriate  and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of  network and information systems which they use in their operations”19. This requirement is in continuity –  17 https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/while-everyone-was-focused-on-gdpr-the-nis-directive-snuck-in-through-the-back- door/?ref=techi.com  18 https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018  19 Chapter IV, Article 14 - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/while-everyone-was-focused-on-gdpr-the-nis-directive-snuck-in-through-the-back-door/?ref=techi.com https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/while-everyone-was-focused-on-gdpr-the-nis-directive-snuck-in-through-the-back-door/?ref=techi.com https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  19  and is an additional catalyst – of a strong trend in which operators of essential services set up a CSIRT within  their organisation.  The table below presents a few examples of recent teams created in recent months.

For  example, a German company created a CERT called CERT@VDE20, specifically dedicated to small and  medium-sized enterprises (SME) and with a focus on Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0.  There are, however, different levels of maturity in the IRC domain from one sector to another. On the one  hand, highly digitalized sectors such as banking and finance appear very mature, in particular when it comes  international and European cooperation. On the other hand, more traditional industrial sectors such as  transport and energy rely on heavy industrial systems, which are more vulnerable because they have not  been designed to deal with malicious acts. This is also due to the fact that the lifetime of their operational  facilities is often very long (more than 10 or 15 years) and need to adapt to the extremely short cycles of  Information Technology, lest they accumulate vulnerabilities due to the obsolescence of their IT layer.  An example of these capability gaps is given by a 2017 report published by the Vlaams Nederlandse Delta  (VNDELTA), pointing out that “few organisations have dedicated IT security staff and none have a mature  security incident detection and response team” in the ports of the Belgo-Dutch provinces, including major  ports such as Rotterdam21.  Initiating collaboration at national, regional and a European level  Acknowledging the growing interdependencies between their infrastructures and services, existing and  recently established CSIRTs of operators of essential services place collaboration at national, a regional and  European level among their key strategic objectives.  At national level, sharing information and reports with other CSIRTs, facilitating contact with appropriate  law enforcement agencies, and participating in national emergency and crisis exercises are the common  objectives of all CSIRTs. At sector level, CSIRTs provide awareness raising and information sharing services  rather than incident response capabilities, with several ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres)  already in place.  However, as illustrated in the two examples presented below, there is an emerging trend, which sees actors,  and CSIRTs in the same sector go beyond information sharing to organise and pool IR capabilities.  In this regard, one should consider the cases of Member States (such as France), who already established  some sector-specific cooperation schemes that may further lead to a vertical organisation of IRC. While  national governmental CERTs have traditionally played a central role in coordinating information exchange,  incident response, and capacity building in the different sectors of the economy, the increasing needs and  numbers of actors impose a more vertical organisation for each sector. The challenge in this context is to  avoid organisational silos as well as excessive disparities among actors.  National level  A pioneering initiative in this regard is the Austrian Energy CERT22, which became operational in 2017. It may  provide a positive role model for establishing cooperation mechanisms in the energy sector at the EU level.  The creation of this CERT is one of the main outcomes of a public-private partnership launched in 2013 by  different players of the energy domain in Austria, with the objective of improving understanding and  20 https://cert.vde.com/de-de  21 http://www.vndelta.eu/files/3215/1125/0649/Cyber_Security_in_Ports_Whitepaper_VND_vonference_november_2017.pdf  22 https://www.energy-cert.at/de/  https://cert.vde.com/de-de http://www.vndelta.eu/files/3215/1125/0649/Cyber_Security_in_Ports_Whitepaper_VND_vonference_november_2017.pdf https://www.energy-cert.at/de/  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  21  addressing common security risks and interdependencies23. Twenty companies are currently directly  involved in CERT Energy and two national professional associations, which played an important role in the  setting up the CERT, represent other smaller players. The basic services of the CERT have been fully  operational for one year and include:   Establishing situation reports and alerting members in case of crisis,   Supporting the incident management of one of the members with centralised IRC,   Improving the capacities of the members through common exercises and training,   Establishing security concepts, and increasing risk awareness at multiple levels, in particular for top  management.  The experience of the Austrian Energy CERT has shown that the main benefit of pooling and sharing IRC is  enabling information sharing and collaboration among trusted actors. Beyond the national scene and in the  context of the NIS Directive, the Energy CERT will also facilitate the choice of a common point of contact for  the Austrian energy sector. It also facilitates collaboration with other Member States and international  organisations in the energy sector. It is however worth noting that it took about 4 years to establish the  consortium, set the common rules and agree on contractual terms.  Regional and European level  At regional level, the Nordic Financial CERT (NfCERT), founded in Oslo in June 2017, aims to strengthen the  Nordic financial industry’s resilience to cyber-attacks, by enabling Nordic financial institutions to respond  rapidly and efficiently to cybersecurity threats and online crime24. The rationale underlying the creation of  the NfCERT is that criminals do not care about borders and, therefore, there is a need to establish  information exchange about what is going on in the neighbouring countries and learn from each other.  IR capacity building actions at a regional level are also implemented by the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU), which is the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication  technologies (ICTs). As such, ITU carries out a variety of actions and activities to build and strengthen incident  response capacities at national and regional levels. The Buenos Aires Action Plan for Europe for 2018-2021  outlines the regional initiatives the ITU25. The fourth initiative, « Enhancing trust and confidence in the use  of information and communication technologies », focuses on supporting the deployment of resilient  infrastructure and secure services in Europe through:   The elaboration or review of national cybersecurity strategies   The setting up or improvement of the capacities of national CSIRTs and the building up of a  network between these structures   The organisation of simulation exercises at national and regional level  From 2013 to 2015, ITU assisted the Cyprus government to establish a national CSIRT26 (see p.11). The ITU  also conducts what is describes itself as a ‘CIRT capability assessment’. Again, according to ITU on its  23 This information is taken from a presentation given at the ‘Cybersecurity in the Energy Sector #CySecEn  High-level conference’ on 11 October 2018 by the European Commission and the Austrian Presidency -  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/programme_-_high_level_conference_cybersecurity.pdf  24 https://www.nfcert.org  25 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Publications/Brochure%20Regional_Initiaitves_EUROPE-  E.pdf  26 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/projects/display.asp?ProjectNo=9CYP13001  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/programme_-_high_level_conference_cybersecurity.pdf https://www.nfcert.org/ https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Publications/Brochure%20Regional_Initiaitves_EUROPE-E.pdf https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Publications/Brochure%20Regional_Initiaitves_EUROPE-E.pdf https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/projects/display.asp?ProjectNo=9CYP13001  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  22  website27 the aim of this is ‘to define the readiness to implement a national CIRT’. However, there is no  detailed information available on what this means and no mapping or comparison is possible with other  assessments like the one provided by ENISA28. In Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), 8  countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, have been evaluated: Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,  Cyprus, Macedonia, Monaco, Montenegro, Serbia. Within the ITU, the Telecommunication Development  Bureau (BDT) organizes ITU ALERT (Applied Learning for Emergency Response Teams), a capacity building  exercise targeted at national CSIRTs, public institutions, telecommunication operators and the academia.  ITU ALERT for Europe Region will be held from 26-30 November in Cyprus29.  Finding 4 – Successful cooperation initiatives in the field of IRC at an international  level are driven by public-private partnerships  On the international stage, two main kind of initiatives were identified pertaining to cooperation in the field  of IRC and cybersecurity to a larger extent: cooperation between global economic actors of the same sector,  and digital diplomacy.  What these initiatives have in common is that they illustrate:   More public-private partnerships in the field of cybersecurity are necessary at the international  level, although security is a sovereign domain;   Addressing digital security indeed requires involving technology giants owning the digital  infrastructures and data;   Sovereign states show an unwillingness to agree on binding measures to regulate their behaviours  and favour a voluntary approach.  1) There have been a number of international cooperation initiatives between global actors of a specific  critical sector. In March 2018, a group of financial services experts, convened by the World Economic  Forum, proposed 19 solutions for systemic cybersecurity threats in the financial sector. The objective is  to provide a toolkit to identify cyber-risk management improvements in an innovative and fast-changing  environment through public-private partnerships as well as concrete examples of how the framework  can be applied in practice30. This is another example of the leading role played by the financial sector,  whose players increasingly link technology companies to their system infrastructure – either voluntarily  or because of regulation such as the European Union’s Payment Services Directive 2 – making it crucial  to have reliable cybersecurity.  2) On a diplomatic and geopolitical level, a proposal to regulate state behaviours in cyberspace has long  been discussed in the framework of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) on  Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International  Security, to address tangible gaps in the existing legal framework. This work has however achieved  limited results, mainly due to the non-binding nature of these norms and the reluctance of some  countries to regulate their own governmental activities in cyberspace. Interestingly the non-binding  27 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/national-CIRT.aspx  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  29 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Pages/Events/2018/CYBDRILL/ITU-ALERT-Cyber-drill.aspx  30 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cyber_Risk_to_Customer_Data.pdf  https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/national-CIRT.aspx https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Pages/Events/2018/CYBDRILL/ITU-ALERT-Cyber-drill.aspx http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cyber_Risk_to_Customer_Data.pdf  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  23  norms drafted by the states are similar to the principles initially proposed by Microsoft. It indeed appears  that while the achievements of the UNGGE are limited, numerous initiatives have been launched in  recent years by states, companies and international organisations: the Microsoft Tech Accord31 and call  for a Digital Geneva Convention, the Siemens “Charter of Trust”32, and the work of the Global  Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace33 (GCSC). These initiatives highlight the importance of  bringing together public and private actors to tackle the challenge of security on the international stage.  On the 12th November 2018 at the UNESCO Internet Governance Forum (IGF), President Emmanuel  Macron launched the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace34. This high-level declaration on  developing common principles for securing cyberspace has received the backing of States, as well as  private companies and civil society organizations.  31 https://cybertechaccord.org  32 https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/cybersecurity-charter-of- trust.html  33 https://cyberstability.org/about/  34 https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber- security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in  https://cybertechaccord.org/ https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/cybersecurity-charter-of-trust.html https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/cybersecurity-charter-of-trust.html https://cyberstability.org/about/ https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber-security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber-security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  24  Finding 5 – There is an important development of IR services in the European private  sector, however new vulnerabilities tend to target the hardware layer of devices  manufactured outside Europe  On the longer term, the NIS Directive also aims to stimulate the competitiveness and innovation capacities  of the digital industry in Europe by increasing the demand for cybersecurity and to support the development  of a sustained supply of innovative cybersecurity products and services in Europe35.  In this regard, the mapping of recently created CSIRTs tends to show that the development of IR capability  – in particular for operators of essential sectors - also relies on managed detection and response (MDR)  services provided by commercial organisations. This offer aims to remove the burden of having to figure out  ‘what method or device to use’ for an incident monitoring and response capability. MDR services includes  security monitoring and alerting, and remote incident management. According to Gartner, the global MDR  market came to approximately 100 million dollars in 2017 (a 15% increase compared to 2016).  In the ENISA European CSIRT inventory, commercial organisations are the most represented constituency. It  seems therefore that the NIS Directive and the overall recent increase in requirements may have a positive  effect on the European private sector by stimulating the supply of innovative cybersecurity services and  products.  Another interesting trend is to be considered. The concept of ‘cybersecurity-by-design’ is being widely  promoted, but its implementation is still below the expected considering the growing number of  vulnerabilities found a patched by digital devices providers and hardware manufacturers every year. As  pointed out in this ENISA info note36, the number of disclosed vulnerabilities each year keeps on growing at  a high rate. As also stated in the same info note, there are now also important vulnerabilities identified  within the hardware layer. The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities revealed in early 2018 illustrate this  trend:  Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors37. These hardware  vulnerabilities allow programmes to steal data, which is being processed on the computer. Even though  there are still fare more vulnerabilities being identified in the software layer, the ones like Meltdown and  Spectre that target the hardware layer are much harder to mitigate, as clearly stated in this38 ENISA info  note: ‘In the realm of the security vs performance discussion, whatever the opinion is, ultimately confirms  that microprocessor manufacturers need to identify new ways to address these issues or vulnerabilities will  continue to occur: manufacturers will continue to announce improved performances, and be forced to patch  those after release’. In 2016, ENISA published a Hardware Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide on this  topic39.  Other types of attacks targeting the hardware layer are the so-called ‘Supply Chain Attacks’40 and attacks  directed at Industrial Control Systems (ICS)41,  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing- competitiveness  36 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/is-software-more-vulnerable-today  37 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/meltdown-and-spectre-critical-processor-vulnerabilities  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/security-vs-performance-discussion-with-the-return-of- 201cspectrum201d-vulnerability  39 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape  40 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain-attacks-back-on-the-agenda  41 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/maturity-levels  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/is-software-more-vulnerable-today https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/meltdown-and-spectre-critical-processor-vulnerabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/security-vs-performance-discussion-with-the-return-of-201cspectrum201d-vulnerability https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/security-vs-performance-discussion-with-the-return-of-201cspectrum201d-vulnerability https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain-attacks-back-on-the-agenda https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/maturity-levels  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  25  In this context, device manufacturers develop their own CSIRTs, sometimes called PSIRT (Product Security  Incident Response Team): IBM, Cisco, Huawei etc. This offer will most likely expand, as the IoT is constantly  expanding, touching the daily lives of most citizens through smartphones, smart devices and the  digitalization of everyday objects. Recently, a group of vendors proposed a cyber-risk management turnkey  solution: Apple, Cisco, Allianz and Aon launched an integrated solution to manage risks associated with  ransomware and other malware, which includes software and communication technologies, devices, and  insurance coverage42.  These trends raise a question pertaining to the benefit of both national/governmental CSIRTs and European  cybersecurity services providers in the IR value chain, and their ability to play a central role should  vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks directly affect devices.  It would therefore be interesting to further study the impact of the NIS Directive on the European  cybersecurity industry, to further analyse if the growing demand (from regulators) for security is met by  European actors or by foreign companies, primarily the United States and other regions where the main  manufacturers of hardware are located.  Finding 6 – Military players tend to follow the same dynamics as the civilian sector  when developing their IR capabilities  IR capacity building in European armed forces  As demonstrated by the growing number of cyber defence commands in European armies, cybersecurity is  now considered as an integral component of modern defence. While the nature and the constrained  environment in which armed forces operate impose a higher level of resilience, forces are going through a  digitalization trend similar to that observed in the world because they are using similar tools, and are  therefore facing similar security issues.  This situation is even more interesting since armed forces have long thought they were untouchable to a  certain degree as they use specific and isolated networks, procedures and tools.  This changing situation can be illustrated by the following examples:   In 2009, the Conficker computer worm infected the French Navy computer network.   The newest Royal Navy aircraft carrier is equipped with the 2001 Windows XP OS, which was ‘state- of-the-art’ when the HMS programme was launched43. This OS was targeted by the WannaCry  ransomware attack in May 2017 that disrupted public administrations and companies worldwide.  According to a report by The Guardian newspaper, some Windows XP incidents were spotted on  the ship's computers.   In September 2018, the U.S. Senate released a report demonstrating to what extent the U.S. armed  forces struggled and often failed to incorporate cybersecurity into key aspects of their processes  and systems and stating how easy it was for cybersecurity test teams to compromise these  systems44.  42 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3254527/security/apple-cisco-aon-and-allianz-partner-in-cyber-risk-management.html  43 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/27/hms-queen-elizabeth-royal-navy-vulnerable-cyber-attack.  44  https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf  https://www.csoonline.com/article/3254527/security/apple-cisco-aon-and-allianz-partner-in-cyber-risk-management.html https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/27/hms-queen-elizabeth-royal-navy-vulnerable-cyber-attack https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  26  There is therefore a structural difficulty for armed forces to ensure the cybersecurity of their digitalized  systems, given the complexity of these systems and their lifecycle in a context of a fast-moving ICT (and  cyber threat) landscape.  Recognising that they may face the same threats as civilian actors, European armed forces are increasing  their IR and offensive capabilities of at a rather rapid pace.  As an example, the German government agreed on 29 august 2018 to create a Federal Agency for Innovation  in Cyber defence45 to develop cutting-edge defence technology and state-of-the-art offensive capabilities.  In the Czech Republic, the creation of a National Cyber Forces Centre46 (NCFC) was initiated in 2016 and this  new capacity should be operational in 2020.  In France, a Cyber Defence Command47 (COMCYBER), placed under the authority of the Chief of the Defence  Staff, gathers as of 1 January 2017 all cyber defence forces of the French armed forces under the same  operational, permanent and joint authority.  While there is little information available in open source on these recently created or strengthened military  capabilities, it also creates a significant demand for IT experts and specialists that armed force are struggling  to address.  IR cooperation at international and European level  Military cooperation in the field of cybersecurity takes place in the framework of both NATO and the  European Union.  1) NATO-own IR capabilities are limited and depend on Allies' capabilities, except the NATO Computer  Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which is the IR team for NATO infrastructure itself. As such, NATO  action focuses more on operational cooperation and interoperability between Allies' capacities during  operations.  At its Brussels Summit in 2018, Allies agreed to set up a new Cyberspace Operations Centre as part of  NATO’s strengthened Command Structure, to be fully operational in 2023. When fully operational, the  centre aims to coordinate NATO’s cyber deterrent through a 70-strong team of experts. However, it is  still uncertain whether this would lead to providing NATO with its own capability or only integrating  Allies’ national cyber capabilities into NATO missions48.  The approach towards cybersecurity promoted by NATO is that standards are increasingly decided by  the industrial actors, and decreasingly by states, as evidenced by the decision to downscale its  standardisation body from an agency (NSA) to a mere office (NSO) in 2014. As highlighted in a recent  report by the European Parliament, NATO recognizes that “Technological innovations and expertise from  the private sector are crucial to enable Allied countries to mount an effective cyber-defence. Industry is  the main supplier of hardware and software used by the military staff, also for operations”. This led NATO  to launch the Industry Cyber Partnership in 2014.  45 https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2018/08/cyberagentur.html  46 https://www.govcert.cz/download/gov-cert/container-nodeid-578/ap-cs-2015-2020-en.pdf  47 http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/163003632.html  48 http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/here-s-why-nato-s-cyber-operations-center-is-a-big-deal and  https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-2018-nato-summit-accomplish-respect-cyber-issues  https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2018/08/cyberagentur.html https://www.govcert.cz/download/gov-cert/container-nodeid-578/ap-cs-2015-2020-en.pdf http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/163003632.html http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/here-s-why-nato-s-cyber-operations-center-is-a-big-deal https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-2018-nato-summit-accomplish-respect-cyber-issues  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  27  2) At the EU level, two of the 17 projects approved in the framework of the Permanent Structured  Cooperation (PESCO) tackle cyber defence and IRC:  a. The first, led by Lithuania, aims to establish an EU Cyber Rapid Response Force. So far, 7  countries have signed the Declaration of intent49.  b. The second, led by Greece, aims to create a Cyber Threats and Incident Response Information  Sharing Platform.  However, these initiatives are recent and limited information is available to evaluate operational  cooperation at the European level in the field of IRC and its tangible impact. While highlighting the  current political will to lay the foundation for joint and stronger European cyber defence capabilities,  their implementation will measure the ability to build common capabilities and a common capacity  to act beyond joint training.  49 https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/economic-relations-connectivity-innovation/47525/new-tool-address-cyber-threats-eus-rapid- response-force_en  https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/economic-relations-connectivity-innovation/47525/new-tool-address-cyber-threats-eus-rapid-response-force_en https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/economic-relations-connectivity-innovation/47525/new-tool-address-cyber-threats-eus-rapid-response-force_en  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  28  4.

Conclusion  This study has sought to collect data about and identify recent and current evolution of CSIRTs and Incident  Response (IR) capabilities in Europe towards 2025 at a strategic and policy level.  Mapping on an operational level of new and less visible CSIRTs created recently  These trends and findings were identified by mapping new and less visible CSIRTs recently created, and  eighty-one (81) CSIRTs were identified and analysed.  The collected data shows an increasing number of sectoral CSIRTs being created in the EU by public and  private organisation operating essential services. In this regard, the important number of cybersecurity  regulations in the EU appears as a key factor of this important cybersecurity capacity effort.  There are, however, different levels of maturity in the IRC domain from one sector to another. On the one  hand, highly digitalized sectors such as banking and finance appears very mature, in particular when it comes  to international and European cooperation. On the other hand, more traditional industrial sectors such as  transport and energy rely on heavy physical infrastructures, which are more vulnerable because they have  not been built with cyber security features by design and imply important investments to be protected.  The mapping and analysis of recent updates of some Member States’ national cybersecurity strategies and  the NIS Directive's transposition into national law also show a harmonisation in terms of strategic objectives,  structures and practices in the fields of IR and CSIRTs.  With much of the detailed application of the NIS Directive left to national implementing laws, there is  however still a risk of fragmentation in terms of actual capabilities.  Emerging structures and trends at a strategic and policy level, and the policies driving these changes.  On a strategic and policy level, the analysis of a corpus of 36 strategic and regulatory documents enabled  the analysis of what is happening across and outside the EU in order, in particular with the NIS Directive  This analysis shows that existing and recently established CSIRTs, in particular for those of operators of  essential services, place collaboration at national, a regional and European level among their key strategic  objectives.  The data also shows and recalls that cybersecurity is – to a large extent – driven by regulations51. In this  regard, the NIS Directive and the GDPR play a key role in constraining actors to upscale their cybersecurity  capabilities and standards, as well as increase their cooperation with other players.  At an international level, the lack of harmonised means and practices among countries in the cyberspace is  mainly due to the absence of binding norms regulating their activities. The current effort made by the UN to  agree on common regulations also supports the assumption that without the legal constraint, actors may be  less willing to cooperate in the field of cybersecurity.  51 See for instance the 2017 CXP Group analysis of cybersecurity key trends for 2017: https://www.pac- online.com/download/26609/187191  https://www.pac-online.com/download/26609/187191 https://www.pac-online.com/download/26609/187191  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  33  In Europe, the identified successful bottom-up driven collaboration – be it a national (Austrian Energy CERT)  or regional (Nordic Financial CERT - NfCERT) - however shows the increasing awareness of market players of  their interdependencies due to their digitalized infrastructures and services. These examples remind that  there has been for many years voluntary information sharing among CSIRT community in Europe.

Conclusion 32  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  05  Executive Summary  This study details trends about the recent and current evolution of CSIRTs and Incident Response (IR)  capabilities in Europe towards 2025 at a strategic and policy level. As stressed in the 2016 Directive  concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the  Union1 (NIS Directive), CSIRTs play a vital role in cyber resilience in a context of increasing dependency on  digital infrastructures. They perform an important function throughout the crisis management process, from  identifying security incidents, protecting organisations against attacks, disseminating information on threats  and recovering from incidents. The analysis framework included the following aspects:   Technology trends   Legal and regulatory landscape   Actors at the policy, strategic and operational levels   Changing threat environment.  These trends and findings were identified by mapping new and less visible CSIRTs recently created and by  investigating policies across Europe and their impact outside Europe. Eighty-one (81) new CSIRTs were  identified and a corpus of 36 policy, regulatory, and strategic documents related to the development of  cyber incident response capabilities were analysed. An overview of the findings of the raw data is presented  in Chapter 4.  Finding 1 – The implementation of the NIS Directive fosters the adoption of a holistic approach towards  IR and an upward alignment of national capabilities  The recent updates of some Member States’ national cybersecurity strategies and of the transposition into  national law of the NIS Directive show a harmonisation in terms of strategic objectives, structures and  practices in the fields of IR and CSIRTs. With regard to international and European cooperation, the national  cybersecurity agencies – an increasing number of them integrating the national/governmental CSIRT in their  organization – tend to play a central role. With much of the detailed application of the NIS Directive left to  the national implementing laws of Member States, there remains a risk of fragmentation in terms of  capabilities. The role and scope of action of CSIRTs may indeed also vary from one country to the other.  Finding 2 - The NIS Directive may have a positive effect at the international level and provides the EU with  a status of ‘norm setter’  In Europe's neighbouring regions and to a lesser extent internationally, there is an emerging trend of  harmonization of domestic legal frameworks with the EU legal framework in the field of cybersecurity.  Together with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)2 implemented since May 2018, the impact  of the NIS Directive outside the EU may illustrate the ability of the EU to reach political and normative  consensus between nations on cybersecurity-related issues, and to act as a standard setter in areas such as  data protection, privacy and transparency.  Finding 3 – IR capability development of national administration and operators of essential services  emphasizes the relevance of collaboration at national and European level  1 Directive (EU) 2016/1148 - http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 - http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/2016-05-04  http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/2016-05-04  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  06  Operators of essential services in the seven sectors identified in the NIS Directive, as well as national  administrations, accelerate their effort to build or upgrade their IRC. This effort includes the development  of sector-specific CSIRTs and IR collaboration mechanisms and fora, both at EU and national levels. At a  national level, the growing number of sector-specific and sector-wide CSIRTs could initiate a move towards  the organisation of IR cooperation according to a vertical model, as a complement to the horizontal and  centralized model built around the national government CSIRTs.  Finding 4 - Successful cooperation initiatives in the field of Incident Response Capabilities at an  international level are driven by public-private partnerships  On the international stage, two main kinds of cooperation initiatives were identified in the field of IRC and  cybersecurity at large: cooperation among global actors of the same sector, and the effort of the  international community to address the international challenges of digital technology and security. These  initiatives show a move toward more public-private partnerships in the field of cybersecurity is necessary at  the international level, although security is a sovereign domain and states are reluctant to agree on binding  measures. Addressing digital security indeed requires involving technology giants to define common norms  in the governance of digital infrastructures and data.  Finding 5 – There is an important development of IR services in the European private sector; however,  new vulnerabilities tend to target the hardware layer of devices manufactured outside Europe  In the longer term, the NIS Directive also has the objective to stimulate the competitiveness and innovation  capacities of the digital industry in Europe by increasing the demand for cybersecurity and to support the  development of a sustained supply of innovative cybersecurity products and services in Europe3. It seems  that the NIS Directive and the overall recent increase in security requirements may have a positive effect on  the European private sector by stimulating the supply of innovative cybersecurity services and products.  However, supply chain attacks and the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities suggest that new vulnerabilities  and the corresponding threats are surfacing within the hardware layer. The difficulties associated with  detecting and mitigating these types of vulnerabilities raises a question on the role and benefit of both  national governmental CSIRTs and European cybersecurity services providers in the IR value chain, should  vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks increasingly affect devices directly in the future.  Finding 6 – Acknowledging their exposure to cyber risks, military players tend to follow the same dynamics  as the civilian sector when developing their IR capabilities  As demonstrated by the growing number of cyber defence commands in European armies, cybersecurity is  now considered as an integral component of modern defence. It seems however that there are limited  specificities for the military domain in the digital era: armed forces are undergoing a similar digitalisation  trend as civilian actors, use similar tools, and therefore face similar security challenges. Taking into account  the recognition that they may face the same threats as civilian actors, European armed forces are increasing  and rationalise the organisation of their IR and offensive capabilities at a rather rapid pace, as witnessed by  the establishment of new cyber units and components in European armies such as Czech Republic4, Germany  and France in 2017. In this endeavour, armed forces however must address additional challenges given the  3https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing- competitiveness  4In 2018, Czech Republic published a national cyber defense strategy to increase its capabilities during the 2018-2023 period:  https://ccdcoe.org/cyber-security-strategy-documents.html  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://ccdcoe.org/cyber-security-strategy-documents.html  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  07  complexity and longer duration of their systems in a context of a fast-moving ICT (and cyber threat)  landscape..  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  08  1. Overview and scope of the study  Context  In 2018, ENISA is concentrating its efforts on assisting Member States with their incident response  capabilities by providing a state-of-the-art view of the CSIRT landscape and development in Europe. One of  the main objectives of this work is to further develop and apply ENISA recommendations for the CSIRT  capability development.  ENISA has a European CSIRT inventory on its public website5, providing an overview of the current situation  concerning CSIRT teams in Europe. This inventory provides a list of publicly listed incident response teams  that can be visualised via an interactive mapping tool.  The CSIRT and Incident Response (IR) fields are fast changing by nature. The current drivers of these changes  are for example:   Creation of NSA-type and or Military CSIRTs;   New types of sectoral CSIRTs are or must be created due to the NIS Directive;   Organisations like the EU itself and NATO also have their own IR-CSIRT capabilities;   In some EU member states, the National Cyber Security Centre has absorbed the National or  Governmental CSIRT(s);   The private sector and digital device manufacturers play an increasing role in incident response.  Objective of the study  The objective of this study is to help ENISA to identify and draw conclusions about the recent and current  evolution of CSIRTs and IR capabilities in Europe towards 2025. Building on the existing knowledge gathered  in the European CSIRT inventory, this study aims to dive deeper into the \"blind spots\" that may exist in this  mapping.  The specific objectives of this study are:   To do a mapping on an operational level of new and less visible CSIRTs created recently.   To investigate on a strategic and policy level what is happening across Europe and outside the EU in  order to reveal new structures that are emerging and to investigate the policies that drive these  changes.   To deliver insightful recommendations to ENISA capturing the key aspects of a state-of-the-art view  of the CSIRT-IR landscape and development in Europe.  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  09  Scope of the work and definitions  In addition to supporting the update of the ENISA European CSIRT Inventory, this study provides data and  an analysis of the main developments in the field of Incident Response (IR) capabilities at strategic and policy  levels.  The analysis focuses on providing insights on whether cooperation between the different players – in  particular CSIRTs – is spontaneous or driven by regulation.  The prospective vision of the analysis tries to identify the key evolutions in the CSIRT-IRC landscape within a  5-year timeframe.  Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) landscape  “A CSIRT is a team of IT security experts whose main business is to respond to computer security incidents. It  provides the necessary services to handle them and support their constituents to recover from breaches”6.  Other widely accepted terms exist for CSIRTs, such as CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team), IRT  (Incident Response Team), CIRT (Computer Incident Response Team) or SERT (Security Emergency Response  Team).  This study extends the concept of CSIRT to cover formal entities performing this work, but not necessarily  called CSIRT. The objective is to capture the latest trends in this field by also covering the most recent and  emerging entities created which provide similar core services and coordinate the effort to respond to cyber  threat.  The landscape focuses on entities operating on a large scale (countrywide capabilities, bigger players) and  in strategic sectors. In this study, the concept of ‘strategic sectors’ covers:   The seven sectors identified in the NIS Directive: healthcare, transport, energy, banking and financial  market infrastructure, digital infrastructure and water supply.   Sectors directly related to national security and sovereignty: defence, justice and security.  The geographical focus of the CSIRT landscape is on the European Union (EU) Member States and the  remaining European countries in Continental Europe (i.e. the Balkan region, the countries applying for EU  membership).  Incident Response (IR) Capabilities  Incident response and management is the protection of an organisation's information by developing and  implementing an incident response process (e.g. plans, defined roles, training, communications,  management oversight) in order to quickly discover an attack and then effectively contain the damage,  eradicate the attacker's presence, and restore the integrity of the network and systems7.  6 A step-by-step approach on how to set-up a CSIRT, ENISA, 2006.  7 Strategies for Incident Response and Cyber Crisis Cooperation, ENISA, August 2016.

Methodology and data collection  Step 1 – Identification of CSIRT inventory’s mapping of blind spots  The ENISA’s inventory tool was used as the starting point to identify blind spots to avoid duplication of efforts  when researching and analysing new entities. In addition to addressing the specific objectives of the study,  the following blind sports were proposed and validated with ENISA at the beginning of the work:    Constituency type: among the 344 CSIRTS identified, there was a majority of Commercial Sector,  NREN, Governmental sector and Financial sector CSIRTs, while entities in Military organisations,  CIP/CIIP sector, Law enforcement agencies, and non-commercial organisations were less  represented;   Geographical coverage: 15 Member States had less than 8 CSIRTs identified in the inventory.  o All EU Members States have a national and/or government CSIRT  o No EU Member State has CSIRTs for all critical sectors  o 3 Member States have a CSIRT for the energy sector (Poland, Italy, and Austria)  o 13 Member States have a CSIRT for the financial sector (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic,  Estonia, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, and the UK)  o 10 Member States have a CSIRT focusing on Critical Information Protection and / or Critical  Information and Infrastructure protection (Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg,  Slovakia, Spain, and the UK)  Step 2 – Definition of data classification criteria  This step was dedicated to building an analysis grid to be used to classify the newly identified CSIRTs, by  defining a set of analysis criteria.  The list of criteria was defined:   Using the criteria of the ENISA CSIRT inventory: Country, CSIRT/Team name, Constituency, Contact.   Adding additional criteria pertaining to the specific data sought in the context of this study (e.g.  cooperation aspects, date of creation, etc.).  A list of criteria was also established for the collection of data pertaining to the IRC.  This step was conducted in close cooperation with the ENISA team to collect criteria that seemed important  to them.  For detailed information on the selected criteria, see part 5.1 on Data classification and structuring.  Step 3 – Design of the data classification grid  During this step, the research team used the pre-defined classification criteria and the validated blind spots  to build an analysis grid. The purpose of this analysis grid was to:  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  12   To facilitate the data collection step by focusing the research work on the key topics of interest for  ENISA;   To present the raw data in a structured way.  Step 4 - Data collection  This step consisted in conducting a literature review to identify relevant resources to collect data on new  CSIRTs and recent trends in the field of IRC. The research methodology was lean, efficient, and employed  techniques to ensure an incremental data collection and research process.  The following resources were used:   Policy documents;   White papers and national security strategies;   Publicly available reports from CSIRT’s, National Cybersecurity Centres, Ministries and  regional/international organisations;   Operational and strategical Publications from research centres and academia;   Publications from subject matter experts.  During a preliminary data collection phase, the relevant data were gathered in the data classification grid by  a first team of analysts.  The preliminary data was then validated and further enriched by a second team of analysts.  Step 5 – Raw Data Analysis and trends evaluation  The methodology used in this step was based on a qualitative use of the Delphi Method8, which ensures  that the data collection team and the data analysis team benefit from and build on each other’s expertise,  and that the final analysis addresses all aspects of the request presented in a concise, coherent and  comprehensive way.  “The Delphi method is a structured communication technique, originally developed as a systematic,  interactive forecasting method which relies on a panel of analysts. The analysts answer questionnaires in at  least two rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts’ forecasts  from the previous round. Thus, analysts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies  of other members of the panel. It is believed that during this process, the range of the answers will decrease  and the group will converge towards the \"correct\" answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a pre-defined  stop criterion (e.g. number of rounds, achievement of consensus, and stability of results).\"9  Relying on the expertise of senior experts and analysts, the Delphi method was applied in a qualitative way  to ensure that these different areas of expertise contributed to a comprehensive analysis. The objective was  to:   Validate that the full scope of study has been covered;  8 https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3558.html  9 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method  https://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3558.html http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  13   Validate the quality of the collected data;   Discuss emerging trends for each specific domain (CSIRTs and IRC);   Discuss the benefits of existing initiatives undertaken at the EU level in these domains;   Identify additional information and topics that should be further explored.  Environment scanning techniques were also used to identify the strategic and operational trends that will  affect CSIRT and IRC by 2025. Environmental scanning is conducted in order to:   Broaden one’s vision and perspective;   Anticipate change;   Understand emerging patterns and trends;   Inform strategic perception, thought and anticipation.  A dedicated scanning framework was set up to guide the analysis. This framework included the following  categories, such as:   Nature of the threats;   Technologies;   Legislation and regulations;   Policy actors.  These categories helped identify:   The driving forces pushing or informing the main trends in the field of CSIRT/IR;   Early signs or indicators to measure the CSIRT/IR developments;   Potential impacts on the field of CSIRT/IR.  Once these analysis methods were applied, a first version of the key findings of the study was drafted and  submitted to ENISA for validation and further discussion.  Final Reporting  This final step consisted in further developing findings of specific interest to ENISA and in drafting the final  report of the study.  Close interactions and exchanges with ENISA ensured that the final recommendations of the study were in  line with the need and expectations of ENISA.

Key findings  Finding 1 – The implementation of the NIS Directive fosters the adoption of a holistic  approach towards IR and an upward alignment of national capabilities  As highlighted in the recently published United Nations e-government survey 201810, all European countries  have cybersecurity legislation and regulations in place.  Figure 1 - Total number of Member States with laws related to cybercrime in 2017 (Source: UN)  The mapping and analysis of some of the recent updates of some Member States’ national cybersecurity  strategies and the NIS Directive's transposition into national law – some of them presented in the table  below – show a harmonisation in terms of strategic objectives, structures and practices in the fields of IR  and CSIRTs.  Concerning international and European cooperation, national cybersecurity agencies – an increasing number  of them integrating the national and governmental CSIRTs into their organisation – tend to play a central  role.  10 https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018  https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  15  MEMBER STATES IR AND CSIRT RELATED ASPECTS  Bulgaria: (Draft) Law on  Cybersecurity11  Organisation, management and control of cybersecurity incident  response;  Designation of competent authorities in the field of cybersecurity, as  well as their functions;  Designation of competent authorities regulating the activities  necessary measures to achieve a high level of network security and  information systems.

Estonia: Cyber Security  Act  The national cybersecurity agency (RIA) is assigned the central role of  organising cybersecurity at the state level;  RIA is assigned the function of the cyber incident resolution unit;  RIA fulfils the role of international point of contact, and is responsible  for coordinating cross-border exchanges of information and IR  measures taken at the EU level.

Netherlands: National  Cyber Security Agenda  (NCSA) 2018  The incident response capabilities of the intelligence and security  services, Defence Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), the  National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Rijkswaterstaat  (Directorate-General for Public Works and Water Management) are  being enhanced to be able to deal with ICT breaches that threaten  national security;  11 https://www.e-gov.bg/bg/212  https://www.e-gov.bg/bg/212  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  16  Situational awareness at the national level will be enhanced by the  creation of a cooperation platform to offer more information and a  swifter perspective for action with relevant organisations.  United Kingdom: NIS  Regulations 2018  The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC – part of GCHQ) acts as the  UK’s CSIRT and as the UK’s single point of contact;  NCSC remit is to provide support, expert advice and incident response  assistance, and to develop cybersecurity guidance and standards, as  well as holding an advisory role in relation to UK CSIRTs;  In 2018, NCSC produced guidance and developed a framework, which  supports the assessment of the level of cybersecurity achieved by OES  in relation to NIS requirements.  These recent policy and regulatory orientations do not however indicate if this harmonisation of legislations  will lead to an actual harmonisation and upgrade of the actual national IR capacities.  As illustrated in the table above, the implementation of the NIS Directive varies from one country to another,  based on the experience of the country in the domain of cybersecurity and the degree of maturity of its  national incident response capabilities, in particular CSIRT.  With much of the detailed application of the NIS Directive left to national implementing laws, there is a risk  of fragmentation in terms of capabilities and of lack of visibility of the newly created national CSIRT and its  actual capabilities. Their role and scope of action vary from one country to the other, and affect the  cooperation with national law enforcement, judicial and military bodies.  As an example, the UK NCSC acts as the UK’s CSIRT under the NIS regulation and will have a significant  supporting and advisory role in providing IRC to cyber-attacks; however ultimate authority and responsibility  for any regulatory decision with regard to cybersecurity in a specific sector lie solely with the competent  sectoral authority.  Furthermore, since the NIS directive is a recent regulation, its full implementation will take time, and some  countries still lack maturity and capacities in the field of IR.  At national level, there is also a strong trend of private-public partnerships, which seems to be a key success  factor of IR. A recent example is the Belgian Cyber Security Coalition12 set up in 2015, which brings together  cybersecurity specialists from government organisations, companies and academia with a view to improving  the protection of government organisations, the business world and private citizens against cybercrime in  Belgium. To this end, the Coalition counts on the exchange of experiences between members as well as  publications offering advice to companies and awareness campaigns aimed at the general public. The  Coalition is also set to advise the government and the business world in drawing up guidelines on to  cybersecurity.  12 https://www.cybersecuritycoalition.be  https://www.cybersecuritycoalition.be/  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  17  Finding 2 – The NIS Directive may have a positive effect at the international level and  provides the EU with a status of ‘norm setter’  In Europe's neighbouring regions and to a lesser extent internationally, there is an emerging trend of  harmonization of domestic legal directives and regulations with the ones created by the EU. As in the recent  case of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the impact of the NIS Directive outside the EU  may illustrate the ability of the EU:   To develop political and normative consensus between countries on security-related issues;   To act as a standard-setter in cybersecurity.  This leading role relates to areas such as data protection, privacy and transparency, e.g. by setting incident  reporting obligations.  Some candidate countries for EU membership, in particular in the Balkans, have increased their  cybersecurity legislation in recent years with specific references to the NIS Directive and relevant EU  regulations.  Serbia, which was officially granted candidate country status for EU membership in 2012, provides an  interesting illustrative case:  in the process of developing its national information security regulatory  framework – and more specifically in its Law on Information Security adopted in 20161314 - Serbia takes into  account existing EU legislation. Referring to European standards and directives, the Law introduced the  National Centre for the Prevention of Security Risks in ICT Systems (National CERT), the CERT republic  authorities, and the possibility of establishing special centres for the prevention of security risks in the ICT  systems (Special CERT)15.  Beyond candidate countries, Ukraine also provides a recent case of national cybersecurity regulations  influenced by European standards. Its 2016 National Cybersecurity Strategy16 acknowledges that “the  primary concerns of development of secure, stable and reliable cyberspace are to be as follows:  - Formation and operational adaptation of state cybersecurity policy on the cyberspace development,  achieving compatibility with the relevant EU and NATO standards;  - Creating a national regulatory framework and term base in this area, harmonization of regulatory  documents for electronic communications, information protection, information security and  cybersecurity in accordance with international standards and standards of the EU and NATO”.  While highlighting the different approaches adopted by the United States (U.S.) and the EU in their  endeavour to strengthen cyber-resilience, the reactions in the U.S. to the GDPR and the NIS Directive also  suggest an increasing interest towards EU-led initiatives. The primary reason is that U.S. private companies  doing business or with subsidiaries in the EU will have to update their cybersecurity practices and policies to  ensure compliance with these new and expanding legal requirements. It is worth noting that lessons from  NIS Directive compliance and from a more binding approach to cybersecurity will also be carefully assessed  13 http://mtt.gov.rs/en/releases-and-announcements/two-laws-adopted-on-advertising-and-information-security/  14 https://www.amcham.rs/upload/Zakon%20o%20informacionoj%20bezbednosti.pdf  15 http://www.ubs-asb.com/Portals/0/Casopis/2017/4/UBS-Bankarstvo-4-2017-DarkoSehovic.pdf  16 https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy_Ukraine.pdf  http://mtt.gov.rs/en/releases-and-announcements/two-laws-adopted-on-advertising-and-information-security/ https://www.amcham.rs/upload/Zakon%20o%20informacionoj%20bezbednosti.pdf http://www.ubs-asb.com/Portals/0/Casopis/2017/4/UBS-Bankarstvo-4-2017-DarkoSehovic.pdf https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/NationalCyberSecurityStrategy_Ukraine.pdf  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  18  by U.S. stakeholders, while experts judge that ‘the likelihood of the US government adopting similar  legislation grows’17.  Finding 3 – IR capability developments of national administrations and operators of  essential services emphasize the relevance of collaboration at national and  European level  The above-mentioned  (3.1) United Nations e-government survey 201818 identifies Europe as the region in  the world with the highest presence of national, government and sectoral CSIRTs.  Figure 2 - Regional view of  CERT/CIRT/CSIRT  In the EU, operators of essential services in the seven sectors identified in the NIS Directive as well as national  administration are accelerating their efforts to build or upgrade their IRC. This effort includes the  development of sector-specific IR collaboration mechanisms and fora, both at an EU and national level.  At national level, the trend towards sector-specific IRC may cause a reorganisation of IR cooperation towards  a vertical model (rather than a horizontal and centralized model built around the national CSIRT).  Strengthening IR capability development of operators of essential services  The NIS Directive states “Member States shall ensure that operators of essential services take appropriate  and proportionate technical and organisational measures to manage the risks posed to the security of  network and information systems which they use in their operations”19. This requirement is in continuity –  17 https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/while-everyone-was-focused-on-gdpr-the-nis-directive-snuck-in-through-the-back- door/?ref=techi.com  18 https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018  19 Chapter IV, Article 14 - https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/while-everyone-was-focused-on-gdpr-the-nis-directive-snuck-in-through-the-back-door/?ref=techi.com https://venturebeat.com/2018/07/07/while-everyone-was-focused-on-gdpr-the-nis-directive-snuck-in-through-the-back-door/?ref=techi.com https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2018 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  19  and is an additional catalyst – of a strong trend in which operators of essential services set up a CSIRT within  their organisation.  The table below presents a few examples of recent teams created in recent months.

For  example, a German company created a CERT called CERT@VDE20, specifically dedicated to small and  medium-sized enterprises (SME) and with a focus on Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0.  There are, however, different levels of maturity in the IRC domain from one sector to another. On the one  hand, highly digitalized sectors such as banking and finance appear very mature, in particular when it comes  international and European cooperation. On the other hand, more traditional industrial sectors such as  transport and energy rely on heavy industrial systems, which are more vulnerable because they have not  been designed to deal with malicious acts. This is also due to the fact that the lifetime of their operational  facilities is often very long (more than 10 or 15 years) and need to adapt to the extremely short cycles of  Information Technology, lest they accumulate vulnerabilities due to the obsolescence of their IT layer.  An example of these capability gaps is given by a 2017 report published by the Vlaams Nederlandse Delta  (VNDELTA), pointing out that “few organisations have dedicated IT security staff and none have a mature  security incident detection and response team” in the ports of the Belgo-Dutch provinces, including major  ports such as Rotterdam21.  Initiating collaboration at national, regional and a European level  Acknowledging the growing interdependencies between their infrastructures and services, existing and  recently established CSIRTs of operators of essential services place collaboration at national, a regional and  European level among their key strategic objectives.  At national level, sharing information and reports with other CSIRTs, facilitating contact with appropriate  law enforcement agencies, and participating in national emergency and crisis exercises are the common  objectives of all CSIRTs. At sector level, CSIRTs provide awareness raising and information sharing services  rather than incident response capabilities, with several ISACs (Information Sharing and Analysis Centres)  already in place.  However, as illustrated in the two examples presented below, there is an emerging trend, which sees actors,  and CSIRTs in the same sector go beyond information sharing to organise and pool IR capabilities.  In this regard, one should consider the cases of Member States (such as France), who already established  some sector-specific cooperation schemes that may further lead to a vertical organisation of IRC. While  national governmental CERTs have traditionally played a central role in coordinating information exchange,  incident response, and capacity building in the different sectors of the economy, the increasing needs and  numbers of actors impose a more vertical organisation for each sector. The challenge in this context is to  avoid organisational silos as well as excessive disparities among actors.  National level  A pioneering initiative in this regard is the Austrian Energy CERT22, which became operational in 2017. It may  provide a positive role model for establishing cooperation mechanisms in the energy sector at the EU level.  The creation of this CERT is one of the main outcomes of a public-private partnership launched in 2013 by  different players of the energy domain in Austria, with the objective of improving understanding and  20 https://cert.vde.com/de-de  21 http://www.vndelta.eu/files/3215/1125/0649/Cyber_Security_in_Ports_Whitepaper_VND_vonference_november_2017.pdf  22 https://www.energy-cert.at/de/  https://cert.vde.com/de-de http://www.vndelta.eu/files/3215/1125/0649/Cyber_Security_in_Ports_Whitepaper_VND_vonference_november_2017.pdf https://www.energy-cert.at/de/  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  21  addressing common security risks and interdependencies23. Twenty companies are currently directly  involved in CERT Energy and two national professional associations, which played an important role in the  setting up the CERT, represent other smaller players. The basic services of the CERT have been fully  operational for one year and include:   Establishing situation reports and alerting members in case of crisis,   Supporting the incident management of one of the members with centralised IRC,   Improving the capacities of the members through common exercises and training,   Establishing security concepts, and increasing risk awareness at multiple levels, in particular for top  management.  The experience of the Austrian Energy CERT has shown that the main benefit of pooling and sharing IRC is  enabling information sharing and collaboration among trusted actors. Beyond the national scene and in the  context of the NIS Directive, the Energy CERT will also facilitate the choice of a common point of contact for  the Austrian energy sector. It also facilitates collaboration with other Member States and international  organisations in the energy sector. It is however worth noting that it took about 4 years to establish the  consortium, set the common rules and agree on contractual terms.  Regional and European level  At regional level, the Nordic Financial CERT (NfCERT), founded in Oslo in June 2017, aims to strengthen the  Nordic financial industry’s resilience to cyber-attacks, by enabling Nordic financial institutions to respond  rapidly and efficiently to cybersecurity threats and online crime24. The rationale underlying the creation of  the NfCERT is that criminals do not care about borders and, therefore, there is a need to establish  information exchange about what is going on in the neighbouring countries and learn from each other.  IR capacity building actions at a regional level are also implemented by the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU), which is the United Nations specialized agency for information and communication  technologies (ICTs). As such, ITU carries out a variety of actions and activities to build and strengthen incident  response capacities at national and regional levels. The Buenos Aires Action Plan for Europe for 2018-2021  outlines the regional initiatives the ITU25. The fourth initiative, « Enhancing trust and confidence in the use  of information and communication technologies », focuses on supporting the deployment of resilient  infrastructure and secure services in Europe through:   The elaboration or review of national cybersecurity strategies   The setting up or improvement of the capacities of national CSIRTs and the building up of a  network between these structures   The organisation of simulation exercises at national and regional level  From 2013 to 2015, ITU assisted the Cyprus government to establish a national CSIRT26 (see p.11). The ITU  also conducts what is describes itself as a ‘CIRT capability assessment’. Again, according to ITU on its  23 This information is taken from a presentation given at the ‘Cybersecurity in the Energy Sector #CySecEn  High-level conference’ on 11 October 2018 by the European Commission and the Austrian Presidency -  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/programme_-_high_level_conference_cybersecurity.pdf  24 https://www.nfcert.org  25 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Publications/Brochure%20Regional_Initiaitves_EUROPE-  E.pdf  26 https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/projects/display.asp?ProjectNo=9CYP13001  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/programme_-_high_level_conference_cybersecurity.pdf https://www.nfcert.org/ https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Publications/Brochure%20Regional_Initiaitves_EUROPE-E.pdf https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Documents/Publications/Brochure%20Regional_Initiaitves_EUROPE-E.pdf https://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/CDS/projects/display.asp?ProjectNo=9CYP13001  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  22  website27 the aim of this is ‘to define the readiness to implement a national CIRT’. However, there is no  detailed information available on what this means and no mapping or comparison is possible with other  assessments like the one provided by ENISA28. In Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), 8  countries, mostly in Eastern Europe, have been evaluated: Albania, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,  Cyprus, Macedonia, Monaco, Montenegro, Serbia. Within the ITU, the Telecommunication Development  Bureau (BDT) organizes ITU ALERT (Applied Learning for Emergency Response Teams), a capacity building  exercise targeted at national CSIRTs, public institutions, telecommunication operators and the academia.  ITU ALERT for Europe Region will be held from 26-30 November in Cyprus29.  Finding 4 – Successful cooperation initiatives in the field of IRC at an international  level are driven by public-private partnerships  On the international stage, two main kind of initiatives were identified pertaining to cooperation in the field  of IRC and cybersecurity to a larger extent: cooperation between global economic actors of the same sector,  and digital diplomacy.  What these initiatives have in common is that they illustrate:   More public-private partnerships in the field of cybersecurity are necessary at the international  level, although security is a sovereign domain;   Addressing digital security indeed requires involving technology giants owning the digital  infrastructures and data;   Sovereign states show an unwillingness to agree on binding measures to regulate their behaviours  and favour a voluntary approach.  1) There have been a number of international cooperation initiatives between global actors of a specific  critical sector. In March 2018, a group of financial services experts, convened by the World Economic  Forum, proposed 19 solutions for systemic cybersecurity threats in the financial sector. The objective is  to provide a toolkit to identify cyber-risk management improvements in an innovative and fast-changing  environment through public-private partnerships as well as concrete examples of how the framework  can be applied in practice30. This is another example of the leading role played by the financial sector,  whose players increasingly link technology companies to their system infrastructure – either voluntarily  or because of regulation such as the European Union’s Payment Services Directive 2 – making it crucial  to have reliable cybersecurity.  2) On a diplomatic and geopolitical level, a proposal to regulate state behaviours in cyberspace has long  been discussed in the framework of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) on  Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International  Security, to address tangible gaps in the existing legal framework. This work has however achieved  limited results, mainly due to the non-binding nature of these norms and the reluctance of some  countries to regulate their own governmental activities in cyberspace. Interestingly the non-binding  27 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/national-CIRT.aspx  28 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey  29 https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Pages/Events/2018/CYBDRILL/ITU-ALERT-Cyber-drill.aspx  30 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cyber_Risk_to_Customer_Data.pdf  https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/national-CIRT.aspx https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-capabilities/csirt-maturity/csirt-maturity-self-assessment-survey https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/Europe/Pages/Events/2018/CYBDRILL/ITU-ALERT-Cyber-drill.aspx http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cyber_Risk_to_Customer_Data.pdf  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  23  norms drafted by the states are similar to the principles initially proposed by Microsoft. It indeed appears  that while the achievements of the UNGGE are limited, numerous initiatives have been launched in  recent years by states, companies and international organisations: the Microsoft Tech Accord31 and call  for a Digital Geneva Convention, the Siemens “Charter of Trust”32, and the work of the Global  Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace33 (GCSC). These initiatives highlight the importance of  bringing together public and private actors to tackle the challenge of security on the international stage.  On the 12th November 2018 at the UNESCO Internet Governance Forum (IGF), President Emmanuel  Macron launched the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace34. This high-level declaration on  developing common principles for securing cyberspace has received the backing of States, as well as  private companies and civil society organizations.  31 https://cybertechaccord.org  32 https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/cybersecurity-charter-of- trust.html  33 https://cyberstability.org/about/  34 https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber- security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in  https://cybertechaccord.org/ https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/cybersecurity-charter-of-trust.html https://www.siemens.com/innovation/en/home/pictures-of-the-future/digitalization-and-software/cybersecurity-charter-of-trust.html https://cyberstability.org/about/ https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber-security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy/digital-diplomacy/france-and-cyber-security/article/cybersecurity-paris-call-of-12-november-2018-for-trust-and-security-in  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  24  Finding 5 – There is an important development of IR services in the European private  sector, however new vulnerabilities tend to target the hardware layer of devices  manufactured outside Europe  On the longer term, the NIS Directive also aims to stimulate the competitiveness and innovation capacities  of the digital industry in Europe by increasing the demand for cybersecurity and to support the development  of a sustained supply of innovative cybersecurity products and services in Europe35.  In this regard, the mapping of recently created CSIRTs tends to show that the development of IR capability  – in particular for operators of essential sectors - also relies on managed detection and response (MDR)  services provided by commercial organisations. This offer aims to remove the burden of having to figure out  ‘what method or device to use’ for an incident monitoring and response capability. MDR services includes  security monitoring and alerting, and remote incident management. According to Gartner, the global MDR  market came to approximately 100 million dollars in 2017 (a 15% increase compared to 2016).  In the ENISA European CSIRT inventory, commercial organisations are the most represented constituency. It  seems therefore that the NIS Directive and the overall recent increase in requirements may have a positive  effect on the European private sector by stimulating the supply of innovative cybersecurity services and  products.  Another interesting trend is to be considered. The concept of ‘cybersecurity-by-design’ is being widely  promoted, but its implementation is still below the expected considering the growing number of  vulnerabilities found a patched by digital devices providers and hardware manufacturers every year. As  pointed out in this ENISA info note36, the number of disclosed vulnerabilities each year keeps on growing at  a high rate. As also stated in the same info note, there are now also important vulnerabilities identified  within the hardware layer. The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities revealed in early 2018 illustrate this  trend:  Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors37. These hardware  vulnerabilities allow programmes to steal data, which is being processed on the computer. Even though  there are still fare more vulnerabilities being identified in the software layer, the ones like Meltdown and  Spectre that target the hardware layer are much harder to mitigate, as clearly stated in this38 ENISA info  note: ‘In the realm of the security vs performance discussion, whatever the opinion is, ultimately confirms  that microprocessor manufacturers need to identify new ways to address these issues or vulnerabilities will  continue to occur: manufacturers will continue to announce improved performances, and be forced to patch  those after release’. In 2016, ENISA published a Hardware Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide on this  topic39.  Other types of attacks targeting the hardware layer are the so-called ‘Supply Chain Attacks’40 and attacks  directed at Industrial Control Systems (ICS)41,  35 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing- competitiveness  36 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/is-software-more-vulnerable-today  37 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/meltdown-and-spectre-critical-processor-vulnerabilities  38 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/security-vs-performance-discussion-with-the-return-of- 201cspectrum201d-vulnerability  39 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape  40 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain-attacks-back-on-the-agenda  41 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/maturity-levels  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/executive-news/discussion-on-implementing-the-nis-directive-and-enhancing-competitiveness https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/is-software-more-vulnerable-today https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/meltdown-and-spectre-critical-processor-vulnerabilities https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/security-vs-performance-discussion-with-the-return-of-201cspectrum201d-vulnerability https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/security-vs-performance-discussion-with-the-return-of-201cspectrum201d-vulnerability https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/hardware-threat-landscape https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/info-notes/supply-chain-attacks-back-on-the-agenda https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/maturity-levels  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  25  In this context, device manufacturers develop their own CSIRTs, sometimes called PSIRT (Product Security  Incident Response Team): IBM, Cisco, Huawei etc. This offer will most likely expand, as the IoT is constantly  expanding, touching the daily lives of most citizens through smartphones, smart devices and the  digitalization of everyday objects. Recently, a group of vendors proposed a cyber-risk management turnkey  solution: Apple, Cisco, Allianz and Aon launched an integrated solution to manage risks associated with  ransomware and other malware, which includes software and communication technologies, devices, and  insurance coverage42.  These trends raise a question pertaining to the benefit of both national/governmental CSIRTs and European  cybersecurity services providers in the IR value chain, and their ability to play a central role should  vulnerabilities and cyber-attacks directly affect devices.  It would therefore be interesting to further study the impact of the NIS Directive on the European  cybersecurity industry, to further analyse if the growing demand (from regulators) for security is met by  European actors or by foreign companies, primarily the United States and other regions where the main  manufacturers of hardware are located.  Finding 6 – Military players tend to follow the same dynamics as the civilian sector  when developing their IR capabilities  IR capacity building in European armed forces  As demonstrated by the growing number of cyber defence commands in European armies, cybersecurity is  now considered as an integral component of modern defence. While the nature and the constrained  environment in which armed forces operate impose a higher level of resilience, forces are going through a  digitalization trend similar to that observed in the world because they are using similar tools, and are  therefore facing similar security issues.  This situation is even more interesting since armed forces have long thought they were untouchable to a  certain degree as they use specific and isolated networks, procedures and tools.  This changing situation can be illustrated by the following examples:   In 2009, the Conficker computer worm infected the French Navy computer network.   The newest Royal Navy aircraft carrier is equipped with the 2001 Windows XP OS, which was ‘state- of-the-art’ when the HMS programme was launched43. This OS was targeted by the WannaCry  ransomware attack in May 2017 that disrupted public administrations and companies worldwide.  According to a report by The Guardian newspaper, some Windows XP incidents were spotted on  the ship's computers.   In September 2018, the U.S. Senate released a report demonstrating to what extent the U.S. armed  forces struggled and often failed to incorporate cybersecurity into key aspects of their processes  and systems and stating how easy it was for cybersecurity test teams to compromise these  systems44.  42 https://www.csoonline.com/article/3254527/security/apple-cisco-aon-and-allianz-partner-in-cyber-risk-management.html  43 https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/27/hms-queen-elizabeth-royal-navy-vulnerable-cyber-attack.  44  https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf  https://www.csoonline.com/article/3254527/security/apple-cisco-aon-and-allianz-partner-in-cyber-risk-management.html https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/27/hms-queen-elizabeth-royal-navy-vulnerable-cyber-attack https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694913.pdf  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  26  There is therefore a structural difficulty for armed forces to ensure the cybersecurity of their digitalized  systems, given the complexity of these systems and their lifecycle in a context of a fast-moving ICT (and  cyber threat) landscape.  Recognising that they may face the same threats as civilian actors, European armed forces are increasing  their IR and offensive capabilities of at a rather rapid pace.  As an example, the German government agreed on 29 august 2018 to create a Federal Agency for Innovation  in Cyber defence45 to develop cutting-edge defence technology and state-of-the-art offensive capabilities.  In the Czech Republic, the creation of a National Cyber Forces Centre46 (NCFC) was initiated in 2016 and this  new capacity should be operational in 2020.  In France, a Cyber Defence Command47 (COMCYBER), placed under the authority of the Chief of the Defence  Staff, gathers as of 1 January 2017 all cyber defence forces of the French armed forces under the same  operational, permanent and joint authority.  While there is little information available in open source on these recently created or strengthened military  capabilities, it also creates a significant demand for IT experts and specialists that armed force are struggling  to address.  IR cooperation at international and European level  Military cooperation in the field of cybersecurity takes place in the framework of both NATO and the  European Union.  1) NATO-own IR capabilities are limited and depend on Allies' capabilities, except the NATO Computer  Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), which is the IR team for NATO infrastructure itself. As such, NATO  action focuses more on operational cooperation and interoperability between Allies' capacities during  operations.  At its Brussels Summit in 2018, Allies agreed to set up a new Cyberspace Operations Centre as part of  NATO’s strengthened Command Structure, to be fully operational in 2023. When fully operational, the  centre aims to coordinate NATO’s cyber deterrent through a 70-strong team of experts. However, it is  still uncertain whether this would lead to providing NATO with its own capability or only integrating  Allies’ national cyber capabilities into NATO missions48.  The approach towards cybersecurity promoted by NATO is that standards are increasingly decided by  the industrial actors, and decreasingly by states, as evidenced by the decision to downscale its  standardisation body from an agency (NSA) to a mere office (NSO) in 2014. As highlighted in a recent  report by the European Parliament, NATO recognizes that “Technological innovations and expertise from  the private sector are crucial to enable Allied countries to mount an effective cyber-defence. Industry is  the main supplier of hardware and software used by the military staff, also for operations”. This led NATO  to launch the Industry Cyber Partnership in 2014.  45 https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2018/08/cyberagentur.html  46 https://www.govcert.cz/download/gov-cert/container-nodeid-578/ap-cs-2015-2020-en.pdf  47 http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/163003632.html  48 http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/here-s-why-nato-s-cyber-operations-center-is-a-big-deal and  https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-2018-nato-summit-accomplish-respect-cyber-issues  https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/kurzmeldungen/DE/2018/08/cyberagentur.html https://www.govcert.cz/download/gov-cert/container-nodeid-578/ap-cs-2015-2020-en.pdf http://discours.vie-publique.fr/notices/163003632.html http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/here-s-why-nato-s-cyber-operations-center-is-a-big-deal https://www.cfr.org/blog/what-did-2018-nato-summit-accomplish-respect-cyber-issues  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  27  2) At the EU level, two of the 17 projects approved in the framework of the Permanent Structured  Cooperation (PESCO) tackle cyber defence and IRC:  a. The first, led by Lithuania, aims to establish an EU Cyber Rapid Response Force. So far, 7  countries have signed the Declaration of intent49.  b. The second, led by Greece, aims to create a Cyber Threats and Incident Response Information  Sharing Platform.  However, these initiatives are recent and limited information is available to evaluate operational  cooperation at the European level in the field of IRC and its tangible impact. While highlighting the  current political will to lay the foundation for joint and stronger European cyber defence capabilities,  their implementation will measure the ability to build common capabilities and a common capacity  to act beyond joint training.  49 https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/economic-relations-connectivity-innovation/47525/new-tool-address-cyber-threats-eus-rapid- response-force_en  https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/economic-relations-connectivity-innovation/47525/new-tool-address-cyber-threats-eus-rapid-response-force_en https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/economic-relations-connectivity-innovation/47525/new-tool-address-cyber-threats-eus-rapid-response-force_en  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  28  4.

Conclusion  This study has sought to collect data about and identify recent and current evolution of CSIRTs and Incident  Response (IR) capabilities in Europe towards 2025 at a strategic and policy level.  Mapping on an operational level of new and less visible CSIRTs created recently  These trends and findings were identified by mapping new and less visible CSIRTs recently created, and  eighty-one (81) CSIRTs were identified and analysed.  The collected data shows an increasing number of sectoral CSIRTs being created in the EU by public and  private organisation operating essential services. In this regard, the important number of cybersecurity  regulations in the EU appears as a key factor of this important cybersecurity capacity effort.  There are, however, different levels of maturity in the IRC domain from one sector to another. On the one  hand, highly digitalized sectors such as banking and finance appears very mature, in particular when it comes  to international and European cooperation. On the other hand, more traditional industrial sectors such as  transport and energy rely on heavy physical infrastructures, which are more vulnerable because they have  not been built with cyber security features by design and imply important investments to be protected.  The mapping and analysis of recent updates of some Member States’ national cybersecurity strategies and  the NIS Directive's transposition into national law also show a harmonisation in terms of strategic objectives,  structures and practices in the fields of IR and CSIRTs.  With much of the detailed application of the NIS Directive left to national implementing laws, there is  however still a risk of fragmentation in terms of actual capabilities.  Emerging structures and trends at a strategic and policy level, and the policies driving these changes.  On a strategic and policy level, the analysis of a corpus of 36 strategic and regulatory documents enabled  the analysis of what is happening across and outside the EU in order, in particular with the NIS Directive  This analysis shows that existing and recently established CSIRTs, in particular for those of operators of  essential services, place collaboration at national, a regional and European level among their key strategic  objectives.  The data also shows and recalls that cybersecurity is – to a large extent – driven by regulations51. In this  regard, the NIS Directive and the GDPR play a key role in constraining actors to upscale their cybersecurity  capabilities and standards, as well as increase their cooperation with other players.  At an international level, the lack of harmonised means and practices among countries in the cyberspace is  mainly due to the absence of binding norms regulating their activities. The current effort made by the UN to  agree on common regulations also supports the assumption that without the legal constraint, actors may be  less willing to cooperate in the field of cybersecurity.  51 See for instance the 2017 CXP Group analysis of cybersecurity key trends for 2017: https://www.pac- online.com/download/26609/187191  https://www.pac-online.com/download/26609/187191 https://www.pac-online.com/download/26609/187191  Study on CSIRT landscape and IR capabilities in Europe 2025  V 1.0 | February 2019  33  In Europe, the identified successful bottom-up driven collaboration – be it a national (Austrian Energy CERT)  or regional (Nordic Financial CERT - NfCERT) - however shows the increasing awareness of market players of  their interdependencies due to their digitalized infrastructures and services. These examples remind that  there has been for many years voluntary information sharing among CSIRT community in Europe.

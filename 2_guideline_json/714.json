    "document(english)": "1  Introduction  A cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) will render most contemporary public key cryptography  insecure, thus making ubiquitous secure communications based on current public key cryptography technology  infeasible. As the creation of a CRQC presents new cyber security risks, organisations are encouraged to consider  anticipating future requirements and dependencies of vulnerable systems during the transition to post-quantum  cryptography (PQC) standards.  Post-quantum cryptography  PQC is a field of cryptography dedicated to the creation and analysis of cryptographic algorithms that derive their  security from mathematical problems considered difficult for both classical and quantum computers. PQC offers a low- cost practical path to maintaining the properties of secure communications in the presence of a CRQC.  Selection of PQC algorithms are informed by a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) process. In doing  so, candidate PQC algorithms are evaluated and scrutinised in successive rounds to ensure they will meet requirements  to protect sensitive or classified data.  The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) will continue to monitor PQC standardisation efforts, including evaluating the  parameters for PQC standardisation. The outcome of these activities will result in updates to ASD-Approved  Cryptographic Algorithms in the Information Security Manual (ISM). At this stage, ASD assesses that currently  approved cryptography within the ISM provides the most effective method of securing communications.  ASD will also continue to monitor alternate methods of securing communications in the presence of a CRQC, such as  quantum key distribution (QKD). However, the practical limitations of QKD (including transmission distances,  specialised hardware requirements and concerns around availability) mean that ASD does not support its use for secure  communications at this time.  ASD encourages research, testing and practical trials of PQC algorithms while NIST finalises the standardisation process.  Research into the further development of PQC algorithms will be a practical and cost-effective step towards securing  real-world communications in the presence of a CRQC. More broadly, including outside of cryptographic applications,  Australian industry is encouraged to continue research and development of quantum technologies. This should include  practical vulnerability research to better understand the risks associated with employing quantum technologies.

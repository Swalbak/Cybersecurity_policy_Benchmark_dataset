SMEs also stand to gain the most from cloud computing, because it is complicated and costly for  them to set-up and run ICT in the traditional way. SMEs do not always understand all the information  security risks and opportunities of cloud computing. This document aims to provide guidance for small  and medium size enterprises (SMEs) about the network information security of cloud computing. It is  important that SMEs do not only look at the network and information security risks of cloud computing  but also at the opportunities to improve their network and information security. This document  contains 3 main parts:   First, we highlight 11 security opportunities, explaining why certain features of cloud  computing could present an opportunity for SMEs. We make a brief comparison also with  traditional IT deployments.   Secondly, we list 11 security risks SMEs should take into account when adopting cloud  computing. We compare also the risks with typical traditional IT deployments.   Thirdly, we provide  a list of the 12 most important security questions SMEs could use to  understand better what are the security aspects of a cloud service when procuring a cloud  service or when assessing different options in the market.  The security questions address  both the risks and the opportunities.  In an annex the SME can find empty forms to use for assessing risks, assessing opportunities and  collecting relevant information about the security aspects of a cloud service: a security cheat sheet.  Risks and opportunities can be very different for different SMEs. A lot depends on the type of cloud  service, the kind of data and processes involved, and other. Still to provide some practical examples  we elaborate two specific scenarios where an SME is a cloud customer:  ● ConsultLess, a 20 people consultancy firm, which wants to implement email and document  management as a SaaS cloud service.  ● EasyAgriSelling, a 10 people technology startup, which wants to run their webshop platform  (for farmers to create e-shops to sell their produce) on top of a IaaS/PaaS cloud service.  Although not the focus of this document we address the issue of legal compliance briefly. We touch  upon the main concepts of EU personal data protection legislation and we provide some pointers to  relevant information.  This guide for SMEs updates the 2009 ENISA Cloud Computing Risk Assessment for SMEs and the 2009  ENISA Assurance Framework. We have deliberately consolidated the risks and reduced the number of  security questions to make it more suitable for SMEs, with limited time and resources to go into a lot  of details. It is important to stress that this guideline should not be seen as a replacement for the  SME’s own risk assessment. Security measures should be appropriate to the risks; not always gold- plated solutions are necessary.  Since 2009 the cloud computing market has changed significantly. There are now many SMEs,  enterprises and government organizations who use some form of cloud computing. Cloud computing  has now become the backbone of the EU’s digital economy. Cloud services offered by providers are  more mature, there is more choice, there is more information for customers and customers are more  aware of the possibilities and limitations of cloud computing.  At the same time a number of issues have remained problematic, such as personal data protection  legislation and the impact of foreign jurisdiction. In 2012, the European Commission issued the  EU  cloud strategy aiming to address a number of these issues. The strategy is an important initiative and  the first results are currently being delivered.

This guide contains a list of 11 security  opportunities for network and information security (see Section 3) and a list of 11 network and  information security risks SMEs (see Section 4). These lists of opportunities and risks can be used  directly by SMEs when they procure cloud services. For two specific fictitious scenarios we rate the  risks and opportunities: An SME using SaaS for email and documents (see Annex B) and an SME using  IaaS/PaaS for running a webshop platform (see Annex C). This guide also contains a list of security  questions SMEs can use to understand the main features of the cloud service most relevant for  network and informations security (see Section 5). Annex D contains empty forms for use during  procurement. Although not the focus of the this guide, we address legal compliance and provide some  pointers to information about personal data protection legislation in Annex A.  Scope  Network and information security  This document focusses on network and information security risks and opportunities; not other issues  like legal compliance, legislation, contractual issues. In the annexes we briefly address personal data  protection legislation, just to point to some relevant concepts and information.  Cloud relevant  This document focuses on the risks and opportunities which are relevant for an SME to consider. These  opportunities and risks are not specific for cloud computing but may pertain to other types of ICT.  Cloud customers  We focus on SMEs in the role of customers of cloud services, not on providers.  Target audience  This guide is aimed at micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs )1. SMEs often have few IT or  information security experts and it is infeasible for SMEs to negotiate with providers about custom  features or custom contracts. SMEs typically buy standardized (off the shelf) services under fixed  (boilerplate) contracts and SLAs. This document will be useful also for other small organisations, like  government agencies.  Methodology  This guide has been created in close collaboration with the ENISA Cloud Security and Resilience expert  group (public sector, private sector and industry association), based on the 2009 ENISA risk  assessment guide. The risks and opportunities have been extensively cross checked and reviewed by  subject matter experts.  Disclaimer about examples  In this document we sometimes give examples of past incidents. It is not our intention to single out  specific services or specific providers for praise or criticism.  1 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  2  Policy Context: the European Cloud Strategy  In 2012, the European Commission (EC) published its cloud computing strategy2, called \"Unleashing  the potential of cloud computing in Europe”. The EU cloud strategy is designed to support the uptale  of cloud computing across the EU. It centres around three key actions:  1. Standardization and certification of cloud services.  2. Safe and fair contract terms and SLAs, and a  3. Setting up a European cloud partnership to promote cloud computing adoption in the EU.  The EU Cloud strategy and the vision produced by the European Cloud Partnership both stress the  importance of facilitating the adoption of cloud computing by SMEs, because they stand to gain most  from cloud computing and they are an important driver for innovation and growth in the EU.  The ex-vice president of the EU’s Digital Agenda, Miss Kroes, said explicitly: “These issues [blocking  adoption of cloud computing] are particularly troublesome for smaller companies, which stand to  benefit the most from the Cloud, but do not have a lot of spending power, nor resources for individual  negotiations with Cloud suppliers”.  ENISA has supported several actions under the EU cloud strategy: ENISA participated  in the working  group on cloud standardisation led by ETSI3. ENISA works with the EC and industry to create a list of  cloud certification schemes4. ENISA also works in a working group which aims to clarify and harmonize  Cloud SLAs5.  Earlier drafts of this document have been developed as part of the activities of the European Cloud  Partnership, by F-Secure Corporation (http://www.f-secure.com).  Past ENISA work  Since 2009 ENISA has engaged with the cloud industry and potential cloud customers and published a  series of reports on cloud computing. Generally speaking ENISA supports the uptake of cloud  computing because of the many opportunities the technology offers to improve network and  information security. These are particularly relevant for SMEs which do not always have the resources  and/or skills to implement state-of-the-art network and information security. Explaining the security  opportunities (and the risks) of cloud computing is therefore an important objective for ENISA.  This document is based on  previous ENISA work. In particular it updates two previous documents:  ● The 2009 ENISA Cloud computing risk assessment, which lists opportunities and risks when  adopting cloud computing6.  ● The 2009 ENISA Assurance framework for cloud computing, which provides a list of questions  for SMEs to ask when procuring cloud services7.  We have consolidated the risks and reduced the number of security questions in the 2009 publications  to make it more suitable for SMEs, with limited time and resources to go into a lot of details.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-computing-strategy  3 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/standards-cloud-neelie-kroess-blog  4 http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/making-cloud-more-transparent-boost-secure-trustworthy-services  5  https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/07/articles/european-commission-issues-cloud-service-level-agreement-standardization- guidelines/  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance-framework  http://www.etsi.org/news-events/news/734-2013-12-press-release-report-on-cloud-computing-standards https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/cloud-service-level-agreement-standardisation-guidelines https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-partnership http://www.f-secure.com/en/web/home_global https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-computing-strategy http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/standards-cloud-neelie-kroess-blog http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/making-cloud-more-transparent-boost-secure-trustworthy-services https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/07/articles/european-commission-issues-cloud-service-level-agreement-standardization-guidelines/ https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/07/articles/european-commission-issues-cloud-service-level-agreement-standardization-guidelines/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance-framework  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  3  2 Cloud Computing Basics  In this section the three basic types of cloud services are introduced and the different division of  security tasks is explained.  One can distinguish among three different types of cloud services, each involving different types of  assets:  Figure 1: Asset in cloud computing  We go over the diagram from left to right:  ● Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS the provider delivers computing resources (virtual  hardware), accessible online. The software providing access to the resources is called the  hypervisor. Generally speaking there are two types of resources: processing power (including  network resources), and (block) storage (memory resources). Examples include Amazon’s  Elastic Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Dropbox,  Rackspace, etc. Note that object storage services (e.g. Dropbox) are often considered a SaaS.  ● Platform as a Service: In PaaS, the provider delivers a platform, or more precisely, application  servers, for customers to run applications on. PaaS providers sometimes provide a software  development tool for the platform. Examples of applications running on these platforms are  scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte code (Java servlets, C#). Examples include Google App  engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.  ● Software as a Service: In SaaS, the provider delivers full-fledged software or applications, via  the internet. Applications range from email servers, document editors, customer relationship  management systems, and so on. SaaS services can often be accessed with a browser or a web  services client. Note that it is not uncommon for SaaS providers to run their applications on  an IaaS or PaaS from another provider. An example is the video streaming site Netflix (SaaS)  which runs on Amazon AWS computing services (PaaS/IaaS).  ● Facilities denote the physical structures and supplies such as networks, cooling, power, etc.  ● Organisation denotes the human resources, the policies and procedures for maintaining the  facilities and supporting the delivery of the services.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  4  In cloud computing delivery of ICT resources is, to some extent, outsourced to the cloud provider. Also  some of the security tasks (such as monitoring, patching, incident response) are outsourced.  Depending on the type of cloud service some tasks remain under the responsibility of the customer,  while other tasks remain under the responsibility of the provider. Division of responsibilities can some  times be a major source of problems as it was based on assumptions and poorly documented, leading  to overlaps and gaps. This however seem to become extinct since SLAs have become more  sophisticated documents and specify this information. For example, in IaaS/PaaS the customers run  their own code on top of the cloud service, and often remain responsible for this (application)  software. In SaaS, on the other hand, the application software is usually8 under control of the provider.  In the diagram below we illustrate how the division of certain security tasks can be different for  different cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).  SaaSPaaSIaaS  C u  sto m  e r  P ro  vid er  Manage user accounts, user permissions, etc.  Manage and protect supplies and facilities (power, cooling, cabling, guards, etc. )  Deploy, update and  patch application  software.  Deploy and maintain hardware (server racks, disks, routers, cables, etc. )  Deploy, update and patch application software.  Deploy, update and  patch OS  Deploy, update and patch application server  Deploy, update and patch OS  Figure 2: Outsourcing of tasks is different for different types of services  Note that this diagram is for illustration and does not provide an exhaustive list of security processes  at the providers side or the customers side. In specific settings there may be specific agreements about  the outsourcing of security tasks. An IaaS provider, for example, might have a service for patching the  Operating System (OS) of customers. Sometimes such services are offered by a third-party (and this is  also known as SECurity-As-A-Service). See the next section about opportunities. See also the annex for  examples of security tasks in two fictitious scenarios.  In practice for SMEs, it is important to carefully assess which security tasks are outsourced to the  provider and which security tasks remain under their own responsibility. It is not uncommon for SMEs  to be confused about their responsibilities concerning security, for example, who makes backups of  data or software, which type of failover/redundancy is offered by the provider and what needs to be  done still by the customer.  8 Barring cases where customers have some liberty to run additional software, on top-of-the service, like third- party apps, add-ons, or self-created code.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  5  3 Network and information security opportunities  Cloud computing can be used by SMEs for a range of different applications (email, corporate website,  CRM, CMS, internal payroll processing, archiving of internal corporate documents, etc). For SMEs  cloud computing can offer many business advantages:  Cloud services are typically “pay as you go”,  which may be an attractive cost structure for an SME, avoiding an upfront investment in hardware,  software and IT experts. The overall costs when implementing are often lower than the cost when  going with traditional IT solutions. Online collaboration is often easier in the cloud case as access is  warranted to users from various physical locations, and various end-user devices etc.  There are also opportunities for network and information security. Generally speaking large cloud  computing providers can offer advanced security measures, while spreading the associated costs  across several customers. In some cases this means that fundamental security settings might be  ‘shared’ between costumers and might not be customisable but it also translates to a number of  specific security opportunities. Below we highlight 11 specific opportunities for the network and  information security of SMEs:  Network and information security opportunities  O1: Geographic spread  O2: Elasticity  O3: Standard formats and interfaces  O4: Physical security  O5: Incident response around-the-clock  O6: Software development  O7: Patching and updating  O8: Backups  O9: Server-side storage  O10: Security-as-a-service and security add-ons  O11: Certification and compliance  The rest of this section goes over each opportunity, explaining briefly why this could present an  opportunity for an SME. For each opportunity a comparison with traditional IT deployments exists and  points the reader to the relevant security questions in Section 6, which can be used in a procurement  process.  As every SME is different, not all of these security opportunities are important to the same degree for  all customers. Note that this report does not provide a rating or a ranking of the opportunities. In  annex two specific (fictitious) scenarios, are examined and rating of the opportunities takes place  using the following scale:  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  6  - Small opportunity: Customer could exploit this opportunity, but benefits would be limited.  - Medium opportunity: Customer should exploit this  opportunity, because benefits would be significant.  - Large opportunity: Customer must exploit this  opportunity, as there would be crucial benefits.  O1: Geographic spread  Cloud computing datacentres are often spread out across different geographic regions, nationally or  globally. Geographic spread can provide resiliency against regional issues and local disasters such as  storms, earthquakes, or cable cuts.  It can also be used  to mitigate certain Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,  allowing customers to get access at other locations.  Geographic spread can help reduce network latency,  because the services are provided from sites closer to  the customer. This could improve the overall  availability and performance of the service.  It should be stressed here that not all cloud services  come with geographic spread, and that sometimes it is available but needs to be first  configured/requested by the customer specifically. Depending on the settings this might involve extra  costs, because data synchronization across two remote sites requires network bandwidth, computing  power and storage.  See security question SQ 3 (in Section 6).  O2: Elasticity  Cloud computing providers can use large data centres  with large amounts of spare resources, to be able to  respond to rapid changes in resource usage, peak usage,  and Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.  It should be noted here that not all cloud services offer  the same kind of elasticity. There may be limits on  resource consumption set by the provider or the  customer. In some settings elasticity may need to be  configured/requested specifically by the customer, and  may increase costs.  See SQ11.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional  IT deployments an SME would have to set  up an additional remote site, sometimes  even doubling the costs for IT facilities.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments a SME  would need to invest in spare resources  to accommodate peak usage, yielding  high costs and inefficiency (because  these resources would be unused most  of the time).  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  7  O3: Standard formats and interfaces  The idea of cloud computing is to offer one service to  many customers at once. This means that in practice  cloud services are often compliant with industry-wide  standards. For example, most PaaS providers offer  standard PHP application servers and many SaaS  providers implement standard interfaces based on  standards like XML and JSON (JavaScript Object  Notation). This means that cloud services can be more  easily integrated with other services, or ported to other  platforms. This is a security opportunity because it  facilitates backup, failover, and integration with existing  security tools the customer may use, for example monitoring tools.  It should be noted here that while most cloud providers use standard interfaces and data formats, this  is not always the case. Customers should ask which standards are used.  See SQ 10, SQ 11.  O4: Physical security  In case the business model of the SME includes shared  resources requirements then physical security is indeed  an opportunity when using cloud. Resource  concentration makes physical security relatively cheap. If  the costs of physical security measures, such as perimeter  protection, 24/7 guards, alarm systems, camera  surveillance, automated fire extinguishers etc., can be  shared with many customers then the cost per customer  is low. In practice this means that cloud providers can  offer state-of-the-art physical security measures which drastically reduce the risk of physical theft of  servers, disks and equipment, fires, floods, etc.  See SQ 1, SQ 3, SQ 6.  O5: Incident response around-the-clock  Security incidents can happen at any time of the day or  night. To ensure continuity most cloud providers  continuously monitor their services around-the-clock and  have response capabilities standing by to react to failures  or attacks. Having personnel ready 24/7 is costly, but in  cloud computing these security measures become  affordable for customers because the costs are shared  with many customers.  Note that cloud providers do not always monitor and respond to all types of security incidents which  could affect a cloud service or a cloud customer. Customers should check which kind of security  incidents are monitored and responded to, and what kind of response actions will be undertaken by  the provider, to understand what remains to be done by the customer.  See SQ 1, SQ 2, SQ 3.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments SMEs often  use non-standard custom  configurations and proprietary  protocols, because of a lack of expertise  and the (sometimes) higher costs of  implementing standards.  Compared with traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments even a  standard security measure like a guard  on premise 24/7, would be too costly  for an SME.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments, an SME  would have to invest a lot to have a  24/7 incident response capability.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  8  O6: Secure software development  Secure software development is not easy and  requires a lot of time and investment in people,  tools, and processes. Even building a simple  website is rife with security pitfalls. A secure  software development pipeline (unit tests,  continuous integration, penetration and security  tests, load tests, and most importantly, skilled and  trained software programmers) is not easy to set- up and maintain. To build custom software, securely, is expensive, and outsourcing software coding is  not always cheap or easy either.  Because of their scale, cloud providers can afford to invest in secure software development, spreading  these high costs across many customers. Customers may lose some flexibility in terms of  customization, but they reduce the risk of software vulnerabilities in code they developed.  Note that not all cloud software is developed securely. Some providers may have bad development  practices. Other providers may use third-party software (proprietary or open source), over which they  have limited control. Customers should assess which software is developed by the provider and how  the provider ensures secure software development.  See SQ 1, SQ 7, SQ 8.  O7: Patching and updating  Timely patching and updating of software is crucial for security as attackers need only a small window  to attack and exploit a discovered vulnerability. Particularly when standard, off-the-shelf software is  used, cyber criminals pay particular attention to  provider patches and often try to reverse engineer  a patch in order to exploit the underlying  vulnerability; and this can happen in a matter of  hours. In fact, many cyber-attacks exploit the fact  that organisations are slow to update and patch  systems. Due to their scale, and because they  deliver the same software to all customers, cloud  providers can automate patching and updating to  a high degree. They can set up procedures and  tools which automatically9 deploy timely patches  and updates, reducing the  window in which  systems can be exploited by attackers.  Note that not all the software relevant to the customer is always patched and updated by the provider.  Particularly in IaaS and PaaS, the customer runs its own software on top of the cloud infrastructure  and the customer usually remains responsible for patching and updating it. Customers should ask who  patches and updates the relevant software in their setting.  See SQ 7, SQ 8, SQ 9.  9 Note that in some settings automated patching and updating might break functionality, especially when customers are  using services or APIs in a non-standard way, or when customers run their code on top of a cloud services, like in IaaS/PaaS.  Of course this is also an issue in traditional IT deployments, and often the reason for delays in patching and updating.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  deployments, if off-the-shelf software  cannot be used, then an SME would need to  invest significant resources in a secure  software development.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  deployments, SMEs often need to dedicate a  lot of time and resources to patch and update  their software. Even then they are often late.  The fact that traditional IT deployments are  often not industry-standard further  complicates updating/patching because of  incompatibility issues.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  9  O8: Backups  For an SME, making backups, across a range of applications and devices, and restoring them when  needed, can be difficult and time-consuming. Cloud providers can implement tools to automate  creation and testing of backupsand offer advanced backup  restore solutions, allowing customers to roll-back mistakes  and errors quickly. Additionally, in many cloud usage  scenarios software applications are implemented as online  (client-server) applications (as opposed to running stand- alone on clients). This reduces the amount of data that is on  the end-user device, simplifying backups.  Backups in the cloud (between cloud data centres) require  both storage and network bandwidth and in some settings cloud providers do not provide backups  automatically of all data, for free. Customers should assess which backups are made by the provider  and if they need to implement or request additional back-up mechanisms.  See SQ 3.  O9: Server-side storage  In many settings, SMEs have a range of mobile (and less mobile) end-user devices which are relatively  vulnerable to theft, loss, physical damage, etc. These threats can easily have a big impact on the assets  of an SME. Especially when dealing with mobile devices, it is  not always easy to keep timely backups of data (due to  connectivity andbandwidth issues), nor to cryptographically  protect the device components, from physical access to  device storage (i.e. after loss or theft), nor to control access  to devices with strong authentication etc. Cloud computing  can mitigate some of these risks. Using cloud services SMEs  can reduce the amount of data on the end-user devices. For  example, using cloud-based email, SMEs can reduce the  amount of corporate data on end-user devices, meaning that  less data is at stake when something goes wrong with end-user devices.  Customers should assess which data is stored server-side, and client-side.  See SQ 8.  O10: Security-as-a-service and security add-ons  As discussed in the previous section, some security tasks  remain with the customer, particularly in the case of IaaS  and PaaS. In cloud computing it is often more easy to  outsource some of these security tasks to third-parties or  the provider (if it offers such services). For example, an SME  running custom software on an IaaS platform, could get a  third-party to patch its OS regularly detect and respond to  security incidents by isolating and replacing infected hosts  instantly. Such security-as-a-service would be much harder  to implement in a traditional IT deployment, typically  requiring physical access to the premises.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In a  traditional IT deployment, an SME  need to dedicate time and resources  to backups leading to high costs.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments it is often  harder for an SME to use security-as- a-service because often in such  settings access to the SME’s  premises would be needed, or at the  very least a high-bandwidth  connection.  Cloud versus traditional IT: Often in  traditional IT there is a significant  amount of data on end-user  devices, which further complicates  back-ups.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  10  There are cloud providers who provide a range of  additional security services (such as patching  software), sometimes partnering with specialized (third-party) firms, enabling customers to procure  additional security services in an easy way.  See SQ 2.  O11: Certification and compliance  In cloud computing one cloud service is offered to many  customers at once. Certification, by independent auditors,  against network and information security standards (like  ISO27001 certification10), could be used by customers to  fulfil their own compliance obligation. An auditor, when  assessing compliance of an SME, would not have to check all  the assets underlying the cloud services, by using existing  compliance certificates for the cloud services they use.  Note that there may be standards or compliance processes  which are not cloud-ready. For example there may be settings where auditors need physical access to  ICT assets, which (in a cloud computing scenario) might be impossible or infeasible because cloud  providers may not always allow all sorts of audits of and visits to their datacentres11.  Use SQ 1.  Understanding opportunities with security questions  For each opportunity we point the reader to relevant security questions in Section 6, which can be  used in a procurement process, to understand if and how opportunities can be used.

Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments, an  auditor would have to cover all the  ICT assets and check compliance to  standards or policies from scratch,  yielding high costs for SMEs.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  11  O10: Security-as-a-service and security add-ons SQ 2  O11: Certification and compliance SQ 1  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  12  4 Network and information security risks  In this section we look at 11 important security risks which should be taken into account by SMEs:  Network and information security risks  R1: Software security vulnerabilities  R2: Network attacks  R3: Social engineering attacks  R4: Management GUI and API compromise  R5: Device theft/loss  R6: Physical hazards  R7: Overloads  R8: Unexpected costs  R9: Vendor lock-in  R10: Administrative or legal outages  R11: Foreign jurisdiction issues  For each risk we refer the reader to relevant security questions (section 5) to answer during  procurement of a cloud service. These questions should help customers understand if certain risks  need to be addressed.  In this section the risks are are not ranked or rated, because risks depend on the specific setting (the  type of SME, the type of cloud service, the data or processes involved, and other).  In annex two (fictitious) scenarios are analysed,  rating the risks using the product of likelihood and  the impact of a threat (following the ISO 27005 12 standard on risk management).  The scale used is  depicted in the figure below, and  ranges from 1 to 5: very low (1), low (2), medium (3), high (4), very  high (5).  Black is used to  indicate threats  which are rare but  could have high  impact. These risks  (also called “black  swans”) should be  handled with care  because the  organisation often  has little hands-on  experience in  dealing with these  incidents.  12 http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27005.html  http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27005.html  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  13  R1: Software security vulnerabilities  Software vulnerabilities in cloud software could have a major impact on customers. For example if an  SME uses a SaaS email service, which is vulnerable to SQL injection, then this vulnerability could lead  to a breach of confidentiality of the customer’s emails, severely damaging the SME’s reputation.  It is important to understand who is responsible for which  software component. In the case of SaaS, all the  responsibility for preventing software vulnerabilities is  with the provider. In IaaS/PaaS, however, the customer is  responsible for the software it runs on top of IaaS/PaaS,  barring any special arrangements13.  Remark on isolation failures14: Certain types of software  vulnerabilities could lead to one customer getting access to  another customer’s data, either directly or via a side- channel: these vulnearbilities are called isolation failures15.  In non-cloud settings, isolation failures are less of an issue  since there is no co-tenancy.  Especially if sensitive data is involved, it is important to ask  the right questions regarding software security. Some well-known SaaS providers are among the  largest companies in the world, and they boost a great track record and advanced security measures.  But this does not imply that all SaaS providers always do a great job at software security. One  complicating factor is that cloud software vulnerabilities become more attractive to attackers/hackers  to exploit, because this would allow them to attack many customers at once.  See security question SQ 7 (in Section 6).  Example: In 2011 a large SaaS provider deployed new software, which had unknown for the  time  vulnerabilities causing an isolation failure that was effectively allowing users to log into  accounts using any password. The bug was alive for approximately 4 hours16.  R2: Network attacks  Cloud computing services are consumed and managed  via internet connections. This means that customers  need to be aware of the risk of network attacks, like  spoofing websites, sniffing/eavesdropping network  traffic, Denial-of-Service attacks, man-in-the-middle  attacks, pharming, wiretapping, etc., on the normal end- user interfaces, as well management/administrator  interfaces, application programming interfaces (APIs),  webservices.  See SQ 8.  13 The different assets supporting cloud services are explained in Section 2.  14 This type of failure (Isolation failure) was separately mentioned in ENISA’s 2009 risk assessment.  15 An example of an isolation failure is described at:  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/06/21/dropbox- lets-anyone-log-in-as-anyone/  16 http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/  Cloud versus traditional IT: Cloud  service providers (using economies of  scale) can implement advanced  processes to develop, deploy and  maintain software, which reduces the  likelihood of software vulnerabilities.  In traditional IT deployments it is  expensive for an SME to set up state- of-the-art processes for software  development and maintenance.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT, key systems like servers  are typically managed locally, on- premise, which reduces the risk of  network attacks on administrative  interfaces. Many organisations  provide online access to services, so a  number of these network attacks are  also a risk in traditional IT.  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/06/21/dropbox-lets-anyone-log-in-as-anyone/ http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/06/21/dropbox-lets-anyone-log-in-as-anyone/ http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  14  Example: DDoS attacks on one customer of a large (SaaS) reverse proxy and DNS service, had a  severe impact on the internet connections for many other users, affecting their use of cloud  services. 17  R3: Social engineering attacks  In cloud computing, some administrative processes, like issuing user credentials, do not happen face- to-face between colleagues, but online via emails and websites. This increases the risk of social  engineering attacks, in which an attacker fakes communication or information so it appears to come  from a trusted source, like the cloud provider, etc. For example an attacker might try to impersonate  a customer and initiate a “credential recovery”  process, which eventually allows the attacker to  access the customer’s account, and access or delete  all the customer data. Or, vice versa, attackers might  try to impersonate the provider and in this way  obtain the customer’s credentials (aka phishing).  Attackers may target normal users, or users with  high-privilege roles, such as software developers,  system administrators, managers, both on the cloud  provider’s and the customer’s side.  SMEs should take into account the risk of social  engineering, such as phishing/spear-phishing,  spoofing, etc. and assess the potential impact on the  data and processes.  See SQ 8  Example: Famously a journalist from Wired (a technology magazine) wrote about his ordeal when,  an attacker, using a social engineering attack, managed to access his (SaaS) email account. Using  the email account, the attacker hacked also other accounts of the victim and wiped data from his  devices.18  R4: Management interface compromise  Most cloud services offer the customer a management interface, which give administrators access to  a a large number of assets; in the case of SaaS, all the user accounts of the SMEs employees for  example, or in the case of IaaS/PaaS, all the different virtual machines and applications of the SME.  Sometimes the cloud service. If an attacker can get access to this interface then damage can be big for  an SME.  Customers should verify that providers offer secure  interfaces with good authentication and  authorization mechanisms, particularly for high- privilege role like administrators. Additionally,  customers should take into account the security of  PCs and browsers used by administrators and high- privilege roles, because if attackers get control of  17 http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-ddos-that-almost-broke-the-internet/  18 http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/  Cloud versus traditional IT: Social  engineering is an issue also in traditional IT  deployments. In a way social engineering is  technology-agnostic. However, it must be  said that in traditional IT a number of  critical processes (like credential recovery,  etc) are often carried out face-to-face. So  customer should take extra care,  particularly to prevent attacks on  administrator’s interfaces.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional  IT interfaces are often only accessible  from the local company network and from  local workstations, which provides some  protection against phishing and spoofing.  http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-ddos-that-almost-broke-the-internet/ http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  15  those, then they could by-pass some protection measures taken by the provider  See SQ7, SQ 8, SQ 9.  Example: A company, offering code backup and code repositories (as a SaaS) for software  developers, stopped its operations permanently when an attacker had deleted virtual machines,  storage volumes and backup data via the cloud management interface 19.  R5: Device theft or loss  One of the defining characteristics of cloud computing, and key advantages, is accessibility from both  fixed and mobile devices, PCs, tablets, smartphones, and so on. This introduces also some new risks.  Mobile devices are relatively vulnerable to theft and loss. Theft and loss could mean data and/or  authentication credentials on the devices could get stolen by attackers.  A complicating factor, for SMEs, is the trend bring- your-own-device (BYOD), which means that  employees use different types of devices, not fully  under control of the SME’s IT experts. Features like  screenlock, disk and storage media encryption, and  many more may work differently on different types  of devices.  Cloud customers should assess which data and  authentication credentials are stored on end-user  devices, and ensure that device theft/loss is  mitigated, by using backups, encryption, data minimization, etc.  See SQ 3, SQ 8  R6: Physical hazards  Natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or fires, can affect the customer’s ICT asset, or the data  centres and infrastructure of a cloud provider. In cloud computing, customers might be affected by  natural disasters occurring far away from their own premises.  Note that IaaS/PaaS customers might need to  specify if and which data centres will be used as  failover.  SMEs should have a business continuity strategy  which addresses the risk of physical hazards. As  part of this strategy, customers should ask which  measures are in place to protect the cloud service  from physical hazards. Customers might need to  consider backing up their data regularly, in a  standard format, to be able to migrate to another  datacenter or another provider when needed.  See SQ 1, SQ 2, SQ 3, SQ 5, SQ 10.  19  http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/code-spaces-a-lesson-in-cloud-backup/a/d- id/1279116  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional  ICT deployments the impact of device  theft/loss is typically higher, because there  is more code and data on end-user devices.  At the same time mobile devices are less  common in traditional IT settings.  Cloud versus traditional IT: Cloud providers  can invest in state-of-the-art perimeter  defence, because the associated costs are  spread across many customers.  In cloud  computing natural disasters are often  mitigated by using multiple geographically  spread datacentres.  http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/code-spaces-a-lesson-in-cloud-backup/a/d-id/1279116 http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/code-spaces-a-lesson-in-cloud-backup/a/d-id/1279116  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  16  Example: Thousands of customers of two major cloud providers were affected by a lightning struck  in the Dublin region in summer 2011. The outage lasted 2 days20.  Example: A large scale electrical storm caused an outage in a large cloud provider affecting the  datacentre facilities. The outcome was that 3 major public services were out for more than 8 hours  affecting thousand customers that didn’t have access and, in some cases, lost data.21  R7: Overloads  Sharing infrastructure offers great cost-savings and economies of scale - allowing customers to get  more value for less costs. Logical isolation ensures that tenants cannot access each other’s data, but  cloud tenants still use the same physical  infrastructure, so customers may be affected by  peaks in resource usage by other tenants or DoS  attacks on other tenants.  Cloud customers should ask if and how their cloud  service handles peaks in demand or increased usage.  Cloud customers should also check the service level  agreements (SLA) which should guarantee  availability of their service (or penalty fees or refunds  in the case of outages).  See SQ 3, SQ 11.  Example: A cloud provider suffered an outage that seemed managable in the beginning, but lasted  longer than expected. During the outage, there was a large number of reboot requests from  customers, which caused a bottleneck, and caused outages for customers22.  R8: Unexpected costs  Cloud computing is often pay-as-you-go, which means costs are not always fixed. This also means that  costs could unexpectedly become very high. For example, customer may get a high bill because one  of their websites becomes very popular, because employees upload and store a lot of data,  or because  attackers mount a DoS attack, consuming all the  resources. One could argue the risk of unexpected  costs is not purely an information security risk (but  rather a business risk) but we nevertheless discuss  it here briefly, because unexpected costs could  quickly lead to financial issues which could result in  an outage.  Customers should check how their service scales  with increased usage and what are the associated  costs.  See SQ 11.  20 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/08/bpos_amazon_power_outages/  21 https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/  22  http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Amazon-Cloud-Outage-Caused-by-Storms-Worsened-by-  Software-Glitches-280060/  Cloud versus traditional IT: In cloud  computing overloads are often mitigated by  providing customers with elasticity, using  spare resources, while in traditional IT it is  often much more expensive for customers  to have large amount of spare resources.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  costs are often fixed, although it should be  said they are usually higher than in cloud  computing, especially for smaller  organisations.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/08/bpos_amazon_power_outages/ https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Amazon-Cloud-Outage-Caused-by-Storms-Worsened-by-Software-Glitches-280060/ http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Amazon-Cloud-Outage-Caused-by-Storms-Worsened-by-Software-Glitches-280060/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  17  Example: An engineering team in an SME forgot to shut down a cluster of 250 servers over a  weekend — a $23,000 mistake since the servers were idle during that period. A marketing group  decided to run analysis on data collected in the cloud on their local servers — after downloading  10 TBs of data, they racked up $1000 dollars in unexpected data transfer fees23.  R9: Vendor lock-in  Vendor lock-in (also called customer lock-in) is a situation  where it is hard for the customer to migrate to another  cloud provider. For SMEs vendor lock-in can become a  financial issue but it can also become a security risk, for  example when circumstances force a customer to migrate  to another provider, for example in case of a legal conflict,  issues about billing, major outages, etc. If the customer  does not use  standard data formats and interfaces, then  migration may become difficult and/or time-consuming.  Customers should have a business continuity strategy,  which includes migration/exit plans for moving data and/or processes to another provider. As part of  this strategy, customers should consider backing up their data regularly, in a standard format, to be  able to migrate when needed, and test regularly if migration works.  See SQ 10.  Example: A cloud storage pioneer, closed its doors and left over 1,000 customers with only two  weeks to save their data that was hosted on the cloud storage provider24.  R10: Administrative or legal aspects  Administrative and/or legal conflicts (even if no technology breaks or gets hacked) could have an  impact on the availability of a cloud service. For example when a provider goes bankrupt and creditors  could threaten to confiscate assets belonging to the supplier, then backups may become unavailable,  before customers can migrate out. Service may also be interrupted when the cloud provider gets a  legal court-order to cease operations, for example  because of legal proceedings against the provider or  against one of their customers/tenants. Cloud  customers could also end up in an administrative  dispute about billing for example.  The obligations of the provider are described in the  contract the two parties counter sign; the contract  should address SLA issues, jurisdiction, liability,  indemnity etc. The contract need to be negotiated carefully and fully understood especially by SMEs.  Customers should assess the risk of outages caused by administrative or legal issues and assess  whether security measures need to be taken to mitigate this risk.  See SQ 4.  23 http://formtek.com/blog/cloud-computing-companies-worry-about-unexpected-costs-and-fees/  24  http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612299/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-provider-nirvanix-is-closing-its- doors.html  Cloud versus traditional IT: Cloud  computing is often  more standard than  legacy IT (using standard XML/HTML  interfaces, standard data formats, standard  VM images, etc), which reduces vendor  lock-in.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  there is often is less dependence on third- parties, hence administrative or legal issues  usually have less impact.  http://formtek.com/blog/cloud-computing-companies-worry-about-unexpected-costs-and-fees/ http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612299/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-provider-nirvanix-is-closing-its-doors.html http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612299/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-provider-nirvanix-is-closing-its-doors.html  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  18  Example: A cloud provider went bankrupt without giving notice to their customers, leaving them  on the spot with their data non reachable. In the aftermath, no data was lost thanks to the quick  response of other vendors to support the customers’ needs.25  R11: Foreign law issues  Cloud services sometimes involves the use of cloud  providers or datacenters abroad, which means that  to a certain extent foreign jurisdictions may have an  impact on the security and privacy of the cloud  service. For example, violations of the law by the  other customers (co-tenants) may lead to services  being ordered shut (for example as part of a criminal prosecution), without taking proper care of the  other customers. It has been argued by legal experts that even if the physical location of supporting  equipment or datacenters are not in a foreign country there could still be an impact26.  Cloud computing customers should ask which foreign jurisdictions may play a role and if there are  incompatibilities with their own national legislation.  See SQ 12.  Example: a European governmental body (for similar reasons) restricted their employees from  using widely used cloud services to share documents and exchange emails27.  Understanding risks with security questions  For each risk we point the reader to relevant security questions in Section 6, which can be used in a  procurement process, to understand if and how risks can be mitigated.

Customers can use these questions to get the most relevant information about the  security of their cloud service, and to understand if more needs to be done to use certain opportunities  or to mitigate certain risks. The table below shows the main topics and how they relate to the  opportunities and risks:  Security questions Related  opportunities  Related  risks  SQ1: Organizational security, governance and risk management O4, O5, O6, O11 R6  SQ2. Responsibilities and liabilities O5, O10 R6  SQ3. Contingencies and backups O1, O4, O5, O8 R5, R6, R7  SQ4. Legal and administrative issues - R10  SQ5. Human resources security O4  R6  SQ6. Access Control O4, O9 R6  SQ7. Software security O6, O7 R1, R4  SQ8. User, management and application programming interfaces O6, O7, O9 R3, R4, R5  SQ9. Monitoring and logging O7 R4  SQ10. Interoperability and portability O3 R6, R9  SQ11. Scaling, sizing and costs O2 R7, R8  SQ12. Compliance with national/international legislation - R11  For each question, an indication of the kind of information customers might need to get an answer is  included. It should be stressed that not all providers will respond to customer question-forms about  one particular service they may offer. A defining characteristic of cloud computing is that one provider  offers the same service to many customers, so answering questionnaires for all customers may be  infeasible and/or too costly. Customers may find some of the answers on the websites of providers or  in other material (for example via cloud certification schemes28).  For each question below examples of possible supporting evidence or guarantees are included, which  could back up or support claims made by the provider. Typically supporting evidence or guarantees  may be clauses in a contract or SLAs, audit reports from third parties29, self-assessments by the  provider, a track record of past performance, statements from past customers etc.  Annex D includes empty question forms for use during procurement.  SQ1: Organizational security, governance and risk management  Before procuring a cloud service from a provider the customer should have an idea about the quality  and effectiveness of the organizational structure and risk management processes at the provider. It is  28 ENISA, EC, together with industry, has developed a list of certification schemes relevant for cloud customers:  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  29 At the same time formal compliance certification and audits by 3rd parties carry a cost and are not always the  most appropriate or the only way to provide evidence.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  21  also important for the customer to know which parts of the provider’s organization will be dealing  with security incidents, how key roles can be carried out by the customer, how to find security- relevant information, security advisories, information about outages.  Question Possible answers  1. How does the cloud provider manage  network and information security risks  related to the cloud service?  - General policy and approach to managing  security risks.  - Contact point for security incidents.  - Presentation of  critical dependencies of the  Cloud Service Provider on third parties.  - Compliance with best practice or industry  standard on governance or risk management.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Audit reports by independent auditors.  - Certification against information security risk  management standards (for example ISO  27001), including scope statement.  - Self-assessment against an industry standard  or best practice.  -  SQ2. Security responsibilities  It is important to apportion responsibilities for security tasks and responsibilities/liabilities for security  incidents. As explained in Section 2, the division of security tasks, and the division of  responsibilities/liabilities for incidents is different for different types of cloud services.  Question Possible answers  2. Which security tasks are carried out by  the provider, which type of security  incidents are mitigated by the provider  (and which tasks and incidents remain  under the responsibility of the customer)?  - Assets under control of the provider.  - Key security tasks carried out by the provider  (patching, updating, etc).  - Examples of incidents under the  responsibility of the provider.  - Tasks and responsibilities under the  responsibility of the customer.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant security tasks mentioned in  contract or SLA,  - Incident classification and response/recovery  time objectives,  - Liability clauses in contracts or SLA i.e.  financial compensation  SQ3. Contingencies and backups  An earthquake, a power cut or a thunder storm could affect facilities, supplies, an entire datacentre  or power or network cables. For customers it is important to understand how the cloud service is  resilient in the face of disasters and how data is backed up.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  22  Question Possible answers  3. How does the cloud service sustain  disasters affecting datacentres or  connections and which data is backed up  where?  - Physical security policy/ measures (backup  power, fire extinguishers, etc.),  - Network redundancy, geographic spread,  availability zones, access control,  - Backups and failover mechanisms,  - Disaster recovery plans.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clauses included in contract and  SLA,  - Recovery time objectives.  SQ4. Legal, regulatory and administrative issues  Legal, regulatory and administrative issues can cause outages (for example, issues about contracts,  billing, legal procedures against co-tenants). Customers should understand how the security of their  data and processes is guaranteed in the event of legal issues or administrative disputes.  Question Possible answers  4. How is security of the cloud service  guaranteed when there are legal issues or  administrative disputes?  - Service continuity in case of legal issues,  administrative disputes, bankruptcy,  confiscation by law enforcement, etc.  - Guaranteed data export.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Contract and SLA relevant clauses about  access to data.  - Disclaimers addressing legal issues or  administrative disputes, guaranteeing  access to customer data and backups.  SQ5. Personnel security  Personnel at the provider could have an impact on security of services or data processing. Customers  should ask how the provider ensures that personnel works securely.  Question Possible answers  5. How does the provider ensure that  personnel works securely?  - Training/certification for key roles.  - Recruitment policies.  - Penetration tests/social engineering testing.  - Compliance to ISMS standard or best  practice (SQ1).  - Security vetting procedures for highly  sensitive posts (handling sensitive data)  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  23  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Certification or self-assessment against ISMS  standard or practice (see SQ1).  SQ6. Access Control  Data and processes of customers should be protected from unauthorized access. Customers should  ask how access control is implemented to protect their data and processes.  Questions  Possible answers  6. How is customer data or processes  protected from unauthorized physical and  logical access?  - Physical access control protection measures.  - Logical access control protection (roles,  permissions, privilege minimization, privilege  segregation).  - Authentication mechanisms used.  - Compliance to ISMS standard or best practice  (SQ1).  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Certification or self-assessment against ISMS  standard or practice (see SQ1).  SQ7. Software security  Software vulnerabilities could have a big impact on the customer’s data or processes. Customers  should ask which measures are in place to make sure software underpinning the cloud service is kept  secure and which software is not under control of the provider, and should be kept secure by the  customer.  Question Possible answers  6. How does provider ensure software  security and which software remains  customers responsibility?  - Secure software development method.  - Vulnerability management process (contact  points for vulnerabilities, time to report etc.),  - Training for developers,  - Patch and update procedures.  - Standards or best practices used (such as ISO  27034).  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Information about past vulnerabilities of  relevant software.  - Vulnerability scan reports.  - Third-party audits of software,  - Measures of software security activities e.g.  BSIMM or OpenSAMM.  SQ8. User, management and application programming interfaces  Cloud services are typically accessible via online web-based user interfaces and APIs. These interfaces  should be protected from unauthorized access, particularly the management interfaces for  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  24  administrators and high-privilege roles should be protected carefully because via these interfaces  attackers could gain access to a large number of customer data and processes.  Questions Possible answers  SQ8. How is access to the GUI’s and API’s  protected, and are their additional  measures for administrators/high privilege  roles (under the customer’s side)?  - Authentication methods at GUIs and APIs,  - Protection measures for administrator  interfaces.  - Authentication for administration interface,  - IP restrictions, administrator roles and privileges.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Technical description of interfaces and  protection methods.  SQ9. Monitoring and logging  Customers should be able to monitor the performance and security of the service, via alerts, periodic  reports, dashboards. Customers should also be able to analyse issues by analysing transaction logs,  either via automatic interface or upon request, for example in the case of an incident.  Questions Possible answers  9. How can the customer monitor the  service, which logs are kept, and how can  they be accessed for example when the  customer needs to analyse an incident?  - Dashboard with access to performance  monitoring.  - Transactions logs, performance logs.  - Alerts and triggers for notification.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clause of the SLA on retrieval of  transaction logs.  SQ10. Interoperability and portability  Interoperability makes it easier for customers to integrate a cloud service with other, existing,  solutions, and portability makes it easier for customers to migrate to a new provider (if needed in an  exit scenario, for example). Customers should ask which standards are used for data and interfaces  (and maybe one step further to hardware and devices), or if export functions and backup data uses  standard formats.  Questions Possible answers  10. Which standards make the cloud service  portable and interoperable?  - Interface standards and data formats for  GUIs, APIs, export, applications and code,  virtual machines, etc.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clauses in contract or SLA,  - Audit reports, certifications, self-assessment  report indicating compliance.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  25  SQ11. Scaling, sizing and costs  Cloud services often provide elasticity in terms of resource usage, on the basis of a pay-as-you-go  payment model. Customers should clarify how peak usage or increased usage is dealt with, and how  the additional costs are handled.  Questions  Possible answers  11. How is increase of usage or peaks  handled, and what are the corresponding  costs?  - Examples of elasticity scenarios, cost  calculation, and so on  - Cost alerts and billing limitations.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clauses in contract or SLA,  - Performance track record.  SQ12. Compliance with national/foreign legislation  Cloud computing changes the way IT resources are delivered and there may be compliance issues with  national legislation. In cloud computing customers sometimes work with providers and/or datacenters  across borders, so also foreign legislation might be relevant to take into account.  Customers ask which  jurisdiction is relevant to take into account and which legislation applies to their cloud service  (national, international etc).  Note that often personal data protection legislation is applicable (see Annex A).  Questions Possible answers  12. Which national legislation applies?  - Relevant national legislation (including national  bodies that have jurisdiction to impose  provisions).  - Relevant foreign jurisdiction and applicable  foreign legislation.  - Location of datacentres.  - Applicable personal data protection legislation.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - References and links to legislation  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  26  6 Conclusions and Outlook  In this document we highlight 11 important security risks and 11 important security opportunities  SMEs should take into account when procuring a cloud service. We also provide a list of 12 security  questions SMEs can use to understand the security features of cloud services in the market.  Since 2009 the market has evolved: Providers offer products which are more mature, they offer more  information about security, customers understand cloud computing better, and know better what are  the risks and opportunities of cloud computing. Also policy makers have taken action. In 2012 the  European Commission issued an EU Cloud strategy aimed at removing remaining barriers to a wider  uptake of cloud computing. Also national governments in the EU are adopting policies (such as cloud- first policies) to improve the use of cloud computing in the private and public sector.  At the same time work still needs to be done to ensure a single digital market in the EU. Cloud  computing exasperates the differences between different countries and different jurisdictions. Some  of these issues may be addressed by technological solutions (such as encryption), but not all.  ENISA believes security should be a driver for cloud computing, and that, when organization need  better network and information security, then cloud computing (in different forms) becomes an  opportunity to meet those requirements (sharing resources, sharing costs, sharing expertise).  We look forward to helping SMEs in the EU as well as other customers, like government agencies, to  adopt cloud computing in a secure way and make full use of its opportunities.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  27  Annex A:  Legal compliance  Cloud computing changes radically the way ICT resources are delivered and consumed. Customers  should assess which cloud computing services are compatible with applicable legislation. Depending  on the setting a range of laws could apply: for example legislation on the protection of personal data  (DP), legislation on sector-specific data like financial data or medical records, legislation for critical  information systems, like energy, water supply or transport, legislation on the handling of state  classified data, criminal law, administrative law etc.  Depending on the setting there may be different requirements, which could have an important  bearing on the way cloud computing can be used by SMEs and which are security measures which  must be taken by the customer. Legal compliance is not only about personal data protection  legislation.  We give some examples of different types of legal requirements which could have an impact:   On-site audits – Legislation might require the customer to facilitate on-site audits of ICT  systems.  Cloud providers might not always be able to subject to all sorts of on-site audits.   Physical separation –Legislation might require the use of physically separated systems for  certain functions. Cloud providers might not offer physically separated systems.   Outsourcing – Legislation might allow outsourcing to third-parties only under certain  conditions, for example, if customers are notified.   National borders – Legislation might prohibit transfer/ processing of data outside the  country’s border. Cloud providers might operate abroad or use data-centres abroad.   Certified products – Legislation might require use of specific (tested/certified) hardware for  certain (for example, cryptographic) operations. Cloud providers might be using different  hardware and/or products.  Legislation is different from sector to sector, from country to country, and compliance depends on the  type of service, how the service is implemented technically, the type of processes or data involved etc.  Generally speaking customers should take into account first their national legislation and secondly,  when needed, foreign legislation in the provider’s country and/or other countries involved with the  service, for example countries hosting datacenters or subsidiaries. It should be noted that legislation  is constantly changing and the need to keep up with it is something the customer should do or for the  cloud provider to take up and notify clients.  One type of legislation which often has an impact on how SMEs can use cloud computing is national  personal data protection legislation. In the rest of this section we provide the reader with some  explanation of relevant concepts and pointers to relevant documents on personal data protection  legislation in the EU, because many SMEs have questions about this type of legislation.  Another type  of legislation would be the specific regulatory law that could impact on top of national legislation; this  could include inter alia finance, telecommunications, healthcare etc. While SMEs may not be directly  regulated they may be legally required to comply with sector specific regulation if they are a supplier  to that industry sector.  Note that ENISA does NOT aim to give legal recommendation or advice on legal matters:  Applicable legislation might be complex so SMEs might need to use legal advice for their  analysis. This report doesn’t substitute any legal analysis provided by experts.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  28  A.1 EU personal data protection legislation  SMEs often have concerns about compliance with personal data protection legislation30. Given the  broad definition of personal data31, in a lot of settings DP legislation plays a role. As with other  legislation, data protection requirements differ from country to country, sector to sector. This  complicates the use of cloud computing across borders and the development of a single market for  online services; which is why the European Union made it one of its priorities (under the Digital  agenda, the EU cloud strategy, and the Data protection reform initiative)  to harmonize national DP  legislation across the EU (see below).  A.1.1 Covered organisations and individuals  The goal of the EU’s personal data protection legislation is to protect the privacy of EU citizens. The  legislation affects cloud providers based in the EU, cloud customers based in the EU, and organisations  offering cloud services directed at EU citizens.  The main EU-wide data-protection legislation is the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. It is currently  being reformed into a new Data Protection Regulation32.  A.1.2 Personal data and processing  Key definitions used in the EU personal data protection legislation are:  ● Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person  ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in  particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his  physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity33.  ● Sensitive (personal) data means personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious,  philosophical or other beliefs, political opinions, membership of parties, trade unions,  associations or organizations of a religious, philosophical, political or trade-unionist character,  as well as personal data disclosing health and sex life.  ● Processing of personal data (processing) means any operation or set of operations which is  performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection,  recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,  disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or  combination, blocking, erasure or destruction.  A.1.3 Roles: Data controllers and data processors  The EU personal data protection legislation distinguishes different roles:  ● Data-controllers: The individual or organization who collects the personal data and who  30 For instance, in Quantitative Estimates of the Demand for Cloud Computing in Europe and the Likely Barriers  to Up-take, 2012, p. 42-43, available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf  31 Business email addresses may be considered personal data and some (the European Court of Justice, e.g.)  have argued that even IP addresses are personal data.  32 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/  33 For the notion of personal data see also Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal  data and the recent Opinion 8/2012 providing further input on the data protection reform discussions, where  the notion of personal data is further explained with regard to “identifiability” (legal term for the notion of  being indirectly identified) in terms of singling out the individuals  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  29  controls how the data is subsequently used and processed.  ● Data-processors: The individual or organization processing the personal data (which might  include storage, computing, sharing, etc.).  ● Data-subject: The citizen whose personal data is involved.  The EU legislation mostly targets data-controllers, and only indirectly targets data-processors (only  when they process data on behalf of data-controllers).  A.1.4 Appropriate security measures and due-diligence  The requirement most relevant to network and information security is the obligation for the data- controller to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect the security of the  processing of personal data.  This means that the data-controller should carry out a risk assessment  about security measures as needed. Risk assessment, on network and information systems, is a central  part of information security governance and information security risk management. For SMEs this  means that they  need to carry out a due-diligence on the setup of the cloud service and the security  measures in place to protect the security of the processing of personal data (initially during  procurement).  In this guide, in Section 3 (Risks) and Section 4 (Security questions), we provide SMEs a tool for  assessing, if appropriate, security measures in place to protect security of the cloud service and the  security of the processing of the customer data. Note that the national Data Protection Authority  might have specific and detailed recommendation about which are “appropriate security measures.”  A.1.5 Security breach notification  In the Data Protection Reform provisions for breach notification obligations are included, for those  security breaches which have an impact on personal data. In practice this would mean that SMEs, as  data controllers, whenever personal data is involved, should be in a position to investigate breaches  and communicate about them to data-subjects or authorities, in a timely manner. This is still under  consultation and does comprise a formal requirement for the data controller. The security question  SQ 12 in Section 4 addresses security breaches and security breach reports34.  A.1.6 National guidance on data protection legislation  Many Data Protection Authorities across the EU have developed excellent information, in local  languages, about compliance to the applicable personal data protection legislation in their country.  We list some of the guidance below, in no particular order35:   The UK data protection authority, ICO, issued guidance on cloud computing36.   The French data protection authority, CNIL, published recommendations for companies  planning to use Cloud computing services37   The Swedish DPA, Datainspektionen, issued guidance on use of cloud services and the  Swedish personal data protection legislation38   The Italian DPA, Garante per la protezione dei dati personali, issued a guide on personal data  and cloud computing39  34 More details can be found in the Art29 WP opinion 5/2012 on personal data breach reporting.  35 This list is not exhaustive.

Under the cloud strategy the EC has worked jointly with  industry on a code of conduct on personal data protection for cloud computing providers, to be  submitted for approval by the Article 29 Working party. The code of conduct aims to make it easier  for customers to be compliant with data protection legislation while using cloud computing. The  progress of that work can be found at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-select-industry- group-code-conduct  40 http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/03-07-12-Cloud-Computing/1221.htm  41 https://www.datenschutz-bayern.de/technik/orient/oh_cloud.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2010/wp169_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-select-industry-group-code-conduct https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-select-industry-group-code-conduct http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/03-07-12-Cloud-Computing/1221.htm https://www.datenschutz-bayern.de/technik/orient/oh_cloud.pdf  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  31  Annex B:  Example scenario: ConsultLess, SME using SaaS  B.1 Introduction  ConsultLess is a small consultancy firm in the EU that has 20 employees (mostly legal and management  experts). One of the employees is partner and also the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the firm.  Occasionally the CIO pays consultants for IT advice or support. ConsultLess decides to procure office  software as a service (SaaS) for use by its employees: the cloud service offers document  storage/editing, email and calendar. This cloud service should replace an internal mail-server and  office software installed on computers. The setup is depicted below.  IT manager  at ConsultLess  ConsultLess SME  ConsultLess  employees  Cloud service provider  Office software  SaaS  B.1.1 Business drivers  For ConsultLess there are many reasons to use a SaaS cloud service are many: better collaborative  features, lower hardware costs, lower management and maintenance costs. Compliance is a key issue  - and the CIO of the firm (the only employee with specialized IT expertise) wants to understand which  standard (boilerplate) services to choose, and also which issues remain to be addressed by specific  mitigating measures, custom features, etc. Some (not all) of the data stored and processed is sensitive,  and data leaks could have a severe impact on the reputation of the firm - and/or possibly even expose  the firm to legal actions by affected customers (which will have great reputation impact for such a  small firm).  B.1.2 Outsourcing information security tasks  In this fictitious scenario the security tasks which will be carried out by the cloud provider are:  - Managing of hardware and facilities, including physical security, power, cooling, etc.;  - Managing of server operating systems and the application server, including development,  deployment, patching, updating, monitoring, checking logs, etc. For example, it is the  responsibility of the provider to patch the server operating systems in time;  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  32  - Managing the application software, including development, patching, updating, monitoring,  and checking logs, and so on. For example, it is the responsibility of the provider to fix software  flaws in the office software;  - Managing updates of software and data.  The customer, ConsultLess, is merely responsible 42  for handing out accounts to its employees,  revoking accounts when employees leave, resetting passwords, etc.  In this scenario most security tasks are outsourced to the provider. The customer, once the service  has been procured and is up and running, will have few security tasks left to perform. It should be  stressed that the responsibility for security cannot be “outsourced”. If something goes wrong with the  office software ConsultLess has procured, causing sensitive data about its clients to leak, then  ConsultLess will in the first place be held responsible for the damages. For ConsultLess, hence, clarity  about security tasks and responsibilities is a crucial consideration in the procurement process.  B.2 Opportunities and risks  B.2.1 Assessing the security opportunities  Let’s look at the security opportunities for ConsultLess (SME uses SaaS).  OPPORTUNITY  RATING REMARKS  O1. GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD Medium No need for making backups and bringing them to a  remote site.  O2. ELASTICITY Small At Consultless usage of resources is quite stable. No  peaks.  O3. STANDARD FORMATS AND  INTERFACES  Medium Consultless plan on keeping documents, communications  long term in archives. Standard data formats are  important.  O4. PHYSICAL SECURITY Large  ConsultLess only secures laptops with disk encryption and  pincodes, and does not need to handle physical security  of servers, backup disks, etc.  O5.INCIDENT RESPONSE  AROUND THE CLOCK  Small Downtime overnight is not a major issue for ConsultLess.  O6. SECURE SOFTWARE  DEVELOPMENT  Small For ConsultLess the alternative would be off-the-shelf  software, so secure software development  is only a small  opportunity in this setting.  O7. PATCHING AND  UPDATING  Large ConsultLess have only one IT manager, and patching and  updating servers would take away a lot of time.  O8. BACKUPS  Large ConsultLess has only one IT manager, and keeping  backups would take up a lot of time.  O9: SERVER-SIDE STORAGE Large ConsultLess has employees which are mobile working  from home and at clients. Server-side storage mitigates  the risk of employees losing their devices.  42 Refer to the Cloud model visual in section 2.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  33  O10. SECURITY AS A SERVICE  AND SECURITY ADD-ONS  Large ConsultLess will use an add-on for scanning emails and  documents for malware.  O11. CERTIFICATION AND  COMPLIANCE  Large ConsultLess can refer to certification of the provider  making it much easier to fulfil their own compliance  obligations.  B.2.2 Assessing the security risks  Let’s look at the different risks in more detail.  RISK TYPE LIKELIHOOD IMPACT RISK  REMARKS  R1. SOFTWARE SECURITY  VULNERABILITIES  Medium High  Significant  ConsultLess uses the cloud  service for sensitive data so  the impact of vulnerabilities  is high.  ConsultLess will  select a vendor with a good  track record.  R2. NETWORK ATTACKS Medium High  Significant ConsultLess has employees  which are not tech-savvy, so  it is possible that spoofing,  sniffing and pharming  attacks are successful.  ConsultLess will secure its  internal wifi network and  raise awareness about  insecure network  connections, rogue hotspots,  etc.  R3. SOCIAL ENGINEERING  ATTACKS  Medium High Significant  ConsultLess has employees  which are not tech-savvy, so  it is possible that phishing  attacks are successful.  ConsultLess will raise  awareness about fake emails  asking for credentials etc.  R4. MANAGEMENT GUI AND  API COMPROMISE  Low High  Minor For ConsultLess the main risk  is the management portal. It  will select a cloud service  which has 2-factor  authentication for the  administrative user account.  It will also set a policy which  requires the administrative  user to use a liveCD for  administrative tasks.  R5. DEVICE THEFT/LOSS Medium High Significant ConsultLess uses the cloud  service for sensitive data so  device loss can be an issue.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  34  Using a cloud service  mitigates some issue  because less emails and  documents are on user  devices. ConsultLess will set  a policy requiring employees  to secure their devices from  unauthorized access.  R6. PHYSICAL HAZARDS Low Medium  Minor ConsultLess use the cloud  service for its business data,  which can not be lost. It will  select a cloud provider with  good physical security on its  sites and backups to multiple  sites to avoid data loss.  R7. OVERLOADS Low  Medium  Minor ConsultLess does not have  high availability  requirements. Outages are  acceptable.  R8. UNEXPECTED COSTS Low  Medium  Minor ConsultLess does not expect  dramatic usage patterns. It  will select a cloud provider  which warns about cost  increases.  R9. VENDOR LOCK-IN  High High Significant For ConsultLess this is a  significant risk. ConsultLess  will use the cloud service  only for emails and  documents stored in widely  used data-formats to  prevent lockin.  R10. ADMINISTRATIVE OR  LEGAL OUTAGES  Medium  High  Minor  ConsultLess does not foresee  major issues around  administrative or legal  disputes.  R11. FOREIGN JURISDICTION  ISSUES  Medium High  Significant  ConsultLess  is not subject to  any specific legal  requirements about cross- border processing or data  transfers.  The risks can be plotted in a matrix, showing what are key issues.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  35  Figure 3: Risks for ConsultLess (SME using SaaS)  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  36  Annex C:  Example scenario: EasyAgriSelling, SME using IaaS/PaaS  C.1 Introduction  EasyAgriSelling is a small tech start-up in the EU, which developed an online web shop software (as a  service) for farmers who would like to start direct-selling their vegetables and other products. Their  slogan is: “Selling your agricultural produce to consumers, made easy”. Farmers can set up an online  shop in a few clicks - customizing their shop with a logo, colours and a description of their farm.  EasyAgriSelling operates a pay-as-you-go model, charging no monthly fee, but only charging their  customers when products are sold.  EasyAgriSelling is a SaaS provider and they are a cloud services  customer building services on a cloud provider who offers them IaaS and PaaS on which to build their  product. In this document we are assessing risks and opportunities from both their roles as a service  provider and as a service customer.  The SaaS platform runs on top of the IaaS/PaaS platform. The  setup is depicted below.  Developer  EasyAgriSelling SME  Cloud service provider  Application servers, DBs, etc IaaS/PaaS  Farmer A Consumers  Helpdesk  Administration  Farmer B Farmer C  Webshop platform SaaS  C.1.1 Business drivers  For EasyAgriSelling there are many reasons for using an IaaS/PaaS cloud service: IaaS/PaaS computing  resources are elastic, so once their service takes off, they can easily scale up, without having to make  an upfront investment. A start-up with limited capital, they need to make the right investments into  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  37  building their product and responding to increasing demand. Cloud computing fits their long term  plan. Moreover, employees at EasyAgriSelling are web design specialists, while running and  maintaining the nuts and bolts of hardware and networks is not their competence. Key concerns are  availability, security and privacy of the payment data and some of the personal data of consumers  (home address, billing address etc.). EasyAgriSelling is responsible for the software security of the  online web shop software, the web interfaces used by the farmers (customers of EasyAgriSelling) and  the personal data and payment data of the consumers buying from the farmers.  C.1.2 Outsourcing information security tasks  EasyAgriSelling is a customer of an IaaS/PaaS service which it uses for running its web shop software  for farmers.  In this setting the security tasks the IaaS/PaaS provider carries out are:   Managing hardware and facilities, including physical security, power, cooling, etc.;   Managing the server operating systems and the application server, including development,  deployment, patching, updating, monitoring, checking logs, and so on. For example, it is the  responsibility of the provider to patch the server operating systems in time.  EasyAgriSelling, the customer, remains responsible43 for:   Managing the application software, including development, patching, updating, monitoring,  and checking logs, and so on. For example, it is the responsibility of EasyAgriSelling to fix  software flaws in the deployed web shop software;   Managing the accounts of the farmers using their web shop software, as well as the consumer  accounts, including resetting passwords, troubleshooting issues with payments etc.;   Managing backups of application software and data.  In this scenario some security tasks are outsourced to the provider, but many security tasks still have  to be carried out by the customer (EasyAgriSelling).  Security considerations in the procurement  process really only regard security of the facilities, the operating system and the application servers  which are under control of the provider.  C.2 Risks and opportunities  C.2.1 Assessing security opportunities  We look at the different opportunities for “EasyAgriSelling” in more detail in the table below:  OPPORTUNITY  RATING EXPLANATION  O1. GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD Medium For EasyAgriSelling geographic spread means more  resilience and it makes it easier to keep SLAs with the  farmers.  O2. ELASTICITY Large For EasyAgriSelling elasticity means it is easier to keep  SLAs with the farmers, even if one farmer has a peak in  demand.  O3. STANDARD FORMATS  AND INTERFACES  Medium For EasyAgriSelling it is important to be able to have the  cheapest  cloud provider, so standard formats for code  and virtual machines are important to be able to migrate  if a better offer is found on the market.  43 Refer to the cloud responsibilities model in section 2  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  38  O4. PHYSICAL SECURITY Medium For EasyAgriSelling it is important to outsource physical  security of the datacentre to a cloud provider.  “EasyAgriSelling” still needs to secure its employees’  end-user devices, but this is relatively easy.  O5. INCIDENT RESPONSE  AROUND THE CLOCK  Large For EasyAgriSelling 24/7 response means it is easier to  keep SLAs with the farmers.  O6. SECURE SOFTWARE  DEVELOPMENT  Small For EasyAgriSelling the main issue is security of its own  application software.  O7. PATCHING AND  UPDATING  Medium For EasyAgriSelling automated patching and updating of  the underlying application servers and operating  systems  can be time-consuming.  O8. BACKUPS Large For EasyAgriSelling backing up to a remote site can be  time-consuming, so it is very convenient to outsource  this.  O9 SERVER-SIDE STORAGE Small N/A – EasyAgriSelling is using IaaS/PaaS.  O10. SECURITY AS A  SERVICE AND SECURITY  AD-ONS  Small N/A – EasyAgriSelling just needs barebone virtual  hardware.  O11. CERTIFICATION AND  COMPLIANCE  Medium It is very important for EasyAgriSelling to show  compliance to industry standards. EasyAgriSelling will  select a vendor with a certification so its own compliance  obligation regard only the application software and the  processes around managing the famers’ webshops .  C.2.2 Assessing the risks  We look at the different risks in more details and rate them individually for this fictitious scenario:  RISK TYPE LIKELIHOOD IMPACT RISK  REMARKS  R1. SOFTWARE  SECURITY  VULNERABILITIES  High  Very high  Major  For EasyAgriSelling software  vulnerabilities are a big risk  (because the payment and  personal data of consumers is at  stake). EasyAgriSelling will look  closely at how the IaaS/PaaS is  patched and updated.  R2. NETWORK  ATTACKS  Medium  High  Significant  For EasyAgriSelling network  attacks are not a major issue,  because its employees are rather  savvy when it comes to using the  IaaS/PaaS.  R3. SOCIAL  ENGINEERING  ATTACKS  Medium  High  Significant For EasyAgriSelling network  attacks is an issue, because its  employees have access to a lot of  assets, and such attacks could  ruin the SME. EasyAgriSelling will  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  39  raise awareness on social  engineering with staff.  R4. MANAGEMENT  INTERFACE AND API  COMPROMISE  Medium  Very high  Major  For EasyAgriSelling network  attacks is an issue, because its  employees have access to a lot of  assets, and such attacks could  ruin the SME. EasyAgriSelling will  select a service which has two- factor authentication.  R5. DEVICE  THEFT/LOSS  Low Medium Minor For EasyAgriSelling this is a limited  issue because most sensitive data  (e.g. the payment data of  consumers) is not on their  employees’ end-user devices.  R6. PHYSICAL  HAZARDS  Low  Medium  Minor  For EasyAgriSelling physical  hazards are an important  risk,because it has SLAs to uphold  with the farmers.  R7. OVERLOADS Low Medium  Minor  For EasyAgriSelling overloads are  an important risk,because it has  SLAs to uphold with the farmers.  R8. UNEXPECTED  COSTS  Medium  Medium  Minor  For EasyAgriSelling this is not a  major risks because increased  costs are billed to farmers (pay- as-you-go) also.  R9. VENDOR LOCK IN  High  Very high  Major For EasyAgriSelling it is important  not to be tied to one provider, so  it can always go to the cheapest  cloud provider.  EasyAgriSelling  will select a provider which  supports standard formats for  code and virtual machines.  R10. ADMINISTRATIVE  OR LEGAL OUTAGES  Medium  High  Minor For EasyAgriSelling administrative  and legal outages are an  important risk, because it has  SLAs to uphold with the farmers.  R11. FOREIGN  JURISDICTION ISSUES  Medium  High  Significant  EasyAgriSelling works with  farmers and consumers from  several countries. The data and  processes are about simple e- commerce and there are no  specific legal requirements that  could cause issues with foreign  jurisdiction.  We show the different risks in a matrix (see below).

SMEs also stand to gain the most from cloud computing, because it is complicated and costly for  them to set-up and run ICT in the traditional way. SMEs do not always understand all the information  security risks and opportunities of cloud computing. This document aims to provide guidance for small  and medium size enterprises (SMEs) about the network information security of cloud computing. It is  important that SMEs do not only look at the network and information security risks of cloud computing  but also at the opportunities to improve their network and information security. This document  contains 3 main parts:   First, we highlight 11 security opportunities, explaining why certain features of cloud  computing could present an opportunity for SMEs. We make a brief comparison also with  traditional IT deployments.   Secondly, we list 11 security risks SMEs should take into account when adopting cloud  computing. We compare also the risks with typical traditional IT deployments.   Thirdly, we provide  a list of the 12 most important security questions SMEs could use to  understand better what are the security aspects of a cloud service when procuring a cloud  service or when assessing different options in the market.  The security questions address  both the risks and the opportunities.  In an annex the SME can find empty forms to use for assessing risks, assessing opportunities and  collecting relevant information about the security aspects of a cloud service: a security cheat sheet.  Risks and opportunities can be very different for different SMEs. A lot depends on the type of cloud  service, the kind of data and processes involved, and other. Still to provide some practical examples  we elaborate two specific scenarios where an SME is a cloud customer:  ● ConsultLess, a 20 people consultancy firm, which wants to implement email and document  management as a SaaS cloud service.  ● EasyAgriSelling, a 10 people technology startup, which wants to run their webshop platform  (for farmers to create e-shops to sell their produce) on top of a IaaS/PaaS cloud service.  Although not the focus of this document we address the issue of legal compliance briefly. We touch  upon the main concepts of EU personal data protection legislation and we provide some pointers to  relevant information.  This guide for SMEs updates the 2009 ENISA Cloud Computing Risk Assessment for SMEs and the 2009  ENISA Assurance Framework. We have deliberately consolidated the risks and reduced the number of  security questions to make it more suitable for SMEs, with limited time and resources to go into a lot  of details. It is important to stress that this guideline should not be seen as a replacement for the  SME’s own risk assessment. Security measures should be appropriate to the risks; not always gold- plated solutions are necessary.  Since 2009 the cloud computing market has changed significantly. There are now many SMEs,  enterprises and government organizations who use some form of cloud computing. Cloud computing  has now become the backbone of the EU’s digital economy. Cloud services offered by providers are  more mature, there is more choice, there is more information for customers and customers are more  aware of the possibilities and limitations of cloud computing.  At the same time a number of issues have remained problematic, such as personal data protection  legislation and the impact of foreign jurisdiction. In 2012, the European Commission issued the  EU  cloud strategy aiming to address a number of these issues. The strategy is an important initiative and  the first results are currently being delivered.

This guide contains a list of 11 security  opportunities for network and information security (see Section 3) and a list of 11 network and  information security risks SMEs (see Section 4). These lists of opportunities and risks can be used  directly by SMEs when they procure cloud services. For two specific fictitious scenarios we rate the  risks and opportunities: An SME using SaaS for email and documents (see Annex B) and an SME using  IaaS/PaaS for running a webshop platform (see Annex C). This guide also contains a list of security  questions SMEs can use to understand the main features of the cloud service most relevant for  network and informations security (see Section 5). Annex D contains empty forms for use during  procurement. Although not the focus of the this guide, we address legal compliance and provide some  pointers to information about personal data protection legislation in Annex A.  Scope  Network and information security  This document focusses on network and information security risks and opportunities; not other issues  like legal compliance, legislation, contractual issues. In the annexes we briefly address personal data  protection legislation, just to point to some relevant concepts and information.  Cloud relevant  This document focuses on the risks and opportunities which are relevant for an SME to consider. These  opportunities and risks are not specific for cloud computing but may pertain to other types of ICT.  Cloud customers  We focus on SMEs in the role of customers of cloud services, not on providers.  Target audience  This guide is aimed at micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs )1. SMEs often have few IT or  information security experts and it is infeasible for SMEs to negotiate with providers about custom  features or custom contracts. SMEs typically buy standardized (off the shelf) services under fixed  (boilerplate) contracts and SLAs. This document will be useful also for other small organisations, like  government agencies.  Methodology  This guide has been created in close collaboration with the ENISA Cloud Security and Resilience expert  group (public sector, private sector and industry association), based on the 2009 ENISA risk  assessment guide. The risks and opportunities have been extensively cross checked and reviewed by  subject matter experts.  Disclaimer about examples  In this document we sometimes give examples of past incidents. It is not our intention to single out  specific services or specific providers for praise or criticism.  1 http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm  http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/facts-figures-analysis/sme-definition/index_en.htm  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  2  Policy Context: the European Cloud Strategy  In 2012, the European Commission (EC) published its cloud computing strategy2, called \"Unleashing  the potential of cloud computing in Europe”. The EU cloud strategy is designed to support the uptale  of cloud computing across the EU. It centres around three key actions:  1. Standardization and certification of cloud services.  2. Safe and fair contract terms and SLAs, and a  3. Setting up a European cloud partnership to promote cloud computing adoption in the EU.  The EU Cloud strategy and the vision produced by the European Cloud Partnership both stress the  importance of facilitating the adoption of cloud computing by SMEs, because they stand to gain most  from cloud computing and they are an important driver for innovation and growth in the EU.  The ex-vice president of the EU’s Digital Agenda, Miss Kroes, said explicitly: “These issues [blocking  adoption of cloud computing] are particularly troublesome for smaller companies, which stand to  benefit the most from the Cloud, but do not have a lot of spending power, nor resources for individual  negotiations with Cloud suppliers”.  ENISA has supported several actions under the EU cloud strategy: ENISA participated  in the working  group on cloud standardisation led by ETSI3. ENISA works with the EC and industry to create a list of  cloud certification schemes4. ENISA also works in a working group which aims to clarify and harmonize  Cloud SLAs5.  Earlier drafts of this document have been developed as part of the activities of the European Cloud  Partnership, by F-Secure Corporation (http://www.f-secure.com).  Past ENISA work  Since 2009 ENISA has engaged with the cloud industry and potential cloud customers and published a  series of reports on cloud computing. Generally speaking ENISA supports the uptake of cloud  computing because of the many opportunities the technology offers to improve network and  information security. These are particularly relevant for SMEs which do not always have the resources  and/or skills to implement state-of-the-art network and information security. Explaining the security  opportunities (and the risks) of cloud computing is therefore an important objective for ENISA.  This document is based on  previous ENISA work. In particular it updates two previous documents:  ● The 2009 ENISA Cloud computing risk assessment, which lists opportunities and risks when  adopting cloud computing6.  ● The 2009 ENISA Assurance framework for cloud computing, which provides a list of questions  for SMEs to ask when procuring cloud services7.  We have consolidated the risks and reduced the number of security questions in the 2009 publications  to make it more suitable for SMEs, with limited time and resources to go into a lot of details.  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-computing-strategy  3 http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/standards-cloud-neelie-kroess-blog  4 http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/making-cloud-more-transparent-boost-secure-trustworthy-services  5  https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/07/articles/european-commission-issues-cloud-service-level-agreement-standardization- guidelines/  6 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment  7 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance-framework  http://www.etsi.org/news-events/news/734-2013-12-press-release-report-on-cloud-computing-standards https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/cloud-service-level-agreement-standardisation-guidelines https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-partnership http://www.f-secure.com/en/web/home_global https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-cloud-computing-strategy http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/standards-cloud-neelie-kroess-blog http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/en/content/making-cloud-more-transparent-boost-secure-trustworthy-services https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/07/articles/european-commission-issues-cloud-service-level-agreement-standardization-guidelines/ https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2014/07/articles/european-commission-issues-cloud-service-level-agreement-standardization-guidelines/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-risk-assessment https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/files/deliverables/cloud-computing-information-assurance-framework  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  3  2 Cloud Computing Basics  In this section the three basic types of cloud services are introduced and the different division of  security tasks is explained.  One can distinguish among three different types of cloud services, each involving different types of  assets:  Figure 1: Asset in cloud computing  We go over the diagram from left to right:  ● Infrastructure as a Service: In IaaS the provider delivers computing resources (virtual  hardware), accessible online. The software providing access to the resources is called the  hypervisor. Generally speaking there are two types of resources: processing power (including  network resources), and (block) storage (memory resources). Examples include Amazon’s  Elastic Compute Cloud, Google’s Compute Engine, Amazon Simple Storage Service, Dropbox,  Rackspace, etc. Note that object storage services (e.g. Dropbox) are often considered a SaaS.  ● Platform as a Service: In PaaS, the provider delivers a platform, or more precisely, application  servers, for customers to run applications on. PaaS providers sometimes provide a software  development tool for the platform. Examples of applications running on these platforms are  scripts (PHP, Python, e.g.) or byte code (Java servlets, C#). Examples include Google App  engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, etc.  ● Software as a Service: In SaaS, the provider delivers full-fledged software or applications, via  the internet. Applications range from email servers, document editors, customer relationship  management systems, and so on. SaaS services can often be accessed with a browser or a web  services client. Note that it is not uncommon for SaaS providers to run their applications on  an IaaS or PaaS from another provider. An example is the video streaming site Netflix (SaaS)  which runs on Amazon AWS computing services (PaaS/IaaS).  ● Facilities denote the physical structures and supplies such as networks, cooling, power, etc.  ● Organisation denotes the human resources, the policies and procedures for maintaining the  facilities and supporting the delivery of the services.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  4  In cloud computing delivery of ICT resources is, to some extent, outsourced to the cloud provider. Also  some of the security tasks (such as monitoring, patching, incident response) are outsourced.  Depending on the type of cloud service some tasks remain under the responsibility of the customer,  while other tasks remain under the responsibility of the provider. Division of responsibilities can some  times be a major source of problems as it was based on assumptions and poorly documented, leading  to overlaps and gaps. This however seem to become extinct since SLAs have become more  sophisticated documents and specify this information. For example, in IaaS/PaaS the customers run  their own code on top of the cloud service, and often remain responsible for this (application)  software. In SaaS, on the other hand, the application software is usually8 under control of the provider.  In the diagram below we illustrate how the division of certain security tasks can be different for  different cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).  SaaSPaaSIaaS  C u  sto m  e r  P ro  vid er  Manage user accounts, user permissions, etc.  Manage and protect supplies and facilities (power, cooling, cabling, guards, etc. )  Deploy, update and  patch application  software.  Deploy and maintain hardware (server racks, disks, routers, cables, etc. )  Deploy, update and patch application software.  Deploy, update and  patch OS  Deploy, update and patch application server  Deploy, update and patch OS  Figure 2: Outsourcing of tasks is different for different types of services  Note that this diagram is for illustration and does not provide an exhaustive list of security processes  at the providers side or the customers side. In specific settings there may be specific agreements about  the outsourcing of security tasks. An IaaS provider, for example, might have a service for patching the  Operating System (OS) of customers. Sometimes such services are offered by a third-party (and this is  also known as SECurity-As-A-Service). See the next section about opportunities. See also the annex for  examples of security tasks in two fictitious scenarios.  In practice for SMEs, it is important to carefully assess which security tasks are outsourced to the  provider and which security tasks remain under their own responsibility. It is not uncommon for SMEs  to be confused about their responsibilities concerning security, for example, who makes backups of  data or software, which type of failover/redundancy is offered by the provider and what needs to be  done still by the customer.  8 Barring cases where customers have some liberty to run additional software, on top-of-the service, like third- party apps, add-ons, or self-created code.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  5  3 Network and information security opportunities  Cloud computing can be used by SMEs for a range of different applications (email, corporate website,  CRM, CMS, internal payroll processing, archiving of internal corporate documents, etc). For SMEs  cloud computing can offer many business advantages:  Cloud services are typically “pay as you go”,  which may be an attractive cost structure for an SME, avoiding an upfront investment in hardware,  software and IT experts. The overall costs when implementing are often lower than the cost when  going with traditional IT solutions. Online collaboration is often easier in the cloud case as access is  warranted to users from various physical locations, and various end-user devices etc.  There are also opportunities for network and information security. Generally speaking large cloud  computing providers can offer advanced security measures, while spreading the associated costs  across several customers. In some cases this means that fundamental security settings might be  ‘shared’ between costumers and might not be customisable but it also translates to a number of  specific security opportunities. Below we highlight 11 specific opportunities for the network and  information security of SMEs:  Network and information security opportunities  O1: Geographic spread  O2: Elasticity  O3: Standard formats and interfaces  O4: Physical security  O5: Incident response around-the-clock  O6: Software development  O7: Patching and updating  O8: Backups  O9: Server-side storage  O10: Security-as-a-service and security add-ons  O11: Certification and compliance  The rest of this section goes over each opportunity, explaining briefly why this could present an  opportunity for an SME. For each opportunity a comparison with traditional IT deployments exists and  points the reader to the relevant security questions in Section 6, which can be used in a procurement  process.  As every SME is different, not all of these security opportunities are important to the same degree for  all customers. Note that this report does not provide a rating or a ranking of the opportunities. In  annex two specific (fictitious) scenarios, are examined and rating of the opportunities takes place  using the following scale:  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  6  - Small opportunity: Customer could exploit this opportunity, but benefits would be limited.  - Medium opportunity: Customer should exploit this  opportunity, because benefits would be significant.  - Large opportunity: Customer must exploit this  opportunity, as there would be crucial benefits.  O1: Geographic spread  Cloud computing datacentres are often spread out across different geographic regions, nationally or  globally. Geographic spread can provide resiliency against regional issues and local disasters such as  storms, earthquakes, or cable cuts.  It can also be used  to mitigate certain Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,  allowing customers to get access at other locations.  Geographic spread can help reduce network latency,  because the services are provided from sites closer to  the customer. This could improve the overall  availability and performance of the service.  It should be stressed here that not all cloud services  come with geographic spread, and that sometimes it is available but needs to be first  configured/requested by the customer specifically. Depending on the settings this might involve extra  costs, because data synchronization across two remote sites requires network bandwidth, computing  power and storage.  See security question SQ 3 (in Section 6).  O2: Elasticity  Cloud computing providers can use large data centres  with large amounts of spare resources, to be able to  respond to rapid changes in resource usage, peak usage,  and Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.  It should be noted here that not all cloud services offer  the same kind of elasticity. There may be limits on  resource consumption set by the provider or the  customer. In some settings elasticity may need to be  configured/requested specifically by the customer, and  may increase costs.  See SQ11.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional  IT deployments an SME would have to set  up an additional remote site, sometimes  even doubling the costs for IT facilities.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments a SME  would need to invest in spare resources  to accommodate peak usage, yielding  high costs and inefficiency (because  these resources would be unused most  of the time).  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  7  O3: Standard formats and interfaces  The idea of cloud computing is to offer one service to  many customers at once. This means that in practice  cloud services are often compliant with industry-wide  standards. For example, most PaaS providers offer  standard PHP application servers and many SaaS  providers implement standard interfaces based on  standards like XML and JSON (JavaScript Object  Notation). This means that cloud services can be more  easily integrated with other services, or ported to other  platforms. This is a security opportunity because it  facilitates backup, failover, and integration with existing  security tools the customer may use, for example monitoring tools.  It should be noted here that while most cloud providers use standard interfaces and data formats, this  is not always the case. Customers should ask which standards are used.  See SQ 10, SQ 11.  O4: Physical security  In case the business model of the SME includes shared  resources requirements then physical security is indeed  an opportunity when using cloud. Resource  concentration makes physical security relatively cheap. If  the costs of physical security measures, such as perimeter  protection, 24/7 guards, alarm systems, camera  surveillance, automated fire extinguishers etc., can be  shared with many customers then the cost per customer  is low. In practice this means that cloud providers can  offer state-of-the-art physical security measures which drastically reduce the risk of physical theft of  servers, disks and equipment, fires, floods, etc.  See SQ 1, SQ 3, SQ 6.  O5: Incident response around-the-clock  Security incidents can happen at any time of the day or  night. To ensure continuity most cloud providers  continuously monitor their services around-the-clock and  have response capabilities standing by to react to failures  or attacks. Having personnel ready 24/7 is costly, but in  cloud computing these security measures become  affordable for customers because the costs are shared  with many customers.  Note that cloud providers do not always monitor and respond to all types of security incidents which  could affect a cloud service or a cloud customer. Customers should check which kind of security  incidents are monitored and responded to, and what kind of response actions will be undertaken by  the provider, to understand what remains to be done by the customer.  See SQ 1, SQ 2, SQ 3.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments SMEs often  use non-standard custom  configurations and proprietary  protocols, because of a lack of expertise  and the (sometimes) higher costs of  implementing standards.  Compared with traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments even a  standard security measure like a guard  on premise 24/7, would be too costly  for an SME.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments, an SME  would have to invest a lot to have a  24/7 incident response capability.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  8  O6: Secure software development  Secure software development is not easy and  requires a lot of time and investment in people,  tools, and processes. Even building a simple  website is rife with security pitfalls. A secure  software development pipeline (unit tests,  continuous integration, penetration and security  tests, load tests, and most importantly, skilled and  trained software programmers) is not easy to set- up and maintain. To build custom software, securely, is expensive, and outsourcing software coding is  not always cheap or easy either.  Because of their scale, cloud providers can afford to invest in secure software development, spreading  these high costs across many customers. Customers may lose some flexibility in terms of  customization, but they reduce the risk of software vulnerabilities in code they developed.  Note that not all cloud software is developed securely. Some providers may have bad development  practices. Other providers may use third-party software (proprietary or open source), over which they  have limited control. Customers should assess which software is developed by the provider and how  the provider ensures secure software development.  See SQ 1, SQ 7, SQ 8.  O7: Patching and updating  Timely patching and updating of software is crucial for security as attackers need only a small window  to attack and exploit a discovered vulnerability. Particularly when standard, off-the-shelf software is  used, cyber criminals pay particular attention to  provider patches and often try to reverse engineer  a patch in order to exploit the underlying  vulnerability; and this can happen in a matter of  hours. In fact, many cyber-attacks exploit the fact  that organisations are slow to update and patch  systems. Due to their scale, and because they  deliver the same software to all customers, cloud  providers can automate patching and updating to  a high degree. They can set up procedures and  tools which automatically9 deploy timely patches  and updates, reducing the  window in which  systems can be exploited by attackers.  Note that not all the software relevant to the customer is always patched and updated by the provider.  Particularly in IaaS and PaaS, the customer runs its own software on top of the cloud infrastructure  and the customer usually remains responsible for patching and updating it. Customers should ask who  patches and updates the relevant software in their setting.  See SQ 7, SQ 8, SQ 9.  9 Note that in some settings automated patching and updating might break functionality, especially when customers are  using services or APIs in a non-standard way, or when customers run their code on top of a cloud services, like in IaaS/PaaS.  Of course this is also an issue in traditional IT deployments, and often the reason for delays in patching and updating.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  deployments, if off-the-shelf software  cannot be used, then an SME would need to  invest significant resources in a secure  software development.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  deployments, SMEs often need to dedicate a  lot of time and resources to patch and update  their software. Even then they are often late.  The fact that traditional IT deployments are  often not industry-standard further  complicates updating/patching because of  incompatibility issues.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  9  O8: Backups  For an SME, making backups, across a range of applications and devices, and restoring them when  needed, can be difficult and time-consuming. Cloud providers can implement tools to automate  creation and testing of backupsand offer advanced backup  restore solutions, allowing customers to roll-back mistakes  and errors quickly. Additionally, in many cloud usage  scenarios software applications are implemented as online  (client-server) applications (as opposed to running stand- alone on clients). This reduces the amount of data that is on  the end-user device, simplifying backups.  Backups in the cloud (between cloud data centres) require  both storage and network bandwidth and in some settings cloud providers do not provide backups  automatically of all data, for free. Customers should assess which backups are made by the provider  and if they need to implement or request additional back-up mechanisms.  See SQ 3.  O9: Server-side storage  In many settings, SMEs have a range of mobile (and less mobile) end-user devices which are relatively  vulnerable to theft, loss, physical damage, etc. These threats can easily have a big impact on the assets  of an SME. Especially when dealing with mobile devices, it is  not always easy to keep timely backups of data (due to  connectivity andbandwidth issues), nor to cryptographically  protect the device components, from physical access to  device storage (i.e. after loss or theft), nor to control access  to devices with strong authentication etc. Cloud computing  can mitigate some of these risks. Using cloud services SMEs  can reduce the amount of data on the end-user devices. For  example, using cloud-based email, SMEs can reduce the  amount of corporate data on end-user devices, meaning that  less data is at stake when something goes wrong with end-user devices.  Customers should assess which data is stored server-side, and client-side.  See SQ 8.  O10: Security-as-a-service and security add-ons  As discussed in the previous section, some security tasks  remain with the customer, particularly in the case of IaaS  and PaaS. In cloud computing it is often more easy to  outsource some of these security tasks to third-parties or  the provider (if it offers such services). For example, an SME  running custom software on an IaaS platform, could get a  third-party to patch its OS regularly detect and respond to  security incidents by isolating and replacing infected hosts  instantly. Such security-as-a-service would be much harder  to implement in a traditional IT deployment, typically  requiring physical access to the premises.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In a  traditional IT deployment, an SME  need to dedicate time and resources  to backups leading to high costs.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments it is often  harder for an SME to use security-as- a-service because often in such  settings access to the SME’s  premises would be needed, or at the  very least a high-bandwidth  connection.  Cloud versus traditional IT: Often in  traditional IT there is a significant  amount of data on end-user  devices, which further complicates  back-ups.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  10  There are cloud providers who provide a range of  additional security services (such as patching  software), sometimes partnering with specialized (third-party) firms, enabling customers to procure  additional security services in an easy way.  See SQ 2.  O11: Certification and compliance  In cloud computing one cloud service is offered to many  customers at once. Certification, by independent auditors,  against network and information security standards (like  ISO27001 certification10), could be used by customers to  fulfil their own compliance obligation. An auditor, when  assessing compliance of an SME, would not have to check all  the assets underlying the cloud services, by using existing  compliance certificates for the cloud services they use.  Note that there may be standards or compliance processes  which are not cloud-ready. For example there may be settings where auditors need physical access to  ICT assets, which (in a cloud computing scenario) might be impossible or infeasible because cloud  providers may not always allow all sorts of audits of and visits to their datacentres11.  Use SQ 1.  Understanding opportunities with security questions  For each opportunity we point the reader to relevant security questions in Section 6, which can be  used in a procurement process, to understand if and how opportunities can be used.

Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT deployments, an  auditor would have to cover all the  ICT assets and check compliance to  standards or policies from scratch,  yielding high costs for SMEs.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  11  O10: Security-as-a-service and security add-ons SQ 2  O11: Certification and compliance SQ 1  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  12  4 Network and information security risks  In this section we look at 11 important security risks which should be taken into account by SMEs:  Network and information security risks  R1: Software security vulnerabilities  R2: Network attacks  R3: Social engineering attacks  R4: Management GUI and API compromise  R5: Device theft/loss  R6: Physical hazards  R7: Overloads  R8: Unexpected costs  R9: Vendor lock-in  R10: Administrative or legal outages  R11: Foreign jurisdiction issues  For each risk we refer the reader to relevant security questions (section 5) to answer during  procurement of a cloud service. These questions should help customers understand if certain risks  need to be addressed.  In this section the risks are are not ranked or rated, because risks depend on the specific setting (the  type of SME, the type of cloud service, the data or processes involved, and other).  In annex two (fictitious) scenarios are analysed,  rating the risks using the product of likelihood and  the impact of a threat (following the ISO 27005 12 standard on risk management).  The scale used is  depicted in the figure below, and  ranges from 1 to 5: very low (1), low (2), medium (3), high (4), very  high (5).  Black is used to  indicate threats  which are rare but  could have high  impact. These risks  (also called “black  swans”) should be  handled with care  because the  organisation often  has little hands-on  experience in  dealing with these  incidents.  12 http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27005.html  http://www.iso27001security.com/html/27005.html  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  13  R1: Software security vulnerabilities  Software vulnerabilities in cloud software could have a major impact on customers. For example if an  SME uses a SaaS email service, which is vulnerable to SQL injection, then this vulnerability could lead  to a breach of confidentiality of the customer’s emails, severely damaging the SME’s reputation.  It is important to understand who is responsible for which  software component. In the case of SaaS, all the  responsibility for preventing software vulnerabilities is  with the provider. In IaaS/PaaS, however, the customer is  responsible for the software it runs on top of IaaS/PaaS,  barring any special arrangements13.  Remark on isolation failures14: Certain types of software  vulnerabilities could lead to one customer getting access to  another customer’s data, either directly or via a side- channel: these vulnearbilities are called isolation failures15.  In non-cloud settings, isolation failures are less of an issue  since there is no co-tenancy.  Especially if sensitive data is involved, it is important to ask  the right questions regarding software security. Some well-known SaaS providers are among the  largest companies in the world, and they boost a great track record and advanced security measures.  But this does not imply that all SaaS providers always do a great job at software security. One  complicating factor is that cloud software vulnerabilities become more attractive to attackers/hackers  to exploit, because this would allow them to attack many customers at once.  See security question SQ 7 (in Section 6).  Example: In 2011 a large SaaS provider deployed new software, which had unknown for the  time  vulnerabilities causing an isolation failure that was effectively allowing users to log into  accounts using any password. The bug was alive for approximately 4 hours16.  R2: Network attacks  Cloud computing services are consumed and managed  via internet connections. This means that customers  need to be aware of the risk of network attacks, like  spoofing websites, sniffing/eavesdropping network  traffic, Denial-of-Service attacks, man-in-the-middle  attacks, pharming, wiretapping, etc., on the normal end- user interfaces, as well management/administrator  interfaces, application programming interfaces (APIs),  webservices.  See SQ 8.  13 The different assets supporting cloud services are explained in Section 2.  14 This type of failure (Isolation failure) was separately mentioned in ENISA’s 2009 risk assessment.  15 An example of an isolation failure is described at:  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/06/21/dropbox- lets-anyone-log-in-as-anyone/  16 http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/  Cloud versus traditional IT: Cloud  service providers (using economies of  scale) can implement advanced  processes to develop, deploy and  maintain software, which reduces the  likelihood of software vulnerabilities.  In traditional IT deployments it is  expensive for an SME to set up state- of-the-art processes for software  development and maintenance.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In  traditional IT, key systems like servers  are typically managed locally, on- premise, which reduces the risk of  network attacks on administrative  interfaces. Many organisations  provide online access to services, so a  number of these network attacks are  also a risk in traditional IT.  http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/06/21/dropbox-lets-anyone-log-in-as-anyone/ http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/06/21/dropbox-lets-anyone-log-in-as-anyone/ http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  14  Example: DDoS attacks on one customer of a large (SaaS) reverse proxy and DNS service, had a  severe impact on the internet connections for many other users, affecting their use of cloud  services. 17  R3: Social engineering attacks  In cloud computing, some administrative processes, like issuing user credentials, do not happen face- to-face between colleagues, but online via emails and websites. This increases the risk of social  engineering attacks, in which an attacker fakes communication or information so it appears to come  from a trusted source, like the cloud provider, etc. For example an attacker might try to impersonate  a customer and initiate a “credential recovery”  process, which eventually allows the attacker to  access the customer’s account, and access or delete  all the customer data. Or, vice versa, attackers might  try to impersonate the provider and in this way  obtain the customer’s credentials (aka phishing).  Attackers may target normal users, or users with  high-privilege roles, such as software developers,  system administrators, managers, both on the cloud  provider’s and the customer’s side.  SMEs should take into account the risk of social  engineering, such as phishing/spear-phishing,  spoofing, etc. and assess the potential impact on the  data and processes.  See SQ 8  Example: Famously a journalist from Wired (a technology magazine) wrote about his ordeal when,  an attacker, using a social engineering attack, managed to access his (SaaS) email account. Using  the email account, the attacker hacked also other accounts of the victim and wiped data from his  devices.18  R4: Management interface compromise  Most cloud services offer the customer a management interface, which give administrators access to  a a large number of assets; in the case of SaaS, all the user accounts of the SMEs employees for  example, or in the case of IaaS/PaaS, all the different virtual machines and applications of the SME.  Sometimes the cloud service. If an attacker can get access to this interface then damage can be big for  an SME.  Customers should verify that providers offer secure  interfaces with good authentication and  authorization mechanisms, particularly for high- privilege role like administrators. Additionally,  customers should take into account the security of  PCs and browsers used by administrators and high- privilege roles, because if attackers get control of  17 http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-ddos-that-almost-broke-the-internet/  18 http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/  Cloud versus traditional IT: Social  engineering is an issue also in traditional IT  deployments. In a way social engineering is  technology-agnostic. However, it must be  said that in traditional IT a number of  critical processes (like credential recovery,  etc) are often carried out face-to-face. So  customer should take extra care,  particularly to prevent attacks on  administrator’s interfaces.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional  IT interfaces are often only accessible  from the local company network and from  local workstations, which provides some  protection against phishing and spoofing.  http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-ddos-that-almost-broke-the-internet/ http://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  15  those, then they could by-pass some protection measures taken by the provider  See SQ7, SQ 8, SQ 9.  Example: A company, offering code backup and code repositories (as a SaaS) for software  developers, stopped its operations permanently when an attacker had deleted virtual machines,  storage volumes and backup data via the cloud management interface 19.  R5: Device theft or loss  One of the defining characteristics of cloud computing, and key advantages, is accessibility from both  fixed and mobile devices, PCs, tablets, smartphones, and so on. This introduces also some new risks.  Mobile devices are relatively vulnerable to theft and loss. Theft and loss could mean data and/or  authentication credentials on the devices could get stolen by attackers.  A complicating factor, for SMEs, is the trend bring- your-own-device (BYOD), which means that  employees use different types of devices, not fully  under control of the SME’s IT experts. Features like  screenlock, disk and storage media encryption, and  many more may work differently on different types  of devices.  Cloud customers should assess which data and  authentication credentials are stored on end-user  devices, and ensure that device theft/loss is  mitigated, by using backups, encryption, data minimization, etc.  See SQ 3, SQ 8  R6: Physical hazards  Natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, or fires, can affect the customer’s ICT asset, or the data  centres and infrastructure of a cloud provider. In cloud computing, customers might be affected by  natural disasters occurring far away from their own premises.  Note that IaaS/PaaS customers might need to  specify if and which data centres will be used as  failover.  SMEs should have a business continuity strategy  which addresses the risk of physical hazards. As  part of this strategy, customers should ask which  measures are in place to protect the cloud service  from physical hazards. Customers might need to  consider backing up their data regularly, in a  standard format, to be able to migrate to another  datacenter or another provider when needed.  See SQ 1, SQ 2, SQ 3, SQ 5, SQ 10.  19  http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/code-spaces-a-lesson-in-cloud-backup/a/d- id/1279116  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional  ICT deployments the impact of device  theft/loss is typically higher, because there  is more code and data on end-user devices.  At the same time mobile devices are less  common in traditional IT settings.  Cloud versus traditional IT: Cloud providers  can invest in state-of-the-art perimeter  defence, because the associated costs are  spread across many customers.  In cloud  computing natural disasters are often  mitigated by using multiple geographically  spread datacentres.  http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/code-spaces-a-lesson-in-cloud-backup/a/d-id/1279116 http://www.networkcomputing.com/cloud-infrastructure/code-spaces-a-lesson-in-cloud-backup/a/d-id/1279116  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  16  Example: Thousands of customers of two major cloud providers were affected by a lightning struck  in the Dublin region in summer 2011. The outage lasted 2 days20.  Example: A large scale electrical storm caused an outage in a large cloud provider affecting the  datacentre facilities. The outcome was that 3 major public services were out for more than 8 hours  affecting thousand customers that didn’t have access and, in some cases, lost data.21  R7: Overloads  Sharing infrastructure offers great cost-savings and economies of scale - allowing customers to get  more value for less costs. Logical isolation ensures that tenants cannot access each other’s data, but  cloud tenants still use the same physical  infrastructure, so customers may be affected by  peaks in resource usage by other tenants or DoS  attacks on other tenants.  Cloud customers should ask if and how their cloud  service handles peaks in demand or increased usage.  Cloud customers should also check the service level  agreements (SLA) which should guarantee  availability of their service (or penalty fees or refunds  in the case of outages).  See SQ 3, SQ 11.  Example: A cloud provider suffered an outage that seemed managable in the beginning, but lasted  longer than expected. During the outage, there was a large number of reboot requests from  customers, which caused a bottleneck, and caused outages for customers22.  R8: Unexpected costs  Cloud computing is often pay-as-you-go, which means costs are not always fixed. This also means that  costs could unexpectedly become very high. For example, customer may get a high bill because one  of their websites becomes very popular, because employees upload and store a lot of data,  or because  attackers mount a DoS attack, consuming all the  resources. One could argue the risk of unexpected  costs is not purely an information security risk (but  rather a business risk) but we nevertheless discuss  it here briefly, because unexpected costs could  quickly lead to financial issues which could result in  an outage.  Customers should check how their service scales  with increased usage and what are the associated  costs.  See SQ 11.  20 http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/08/bpos_amazon_power_outages/  21 https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/  22  http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Amazon-Cloud-Outage-Caused-by-Storms-Worsened-by-  Software-Glitches-280060/  Cloud versus traditional IT: In cloud  computing overloads are often mitigated by  providing customers with elasticity, using  spare resources, while in traditional IT it is  often much more expensive for customers  to have large amount of spare resources.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  costs are often fixed, although it should be  said they are usually higher than in cloud  computing, especially for smaller  organisations.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/08/bpos_amazon_power_outages/ https://aws.amazon.com/message/67457/ http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Amazon-Cloud-Outage-Caused-by-Storms-Worsened-by-Software-Glitches-280060/ http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Cloud-Computing/Amazon-Cloud-Outage-Caused-by-Storms-Worsened-by-Software-Glitches-280060/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  17  Example: An engineering team in an SME forgot to shut down a cluster of 250 servers over a  weekend — a $23,000 mistake since the servers were idle during that period. A marketing group  decided to run analysis on data collected in the cloud on their local servers — after downloading  10 TBs of data, they racked up $1000 dollars in unexpected data transfer fees23.  R9: Vendor lock-in  Vendor lock-in (also called customer lock-in) is a situation  where it is hard for the customer to migrate to another  cloud provider. For SMEs vendor lock-in can become a  financial issue but it can also become a security risk, for  example when circumstances force a customer to migrate  to another provider, for example in case of a legal conflict,  issues about billing, major outages, etc. If the customer  does not use  standard data formats and interfaces, then  migration may become difficult and/or time-consuming.  Customers should have a business continuity strategy,  which includes migration/exit plans for moving data and/or processes to another provider. As part of  this strategy, customers should consider backing up their data regularly, in a standard format, to be  able to migrate when needed, and test regularly if migration works.  See SQ 10.  Example: A cloud storage pioneer, closed its doors and left over 1,000 customers with only two  weeks to save their data that was hosted on the cloud storage provider24.  R10: Administrative or legal aspects  Administrative and/or legal conflicts (even if no technology breaks or gets hacked) could have an  impact on the availability of a cloud service. For example when a provider goes bankrupt and creditors  could threaten to confiscate assets belonging to the supplier, then backups may become unavailable,  before customers can migrate out. Service may also be interrupted when the cloud provider gets a  legal court-order to cease operations, for example  because of legal proceedings against the provider or  against one of their customers/tenants. Cloud  customers could also end up in an administrative  dispute about billing for example.  The obligations of the provider are described in the  contract the two parties counter sign; the contract  should address SLA issues, jurisdiction, liability,  indemnity etc. The contract need to be negotiated carefully and fully understood especially by SMEs.  Customers should assess the risk of outages caused by administrative or legal issues and assess  whether security measures need to be taken to mitigate this risk.  See SQ 4.  23 http://formtek.com/blog/cloud-computing-companies-worry-about-unexpected-costs-and-fees/  24  http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612299/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-provider-nirvanix-is-closing-its- doors.html  Cloud versus traditional IT: Cloud  computing is often  more standard than  legacy IT (using standard XML/HTML  interfaces, standard data formats, standard  VM images, etc), which reduces vendor  lock-in.  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  there is often is less dependence on third- parties, hence administrative or legal issues  usually have less impact.  http://formtek.com/blog/cloud-computing-companies-worry-about-unexpected-costs-and-fees/ http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612299/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-provider-nirvanix-is-closing-its-doors.html http://www.infoworld.com/article/2612299/cloud-storage/cloud-storage-provider-nirvanix-is-closing-its-doors.html  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  18  Example: A cloud provider went bankrupt without giving notice to their customers, leaving them  on the spot with their data non reachable. In the aftermath, no data was lost thanks to the quick  response of other vendors to support the customers’ needs.25  R11: Foreign law issues  Cloud services sometimes involves the use of cloud  providers or datacenters abroad, which means that  to a certain extent foreign jurisdictions may have an  impact on the security and privacy of the cloud  service. For example, violations of the law by the  other customers (co-tenants) may lead to services  being ordered shut (for example as part of a criminal prosecution), without taking proper care of the  other customers. It has been argued by legal experts that even if the physical location of supporting  equipment or datacenters are not in a foreign country there could still be an impact26.  Cloud computing customers should ask which foreign jurisdictions may play a role and if there are  incompatibilities with their own national legislation.  See SQ 12.  Example: a European governmental body (for similar reasons) restricted their employees from  using widely used cloud services to share documents and exchange emails27.  Understanding risks with security questions  For each risk we point the reader to relevant security questions in Section 6, which can be used in a  procurement process, to understand if and how risks can be mitigated.  Network and information security risks Relevant security questions  R1: Software security vulnerabilities  SQ7  R2: Network attacks  SQ8  R3: Social engineering attacks  SQ8  R4: Management GUI and API compromise SQ7, SQ8, SQ9  R5: Device theft/loss SQ3, SQ8  R6: Physical hazards SQ1, SQ2, SQ3, SQ5, SQ6, SQ10  R7: Overloads SQ3, SQ11  R8: Unexpected costs SQ11  25 http://gcn.com/Articles/2013/09/26/avoid-cloud-shutdown.aspx?Page=2  26 IVIR has issued an analysis in which it argues that the US FISA legislation makes the use of cloud services from US providers by Dutch  educational organisations unconstitutional, regardless of the physical location of datacenters.  27  http://www.dechert.com/files/Publication/59c8f721-ba27-4397-99a1-72f6b554820e/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/655d6df2- b7ec-4f8c-917f-58efd20fb862/Cloud_Computing_02_12.pdf  Cloud versus traditional IT: In traditional IT  data and processes remain on-premises, so  foreign jurisdictions are hardly an issue.  http://gcn.com/Articles/2013/09/26/avoid-cloud-shutdown.aspx?Page=2 http://www.dechert.com/files/Publication/59c8f721-ba27-4397-99a1-72f6b554820e/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/655d6df2-b7ec-4f8c-917f-58efd20fb862/Cloud_Computing_02_12.pdf http://www.dechert.com/files/Publication/59c8f721-ba27-4397-99a1-72f6b554820e/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/655d6df2-b7ec-4f8c-917f-58efd20fb862/Cloud_Computing_02_12.pdf  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  19  R9: Vendor lock-in SQ10  R10: Administrative or legal outages SQ4  R11: Foreign jurisdiction issues SQ12  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  20  5 Security questions  In this section we address the risks (see Section 5) and opportunities (see Section 4) with a list of 12  security questions. Customers can use these questions to get the most relevant information about the  security of their cloud service, and to understand if more needs to be done to use certain opportunities  or to mitigate certain risks. The table below shows the main topics and how they relate to the  opportunities and risks:  Security questions Related  opportunities  Related  risks  SQ1: Organizational security, governance and risk management O4, O5, O6, O11 R6  SQ2. Responsibilities and liabilities O5, O10 R6  SQ3. Contingencies and backups O1, O4, O5, O8 R5, R6, R7  SQ4. Legal and administrative issues - R10  SQ5. Human resources security O4  R6  SQ6. Access Control O4, O9 R6  SQ7. Software security O6, O7 R1, R4  SQ8. User, management and application programming interfaces O6, O7, O9 R3, R4, R5  SQ9. Monitoring and logging O7 R4  SQ10. Interoperability and portability O3 R6, R9  SQ11. Scaling, sizing and costs O2 R7, R8  SQ12. Compliance with national/international legislation - R11  For each question, an indication of the kind of information customers might need to get an answer is  included. It should be stressed that not all providers will respond to customer question-forms about  one particular service they may offer. A defining characteristic of cloud computing is that one provider  offers the same service to many customers, so answering questionnaires for all customers may be  infeasible and/or too costly. Customers may find some of the answers on the websites of providers or  in other material (for example via cloud certification schemes28).  For each question below examples of possible supporting evidence or guarantees are included, which  could back up or support claims made by the provider. Typically supporting evidence or guarantees  may be clauses in a contract or SLAs, audit reports from third parties29, self-assessments by the  provider, a track record of past performance, statements from past customers etc.  Annex D includes empty question forms for use during procurement.  SQ1: Organizational security, governance and risk management  Before procuring a cloud service from a provider the customer should have an idea about the quality  and effectiveness of the organizational structure and risk management processes at the provider. It is  28 ENISA, EC, together with industry, has developed a list of certification schemes relevant for cloud customers:  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  29 At the same time formal compliance certification and audits by 3rd parties carry a cost and are not always the  most appropriate or the only way to provide evidence.  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  21  also important for the customer to know which parts of the provider’s organization will be dealing  with security incidents, how key roles can be carried out by the customer, how to find security- relevant information, security advisories, information about outages.  Question Possible answers  1. How does the cloud provider manage  network and information security risks  related to the cloud service?  - General policy and approach to managing  security risks.  - Contact point for security incidents.  - Presentation of  critical dependencies of the  Cloud Service Provider on third parties.  - Compliance with best practice or industry  standard on governance or risk management.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Audit reports by independent auditors.  - Certification against information security risk  management standards (for example ISO  27001), including scope statement.  - Self-assessment against an industry standard  or best practice.  -  SQ2. Security responsibilities  It is important to apportion responsibilities for security tasks and responsibilities/liabilities for security  incidents. As explained in Section 2, the division of security tasks, and the division of  responsibilities/liabilities for incidents is different for different types of cloud services.  Question Possible answers  2. Which security tasks are carried out by  the provider, which type of security  incidents are mitigated by the provider  (and which tasks and incidents remain  under the responsibility of the customer)?  - Assets under control of the provider.  - Key security tasks carried out by the provider  (patching, updating, etc).  - Examples of incidents under the  responsibility of the provider.  - Tasks and responsibilities under the  responsibility of the customer.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant security tasks mentioned in  contract or SLA,  - Incident classification and response/recovery  time objectives,  - Liability clauses in contracts or SLA i.e.  financial compensation  SQ3. Contingencies and backups  An earthquake, a power cut or a thunder storm could affect facilities, supplies, an entire datacentre  or power or network cables. For customers it is important to understand how the cloud service is  resilient in the face of disasters and how data is backed up.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  22  Question Possible answers  3. How does the cloud service sustain  disasters affecting datacentres or  connections and which data is backed up  where?  - Physical security policy/ measures (backup  power, fire extinguishers, etc.),  - Network redundancy, geographic spread,  availability zones, access control,  - Backups and failover mechanisms,  - Disaster recovery plans.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clauses included in contract and  SLA,  - Recovery time objectives.  SQ4. Legal, regulatory and administrative issues  Legal, regulatory and administrative issues can cause outages (for example, issues about contracts,  billing, legal procedures against co-tenants). Customers should understand how the security of their  data and processes is guaranteed in the event of legal issues or administrative disputes.  Question Possible answers  4. How is security of the cloud service  guaranteed when there are legal issues or  administrative disputes?  - Service continuity in case of legal issues,  administrative disputes, bankruptcy,  confiscation by law enforcement, etc.  - Guaranteed data export.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Contract and SLA relevant clauses about  access to data.  - Disclaimers addressing legal issues or  administrative disputes, guaranteeing  access to customer data and backups.  SQ5. Personnel security  Personnel at the provider could have an impact on security of services or data processing. Customers  should ask how the provider ensures that personnel works securely.  Question Possible answers  5. How does the provider ensure that  personnel works securely?  - Training/certification for key roles.  - Recruitment policies.  - Penetration tests/social engineering testing.  - Compliance to ISMS standard or best  practice (SQ1).  - Security vetting procedures for highly  sensitive posts (handling sensitive data)  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  23  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Certification or self-assessment against ISMS  standard or practice (see SQ1).  SQ6. Access Control  Data and processes of customers should be protected from unauthorized access. Customers should  ask how access control is implemented to protect their data and processes.  Questions  Possible answers  6. How is customer data or processes  protected from unauthorized physical and  logical access?  - Physical access control protection measures.  - Logical access control protection (roles,  permissions, privilege minimization, privilege  segregation).  - Authentication mechanisms used.  - Compliance to ISMS standard or best practice  (SQ1).  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Certification or self-assessment against ISMS  standard or practice (see SQ1).  SQ7. Software security  Software vulnerabilities could have a big impact on the customer’s data or processes. Customers  should ask which measures are in place to make sure software underpinning the cloud service is kept  secure and which software is not under control of the provider, and should be kept secure by the  customer.  Question Possible answers  6. How does provider ensure software  security and which software remains  customers responsibility?  - Secure software development method.  - Vulnerability management process (contact  points for vulnerabilities, time to report etc.),  - Training for developers,  - Patch and update procedures.  - Standards or best practices used (such as ISO  27034).  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Information about past vulnerabilities of  relevant software.  - Vulnerability scan reports.  - Third-party audits of software,  - Measures of software security activities e.g.  BSIMM or OpenSAMM.  SQ8. User, management and application programming interfaces  Cloud services are typically accessible via online web-based user interfaces and APIs. These interfaces  should be protected from unauthorized access, particularly the management interfaces for  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  24  administrators and high-privilege roles should be protected carefully because via these interfaces  attackers could gain access to a large number of customer data and processes.  Questions Possible answers  SQ8. How is access to the GUI’s and API’s  protected, and are their additional  measures for administrators/high privilege  roles (under the customer’s side)?  - Authentication methods at GUIs and APIs,  - Protection measures for administrator  interfaces.  - Authentication for administration interface,  - IP restrictions, administrator roles and privileges.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Technical description of interfaces and  protection methods.  SQ9. Monitoring and logging  Customers should be able to monitor the performance and security of the service, via alerts, periodic  reports, dashboards. Customers should also be able to analyse issues by analysing transaction logs,  either via automatic interface or upon request, for example in the case of an incident.  Questions Possible answers  9. How can the customer monitor the  service, which logs are kept, and how can  they be accessed for example when the  customer needs to analyse an incident?  - Dashboard with access to performance  monitoring.  - Transactions logs, performance logs.  - Alerts and triggers for notification.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clause of the SLA on retrieval of  transaction logs.  SQ10. Interoperability and portability  Interoperability makes it easier for customers to integrate a cloud service with other, existing,  solutions, and portability makes it easier for customers to migrate to a new provider (if needed in an  exit scenario, for example). Customers should ask which standards are used for data and interfaces  (and maybe one step further to hardware and devices), or if export functions and backup data uses  standard formats.  Questions Possible answers  10. Which standards make the cloud service  portable and interoperable?  - Interface standards and data formats for  GUIs, APIs, export, applications and code,  virtual machines, etc.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clauses in contract or SLA,  - Audit reports, certifications, self-assessment  report indicating compliance.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  25  SQ11. Scaling, sizing and costs  Cloud services often provide elasticity in terms of resource usage, on the basis of a pay-as-you-go  payment model. Customers should clarify how peak usage or increased usage is dealt with, and how  the additional costs are handled.  Questions  Possible answers  11. How is increase of usage or peaks  handled, and what are the corresponding  costs?  - Examples of elasticity scenarios, cost  calculation, and so on  - Cost alerts and billing limitations.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - Relevant clauses in contract or SLA,  - Performance track record.  SQ12. Compliance with national/foreign legislation  Cloud computing changes the way IT resources are delivered and there may be compliance issues with  national legislation. In cloud computing customers sometimes work with providers and/or datacenters  across borders, so also foreign legislation might be relevant to take into account.  Customers ask which  jurisdiction is relevant to take into account and which legislation applies to their cloud service  (national, international etc).  Note that often personal data protection legislation is applicable (see Annex A).  Questions Possible answers  12. Which national legislation applies?  - Relevant national legislation (including national  bodies that have jurisdiction to impose  provisions).  - Relevant foreign jurisdiction and applicable  foreign legislation.  - Location of datacentres.  - Applicable personal data protection legislation.  (Supporting evidence/guarantees) - References and links to legislation  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  26  6 Conclusions and Outlook  In this document we highlight 11 important security risks and 11 important security opportunities  SMEs should take into account when procuring a cloud service. We also provide a list of 12 security  questions SMEs can use to understand the security features of cloud services in the market.  Since 2009 the market has evolved: Providers offer products which are more mature, they offer more  information about security, customers understand cloud computing better, and know better what are  the risks and opportunities of cloud computing. Also policy makers have taken action. In 2012 the  European Commission issued an EU Cloud strategy aimed at removing remaining barriers to a wider  uptake of cloud computing. Also national governments in the EU are adopting policies (such as cloud- first policies) to improve the use of cloud computing in the private and public sector.  At the same time work still needs to be done to ensure a single digital market in the EU. Cloud  computing exasperates the differences between different countries and different jurisdictions. Some  of these issues may be addressed by technological solutions (such as encryption), but not all.  ENISA believes security should be a driver for cloud computing, and that, when organization need  better network and information security, then cloud computing (in different forms) becomes an  opportunity to meet those requirements (sharing resources, sharing costs, sharing expertise).  We look forward to helping SMEs in the EU as well as other customers, like government agencies, to  adopt cloud computing in a secure way and make full use of its opportunities.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  27  Annex A:  Legal compliance  Cloud computing changes radically the way ICT resources are delivered and consumed. Customers  should assess which cloud computing services are compatible with applicable legislation. Depending  on the setting a range of laws could apply: for example legislation on the protection of personal data  (DP), legislation on sector-specific data like financial data or medical records, legislation for critical  information systems, like energy, water supply or transport, legislation on the handling of state  classified data, criminal law, administrative law etc.  Depending on the setting there may be different requirements, which could have an important  bearing on the way cloud computing can be used by SMEs and which are security measures which  must be taken by the customer. Legal compliance is not only about personal data protection  legislation.  We give some examples of different types of legal requirements which could have an impact:   On-site audits – Legislation might require the customer to facilitate on-site audits of ICT  systems.  Cloud providers might not always be able to subject to all sorts of on-site audits.   Physical separation –Legislation might require the use of physically separated systems for  certain functions. Cloud providers might not offer physically separated systems.   Outsourcing – Legislation might allow outsourcing to third-parties only under certain  conditions, for example, if customers are notified.   National borders – Legislation might prohibit transfer/ processing of data outside the  country’s border. Cloud providers might operate abroad or use data-centres abroad.   Certified products – Legislation might require use of specific (tested/certified) hardware for  certain (for example, cryptographic) operations. Cloud providers might be using different  hardware and/or products.  Legislation is different from sector to sector, from country to country, and compliance depends on the  type of service, how the service is implemented technically, the type of processes or data involved etc.  Generally speaking customers should take into account first their national legislation and secondly,  when needed, foreign legislation in the provider’s country and/or other countries involved with the  service, for example countries hosting datacenters or subsidiaries. It should be noted that legislation  is constantly changing and the need to keep up with it is something the customer should do or for the  cloud provider to take up and notify clients.  One type of legislation which often has an impact on how SMEs can use cloud computing is national  personal data protection legislation. In the rest of this section we provide the reader with some  explanation of relevant concepts and pointers to relevant documents on personal data protection  legislation in the EU, because many SMEs have questions about this type of legislation.  Another type  of legislation would be the specific regulatory law that could impact on top of national legislation; this  could include inter alia finance, telecommunications, healthcare etc. While SMEs may not be directly  regulated they may be legally required to comply with sector specific regulation if they are a supplier  to that industry sector.  Note that ENISA does NOT aim to give legal recommendation or advice on legal matters:  Applicable legislation might be complex so SMEs might need to use legal advice for their  analysis. This report doesn’t substitute any legal analysis provided by experts.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  28  A.1 EU personal data protection legislation  SMEs often have concerns about compliance with personal data protection legislation30. Given the  broad definition of personal data31, in a lot of settings DP legislation plays a role. As with other  legislation, data protection requirements differ from country to country, sector to sector. This  complicates the use of cloud computing across borders and the development of a single market for  online services; which is why the European Union made it one of its priorities (under the Digital  agenda, the EU cloud strategy, and the Data protection reform initiative)  to harmonize national DP  legislation across the EU (see below).  A.1.1 Covered organisations and individuals  The goal of the EU’s personal data protection legislation is to protect the privacy of EU citizens. The  legislation affects cloud providers based in the EU, cloud customers based in the EU, and organisations  offering cloud services directed at EU citizens.  The main EU-wide data-protection legislation is the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. It is currently  being reformed into a new Data Protection Regulation32.  A.1.2 Personal data and processing  Key definitions used in the EU personal data protection legislation are:  ● Personal Data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person  ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in  particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his  physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity33.  ● Sensitive (personal) data means personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, religious,  philosophical or other beliefs, political opinions, membership of parties, trade unions,  associations or organizations of a religious, philosophical, political or trade-unionist character,  as well as personal data disclosing health and sex life.  ● Processing of personal data (processing) means any operation or set of operations which is  performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection,  recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,  disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or  combination, blocking, erasure or destruction.  A.1.3 Roles: Data controllers and data processors  The EU personal data protection legislation distinguishes different roles:  ● Data-controllers: The individual or organization who collects the personal data and who  30 For instance, in Quantitative Estimates of the Demand for Cloud Computing in Europe and the Likely Barriers  to Up-take, 2012, p. 42-43, available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf  31 Business email addresses may be considered personal data and some (the European Court of Justice, e.g.)  have argued that even IP addresses are personal data.  32 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/  33 For the notion of personal data see also Article 29 Working Party Opinion 4/2007 on the concept of personal  data and the recent Opinion 8/2012 providing further input on the data protection reform discussions, where  the notion of personal data is further explained with regard to “identifiability” (legal term for the notion of  being indirectly identified) in terms of singling out the individuals  http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/cloudcomputing/docs/quantitative_estimates.pdf http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  29  controls how the data is subsequently used and processed.  ● Data-processors: The individual or organization processing the personal data (which might  include storage, computing, sharing, etc.).  ● Data-subject: The citizen whose personal data is involved.  The EU legislation mostly targets data-controllers, and only indirectly targets data-processors (only  when they process data on behalf of data-controllers).  A.1.4 Appropriate security measures and due-diligence  The requirement most relevant to network and information security is the obligation for the data- controller to ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to protect the security of the  processing of personal data.  This means that the data-controller should carry out a risk assessment  about security measures as needed. Risk assessment, on network and information systems, is a central  part of information security governance and information security risk management. For SMEs this  means that they  need to carry out a due-diligence on the setup of the cloud service and the security  measures in place to protect the security of the processing of personal data (initially during  procurement).  In this guide, in Section 3 (Risks) and Section 4 (Security questions), we provide SMEs a tool for  assessing, if appropriate, security measures in place to protect security of the cloud service and the  security of the processing of the customer data. Note that the national Data Protection Authority  might have specific and detailed recommendation about which are “appropriate security measures.”  A.1.5 Security breach notification  In the Data Protection Reform provisions for breach notification obligations are included, for those  security breaches which have an impact on personal data. In practice this would mean that SMEs, as  data controllers, whenever personal data is involved, should be in a position to investigate breaches  and communicate about them to data-subjects or authorities, in a timely manner. This is still under  consultation and does comprise a formal requirement for the data controller. The security question  SQ 12 in Section 4 addresses security breaches and security breach reports34.  A.1.6 National guidance on data protection legislation  Many Data Protection Authorities across the EU have developed excellent information, in local  languages, about compliance to the applicable personal data protection legislation in their country.  We list some of the guidance below, in no particular order35:   The UK data protection authority, ICO, issued guidance on cloud computing36.   The French data protection authority, CNIL, published recommendations for companies  planning to use Cloud computing services37   The Swedish DPA, Datainspektionen, issued guidance on use of cloud services and the  Swedish personal data protection legislation38   The Italian DPA, Garante per la protezione dei dati personali, issued a guide on personal data  and cloud computing39  34 More details can be found in the Art29 WP opinion 5/2012 on personal data breach reporting.  35 This list is not exhaustive.

Under the cloud strategy the EC has worked jointly with  industry on a code of conduct on personal data protection for cloud computing providers, to be  submitted for approval by the Article 29 Working party. The code of conduct aims to make it easier  for customers to be compliant with data protection legislation while using cloud computing. The  progress of that work can be found at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-select-industry- group-code-conduct  40 http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/03-07-12-Cloud-Computing/1221.htm  41 https://www.datenschutz-bayern.de/technik/orient/oh_cloud.pdf  http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/docs/wpdocs/2010/wp169_en.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-select-industry-group-code-conduct https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-select-industry-group-code-conduct http://www.dataprotection.ie/docs/03-07-12-Cloud-Computing/1221.htm https://www.datenschutz-bayern.de/technik/orient/oh_cloud.pdf  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  31  Annex B:  Example scenario: ConsultLess, SME using SaaS  B.1 Introduction  ConsultLess is a small consultancy firm in the EU that has 20 employees (mostly legal and management  experts). One of the employees is partner and also the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the firm.  Occasionally the CIO pays consultants for IT advice or support. ConsultLess decides to procure office  software as a service (SaaS) for use by its employees: the cloud service offers document  storage/editing, email and calendar. This cloud service should replace an internal mail-server and  office software installed on computers. The setup is depicted below.  IT manager  at ConsultLess  ConsultLess SME  ConsultLess  employees  Cloud service provider  Office software  SaaS  B.1.1 Business drivers  For ConsultLess there are many reasons to use a SaaS cloud service are many: better collaborative  features, lower hardware costs, lower management and maintenance costs. Compliance is a key issue  - and the CIO of the firm (the only employee with specialized IT expertise) wants to understand which  standard (boilerplate) services to choose, and also which issues remain to be addressed by specific  mitigating measures, custom features, etc. Some (not all) of the data stored and processed is sensitive,  and data leaks could have a severe impact on the reputation of the firm - and/or possibly even expose  the firm to legal actions by affected customers (which will have great reputation impact for such a  small firm).  B.1.2 Outsourcing information security tasks  In this fictitious scenario the security tasks which will be carried out by the cloud provider are:  - Managing of hardware and facilities, including physical security, power, cooling, etc.;  - Managing of server operating systems and the application server, including development,  deployment, patching, updating, monitoring, checking logs, etc. For example, it is the  responsibility of the provider to patch the server operating systems in time;  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  32  - Managing the application software, including development, patching, updating, monitoring,  and checking logs, and so on. For example, it is the responsibility of the provider to fix software  flaws in the office software;  - Managing updates of software and data.  The customer, ConsultLess, is merely responsible 42  for handing out accounts to its employees,  revoking accounts when employees leave, resetting passwords, etc.  In this scenario most security tasks are outsourced to the provider. The customer, once the service  has been procured and is up and running, will have few security tasks left to perform. It should be  stressed that the responsibility for security cannot be “outsourced”. If something goes wrong with the  office software ConsultLess has procured, causing sensitive data about its clients to leak, then  ConsultLess will in the first place be held responsible for the damages. For ConsultLess, hence, clarity  about security tasks and responsibilities is a crucial consideration in the procurement process.  B.2 Opportunities and risks  B.2.1 Assessing the security opportunities  Let’s look at the security opportunities for ConsultLess (SME uses SaaS).  OPPORTUNITY  RATING REMARKS  O1. GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD Medium No need for making backups and bringing them to a  remote site.  O2. ELASTICITY Small At Consultless usage of resources is quite stable. No  peaks.  O3. STANDARD FORMATS AND  INTERFACES  Medium Consultless plan on keeping documents, communications  long term in archives. Standard data formats are  important.  O4. PHYSICAL SECURITY Large  ConsultLess only secures laptops with disk encryption and  pincodes, and does not need to handle physical security  of servers, backup disks, etc.  O5.INCIDENT RESPONSE  AROUND THE CLOCK  Small Downtime overnight is not a major issue for ConsultLess.  O6. SECURE SOFTWARE  DEVELOPMENT  Small For ConsultLess the alternative would be off-the-shelf  software, so secure software development  is only a small  opportunity in this setting.  O7. PATCHING AND  UPDATING  Large ConsultLess have only one IT manager, and patching and  updating servers would take away a lot of time.  O8. BACKUPS  Large ConsultLess has only one IT manager, and keeping  backups would take up a lot of time.  O9: SERVER-SIDE STORAGE Large ConsultLess has employees which are mobile working  from home and at clients. Server-side storage mitigates  the risk of employees losing their devices.  42 Refer to the Cloud model visual in section 2.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  33  O10. SECURITY AS A SERVICE  AND SECURITY ADD-ONS  Large ConsultLess will use an add-on for scanning emails and  documents for malware.  O11. CERTIFICATION AND  COMPLIANCE  Large ConsultLess can refer to certification of the provider  making it much easier to fulfil their own compliance  obligations.  B.2.2 Assessing the security risks  Let’s look at the different risks in more detail.  RISK TYPE LIKELIHOOD IMPACT RISK  REMARKS  R1. SOFTWARE SECURITY  VULNERABILITIES  Medium High  Significant  ConsultLess uses the cloud  service for sensitive data so  the impact of vulnerabilities  is high.  ConsultLess will  select a vendor with a good  track record.  R2. NETWORK ATTACKS Medium High  Significant ConsultLess has employees  which are not tech-savvy, so  it is possible that spoofing,  sniffing and pharming  attacks are successful.  ConsultLess will secure its  internal wifi network and  raise awareness about  insecure network  connections, rogue hotspots,  etc.  R3. SOCIAL ENGINEERING  ATTACKS  Medium High Significant  ConsultLess has employees  which are not tech-savvy, so  it is possible that phishing  attacks are successful.  ConsultLess will raise  awareness about fake emails  asking for credentials etc.  R4. MANAGEMENT GUI AND  API COMPROMISE  Low High  Minor For ConsultLess the main risk  is the management portal. It  will select a cloud service  which has 2-factor  authentication for the  administrative user account.  It will also set a policy which  requires the administrative  user to use a liveCD for  administrative tasks.  R5. DEVICE THEFT/LOSS Medium High Significant ConsultLess uses the cloud  service for sensitive data so  device loss can be an issue.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  34  Using a cloud service  mitigates some issue  because less emails and  documents are on user  devices. ConsultLess will set  a policy requiring employees  to secure their devices from  unauthorized access.  R6. PHYSICAL HAZARDS Low Medium  Minor ConsultLess use the cloud  service for its business data,  which can not be lost. It will  select a cloud provider with  good physical security on its  sites and backups to multiple  sites to avoid data loss.  R7. OVERLOADS Low  Medium  Minor ConsultLess does not have  high availability  requirements. Outages are  acceptable.  R8. UNEXPECTED COSTS Low  Medium  Minor ConsultLess does not expect  dramatic usage patterns. It  will select a cloud provider  which warns about cost  increases.  R9. VENDOR LOCK-IN  High High Significant For ConsultLess this is a  significant risk. ConsultLess  will use the cloud service  only for emails and  documents stored in widely  used data-formats to  prevent lockin.  R10. ADMINISTRATIVE OR  LEGAL OUTAGES  Medium  High  Minor  ConsultLess does not foresee  major issues around  administrative or legal  disputes.  R11. FOREIGN JURISDICTION  ISSUES  Medium High  Significant  ConsultLess  is not subject to  any specific legal  requirements about cross- border processing or data  transfers.  The risks can be plotted in a matrix, showing what are key issues.  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  35  Figure 3: Risks for ConsultLess (SME using SaaS)  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  36  Annex C:  Example scenario: EasyAgriSelling, SME using IaaS/PaaS  C.1 Introduction  EasyAgriSelling is a small tech start-up in the EU, which developed an online web shop software (as a  service) for farmers who would like to start direct-selling their vegetables and other products. Their  slogan is: “Selling your agricultural produce to consumers, made easy”. Farmers can set up an online  shop in a few clicks - customizing their shop with a logo, colours and a description of their farm.  EasyAgriSelling operates a pay-as-you-go model, charging no monthly fee, but only charging their  customers when products are sold.  EasyAgriSelling is a SaaS provider and they are a cloud services  customer building services on a cloud provider who offers them IaaS and PaaS on which to build their  product. In this document we are assessing risks and opportunities from both their roles as a service  provider and as a service customer.  The SaaS platform runs on top of the IaaS/PaaS platform. The  setup is depicted below.  Developer  EasyAgriSelling SME  Cloud service provider  Application servers, DBs, etc IaaS/PaaS  Farmer A Consumers  Helpdesk  Administration  Farmer B Farmer C  Webshop platform SaaS  C.1.1 Business drivers  For EasyAgriSelling there are many reasons for using an IaaS/PaaS cloud service: IaaS/PaaS computing  resources are elastic, so once their service takes off, they can easily scale up, without having to make  an upfront investment. A start-up with limited capital, they need to make the right investments into  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  37  building their product and responding to increasing demand. Cloud computing fits their long term  plan. Moreover, employees at EasyAgriSelling are web design specialists, while running and  maintaining the nuts and bolts of hardware and networks is not their competence. Key concerns are  availability, security and privacy of the payment data and some of the personal data of consumers  (home address, billing address etc.). EasyAgriSelling is responsible for the software security of the  online web shop software, the web interfaces used by the farmers (customers of EasyAgriSelling) and  the personal data and payment data of the consumers buying from the farmers.  C.1.2 Outsourcing information security tasks  EasyAgriSelling is a customer of an IaaS/PaaS service which it uses for running its web shop software  for farmers.  In this setting the security tasks the IaaS/PaaS provider carries out are:   Managing hardware and facilities, including physical security, power, cooling, etc.;   Managing the server operating systems and the application server, including development,  deployment, patching, updating, monitoring, checking logs, and so on. For example, it is the  responsibility of the provider to patch the server operating systems in time.  EasyAgriSelling, the customer, remains responsible43 for:   Managing the application software, including development, patching, updating, monitoring,  and checking logs, and so on. For example, it is the responsibility of EasyAgriSelling to fix  software flaws in the deployed web shop software;   Managing the accounts of the farmers using their web shop software, as well as the consumer  accounts, including resetting passwords, troubleshooting issues with payments etc.;   Managing backups of application software and data.  In this scenario some security tasks are outsourced to the provider, but many security tasks still have  to be carried out by the customer (EasyAgriSelling).  Security considerations in the procurement  process really only regard security of the facilities, the operating system and the application servers  which are under control of the provider.  C.2 Risks and opportunities  C.2.1 Assessing security opportunities  We look at the different opportunities for “EasyAgriSelling” in more detail in the table below:  OPPORTUNITY  RATING EXPLANATION  O1. GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD Medium For EasyAgriSelling geographic spread means more  resilience and it makes it easier to keep SLAs with the  farmers.  O2. ELASTICITY Large For EasyAgriSelling elasticity means it is easier to keep  SLAs with the farmers, even if one farmer has a peak in  demand.  O3. STANDARD FORMATS  AND INTERFACES  Medium For EasyAgriSelling it is important to be able to have the  cheapest  cloud provider, so standard formats for code  and virtual machines are important to be able to migrate  if a better offer is found on the market.  43 Refer to the cloud responsibilities model in section 2  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  38  O4. PHYSICAL SECURITY Medium For EasyAgriSelling it is important to outsource physical  security of the datacentre to a cloud provider.  “EasyAgriSelling” still needs to secure its employees’  end-user devices, but this is relatively easy.  O5. INCIDENT RESPONSE  AROUND THE CLOCK  Large For EasyAgriSelling 24/7 response means it is easier to  keep SLAs with the farmers.  O6. SECURE SOFTWARE  DEVELOPMENT  Small For EasyAgriSelling the main issue is security of its own  application software.  O7. PATCHING AND  UPDATING  Medium For EasyAgriSelling automated patching and updating of  the underlying application servers and operating  systems  can be time-consuming.  O8. BACKUPS Large For EasyAgriSelling backing up to a remote site can be  time-consuming, so it is very convenient to outsource  this.  O9 SERVER-SIDE STORAGE Small N/A – EasyAgriSelling is using IaaS/PaaS.  O10. SECURITY AS A  SERVICE AND SECURITY  AD-ONS  Small N/A – EasyAgriSelling just needs barebone virtual  hardware.  O11. CERTIFICATION AND  COMPLIANCE  Medium It is very important for EasyAgriSelling to show  compliance to industry standards. EasyAgriSelling will  select a vendor with a certification so its own compliance  obligation regard only the application software and the  processes around managing the famers’ webshops .  C.2.2 Assessing the risks  We look at the different risks in more details and rate them individually for this fictitious scenario:  RISK TYPE LIKELIHOOD IMPACT RISK  REMARKS  R1. SOFTWARE  SECURITY  VULNERABILITIES  High  Very high  Major  For EasyAgriSelling software  vulnerabilities are a big risk  (because the payment and  personal data of consumers is at  stake). EasyAgriSelling will look  closely at how the IaaS/PaaS is  patched and updated.  R2. NETWORK  ATTACKS  Medium  High  Significant  For EasyAgriSelling network  attacks are not a major issue,  because its employees are rather  savvy when it comes to using the  IaaS/PaaS.  R3. SOCIAL  ENGINEERING  ATTACKS  Medium  High  Significant For EasyAgriSelling network  attacks is an issue, because its  employees have access to a lot of  assets, and such attacks could  ruin the SME. EasyAgriSelling will  Cloud Security Guide for SMEs  Cloud computing security risks and opportunities for SMEs  April 2015  Page  39  raise awareness on social  engineering with staff.  R4. MANAGEMENT  INTERFACE AND API  COMPROMISE  Medium  Very high  Major  For EasyAgriSelling network  attacks is an issue, because its  employees have access to a lot of  assets, and such attacks could  ruin the SME. EasyAgriSelling will  select a service which has two- factor authentication.  R5. DEVICE  THEFT/LOSS  Low Medium Minor For EasyAgriSelling this is a limited  issue because most sensitive data  (e.g. the payment data of  consumers) is not on their  employees’ end-user devices.  R6. PHYSICAL  HAZARDS  Low  Medium  Minor  For EasyAgriSelling physical  hazards are an important  risk,because it has SLAs to uphold  with the farmers.  R7. OVERLOADS Low Medium  Minor  For EasyAgriSelling overloads are  an important risk,because it has  SLAs to uphold with the farmers.  R8. UNEXPECTED  COSTS  Medium  Medium  Minor  For EasyAgriSelling this is not a  major risks because increased  costs are billed to farmers (pay- as-you-go) also.  R9. VENDOR LOCK IN  High  Very high  Major For EasyAgriSelling it is important  not to be tied to one provider, so  it can always go to the cheapest  cloud provider.  EasyAgriSelling  will select a provider which  supports standard formats for  code and virtual machines.  R10. ADMINISTRATIVE  OR LEGAL OUTAGES  Medium  High  Minor For EasyAgriSelling administrative  and legal outages are an  important risk, because it has  SLAs to uphold with the farmers.  R11. FOREIGN  JURISDICTION ISSUES  Medium  High  Significant  EasyAgriSelling works with  farmers and consumers from  several countries. The data and  processes are about simple e- commerce and there are no  specific legal requirements that  could cause issues with foreign  jurisdiction.  We show the different risks in a matrix (see below).

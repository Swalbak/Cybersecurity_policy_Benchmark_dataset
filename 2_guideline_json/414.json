Every year the NRAs report summaries about a selection of  these notified incidents, the most significant incidents, based on a set of agreed thresholds. This document, the  Annual Report on Telecom Security Incidents 2017, aggregates the incident reported in 2017, and provides a single  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents in the EU.  Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the  telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The breach  reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents causing significant outages. The Commission recently proposed  an update of the telecom rules. The new breach reporting requirements in Article 40 of the Electronic  Communications Code1 2 have a broader scope, including not only incidents causing outages, but also confidentiality  breaches. Security breach reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU (under Article 19 of the  EIDAS regulation), for Operators of Essential Services in the EU (under Article 14 of the NIS directive) and for Digital  Service Providers (under Article 16 of the NIS directive) in the EU.  Key statistics from the 2017 reporting  This year’s annual incident report covers 169 incidents, reported by the NRAs across the EU. The reports come from  the 28 EU countries and additionally 2 EFTA countries participated. 6 EU countries reported no incidents with  significant impact, submitting so-called empty reports. We highlight some of the statistics:   Most incidents have an impact on mobile telephony and internet: In 2017 most incidents affected mobile  telephony (51% of all reported incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant  affected services in the previous years also, except for 2014 when fixed telephony was the most affected.   Incidents with mobile telephony and mobile internet impact, on average, most users: Incidents affecting  mobile internet or mobile telephony affected most users, on average around half a million users per  reported incident, around 8% of the national user base. Over the past years we observe is a downward trend,  meaning that the average size of reported incidents is decreasing. This could be due to the fact that many  EU countries are adopting lower reporting thresholds.   System failures are the dominant root cause of reported incidents: Most incidents reported were caused  by system failures (62% of the incidents) as a root cause. Often these are hardware failures or software bugs.  1 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4070_en.htm  2 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electronic-communications-code/  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  05   Human errors affect (on average) a high number of user connections: In 2017 human errors was the root  cause category involving most users affected per incident (around 1.2 million user connections on average).   Incidents caused by malicious actions are rare: Only a small percentage of reported incidents (2.5% in 2017)  was categorized as caused by malicious actions. This percentage reduced by half compared to the previous  year (5.1% in 2016).   System failures are the dominant root cause: In 2017 most incidents were caused by system failures, i.e.  more than 62 % had system failure as a root cause. This is in line with previous years (always between 60%  and 80%). In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware failures were the most common  causes. The assets failing in these cases are most often switches, routers, and power supplies.   Natural phenomena are causing more incidents: In 2017 a larger number of incidents (18%) were caused  by natural phenomena, such as heavy snow/ice, storms and wild fires. This is significantly higher than 2016,  2015, and 2014 when natural phenomena accounted for around 5% of the incidents. Natural phenomena  also cause the highest number of user hours lost, on average, per incident, with 56800 user hours.  Natural  phenomena will continue to be a concern for telecom providers across the EU, with extreme weather  becoming more common due to climate change.   A fifth of the incidents are third party failures: Almost a fifth of the incidents (18%) are third party failures.  This is similar to last year (22%). Third party failure incidents are interesting for NRAs to investigate further  because often third-party failures involve other sectors, and are complex and costly to tackle for providers.  Most of the incidents categorized as a third party failures are also categorized as caused by natural  phenomena. A common incident scenario is when a natural disaster, like a storm or wildfire, disrupts the  power grid infrastructure, which then impacts the mobile network infrastructure.   Mobile base stations and controllers the most affected assets: Overall, mobile base stations and controllers  and mobile switches were the network components most affected by incidents (9% and 8% respectively).   Wild fires cause, on average, most impact in user hours: A good measure for the total impact is to multiply  the number of users and the number of hours outage: this gives a total number of user hours. The diagram  below shows the total number of user hours lost, per detailed cause, for the incidents reported in 2017.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  06  Trends in 7 years of reporting  Mandatory security incident reporting was introduced in the 2009 reform which came into force in 2011. ENISA has  been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. Looking back at the 7 years of annual incident reports,  we can observe a number of multi-annual trends.   System failures dominate: Every year system failures are the most common root cause of reported incident,  responsible for about 60-70% of the major outages.   Natural phenomena trending upwards: There is an upward trend in the impact of natural phenomena on  telecom services. Heavy storms, heavy floods, or wildfires cause by extreme drought, can severely impact  the telecom infrastructure. Extreme weather is likely to increase due to climate change and this means that  natural phenomena will continue to be a concern for the EU telecom sector.  Follow-up by NRAs and ENISA  The NRAs are responsible for supervision the security telecom sector in each EU member state. ENISA supports the  NRAs with common guidelines and collecting good practices. Incident reporting is a key pillar of this supervision.  Article 13a and incident reporting are key in allowing the NRAs to understand trends and to work with the sector to  address issues. This positive impact was confirmed also in an independent impact assessment analysing the impact  of EU legislation on telecom security3.  As a follow up to the incident reporting, at the EU level, ENISA works with the NRAs and the private sector to analyse  and address EU-wide issues and trends:   Power cuts are a common cause of outages. In 2013 ENISA analysed power supply dependencies4, and issued  recommendations regarding the sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts.   ENISA published an overview of good practices regarding to national roaming for increased resilience in  mobile networks5. A number of EU Member States have implemented such national roaming frameworks.  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  4 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/  5 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by- eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  07   Issues with ICT equipment were a major source of outages in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, ENISA published  recommendations for providers6 about how to address security requirements when dealing with ICT  equipment vendors and suppliers of outsourced services for core operations.   Cable cuts (due to civil works) were a prominent cause of incidents in the 2012 and 2013 annual incident  reporting. In 2014, ENISA worked with NRAs to publish an overview of good practices and frameworks to  reduce underground cable cuts7.   In 2016, ENISA assessed, EU-wide, which security measures are implemented by telecom providers8.   In 2018, ENISA published an EU state of play report on legacy protocols used for interconnections.9  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-measures  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/legacy-technologies-as-a-threat-to-eu2019s-telecommunications- infrastructure  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  08  1. Introduction  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents, with a significant impact on the  continuity of electronic communication services, to the national telecom regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU  member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary to ENISA, covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most  significant incidents, based on a set of agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents  Report 2017, aggregates the incident reports reported in 2017, and gives a single EU-wide overview of telecom  security incidents in the EU.  This is the 7th time ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. ENISA started publishing such  annual reports in 2012. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since  the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in  2011. The breach reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents causing significant outages. For example,  consider an attack in which attackers wiretap undersea cables; if this attack causes no outages, then the security  incident does not fall under the breach reporting requirements of Article 13a. The Commission recently proposed  an update of the telecom rules. The new breach reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the Electronic  Communications Code10 have a broader scope, including not only incidents causing outages, but also significant  confidentiality breaches for example.  Note that this document does not contain details about individual countries or individual incident reports and it does  not contain any references to regions, countries or specific providers.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the technical details  of the implementation of the annual summary reporting, as agreed by the experts in the Article 13a Expert Group  which involves different NRAs from different EU Member States and EFTA countries. Section 4 contains the statistical  analysis of the incidents from 2017 and contains examples of incidents and Section 5 contains the conclusions.  10 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electronic-communications-code/  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  09  2. Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communicationsError! Bookmark not defined., which was adopted  in 2009 and transposed by most EU countries in 2011, added Article 13a to the Framework DirectiveError! Bookmark not  defined.. Article 13a addresses the security and integrity11 of public electronic communications networks and services.  The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications  networks and services (providers).  Article 13a states that:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to guarantee  security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of integrity that have  had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary, for  example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram below. This  document analyses the incidents from 2017 that have been reported to ENISA (the black dashed arrow).

A public consultation concerning the evaluation and review of the current regulatory framework ended  in December 2015. In this context, ENISA along with the Article 13a Expert Group submitted an opinion on the  evaluation and review of Article 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive, an area which is at the core of ENISA  expertise and competence.  11 Here integrity means network integrity, which is often called availability or continuity in information security literature.  12https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework- electronic-communications  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  10  3. Article 13a Expert Group and Annual Incident Reporting Procedure  3.1.1 Article 13a Expert group  In 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve a  harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Framework directive. In the following years, during these meetings,  a group of experts from NRAs, now referred to as the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on three non- binding technical guidelines:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting13   Technical Guideline on Security Measures14   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets15  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet 3 times per year to develop the technical guidelines and to discuss  the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector) and to  share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  3.1.2 Annual summary reporting by NRAs to ENISA  In spring 2012, the EC agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the Communications Committee, COCOM)  to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011 incidents impacting the continuity of supply of  electronic communications services. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed  within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA implemented  the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual reporting would be carried out by the end  of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaced the electronic  forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data reported and provides the NRAs  with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU. Since 2015, ENISA is providing the possibility for  the NRAs to extract graphs from CIRAS based on their search results.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting, which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.3 Services and incidents in scope of reporting  There are four main services (aka classic services) in scope:   Fixed telephony   Mobile telephony   Fixed Internet access   Mobile Internet access  Additionally NRAs can report about other services, such as SMS, MMS, Satellite TV, International roaming, RADIO  broadcasting, TV broadcasting , Cable TV, IPTV, Video on demand, Public WIFI, Web based voice services, Web- based messaging services, and Public email services.  13 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  14 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  15 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  11  Providers are required to notify security incidents to NRAs, if there is a significant impact on the continuity of supply  of electronic communications services. As mentioned, the mandatory reporting requirements in Article 13a focus on  the continuity of the service.  3.1.4 Thresholds for annual summary reporting  To facilitate an efficient and effective process of annual summary reporting from NRAs to ENISA, the NRAs agreed  on a set of EU wide thresholds, based on the duration of an incident and the relative number of customers affected.  Relative thresholds  The relative threshold are based on the duration and the number of users of a service affected as a percentage of  the national user base of the service. NRAs should include incidents in annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1h<...<2h  2h<...<4h  4h<...<6h  6h<...<8h  >8h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Table 1: Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base  Absolute thresholds  Complementing the relative threshold, there is an absolute threshold: Incidents should be included in annual  summary reporting if the product of duration and number of user connections affected exceeds 60 million user  minutes, or 1 million user hours.  3.1.5 Annual summary reporting template  The annual summary reporting template for annual summary reporting contains fields for the services affected, the  number of customers affected and the duration of the incident.  The annual summary reporting template distinguishes 5 root cause categories:   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of the provider  or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of  procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation, e.g. a Denial of Service attack disrupting the service, or a cable theft.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  12   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example  caused by hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third party. The  category is used in conjunction with one of the other four root cause categories.  Optionally the template allows NRAs to indicate:   Detailed causes triggering the incident, either as “initial cause” or as “subsequent cause”, because incidents  often involve a chain of events. For example, often a storm, leads to a power cut.   Assets affected by the incident, e.g. HLRs, routers and switches, underground cables etc. These assets are  listed and described in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  13  4. Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in this process. Of these, 22 Member States and  2 EFTA countries reported in total 169 significant incidents and 6 countries reported there were no significant  incidents. This is a small increase from the previous year where the same number of countries reported 158  significant incidents.  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting in 2017.  Examples of incidents  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents that are notified to NRAs and  then included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA:   A system failure caused a mobile internet outage for millions of users (duration: hours, connections:  millions, cause: software bug): A software bug occurred  in the Internal system component Software  Deployment Manager (SDM) leading to the degradation of user authorization for mobile data and mobile  voice. As a result end users had difficulties to access mobile services, both voice and data. Also customers  abroad were affected (roaming services). Mobile switches and mobile user registers were affected by this  bug. The provider removed the obstacles in accessing the services  and for the prevention of similar  incidents in the future, a mitigation plan was created in collaboration with software vendors.   System failure caused disruption in, both mobile and fixed, telephony and internet services as well SMS/  MMS services, affecting millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause: hardware failure):  Outage of several network components used for delivering DSL in the subscriber access network resulted in  the disruption of mobile and fixed telephony and internet access. The provider responded by raising the  capacity of the remaining network components. A subsequent software upgrade resolved the issue  completely.   An attempt at malware infection coming from a malicious action caused outage on fixed internet, fixed  telephony, IPTV and DNS services for more than three days: (duration: days, connections: thousands,  cause: Malicious action ):  A worldwide attack of a botnet attempted to infect maintenance interfaces of  customer premise equipments with malware. This attempt failed but the attack impacted a large number of  fixed internet connections. The provider mitigated this attack by implementing filtering measures in order  to prevent further attacks of this kind. Later the provider updated the firmware of the customer premises  equipments (CPEs) and asked affected customers to disconnect their CPEs from the power supply, and  switch them on again, in order to finalise the update.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  14  The rest of this section contains statistical information.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the statistics in this  report. In particular, they should take into account that:   The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the continuity of  public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other types of incidents with an  impact on security of services and networks, which are under the current telecom framework not in scope  of annual reporting. For example, if attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing any outages,  then such a security incident would not be included in this process of annual reporting. The new breach  reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the Electronic Communications Code16 have a broader scope,  including not only incidents causing outages, but also confidentiality breaches for example.  The scope of reporting includes major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed reporting thresholds (Table 1: Threshold for annual  summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base   ). Smaller incidents are not reported at EU level, meaning that the view is skewed towards the larger  incidents. Common incidents that get resolved quickly stay below the radar, so to speak.   National reporting thresholds are different across the EU. Every country has a different size. Thresholds have  also been adapted over the years. Many countries started with relatively high thresholds, lowering them  later on. For instance there is an increase in the number of reported incidents. This does not mean, for  instance, that the telecom sector is getting less secure, or that the total number of incidents is increasing. In  fact, over the years we have seen more incidents getting reported which are on average smaller in size.  Impact of the incidents  First, we look at which services are impacted by the reported incidents.  4.1.1 Impact per service  For the third year in a row most of the reported incidents affected mobile internet. Both mobile internet and  mobile telephony services had an increase on incidents compared to last year’s results.  Figure 4: Impact on classic services (percentage)  16 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electronic-communications-code/  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  15  Figure 5: Impact on other services (percentage)  Note that each incident can have an impact on more than one service (which is why the percentages in the chart  add up to more than 100 %).  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile internet outages affect most user connections s, with an average of 600 thousand user connections  affected per reported incident. Compared to the previous years this is a 50% decrease, which is significant.  Figure 6: Average number of user connections affected per incident per classic service (1000s).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  16  Note that the averages in these diagrams include both small and large countries. These EU-wide averages, are not  necessarily representative for the size of incidents occurring nationally.  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile internet outages impact on average 8% of the national user base (a 14% decrease compared to 2016).  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  A third of the reported incidents had an impact on the reachability of emergency call-centres, i.e. 112.  Figure 7: Average number of user connections affected (1000s) - other services  Figure 8: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  17  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 7 % of incidents reported there was an impact on interconnections between providers.  Compared to 2016 this  figure is stable.  Root cause categories  In this section we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. For a description of the root cause  categories, see section 3.1.5.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  This year, 62% of the reported incidents were caused by system failures or technical failures. For all reporting  years, system failures has been the most common root cause category. In second place, for this year is root cause  of human errors (18,3% of the reported incidents), a small increase compared with previous years. Natural  phenomena as expected due to the wildfires consist of 17%.  Figure 9: Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 10: Impact on interconnections (percentage)  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  18  4.2.2 Third party failures  Around 18% of the incidents reported were categorized as third party failures, a slight decrease compared to the  previous year (22.5%).  Figure 11: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Figure 12: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  19  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  In this section, we look at the root causes for the services separately.  As in 2016, also in 2017, system failures was  the dominant root cause for all services, scoring more than half of the incidents reported per service. For mobile  telephony and mobile internet, this was the case also in the previous years, whereas the dominant root cause for  fixed telephony and fixed internet oscillated in the previous years between natural phenomena and system failures.  Wildfires caused a significant increase in the number of incidents categorized under natural phenomena.  4.2.3.1 Fixed Telephony  4.2.3.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  Figure 14: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  20  4.2.3.3 Mobile telephony  4.2.3.4 Mobile internet  4.2.3.5 Other services  System failures is also the main root cause for the other services besides the classic services, with a percentage  of approximately 53%.

Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  21  4.2.4 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  This year, human errors affected most user connections, on average about 1.2 million user connections per incident,  which is a significant increase, compared to the previous year. A significant decrease was noted on malicious actions  4.2.5 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  The reported incidents caused by natural phenomena had by far the longest recovery time on average per incident  with a tremendous increase compared to last year. However, this extraordinary result is an exception due to the last  year’s wildfires.

Figure 20: User hours lost per root cause category (hours).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  23  Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad but give a good summary of the most common types of incidents. In this  section we break down the root cause categories in a set of more detailed causes.  An incident is often a chain of events and failures, involving multiple causes. For instance, an incident may be  triggered by storm, heavy winds, which tear down power supply infrastructure, then cause a power cut, which in  turn leads to an outage because base stations are without power. For this incident both heavy winds and power cuts  are listed as detailed causes. In the annual summary reporting we keep track of these detailed causes.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2017, the most common cause was hardware failure. This is part of a multi-year trend, because in previous years,  hardware failure is always either the first or the second most common cause. Despite last year’s decrease, power  cuts and cable cuts are again in the top four of most frequent causes. The cause “Other” saw an increase this year.  A more in-depth analysis showed that these incidents are different types of system failures.  Figure 21: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  24  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  In this section, we show the detailed causes of incidents for each of the main four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) and for the other services. As in the previous year, also this year,  Hardware failures were the most common causes for failures in all the main four services and for the other services  as well.  4.3.2.1 Fixed Telephony  4.3.2.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 23: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).

Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  28  Assets affected  Also this year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the electronic communications  networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more information about the nature of the outages  and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily involved in them.  4.4.1 Assets affected overall  In 2017, mobile base stations and controllers, and switches and routers were the assets most affected by incidents.  4.4.2 Affected assets in system failures  As for all previous reporting years, system failures (or technical failures), was the most common root cause  category in 2017. In these system failures, the most common assets that failed were power supplies, switches and  routers and other uncategorised assets. Also in the previous year mobile switches, and switches and routers were  the most common assets to fail in this root cause category.  Figure 31: Assets affected by system failures (percentages).  Figure 30: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  29  5. Conclusions  In this report ENISA summarized and analysed the reports about 169 incidents which happened in 2017 affecting  telecom networks and services in the EU. These reports were submitted by National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs)  in 28 EU member states and 2 EFTA countries, as mandated by Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC)Error! Bookmark not defined..  Looking at the 2017 incidents, and looking back at the previous years of incident reporting (2012-2016), we can draw  the following conclusions:   Mobile telephony and internet remain the most affected services: In 2017 most incidents affected mobile  telephony (51% of all reported incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant  affected services in the previous years also, except for 2014 when fixed telephony was the most affected.   Incidents with mobile telephony and mobile internet impact, on average, most users: Incidents affecting  mobile internet or mobile telephony affected most users, on average around half a million users per  reported incident, around 8% of the national user base. Looking at the multiannual trend, there is a  significant decrease compared to the data for 2016.   System failures are the dominant root cause: In 2017 most incidents were caused by system failures, i.e.  more than 62 % had system failure as a root cause. This is in line with previous years (always between 60%  and 80%). In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware failures were the most common  causes. The assets failing in these cases are most often switches, routers, and power supplies.   Natural phenomena are causing more incidents: In 2017 a larger number of incidents (18%) were caused  by natural phenomena, such as heavy snow/ice, storms and wild fires. This is significantly higher than 2016,  2015, and 2014 when natural phenomena accounted for around 5% of the incidents. Natural phenomena  also cause the highest number of user hours lost, on average, per incident, with 56800 user hours.  Natural  phenomena will continue to be a concern for telecom providers across the EU, with extreme weather  becoming more common due to climate change.   A fifth of the incidents are third party failures: Almost a fifth of the incidents (18%) are third party failures.  This is similar to last year (22%). Third party failure incidents are interesting for NRAs to investigate further  because often third-party failures involve other sectors, and are complex and costly to tackle for providers.  Most of the incidents categorized as a third party failures are also categorized as caused by natural  phenomena. A common incident scenario is when a natural disaster, like a storm or wildfire, disrupts the  power grid infrastructure, which then impacts the mobile network infrastructure.  ENISA will continue to work closely with the Article 13a Expert Group and the telecom sector to discuss and analyse  common security incidents and good practices to mitigate them. The ongoing update of the legal framework for  electronic communications (the EECC) is an important step to help the NRAs in understanding the issues facing the  sector. Telecom security remains a top-priority, because, although the sector is quite mature in terms of network  and information security compared to other critical sectors, it is also increasingly critical. The EU’s digital economy  relies on secure and resilient telecom networks and services. Improving resilience and security, while at the same  time adopting new technology, phasing out the old technology, will be a key challenge in the future17.  17 https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/connecting-the-world-whats-it-worth/challenges-in-eu-telecom-security  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  30  References  Related ENISA papers   ENISA’s annual reports telecom security incidents in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 can be found  at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports   ENISA commissioned in an independent impact assessment about Article 13a  “Impact evaluation on the  implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a   The Article 13a Expert Group technical guidelines on incident reporting, security measures, and threats  and assets respectively: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s study 2013 on Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply- dependencies   ENISA’s study 2013 on National Roaming for Resilience: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience- and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience   ENISA’s study and guide 2014 to Electronic Communications Providers when procuring ICT products and  outsourced services for core operations: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors   ENISA’s study 2014 on information sharing systems for announcing civil works in order to protect  underground communications infrastructure from cable cuts:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of- underground-infrastructure   ENISA’s whitepaper from 2012 on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security measures:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting- in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of the situation in  the EU 6 years ago: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/good- practice-guide-on-incident-reporting/good-practice-guide-on-incident-reporting-1  EU legislation   Article 13a of the Framework directive of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140   The full EU regulatory framework for electronic communications (incorporating the Framework Directive  including Article 13a) right after the 2009 reform:  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013 %20NO%20CROPS.pdf   The NIS directive, that also contains incident notification provisions for operators of essential services  (OESs) and digital service providers (DSPs): http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Heraklion Office  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Catalogue Number: TP-AD-18-001-EN-N  1 Vasilissis Sofias Str, Maroussi 151 24, Attiki,  Greece Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-257-8  DOI: 10.2824/017314",

Every year the NRAs report summaries about a selection of  these notified incidents, the most significant incidents, based on a set of agreed thresholds. This document, the  Annual Report on Telecom Security Incidents 2017, aggregates the incident reported in 2017, and provides a single  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents in the EU.  Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the  telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011. The breach  reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents causing significant outages. The Commission recently proposed  an update of the telecom rules. The new breach reporting requirements in Article 40 of the Electronic  Communications Code1 2 have a broader scope, including not only incidents causing outages, but also confidentiality  breaches. Security breach reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU (under Article 19 of the  EIDAS regulation), for Operators of Essential Services in the EU (under Article 14 of the NIS directive) and for Digital  Service Providers (under Article 16 of the NIS directive) in the EU.  Key statistics from the 2017 reporting  This year’s annual incident report covers 169 incidents, reported by the NRAs across the EU. The reports come from  the 28 EU countries and additionally 2 EFTA countries participated. 6 EU countries reported no incidents with  significant impact, submitting so-called empty reports. We highlight some of the statistics:   Most incidents have an impact on mobile telephony and internet: In 2017 most incidents affected mobile  telephony (51% of all reported incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant  affected services in the previous years also, except for 2014 when fixed telephony was the most affected.   Incidents with mobile telephony and mobile internet impact, on average, most users: Incidents affecting  mobile internet or mobile telephony affected most users, on average around half a million users per  reported incident, around 8% of the national user base. Over the past years we observe is a downward trend,  meaning that the average size of reported incidents is decreasing. This could be due to the fact that many  EU countries are adopting lower reporting thresholds.   System failures are the dominant root cause of reported incidents: Most incidents reported were caused  by system failures (62% of the incidents) as a root cause. Often these are hardware failures or software bugs.  1 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4070_en.htm  2 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electronic-communications-code/  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  05   Human errors affect (on average) a high number of user connections: In 2017 human errors was the root  cause category involving most users affected per incident (around 1.2 million user connections on average).   Incidents caused by malicious actions are rare: Only a small percentage of reported incidents (2.5% in 2017)  was categorized as caused by malicious actions. This percentage reduced by half compared to the previous  year (5.1% in 2016).   System failures are the dominant root cause: In 2017 most incidents were caused by system failures, i.e.  more than 62 % had system failure as a root cause. This is in line with previous years (always between 60%  and 80%). In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware failures were the most common  causes. The assets failing in these cases are most often switches, routers, and power supplies.   Natural phenomena are causing more incidents: In 2017 a larger number of incidents (18%) were caused  by natural phenomena, such as heavy snow/ice, storms and wild fires. This is significantly higher than 2016,  2015, and 2014 when natural phenomena accounted for around 5% of the incidents. Natural phenomena  also cause the highest number of user hours lost, on average, per incident, with 56800 user hours.  Natural  phenomena will continue to be a concern for telecom providers across the EU, with extreme weather  becoming more common due to climate change.   A fifth of the incidents are third party failures: Almost a fifth of the incidents (18%) are third party failures.  This is similar to last year (22%). Third party failure incidents are interesting for NRAs to investigate further  because often third-party failures involve other sectors, and are complex and costly to tackle for providers.  Most of the incidents categorized as a third party failures are also categorized as caused by natural  phenomena. A common incident scenario is when a natural disaster, like a storm or wildfire, disrupts the  power grid infrastructure, which then impacts the mobile network infrastructure.   Mobile base stations and controllers the most affected assets: Overall, mobile base stations and controllers  and mobile switches were the network components most affected by incidents (9% and 8% respectively).   Wild fires cause, on average, most impact in user hours: A good measure for the total impact is to multiply  the number of users and the number of hours outage: this gives a total number of user hours. The diagram  below shows the total number of user hours lost, per detailed cause, for the incidents reported in 2017.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  06  Trends in 7 years of reporting  Mandatory security incident reporting was introduced in the 2009 reform which came into force in 2011. ENISA has  been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. Looking back at the 7 years of annual incident reports,  we can observe a number of multi-annual trends.   System failures dominate: Every year system failures are the most common root cause of reported incident,  responsible for about 60-70% of the major outages.   Natural phenomena trending upwards: There is an upward trend in the impact of natural phenomena on  telecom services. Heavy storms, heavy floods, or wildfires cause by extreme drought, can severely impact  the telecom infrastructure. Extreme weather is likely to increase due to climate change and this means that  natural phenomena will continue to be a concern for the EU telecom sector.  Follow-up by NRAs and ENISA  The NRAs are responsible for supervision the security telecom sector in each EU member state. ENISA supports the  NRAs with common guidelines and collecting good practices. Incident reporting is a key pillar of this supervision.  Article 13a and incident reporting are key in allowing the NRAs to understand trends and to work with the sector to  address issues. This positive impact was confirmed also in an independent impact assessment analysing the impact  of EU legislation on telecom security3.  As a follow up to the incident reporting, at the EU level, ENISA works with the NRAs and the private sector to analyse  and address EU-wide issues and trends:   Power cuts are a common cause of outages. In 2013 ENISA analysed power supply dependencies4, and issued  recommendations regarding the sector’s ability to withstand and act efficiently after power cuts.   ENISA published an overview of good practices regarding to national roaming for increased resilience in  mobile networks5. A number of EU Member States have implemented such national roaming frameworks.  3 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a  4 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply-dependencies/  5 See http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/using-national-roaming-to-mitigate-mobile-network-outages201d-new-report-by- eu-cyber-security-agency-enisa  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  07   Issues with ICT equipment were a major source of outages in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, ENISA published  recommendations for providers6 about how to address security requirements when dealing with ICT  equipment vendors and suppliers of outsourced services for core operations.   Cable cuts (due to civil works) were a prominent cause of incidents in the 2012 and 2013 annual incident  reporting. In 2014, ENISA worked with NRAs to publish an overview of good practices and frameworks to  reduce underground cable cuts7.   In 2016, ENISA assessed, EU-wide, which security measures are implemented by telecom providers8.   In 2018, ENISA published an EU state of play report on legacy protocols used for interconnections.9  6 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  7 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of-underground-infrastructure  8 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/security-measures  9 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/legacy-technologies-as-a-threat-to-eu2019s-telecommunications- infrastructure  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  08  1. Introduction  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents, with a significant impact on the  continuity of electronic communication services, to the national telecom regulatory authorities (NRAs) in each EU  member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary to ENISA, covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most  significant incidents, based on a set of agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents  Report 2017, aggregates the incident reports reported in 2017, and gives a single EU-wide overview of telecom  security incidents in the EU.  This is the 7th time ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. ENISA started publishing such  annual reports in 2012. Mandatory breach reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since  the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in  2011. The breach reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents causing significant outages. For example,  consider an attack in which attackers wiretap undersea cables; if this attack causes no outages, then the security  incident does not fall under the breach reporting requirements of Article 13a. The Commission recently proposed  an update of the telecom rules. The new breach reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the Electronic  Communications Code10 have a broader scope, including not only incidents causing outages, but also significant  confidentiality breaches for example.  Note that this document does not contain details about individual countries or individual incident reports and it does  not contain any references to regions, countries or specific providers.  This document is structured as follows: Section 2 and Section 3 briefly summarize Article 13a and the technical details  of the implementation of the annual summary reporting, as agreed by the experts in the Article 13a Expert Group  which involves different NRAs from different EU Member States and EFTA countries. Section 4 contains the statistical  analysis of the incidents from 2017 and contains examples of incidents and Section 5 contains the conclusions.  10 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electronic-communications-code/  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  09  2. Article 13a of the Framework Directive: ‘Security and Integrity’  The reform of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communicationsError! Bookmark not defined., which was adopted  in 2009 and transposed by most EU countries in 2011, added Article 13a to the Framework DirectiveError! Bookmark not  defined.. Article 13a addresses the security and integrity11 of public electronic communications networks and services.  The legislation concerns National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and providers of public electronic communications  networks and services (providers).  Article 13a states that:   Providers of public electronic communications networks and services should take measures to guarantee  security and integrity of their networks.   Providers must notify competent national authorities about breaches of security or loss of integrity that have  had significant impact on the operation of networks or services.   National Regulatory Authorities should notify ENISA and national authorities abroad when necessary, for  example in case of incidents with cross-border impact.   Annually, National Regulatory Authorities should submit a summary report to ENISA and the European  Commission about the incidents.  These incident reporting flows (incident notification and annual reporting) are shown in the diagram below. This  document analyses the incidents from 2017 that have been reported to ENISA (the black dashed arrow).

A public consultation concerning the evaluation and review of the current regulatory framework ended  in December 2015. In this context, ENISA along with the Article 13a Expert Group submitted an opinion on the  evaluation and review of Article 13a and 13b of the Framework Directive, an area which is at the core of ENISA  expertise and competence.  11 Here integrity means network integrity, which is often called availability or continuity in information security literature.  12https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/public-consultation-evaluation-and-review-regulatory-framework- electronic-communications  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  10  3. Article 13a Expert Group and Annual Incident Reporting Procedure  3.1.1 Article 13a Expert group  In 2010, ENISA, Ministries and NRAs initiated a series of meetings (workshops, conference calls) to achieve a  harmonised implementation of Article 13a of the Framework directive. In the following years, during these meetings,  a group of experts from NRAs, now referred to as the Article 13a Expert Group, reached agreement on three non- binding technical guidelines:   Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting13   Technical Guideline on Security Measures14   Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets15  The Article 13a Expert Group continues to meet 3 times per year to develop the technical guidelines and to discuss  the implementation of Article 13a (for example, on how to supervise the electronic communications sector) and to  share knowledge and exchange views about past incidents, and how to address them.  3.1.2 Annual summary reporting by NRAs to ENISA  In spring 2012, the EC agreed with the EU Member States (in meetings of the Communications Committee, COCOM)  to do the first round of annual summary reporting on the 2011 incidents impacting the continuity of supply of  electronic communications services. The decision included a recommendation to use the reporting template agreed  within the Article 13a Expert Group and published by ENISA.  Following the COCOM meeting, ENISA implemented  the technical procedure by deploying a basic electronic form based on the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Incident  Reporting. There was also an agreement that in the coming years, annual reporting would be carried out by the end  of February each year.  In autumn 2012, ENISA developed an online incident reporting tool (called CIRAS), which replaced the electronic  forms exchanged by email. CIRAS allows NRAs to exert greater control over the data reported and provides the NRAs  with better access to data about incidents reported across the EU. Since 2015, ENISA is providing the possibility for  the NRAs to extract graphs from CIRAS based on their search results.  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting procedure, as described in the Article 13a Technical  Guideline on Incident Reporting, which was developed in collaboration with the NRAs.  3.1.3 Services and incidents in scope of reporting  There are four main services (aka classic services) in scope:   Fixed telephony   Mobile telephony   Fixed Internet access   Mobile Internet access  Additionally NRAs can report about other services, such as SMS, MMS, Satellite TV, International roaming, RADIO  broadcasting, TV broadcasting , Cable TV, IPTV, Video on demand, Public WIFI, Web based voice services, Web- based messaging services, and Public email services.  13 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  14 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  15 See https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline_on_threats_and_assets  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  11  Providers are required to notify security incidents to NRAs, if there is a significant impact on the continuity of supply  of electronic communications services. As mentioned, the mandatory reporting requirements in Article 13a focus on  the continuity of the service.  3.1.4 Thresholds for annual summary reporting  To facilitate an efficient and effective process of annual summary reporting from NRAs to ENISA, the NRAs agreed  on a set of EU wide thresholds, based on the duration of an incident and the relative number of customers affected.  Relative thresholds  The relative threshold are based on the duration and the number of users of a service affected as a percentage of  the national user base of the service. NRAs should include incidents in annual summary reporting, if the incident:   lasts more than an hour, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 15 %,   lasts more than 2 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 10 %,   lasts more than 4 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 5 %,   lasts more than 6 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 2 %, or if it   lasts more than 8 hours, and the percentage of users affected is higher than 1 %.  1h<...<2h  2h<...<4h  4h<...<6h  6h<...<8h  >8h  1%<...< 2% of user base  2%<...< 5% of user base  5%<...< 10% of user base  10%<...< 15% of user base  > 15% of user base  Table 1: Threshold for annual summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base  Absolute thresholds  Complementing the relative threshold, there is an absolute threshold: Incidents should be included in annual  summary reporting if the product of duration and number of user connections affected exceeds 60 million user  minutes, or 1 million user hours.  3.1.5 Annual summary reporting template  The annual summary reporting template for annual summary reporting contains fields for the services affected, the  number of customers affected and the duration of the incident.  The annual summary reporting template distinguishes 5 root cause categories:   Natural phenomena – This category includes incidents caused by severe weather, earthquakes, floods,  pandemic diseases, wildfires, wildlife, and so on.   Human errors - This category includes incidents caused by errors committed by employees of the provider  or outside the provider, during the operation of equipment or facilities, the use of tools, the execution of  procedures, etc. E.g. an excavator cutting off a cable.   Malicious attacks - This category includes incidents caused by a deliberate act by someone or some  organisation, e.g. a Denial of Service attack disrupting the service, or a cable theft.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  12   System failures – This category includes incidents caused by technical failures of a system, for example  caused by hardware failures, software bugs or flaws in manuals, procedures or policies.   Third party failures – This category includes incidents caused by a failure or incident at a third party. The  category is used in conjunction with one of the other four root cause categories.  Optionally the template allows NRAs to indicate:   Detailed causes triggering the incident, either as “initial cause” or as “subsequent cause”, because incidents  often involve a chain of events. For example, often a storm, leads to a power cut.   Assets affected by the incident, e.g. HLRs, routers and switches, underground cables etc. These assets are  listed and described in the Article 13a Technical Guideline on Threats and Assets.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  13  4. Analysis of the incidents  In total, all 28 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in this process. Of these, 22 Member States and  2 EFTA countries reported in total 169 significant incidents and 6 countries reported there were no significant  incidents. This is a small increase from the previous year where the same number of countries reported 158  significant incidents.  Figure 3: Countries involved in the annual summary reporting in 2017.  Examples of incidents  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents that are notified to NRAs and  then included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA:   A system failure caused a mobile internet outage for millions of users (duration: hours, connections:  millions, cause: software bug): A software bug occurred  in the Internal system component Software  Deployment Manager (SDM) leading to the degradation of user authorization for mobile data and mobile  voice. As a result end users had difficulties to access mobile services, both voice and data. Also customers  abroad were affected (roaming services). Mobile switches and mobile user registers were affected by this  bug. The provider removed the obstacles in accessing the services  and for the prevention of similar  incidents in the future, a mitigation plan was created in collaboration with software vendors.   System failure caused disruption in, both mobile and fixed, telephony and internet services as well SMS/  MMS services, affecting millions of users (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause: hardware failure):  Outage of several network components used for delivering DSL in the subscriber access network resulted in  the disruption of mobile and fixed telephony and internet access. The provider responded by raising the  capacity of the remaining network components. A subsequent software upgrade resolved the issue  completely.   An attempt at malware infection coming from a malicious action caused outage on fixed internet, fixed  telephony, IPTV and DNS services for more than three days: (duration: days, connections: thousands,  cause: Malicious action ):  A worldwide attack of a botnet attempted to infect maintenance interfaces of  customer premise equipments with malware. This attempt failed but the attack impacted a large number of  fixed internet connections. The provider mitigated this attack by implementing filtering measures in order  to prevent further attacks of this kind. Later the provider updated the firmware of the customer premises  equipments (CPEs) and asked affected customers to disconnect their CPEs from the power supply, and  switch them on again, in order to finalise the update.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  14  The rest of this section contains statistical information.  Note about statistical conclusions: Readers should be cautious when drawing conclusions from the statistics in this  report. In particular, they should take into account that:   The scope of reporting major security incidents is restricted to incidents with an impact on the continuity of  public electronic communication services and networks. There are many other types of incidents with an  impact on security of services and networks, which are under the current telecom framework not in scope  of annual reporting. For example, if attackers would wiretap undersea cables without causing any outages,  then such a security incident would not be included in this process of annual reporting. The new breach  reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the Electronic Communications Code16 have a broader scope,  including not only incidents causing outages, but also confidentiality breaches for example.  The scope of reporting includes major, or significant, incidents scoring above the agreed reporting thresholds (Table 1: Threshold for annual  summary reporting based on a combination of duration and the percentage of the national user base   ). Smaller incidents are not reported at EU level, meaning that the view is skewed towards the larger  incidents. Common incidents that get resolved quickly stay below the radar, so to speak.   National reporting thresholds are different across the EU. Every country has a different size. Thresholds have  also been adapted over the years. Many countries started with relatively high thresholds, lowering them  later on. For instance there is an increase in the number of reported incidents. This does not mean, for  instance, that the telecom sector is getting less secure, or that the total number of incidents is increasing. In  fact, over the years we have seen more incidents getting reported which are on average smaller in size.  Impact of the incidents  First, we look at which services are impacted by the reported incidents.  4.1.1 Impact per service  For the third year in a row most of the reported incidents affected mobile internet. Both mobile internet and  mobile telephony services had an increase on incidents compared to last year’s results.  Figure 4: Impact on classic services (percentage)  16 http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/electronic-communications-code/  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  15  Figure 5: Impact on other services (percentage)  Note that each incident can have an impact on more than one service (which is why the percentages in the chart  add up to more than 100 %).  4.1.2 Number of user connections affected  Mobile internet outages affect most user connections s, with an average of 600 thousand user connections  affected per reported incident. Compared to the previous years this is a 50% decrease, which is significant.  Figure 6: Average number of user connections affected per incident per classic service (1000s).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  16  Note that the averages in these diagrams include both small and large countries. These EU-wide averages, are not  necessarily representative for the size of incidents occurring nationally.  4.1.3 Percentage of the national user base affected  Mobile internet outages impact on average 8% of the national user base (a 14% decrease compared to 2016).  4.1.4 Impact on emergency services  A third of the reported incidents had an impact on the reachability of emergency call-centres, i.e. 112.  Figure 7: Average number of user connections affected (1000s) - other services  Figure 8: Percentage of national user base affected on average per incident per service.  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  17  4.1.5 Impact on interconnections  In 7 % of incidents reported there was an impact on interconnections between providers.  Compared to 2016 this  figure is stable.  Root cause categories  In this section we look at the main root cause categories of reported incidents. For a description of the root cause  categories, see section 3.1.5.  4.2.1 Incidents per root cause category  This year, 62% of the reported incidents were caused by system failures or technical failures. For all reporting  years, system failures has been the most common root cause category. In second place, for this year is root cause  of human errors (18,3% of the reported incidents), a small increase compared with previous years. Natural  phenomena as expected due to the wildfires consist of 17%.  Figure 9: Impact on emergency calls.  Figure 10: Impact on interconnections (percentage)  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  18  4.2.2 Third party failures  Around 18% of the incidents reported were categorized as third party failures, a slight decrease compared to the  previous year (22.5%).  Figure 11: Incidents per root cause category (percentage).  Figure 12: Third party failures and non-third party failures of all incidents (percentages).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  19  4.2.3 Root cause categories per service  In this section, we look at the root causes for the services separately.  As in 2016, also in 2017, system failures was  the dominant root cause for all services, scoring more than half of the incidents reported per service. For mobile  telephony and mobile internet, this was the case also in the previous years, whereas the dominant root cause for  fixed telephony and fixed internet oscillated in the previous years between natural phenomena and system failures.  Wildfires caused a significant increase in the number of incidents categorized under natural phenomena.  4.2.3.1 Fixed Telephony  4.2.3.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 13: Root cause categories for fixed telephony (percentage).  Figure 14: Root cause categories for fixed Internet (percentage).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  20  4.2.3.3 Mobile telephony  4.2.3.4 Mobile internet  4.2.3.5 Other services  System failures is also the main root cause for the other services besides the classic services, with a percentage  of approximately 53%.  Figure 16: Root cause categories for mobile Internet (percentage).  Figure 15: Root cause categories for mobile telephony (percentage).  Figure 17: Root cause categories for other services (percentage).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  21  4.2.4 Average number of user connections affected per root cause category  This year, human errors affected most user connections, on average about 1.2 million user connections per incident,  which is a significant increase, compared to the previous year. A significant decrease was noted on malicious actions  4.2.5 Average duration of incidents per root cause category  The reported incidents caused by natural phenomena had by far the longest recovery time on average per incident  with a tremendous increase compared to last year. However, this extraordinary result is an exception due to the last  year’s wildfires.  Figure 18: Average number of user connections affected per incident per root cause (1000s)  Figure 19: Average duration of incidents per root cause category (hours).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  22  4.2.6 User hours lost per root cause category  Natural phenomena also cause the highest number of user hours lost, on average, per incident, with 56800 user  hours.  Figure 20: User hours lost per root cause category (hours).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  23  Detailed causes  Root cause categories are rather broad but give a good summary of the most common types of incidents. In this  section we break down the root cause categories in a set of more detailed causes.  An incident is often a chain of events and failures, involving multiple causes. For instance, an incident may be  triggered by storm, heavy winds, which tear down power supply infrastructure, then cause a power cut, which in  turn leads to an outage because base stations are without power. For this incident both heavy winds and power cuts  are listed as detailed causes. In the annual summary reporting we keep track of these detailed causes.  4.3.1 Detailed causes of all incidents  In 2017, the most common cause was hardware failure. This is part of a multi-year trend, because in previous years,  hardware failure is always either the first or the second most common cause. Despite last year’s decrease, power  cuts and cable cuts are again in the top four of most frequent causes. The cause “Other” saw an increase this year.  A more in-depth analysis showed that these incidents are different types of system failures.  Figure 21: Detailed causes of reported incidents (percentage)  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  24  4.3.2 Detailed causes per service  In this section, we show the detailed causes of incidents for each of the main four services (fixed telephony, fixed  Internet, mobile telephony and mobile Internet) and for the other services. As in the previous year, also this year,  Hardware failures were the most common causes for failures in all the main four services and for the other services  as well.  4.3.2.1 Fixed Telephony  4.3.2.2 Fixed Internet  Figure 23: Detailed causes for fixed Internet (percentage).  Figure 22: Detailed causes for fixed telephony (percentage).

Figure 25: Detailed causes for mobile Internet (percentage).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  26  4.3.2.5 Other services  Half of the incidents (almost 50%) with an impact on other services (other than the four main services) were  caused by power cuts (33%), hardware failures (21%) and software bugs (15%), see the graph below.  4.3.2.6 Average number of user connections affected per detailed cause  On average software bugs cause incidents affecting most user connections.  Figure 26: Detailed causes for other services (percentage).  Figure 27: Average number of user connections affected per detailed cause (hours).

Figure 28: Average duration of incidents per detailed cause category (hours).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  28  Assets affected  Also this year we received reports from NRAs about which components or assets of the electronic communications  networks were affected by the incidents. This provides some more information about the nature of the outages  and what assets of the infrastructure that were primarily involved in them.  4.4.1 Assets affected overall  In 2017, mobile base stations and controllers, and switches and routers were the assets most affected by incidents.  4.4.2 Affected assets in system failures  As for all previous reporting years, system failures (or technical failures), was the most common root cause  category in 2017. In these system failures, the most common assets that failed were power supplies, switches and  routers and other uncategorised assets. Also in the previous year mobile switches, and switches and routers were  the most common assets to fail in this root cause category.  Figure 31: Assets affected by system failures (percentages).  Figure 30: Assets affected by the incidents (percentage).  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  29  5. Conclusions  In this report ENISA summarized and analysed the reports about 169 incidents which happened in 2017 affecting  telecom networks and services in the EU. These reports were submitted by National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs)  in 28 EU member states and 2 EFTA countries, as mandated by Article 13a of the Framework Directive  (2009/140/EC)Error! Bookmark not defined..  Looking at the 2017 incidents, and looking back at the previous years of incident reporting (2012-2016), we can draw  the following conclusions:   Mobile telephony and internet remain the most affected services: In 2017 most incidents affected mobile  telephony (51% of all reported incidents). Mobile internet and mobile telephony were the predominant  affected services in the previous years also, except for 2014 when fixed telephony was the most affected.   Incidents with mobile telephony and mobile internet impact, on average, most users: Incidents affecting  mobile internet or mobile telephony affected most users, on average around half a million users per  reported incident, around 8% of the national user base. Looking at the multiannual trend, there is a  significant decrease compared to the data for 2016.   System failures are the dominant root cause: In 2017 most incidents were caused by system failures, i.e.  more than 62 % had system failure as a root cause. This is in line with previous years (always between 60%  and 80%). In the category system failures, software bugs and hardware failures were the most common  causes. The assets failing in these cases are most often switches, routers, and power supplies.   Natural phenomena are causing more incidents: In 2017 a larger number of incidents (18%) were caused  by natural phenomena, such as heavy snow/ice, storms and wild fires. This is significantly higher than 2016,  2015, and 2014 when natural phenomena accounted for around 5% of the incidents. Natural phenomena  also cause the highest number of user hours lost, on average, per incident, with 56800 user hours.  Natural  phenomena will continue to be a concern for telecom providers across the EU, with extreme weather  becoming more common due to climate change.   A fifth of the incidents are third party failures: Almost a fifth of the incidents (18%) are third party failures.  This is similar to last year (22%). Third party failure incidents are interesting for NRAs to investigate further  because often third-party failures involve other sectors, and are complex and costly to tackle for providers.  Most of the incidents categorized as a third party failures are also categorized as caused by natural  phenomena. A common incident scenario is when a natural disaster, like a storm or wildfire, disrupts the  power grid infrastructure, which then impacts the mobile network infrastructure.  ENISA will continue to work closely with the Article 13a Expert Group and the telecom sector to discuss and analyse  common security incidents and good practices to mitigate them. The ongoing update of the legal framework for  electronic communications (the EECC) is an important step to help the NRAs in understanding the issues facing the  sector. Telecom security remains a top-priority, because, although the sector is quite mature in terms of network  and information security compared to other critical sectors, it is also increasingly critical. The EU’s digital economy  relies on secure and resilient telecom networks and services. Improving resilience and security, while at the same  time adopting new technology, phasing out the old technology, will be a key challenge in the future17.  17 https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/connecting-the-world-whats-it-worth/challenges-in-eu-telecom-security  Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2017  August 2018  30  References  Related ENISA papers   ENISA’s annual reports telecom security incidents in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 can be found  at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/annual-reports   ENISA commissioned in an independent impact assessment about Article 13a  “Impact evaluation on the  implementation of Article 13a incident reporting scheme within EU”:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/impact-evaluation-article13a   The Article 13a Expert Group technical guidelines on incident reporting, security measures, and threats  and assets respectively: https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13   ENISA’s study 2013 on Power Supply Dependencies in the Electronic Communications Sector:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/power-supply- dependencies   ENISA’s study 2013 on National Roaming for Resilience: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience- and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/national-roaming-for-resilience   ENISA’s study and guide 2014 to Electronic Communications Providers when procuring ICT products and  outsourced services for core operations: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors   ENISA’s study 2014 on information sharing systems for announcing civil works in order to protect  underground communications infrastructure from cable cuts:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/protection-of- underground-infrastructure   ENISA’s whitepaper from 2012 on cyber incident reporting in the EU shows Article 13a and how it  compares to some other security articles mandating incident reporting and security measures:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/cyber-incident-reporting- in-the-eu   For the interested reader, ENISA’s 2009 paper on incident reporting shows an overview of the situation in  the EU 6 years ago: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/good- practice-guide-on-incident-reporting/good-practice-guide-on-incident-reporting-1  EU legislation   Article 13a of the Framework directive of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications:  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140   The full EU regulatory framework for electronic communications (incorporating the Framework Directive  including Article 13a) right after the 2009 reform:  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013 %20NO%20CROPS.pdf   The NIS directive, that also contains incident notification provisions for operators of essential services  (OESs) and digital service providers (DSPs): http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC  ENISA  European Union Agency for Network  and Information Security  1 Vasilissis Sofias  Marousi 151 24, Attiki, Greece  Heraklion Office  Science and Technology Park of Crete (ITE)  Vassilika Vouton, 700 13, Heraklion, Greece  Catalogue Number: TP-AD-18-001-EN-N  1 Vasilissis Sofias Str, Maroussi 151 24, Attiki,  Greece Tel: +30 28 14 40 9710  info@enisa.europa.eu  www.enisa.europa.eu  ISBN: 978-92-9204-257-8  DOI: 10.2824/017314",

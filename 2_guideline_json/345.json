At the start of every calendar year, the national authorities for  telecom security send a summary about these incidents to ENISA. This document, the Annual  Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019, covers the incidents reported by the authorities for the  calendar year 2019 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated EU-wide overview of telecom  security incidents.  Security incident reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the  2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC)  came into force in 2011. The incident reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents with  significant impact on the operation of services, i.e. outages of the electronic communication  networks and/or services.  Statistics annual summary reporting 2019  The 2019 annual summary reporting contains reports about 153 incidents submitted by national  authorities from the 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost,  multiplying for each incident the number of users and the number of hours was 988.12 Million  User Hours, i.e. roughly 0.026% of the total user hours in a year1.  It should be noted that the current incident reporting is not the full telecom security picture,  because it only covers the largest incidents that cause the big outages.  Figure 1: Number of incidents and million user hours lost per year  1 Using a basis of 500M (EU citizens) times 365 (days) times 24 (hours). User hours is a metric we use throughout this  report to quantify the impact of an incident, multiplying the number of subscribers/connections affected, with the duration in  hours. For example, 1M User Hours means 1M users were affected for one hour, or 2M users for half an hour, etc.  In 2019, half of the  total user hours  lost were due to  system failures.  In 2019, human  errors were more  frequent, an  increase of 50%  compared to 2018  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  4  Key takeaways from the 2019 incidents   System failures dominate in terms of impact: they represent almost half of the total  user hours lost (479 million user hours). They are also the most frequent root cause of  incidents: 56% of the total. Over the last 4 years, both the frequency and overall impact  of system failures have been trending down significantly.   Incidents caused by human errors have risen: More than a quarter (26%) of total  incidents have human errors as a root cause. Human errors have increased with 50%  compared to the previous year.   Third-party failures show a great increase: Almost a third of the incidents were also  flagged as third-party failures (31%), i.e. incidents which originated in third party, say a  utility company, a contractor, a supplier, etc. This number tripled compared to 2018,  when it was just 9%.  Figure 2: Root Causes and Third party failures – 2019   Power cuts are the second most common detailed cause: Overall, independent  from the underlying root cause, power cuts are either a primary or a secondary cause  in over a fifth of the major incidents.   Natural phenomena have a major impact: Natural phenomena account for a third  of the total user hours lost, which brings them in the second place in terms of impact.  Figure 3: Share of user hours lost for each root cause category in 2019  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  5  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing the incidents. It can be used to dive into other  aspects and detailed causes. See:  Multiannual trends over 8 years of reporting  Every year, the incident data points to important issues and trends. Apart from the national  initiatives, the EU telecom security authorities also collaborate with ENISA on an EU level to  analyse and work on specific issues.  Figure 4: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU - reported over 2012-2019   Total number of incidents reported is stabilizing at around 160: Over the period  2014-2019, there is a consistent number of incidents reported which is stabilizing at  around 160 incidents per year.   Sharp drop of the average impact of incidents: Until 2017, there was a gradual  increase of total user hours lost per year. But in 2018 we see a sharp drop in the total  user hours lost compared to previous years. This trend continues in 2019.   Share of incidents caused by human errors is trending up: The percentage of  incidents caused by Human errors in regards with the total number of incidents has  been trending up since 2016 and now in 2019 they account for 21% of the total  number of incidents.   System failures continue to be the most frequent cause of incidents, but their  average size is trending down: Every year system failures have been the most  common root cause category. Although, since 2016 the average size of these incidents  is decreasing, between 2018 and 2019 we observe a slight increase in lost user hours  due to system failures, and a corresponding decrease to hours lost due to natural  phenomena.   Frequency and impact of malicious actions stable: Over the reporting period the  frequency of malicious actions is stable (approximately accounting for 5% of incidents  per year). Their impact in terms of user hours is stable also.  We refer the reader to the body of this paper for more details.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-  incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  6  Outlook  Security incident reporting has is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and it is an  important enabler for cybersecurity supervision and policy making, at national and EU level.  Since 2016 security incident reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU,  under Article 19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS Directive (NISD), security  incident reporting became mandatory for Operators of Essential Services in the EU and for  Digital Service Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS directive.  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will come into  effect across the EU. Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a  broader scope, including not only outages, but also breaches of confidentiality, for instance.  Also, there are more services in scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom  operators, but also for example over-the-top providers of communications services.  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline will be updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA combining quantitative and qualitative parameters and also the  notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet and  telephony, but also the number-based interpersonal communications services and/or number  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).  ENISA has been working with national authorities and experts from the private sector to prepare  the ground for the above mentioned changes.  ENISA is also working with the NIS Cooperation group to find and exploit synergies between the  different pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes to incident reporting and cross-  border supervision.  We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with the EU member states, the national  telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe to implement  security incident reporting efficiently and effectively.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents with a significant  impact on the continuity of electronic communication services, to the national telecom regulatory  authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary to ENISA,  covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most significant incidents, based on a set of  agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2019,  aggregates the incident reports reported in 2019 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 9th year ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. ENISA  started publishing such annual reports in 2012. Mandatory incident reporting has been part of  the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article  13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  The mandatory incident reporting under Article 13a has a specific focus on security incidents  with a significant impact on the functioning of the service. There is some divergence and  discussion about what is in scope here, but the authorities agreed to focus on network/service  outages. This would leave out of scope for example an attack involving a wiretap on an  undersea cable or a BGP hijack, if the attack causes no outages. Recently the Council and  Parliament agreed about an update of the EU telecom rules called the European Electronic  Communications Code (EECC). The incident reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the EECC  have a broader scope, including explicitly also for example breaches of confidentiality. An  incident like the one just mentioned would be reportable under (Article 40 of) the EECC.  This document is structured as follows: In section 2 we briefly summarize the reporting  procedure and to give an idea about the kind of incidents that are reported we give some  specific but anonymized examples of incidents that occurred in 2019. In Section 3 we provide  some key facts and statistics about the 2019 incidents. In Section 4 we take a closer look at  Human Errors as a root cause of incidents. In section 5 we look at multiannual trends over the  years 2012-2019.  Note that conclusions about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with  care, because national reporting thresholds have changed over the years, reporting thresholds  have been lowered in most countries, and because the incident reporting only covers the most  significant incidents (and not smaller incidents which may be more frequent).  This is the 9th  time ENISA  publishes an  annual incident  report for the  telecom sector.  Mandatory  incident  reporting has  been part of the  EU’s telecom  regulatory  framework since  the 2009 reform  of the telecom  package: Article  13a of the  Framework  directive  (2009/140/EC)  came into force  in 2011.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  8  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting process, as described in the Article  13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting2, which was developed in collaboration with the  national authorities.  2.1 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a introduces three types of incident reporting: 1) National incident reporting from  providers to NRAs, 2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and 3) Annual  summary reporting from national authorities to the EC and ENISA. The different types of  reporting are shown in the diagram below.  Figure 5: Incident Reporting Framework for Telecom Servicies  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymizing aggregating and analysing  the incident reports. In the current setup NRAs can search incidents in the reporting tool  (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making the  overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.2 EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS REPORTED  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents that are  notified to NRAs and then included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA:   Three high-capacity optical fibres were simultaneously cut, which caused mobile  internet and telephony and also fixed internet and telephony outage in a national  level for three hours (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: human  errors): In two of these cases, the cables were cut as a result of road modernization  2 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  9  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-  incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  works (carried out by third parties); in the third case, the optical fiber was affected  following a landslide. The incident had a national impact.   The fixed network of an operator got isolated from all other networks during 3  hours, affecting emergency calls from all the other networks for millions of users  for 3 hours (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause: system failures):  Since all emergency call centres were connected to this fixed network, emergency  calls were not possible from all those other networks. The cause of the incident was a  software bug that caused an interconnection platform to fail due to a combination of  circumstances.  Following this incident, multiple meetings were organized between the NRA, the main  operators and the emergency services to identify single points of failure and discuss  possible technical solutions to avoid similar incidents in the future and reduce their  impact.   A DDos attack caused a 13 hour outage of the VoIP service for 400.000 users  (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: malicious actions): Corrective  measures taken included hardening of the systems and hardening of firewall rules.   A power outage caused mobile telephony, internet and sms outage for 100000  users and duration of 10 hours (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause:  natural phenomena):  A power outage caused by a storm had as a result the failure of  the technological terminal equipment in the whole country. All processes we set up  successfully and spare power supplies were activated.   A software bug of a third party internet access service provider affected a data  center, causing email (OTT service) outage for more than a hundred users  during 8 hours (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: system  failures: The affected data center caused an outage of the email service. The  connections with the third party internet access service provider were reduced.  2.3 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  In 2020, ENISA has released a new version of CIRAS, the tool for statistical analysis of  cybersecurity incidents. Telecom security incidents reported for the year 2019 are available on  the new CIRAS  Experts from the national authorities have access to the ENISA CIRAS incident reporting tool,  where they can search for and study specific incidents. This tool anonymizes the country or  operator involved.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  10  3. ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENTS  In 2019, 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in the annual reporting,  reporting a total of 153 significant incidents. In this section, the 153 reported incidents are  aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per root cause category is analysed (in section 3.1),  in section 3.2 we focus on the user hours that have been lost per root cause category, then  detailed causes are examined (Section 3.3), and in Section 3.4 the impact per service is analysed.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  In 2019 more than half of the telecom security incidents were system failures. This is consistent  with previous years, although somewhat lower. Often they are hardware failures and software  bugs.  Human errors show an increase, rising up to one fourth of the security incidents.  Most  often these are accidental cable cuts and faulty software changes/updates. 13% of the incidents  are caused by natural phenomena also increased up to 30% compared to the previous year.  Only 5% of incidents were due to malicious actions. Typically these cases are denial of service  attacks, cable theft and arson.  Figure 6: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents – 2019  There is a fifth category called Third-party failures, which can be selected (only) in conjunction  with another root cause category. Typically third party failures are incidents which happen at a  utility company or supplier and then affect the telecom providers, for example a cable cut.  Figure 7: Root Causes and Third party failures - 2019  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  11  In total over 2019, 32% of incidents were flagged as third-party failures, which is greatly  increased in comparison with the previous years. The division is shown in the chart below.  3.2 USER HOURS LOST FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY  Adding up the total user hours lost for each root cause category we find that almost half of the  total user hours lost were due to system failures (48%, 479 million user hours). Natural  phenomena account for almost one third of user hours lost (30%, 289 million user hours) and  human errors for almost one fifth of user hours lost (21%, 208 million user hours).  Figure 8: Share of user hours lost for each root cause category in 2019  So system failures are the most common (see section 3.1) and they also have more impact than  the other root causes. However, human errors have doubled their percentage in impact and  they are also more common than in 2018. Also, natural phenomena have less impact than  2018, although the number of incidents caused by natural phenomena has raised.  The multi annual trends graph for user hours lost per root cause category (see section 5.3)  shows this is the first year that natural phenomena account for more user hours lost than  system failures.  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but can involve multiple detailed causes, a  chain of events.For instance, an incident may be triggered by a storm, which tears down power  supply infrastructure, power cuts and cable cuts, which in turn leads to a telecom outage. For  this example detailed causes could be: Heavy wind, Cable cut, Power cut, Battery depletion.  The root cause of the incident would be natural phenomena.  In the following graph we show the frequency of the detailed causes.  Figure 9: Detailed causes - 2019  22% 21%  15% 13%  12% 11%  7% 6%  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  12  In 2019, the most common cause of incidents was hardware failures, which confirms the multi-  annual trend in which hardware failure is always either the first or the second most common  cause. Power cuts became the second most common “detailed cause”. Around a fifth of the  incidents reported involved a power cut. Hardware failures, power cuts, faulty software updates  and  software bugs remain the top four causes, as in the previous years. Some detailed causes  mentioned in incidents reports do not fall under a specific category and they are grouped under  “Other”.  In the following charts, we look at the frequency of detailed causes under each root cause  category.  Figure 10: System failures - detailed causes  Figure 11: Human errors - detailed causes  Figure 12: Natural phenomena - detailed causes  3  6  6  9  11  15  21  30  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35  Cable cut  Overload  Policy/procedure flaw  Power cut  Other  Faulty software change/update  Software bugs  Hardware failures  1  1  1  1  2  3  5  12  15  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16  Hardware failure  Fire  Other  Flood  Cable cut  Heavy  snow/ice  External env causes  Heavy wind  Power cut  1  2  3  4  6  6  9  12  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14  External env causes  Security shutdown  Policy/procedure flaw  Faulty hardware change/update  Power cut  Other  Faulty software change/update  Cable cut  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  13  Figure 13: Malicious actions - detailed causes  Custom analysis over the full dataset can be done using CIRAS (see par. 2.3). For example, by  selecting system failures (top left), then fixed internet and telephony (top right), the charts at the  bottom show the detailed causes for the selected subset of incidents.  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section we look at the services affected by the incidents. For the fourth year in a row,  most of the reported incidents affected mobile services. In 2019, almost the half of the incidents  reported had an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift over  the last years. Fixed telephony was the most affected service only in the early years of  reporting.  Figure 14: Services affected  Note that for most reported incidents there is impact on more than one service, which explains  why the percentages in the chart here add up to more than 100%.  In the following pie charts the affected services are presented in relation to the four root causes.  1  1  1  2  2  3  0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5  Hardware failure  Vulnerability exploit  Power cut  Cable cut  Arson  DDoS  28%  34%  51%  56%  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  Fixed internet Fixed telephony Mobile internet Mobile telephony  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  14  Figure 15: Mobile telephony vs root causes  Figure 16: Mobile internet vs root causes  Having a closer look at the charts, we can conclude that system failures are the dominant root  cause for mobile telephony and internet, whereas in fixed internet, human errors are the most  common root cause.  Figure 17: Fixed telephony vs root causes  59%22%  16%  3%  42%  38%  10%  10%  55%  21%  21%  3%  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  15  In general, fixed telephony and internet seem to be severely affected by human errors even more  than natural phenomena. Natural phenomena are responsible for 1 out of 10 incidents in fixed  telephony and for the 14% of incidents in fixed internet.  Finally, malicious actions are responsible for 10% and 14% of incidents in fixed telephony and  internet respectively, however in mobile telephony and internet this percentage is much lower  (3% for mobile telephony and the same for mobile internet).  Figure 18: Fixed internet vs root causes  42%  33%  14%  11%  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  16  4. DETAILED ANALYSIS – HUMAN ERRORS  In 2019, the number of incidents caused by human errors has risen up to 50% compared to the  previous year. More than one fourth of the security incidents were caused by human errors and  these incidents account for one fifth of the total user hours lost (21%, 208 million user hours).  Considering the above remarks, in this section we perform a deep dive in human errors.  Looking carefully at the multiannual graph above, though it is not the first time since 2012 that  human errors are responsible for almost 20% of the incidents, it seems that they are trending up  since 2016.  Figure 19: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU - reported over 2012-2019  For all incidents having as a root cause human errors, we can see the detailed causes in the  graph below. Most incidents caused by human errors are about cable cuts and the second more  frequent detailed cause is faulty software change or update.  Figure 20: Human errors - detailed cause  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  50%  of the incidents  were caused by  human error,  accounting for  208 million user  hour lost, 21% of  the total.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  17  In 2019, the increased number of incidents caused by human errors (raising from 18% in 2018 to  26% in 2019) is due to third-party failures, taking into account that third-party failures accounted  in 2019 for 12% of incidents that had human errors as the root cause, whereas in 2018 this  percentage was 3%.  Also, as far as human errors are concerned, fixed telephony and internet are the most affected  services, which doesn’t follow the general conclusion that mobile internet and telephony are  mostly affected by security incidents during the last years.  Figure 21: Services affected by human errors  As for the affected assets, the graph below indicates that human errors have a major impact on  switches and routers in fixed telephony and internet.

MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section, we look  at the multiannual trends over the last 8 years, covering from 2012 to 2019. This dataset  contains 1093 reported incidents in total.  5.1 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS - ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Every year from 2012 to 2019, system failures are the most common root cause. In 2019,  however, system failures show a considerable decrease. In fact, in 2019 the number of  incidents due to system failures is the lowest since 2012. In total system failures account for 722  of incident reports (66% of the total). For this root cause category, over the last 8 years, the  most common causes were hardware failures (36%) and software bugs (28%). The second  most common root cause over the 8 years of reporting is human errors with nearly a fifth of total  incidents (19%, 202 incidents in total). Natural phenomena come third at almost a tenth of total  incidents (9%, 109 incidents in total). Only 5% of the incidents are categorized as malicious  actions. In the period 2012-2019 nearly two thirds of the malicious actions consist of Denial of  Service attacks, and the rest resulted mainly in lasting damage to physical infrastructure.  Figure 23: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU - reported over 2012-2019  5.2 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS - IMPACT PER SERVICE  In 2019 mobile networks and services were the most impacted by incidents. This is part of a  multiannual trend. Only in 2014 the fixed networks and services was where the most affected.  Looking back at the 8 years of annual incident reporting, a total of 1093 incidents, almost half  had an impact on mobile internet or mobile telephony. The chart below shows the multiannual  trends over the 2012-2019 period. It indicates the share of the total incidents for each year that  involved one of the four classic telecommunication services. For instance, in 2019 56% of the  incidents had to do with mobile telephony.  1093  Incidents were  reported over  8 years of  reporting,  2012-2019.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  19  Figure 24: Trend on classic services affected per year  5.3 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS - USER HOURS PER ROOT CAUSE  Adding up the total user hours lost per root cause category, we observe that human errors have  been increasing since 2016. In 2019, although system failure is the dominant root cause  category, human errors show a raise of almost 50% compared to the previous year. Between  2018 and 2019 we observe a slight increase in lost user hours due to system failures, and a  corresponding decrease to hours lost due to natural phenomena. Malicious actions are stable  over the years.

This is probably due to  more reporting by providers, better awareness about the reporting obligations, and partly  due to lower national thresholds for annual summary reporting.  In the chart below we also show total numbers of incidents reported and total user hours lost  per year over the period 2012-2019. There was an upward trend in user hours lost reaching a  peak in 2017 with 1942 million user hours lost. Interestingly there was a sharp drop in the  average user hours lost per incident reported over 2018 and they remain at the same level in  2019. This could lead to the conclusion that 2018 was a start of a longer trend.

CONCLUSIONS  This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019, covers the incidents  reported by the authorities for the calendar year 2019 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. It marks the 9th time ENISA publishes an  annual report for the telecom sector.  We would like to conclude highlighting the most important findings and including some more  general observations about this process and the broader policy context.  6.1 KEY TAKEAWAYS  The key takeaways from the 2019 incidents are:   Annual number of incidents seems to be stabilizing at around 160: this shows that  the process of incident reporting has matured among operators and national authorities  so that worth-mentioning incidents get the attention they deserve. This is probably due  to more reporting by providers, better awareness about the reporting obligations, and  partly due to lower national thresholds for annual summary reporting.   The sharp decline in total number of user hours lost: between 2017 and 2018, was  not an exception. Also in 2019, the number of user hours lost remained low.   Looking into the system failures, hardware failures are a major factor in 2019:  almost a quarter of incidents (23%) were caused by hardware failures and they also  had a major impact in terms of user hours with 38% of the total. Also, software bugs  are still a concern, since they are responsible for 15% of the incidents.   Frequency of human errors is trending up: In 2019, this raise is mostly due to third-  party failures, often during construction works that led to cable/optic fiber cuts or  because of faulty software updates, performed by subcontractors.   Natural phenomena are trending up: due to severe weather conditions and climate  change.   One incident involving a fire had a major impact: It can be difficult to recover from a  fire and it often takes hours or days before the operator can even start repairs. Fire  protection as well as redundancy are important to consider.  6.2 OBSERVATIONS  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will come into  effect across the EU. Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a  broader scope, including not only outages, but also breaches of confidentiality. Also, there are  more services in scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom operators, but also  for example over-the-top providers of communications services.  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline will be updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA combining quantitative and qualitative parameters. Furthermore,  the notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet  and telephony, but also the number-based interpersonal communications services and/or  number independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).

At the start of every calendar year, the national authorities for  telecom security send a summary about these incidents to ENISA. This document, the Annual  Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019, covers the incidents reported by the authorities for the  calendar year 2019 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated EU-wide overview of telecom  security incidents.  Security incident reporting has been part of the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the  2009 reform of the telecom package: Article 13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC)  came into force in 2011. The incident reporting in Article 13a focuses on security incidents with  significant impact on the operation of services, i.e. outages of the electronic communication  networks and/or services.  Statistics annual summary reporting 2019  The 2019 annual summary reporting contains reports about 153 incidents submitted by national  authorities from the 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries. The total user hours lost,  multiplying for each incident the number of users and the number of hours was 988.12 Million  User Hours, i.e. roughly 0.026% of the total user hours in a year1.  It should be noted that the current incident reporting is not the full telecom security picture,  because it only covers the largest incidents that cause the big outages.  Figure 1: Number of incidents and million user hours lost per year  1 Using a basis of 500M (EU citizens) times 365 (days) times 24 (hours). User hours is a metric we use throughout this  report to quantify the impact of an incident, multiplying the number of subscribers/connections affected, with the duration in  hours. For example, 1M User Hours means 1M users were affected for one hour, or 2M users for half an hour, etc.  In 2019, half of the  total user hours  lost were due to  system failures.  In 2019, human  errors were more  frequent, an  increase of 50%  compared to 2018  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  4  Key takeaways from the 2019 incidents   System failures dominate in terms of impact: they represent almost half of the total  user hours lost (479 million user hours). They are also the most frequent root cause of  incidents: 56% of the total. Over the last 4 years, both the frequency and overall impact  of system failures have been trending down significantly.   Incidents caused by human errors have risen: More than a quarter (26%) of total  incidents have human errors as a root cause. Human errors have increased with 50%  compared to the previous year.   Third-party failures show a great increase: Almost a third of the incidents were also  flagged as third-party failures (31%), i.e. incidents which originated in third party, say a  utility company, a contractor, a supplier, etc. This number tripled compared to 2018,  when it was just 9%.  Figure 2: Root Causes and Third party failures – 2019   Power cuts are the second most common detailed cause: Overall, independent  from the underlying root cause, power cuts are either a primary or a secondary cause  in over a fifth of the major incidents.   Natural phenomena have a major impact: Natural phenomena account for a third  of the total user hours lost, which brings them in the second place in terms of impact.  Figure 3: Share of user hours lost for each root cause category in 2019  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  5  ENISA offers an online visual tool for analysing the incidents. It can be used to dive into other  aspects and detailed causes. See:  Multiannual trends over 8 years of reporting  Every year, the incident data points to important issues and trends. Apart from the national  initiatives, the EU telecom security authorities also collaborate with ENISA on an EU level to  analyse and work on specific issues.  Figure 4: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU - reported over 2012-2019   Total number of incidents reported is stabilizing at around 160: Over the period  2014-2019, there is a consistent number of incidents reported which is stabilizing at  around 160 incidents per year.   Sharp drop of the average impact of incidents: Until 2017, there was a gradual  increase of total user hours lost per year. But in 2018 we see a sharp drop in the total  user hours lost compared to previous years. This trend continues in 2019.   Share of incidents caused by human errors is trending up: The percentage of  incidents caused by Human errors in regards with the total number of incidents has  been trending up since 2016 and now in 2019 they account for 21% of the total  number of incidents.   System failures continue to be the most frequent cause of incidents, but their  average size is trending down: Every year system failures have been the most  common root cause category. Although, since 2016 the average size of these incidents  is decreasing, between 2018 and 2019 we observe a slight increase in lost user hours  due to system failures, and a corresponding decrease to hours lost due to natural  phenomena.   Frequency and impact of malicious actions stable: Over the reporting period the  frequency of malicious actions is stable (approximately accounting for 5% of incidents  per year). Their impact in terms of user hours is stable also.  We refer the reader to the body of this paper for more details.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-  incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  6  Outlook  Security incident reporting has is a hallmark of EU cybersecurity legislation and it is an  important enabler for cybersecurity supervision and policy making, at national and EU level.  Since 2016 security incident reporting is also mandatory for trust service providers in the EU,  under Article 19 of the EIDAS regulation. In 2018, under the NIS Directive (NISD), security  incident reporting became mandatory for Operators of Essential Services in the EU and for  Digital Service Providers, under Article 14 and Article 16 of the NIS directive.  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will come into  effect across the EU. Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a  broader scope, including not only outages, but also breaches of confidentiality, for instance.  Also, there are more services in scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom  operators, but also for example over-the-top providers of communications services.  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline will be updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA combining quantitative and qualitative parameters and also the  notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet and  telephony, but also the number-based interpersonal communications services and/or number  independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).  ENISA has been working with national authorities and experts from the private sector to prepare  the ground for the above mentioned changes.  ENISA is also working with the NIS Cooperation group to find and exploit synergies between the  different pieces of EU legislation, particularly when it comes to incident reporting and cross-  border supervision.  We look forward to continuing our close collaboration with the EU member states, the national  telecom authorities and experts from the telecom sector from across Europe to implement  security incident reporting efficiently and effectively.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  7  1. INTRODUCTION  Electronic communication providers in the EU have to notify security incidents with a significant  impact on the continuity of electronic communication services, to the national telecom regulatory  authorities (NRAs) in each EU member state. Every year the NRAs report a summary to ENISA,  covering a selection of these incidents, i.e. the most significant incidents, based on a set of  agreed EU-wide thresholds. This document, the Annual Security Incidents Report 2019,  aggregates the incident reports reported in 2019 and gives a single EU-wide overview of  telecom security incidents in the EU.  This is the 9th year ENISA publishes an annual incident report for the telecom sector. ENISA  started publishing such annual reports in 2012. Mandatory incident reporting has been part of  the EU’s telecom regulatory framework since the 2009 reform of the telecom package: Article  13a of the Framework directive (2009/140/EC) came into force in 2011.  The mandatory incident reporting under Article 13a has a specific focus on security incidents  with a significant impact on the functioning of the service. There is some divergence and  discussion about what is in scope here, but the authorities agreed to focus on network/service  outages. This would leave out of scope for example an attack involving a wiretap on an  undersea cable or a BGP hijack, if the attack causes no outages. Recently the Council and  Parliament agreed about an update of the EU telecom rules called the European Electronic  Communications Code (EECC). The incident reporting requirements in (Article 40 of) the EECC  have a broader scope, including explicitly also for example breaches of confidentiality. An  incident like the one just mentioned would be reportable under (Article 40 of) the EECC.  This document is structured as follows: In section 2 we briefly summarize the reporting  procedure and to give an idea about the kind of incidents that are reported we give some  specific but anonymized examples of incidents that occurred in 2019. In Section 3 we provide  some key facts and statistics about the 2019 incidents. In Section 4 we take a closer look at  Human Errors as a root cause of incidents. In section 5 we look at multiannual trends over the  years 2012-2019.  Note that conclusions about trends and comparisons with previous years have to be made with  care, because national reporting thresholds have changed over the years, reporting thresholds  have been lowered in most countries, and because the incident reporting only covers the most  significant incidents (and not smaller incidents which may be more frequent).  This is the 9th  time ENISA  publishes an  annual incident  report for the  telecom sector.  Mandatory  incident  reporting has  been part of the  EU’s telecom  regulatory  framework since  the 2009 reform  of the telecom  package: Article  13a of the  Framework  directive  (2009/140/EC)  came into force  in 2011.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  8  2. INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  We briefly explain the main features of the incident reporting process, as described in the Article  13a Technical Guideline on Incident Reporting2, which was developed in collaboration with the  national authorities.  2.1 INCIDENT REPORTING FRAMEWORK  Article 13a introduces three types of incident reporting: 1) National incident reporting from  providers to NRAs, 2) Ad-hoc incident reporting between NRAs and ENISA, and 3) Annual  summary reporting from national authorities to the EC and ENISA. The different types of  reporting are shown in the diagram below.  Figure 5: Incident Reporting Framework for Telecom Servicies  Note that in this setup ENISA acts as a collection point, anonymizing aggregating and analysing  the incident reports. In the current setup NRAs can search incidents in the reporting tool  (CIRAS) but the incident reports themselves do not refer to countries or providers, making the  overall summary reporting process less sensitive.  2.2 EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS REPORTED  We give some specific examples of incidents to give an idea of the kind of incidents that are  notified to NRAs and then included in the annual summary reporting to ENISA:   Three high-capacity optical fibres were simultaneously cut, which caused mobile  internet and telephony and also fixed internet and telephony outage in a national  level for three hours (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: human  errors): In two of these cases, the cables were cut as a result of road modernization  2 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-incident-reporting  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  9  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-  incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  works (carried out by third parties); in the third case, the optical fiber was affected  following a landslide. The incident had a national impact.   The fixed network of an operator got isolated from all other networks during 3  hours, affecting emergency calls from all the other networks for millions of users  for 3 hours (duration: hours, connections: millions, cause: system failures):  Since all emergency call centres were connected to this fixed network, emergency  calls were not possible from all those other networks. The cause of the incident was a  software bug that caused an interconnection platform to fail due to a combination of  circumstances.  Following this incident, multiple meetings were organized between the NRA, the main  operators and the emergency services to identify single points of failure and discuss  possible technical solutions to avoid similar incidents in the future and reduce their  impact.   A DDos attack caused a 13 hour outage of the VoIP service for 400.000 users  (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: malicious actions): Corrective  measures taken included hardening of the systems and hardening of firewall rules.   A power outage caused mobile telephony, internet and sms outage for 100000  users and duration of 10 hours (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause:  natural phenomena):  A power outage caused by a storm had as a result the failure of  the technological terminal equipment in the whole country. All processes we set up  successfully and spare power supplies were activated.   A software bug of a third party internet access service provider affected a data  center, causing email (OTT service) outage for more than a hundred users  during 8 hours (duration: hours, connections: thousands, cause: system  failures: The affected data center caused an outage of the email service. The  connections with the third party internet access service provider were reduced.  2.3 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  In 2020, ENISA has released a new version of CIRAS, the tool for statistical analysis of  cybersecurity incidents. Telecom security incidents reported for the year 2019 are available on  the new CIRAS  Experts from the national authorities have access to the ENISA CIRAS incident reporting tool,  where they can search for and study specific incidents. This tool anonymizes the country or  operator involved.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  10  3. ANALYSIS OF THE INCIDENTS  In 2019, 26 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries participated in the annual reporting,  reporting a total of 153 significant incidents. In this section, the 153 reported incidents are  aggregated and analysed. First, the impact per root cause category is analysed (in section 3.1),  in section 3.2 we focus on the user hours that have been lost per root cause category, then  detailed causes are examined (Section 3.3), and in Section 3.4 the impact per service is analysed.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  In 2019 more than half of the telecom security incidents were system failures. This is consistent  with previous years, although somewhat lower. Often they are hardware failures and software  bugs.  Human errors show an increase, rising up to one fourth of the security incidents.  Most  often these are accidental cable cuts and faulty software changes/updates. 13% of the incidents  are caused by natural phenomena also increased up to 30% compared to the previous year.  Only 5% of incidents were due to malicious actions. Typically these cases are denial of service  attacks, cable theft and arson.  Figure 6: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents – 2019  There is a fifth category called Third-party failures, which can be selected (only) in conjunction  with another root cause category. Typically third party failures are incidents which happen at a  utility company or supplier and then affect the telecom providers, for example a cable cut.  Figure 7: Root Causes and Third party failures - 2019  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  11  In total over 2019, 32% of incidents were flagged as third-party failures, which is greatly  increased in comparison with the previous years. The division is shown in the chart below.  3.2 USER HOURS LOST FOR EACH ROOT CAUSE CATEGORY  Adding up the total user hours lost for each root cause category we find that almost half of the  total user hours lost were due to system failures (48%, 479 million user hours). Natural  phenomena account for almost one third of user hours lost (30%, 289 million user hours) and  human errors for almost one fifth of user hours lost (21%, 208 million user hours).  Figure 8: Share of user hours lost for each root cause category in 2019  So system failures are the most common (see section 3.1) and they also have more impact than  the other root causes. However, human errors have doubled their percentage in impact and  they are also more common than in 2018. Also, natural phenomena have less impact than  2018, although the number of incidents caused by natural phenomena has raised.  The multi annual trends graph for user hours lost per root cause category (see section 5.3)  shows this is the first year that natural phenomena account for more user hours lost than  system failures.  3.3 DETAILED CAUSES  An incident is often not only triggered by one cause but can involve multiple detailed causes, a  chain of events.For instance, an incident may be triggered by a storm, which tears down power  supply infrastructure, power cuts and cable cuts, which in turn leads to a telecom outage. For  this example detailed causes could be: Heavy wind, Cable cut, Power cut, Battery depletion.  The root cause of the incident would be natural phenomena.  In the following graph we show the frequency of the detailed causes.  Figure 9: Detailed causes - 2019  22% 21%  15% 13%  12% 11%  7% 6%  0%  5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  12  In 2019, the most common cause of incidents was hardware failures, which confirms the multi-  annual trend in which hardware failure is always either the first or the second most common  cause. Power cuts became the second most common “detailed cause”. Around a fifth of the  incidents reported involved a power cut. Hardware failures, power cuts, faulty software updates  and  software bugs remain the top four causes, as in the previous years. Some detailed causes  mentioned in incidents reports do not fall under a specific category and they are grouped under  “Other”.  In the following charts, we look at the frequency of detailed causes under each root cause  category.

For example, by  selecting system failures (top left), then fixed internet and telephony (top right), the charts at the  bottom show the detailed causes for the selected subset of incidents.  3.4 SERVICES AFFECTED  In this section we look at the services affected by the incidents. For the fourth year in a row,  most of the reported incidents affected mobile services. In 2019, almost the half of the incidents  reported had an impact on mobile telephony and internet in the EU. This confirms the shift over  the last years. Fixed telephony was the most affected service only in the early years of  reporting.  Figure 14: Services affected  Note that for most reported incidents there is impact on more than one service, which explains  why the percentages in the chart here add up to more than 100%.

Natural phenomena are responsible for 1 out of 10 incidents in fixed  telephony and for the 14% of incidents in fixed internet.  Finally, malicious actions are responsible for 10% and 14% of incidents in fixed telephony and  internet respectively, however in mobile telephony and internet this percentage is much lower  (3% for mobile telephony and the same for mobile internet).

DETAILED ANALYSIS – HUMAN ERRORS  In 2019, the number of incidents caused by human errors has risen up to 50% compared to the  previous year. More than one fourth of the security incidents were caused by human errors and  these incidents account for one fifth of the total user hours lost (21%, 208 million user hours).  Considering the above remarks, in this section we perform a deep dive in human errors.  Looking carefully at the multiannual graph above, though it is not the first time since 2012 that  human errors are responsible for almost 20% of the incidents, it seems that they are trending up  since 2016.  Figure 19: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU - reported over 2012-2019  For all incidents having as a root cause human errors, we can see the detailed causes in the  graph below. Most incidents caused by human errors are about cable cuts and the second more  frequent detailed cause is faulty software change or update.

TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  17  In 2019, the increased number of incidents caused by human errors (raising from 18% in 2018 to  26% in 2019) is due to third-party failures, taking into account that third-party failures accounted  in 2019 for 12% of incidents that had human errors as the root cause, whereas in 2018 this  percentage was 3%.  Also, as far as human errors are concerned, fixed telephony and internet are the most affected  services, which doesn’t follow the general conclusion that mobile internet and telephony are  mostly affected by security incidents during the last years.  Figure 21: Services affected by human errors  As for the affected assets, the graph below indicates that human errors have a major impact on  switches and routers in fixed telephony and internet.

MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating incident reports since 2012. In this section, we look  at the multiannual trends over the last 8 years, covering from 2012 to 2019. This dataset  contains 1093 reported incidents in total.  5.1 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS - ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Every year from 2012 to 2019, system failures are the most common root cause. In 2019,  however, system failures show a considerable decrease. In fact, in 2019 the number of  incidents due to system failures is the lowest since 2012. In total system failures account for 722  of incident reports (66% of the total). For this root cause category, over the last 8 years, the  most common causes were hardware failures (36%) and software bugs (28%). The second  most common root cause over the 8 years of reporting is human errors with nearly a fifth of total  incidents (19%, 202 incidents in total). Natural phenomena come third at almost a tenth of total  incidents (9%, 109 incidents in total). Only 5% of the incidents are categorized as malicious  actions. In the period 2012-2019 nearly two thirds of the malicious actions consist of Denial of  Service attacks, and the rest resulted mainly in lasting damage to physical infrastructure.  Figure 23: Root cause categories Telecom security incidents in the EU - reported over 2012-2019  5.2 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS - IMPACT PER SERVICE  In 2019 mobile networks and services were the most impacted by incidents. This is part of a  multiannual trend. Only in 2014 the fixed networks and services was where the most affected.  Looking back at the 8 years of annual incident reporting, a total of 1093 incidents, almost half  had an impact on mobile internet or mobile telephony. The chart below shows the multiannual  trends over the 2012-2019 period. It indicates the share of the total incidents for each year that  involved one of the four classic telecommunication services. For instance, in 2019 56% of the  incidents had to do with mobile telephony.  1093  Incidents were  reported over  8 years of  reporting,  2012-2019.  TELECOM SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2019  July 2020  19  Figure 24: Trend on classic services affected per year  5.3 MULTIANNUAL TRENDS - USER HOURS PER ROOT CAUSE  Adding up the total user hours lost per root cause category, we observe that human errors have  been increasing since 2016. In 2019, although system failure is the dominant root cause  category, human errors show a raise of almost 50% compared to the previous year. Between  2018 and 2019 we observe a slight increase in lost user hours due to system failures, and a  corresponding decrease to hours lost due to natural phenomena. Malicious actions are stable  over the years.

This is probably due to  more reporting by providers, better awareness about the reporting obligations, and partly  due to lower national thresholds for annual summary reporting.  In the chart below we also show total numbers of incidents reported and total user hours lost  per year over the period 2012-2019. There was an upward trend in user hours lost reaching a  peak in 2017 with 1942 million user hours lost. Interestingly there was a sharp drop in the  average user hours lost per incident reported over 2018 and they remain at the same level in  2019. This could lead to the conclusion that 2018 was a start of a longer trend.

CONCLUSIONS  This document, the Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019, covers the incidents  reported by the authorities for the calendar year 2019 and it gives an anonymised, aggregated  EU-wide overview of telecom security incidents. It marks the 9th time ENISA publishes an  annual report for the telecom sector.  We would like to conclude highlighting the most important findings and including some more  general observations about this process and the broader policy context.  6.1 KEY TAKEAWAYS  The key takeaways from the 2019 incidents are:   Annual number of incidents seems to be stabilizing at around 160: this shows that  the process of incident reporting has matured among operators and national authorities  so that worth-mentioning incidents get the attention they deserve. This is probably due  to more reporting by providers, better awareness about the reporting obligations, and  partly due to lower national thresholds for annual summary reporting.   The sharp decline in total number of user hours lost: between 2017 and 2018, was  not an exception. Also in 2019, the number of user hours lost remained low.   Looking into the system failures, hardware failures are a major factor in 2019:  almost a quarter of incidents (23%) were caused by hardware failures and they also  had a major impact in terms of user hours with 38% of the total. Also, software bugs  are still a concern, since they are responsible for 15% of the incidents.   Frequency of human errors is trending up: In 2019, this raise is mostly due to third-  party failures, often during construction works that led to cable/optic fiber cuts or  because of faulty software updates, performed by subcontractors.   Natural phenomena are trending up: due to severe weather conditions and climate  change.   One incident involving a fire had a major impact: It can be difficult to recover from a  fire and it often takes hours or days before the operator can even start repairs. Fire  protection as well as redundancy are important to consider.  6.2 OBSERVATIONS  By the end of 2020, the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) will come into  effect across the EU. Under Article 40 of the EECC the incident reporting requirements have a  broader scope, including not only outages, but also breaches of confidentiality. Also, there are  more services in scope of the EECC, including not only traditional telecom operators, but also  for example over-the-top providers of communications services.  In 2020, the annual reporting guideline will be updated to include new thresholds for annual  summary reporting to ENISA combining quantitative and qualitative parameters. Furthermore,  the notification of security incidents affecting not only the services of fixed and mobile internet  and telephony, but also the number-based interpersonal communications services and/or  number independent interpersonal communications services (OTT communications services).

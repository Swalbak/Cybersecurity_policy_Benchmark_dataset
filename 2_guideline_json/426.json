Conclusion 18  Annex A: Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy Member List 19  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  04  1 Introduction  Over the past years there have been several discussions around the topic of security incident classification  taxonomies. A number of initiatives even resulted in new or modified taxonomies, such as the ‘Common  Taxonomy for (LE) Law Enforcement and CSIRTs,1 which was set up to simplify CSIRT and LEA cooperation.  This taxonomy resulted from collaboration initiatives such as the annual ENISA/EC3 Workshop which  involved CSIRTs, LEAs, ENISA, and EC3. Other examples include the eCSIRT.net taxonomy2 which was  developed in 2003, and the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy3 which is an adaptation of the original eCSIRT.net  taxonomy.  Creating a taxonomy is not a simple task. When dealing with topics like security incidents, there can be  different ways in which to classify incidents, and it is not always easy or possible to determine which the  best or correct classification is. Organisations defining a taxonomy are usually driven by different needs,  and since different CSIRTs have different expectations, teams often end up developing their own incident  classifications for internal use. In fact, the ‘Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs’ is itself an adaptation of  the CERT.PT taxonomy4, which is itself an adaptation of the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy. One main  advantage of the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs for its use in the context of law enforcement is that  it has been extended to also include a mapping of the incident classifications with a legal framework.  Similarly, there have been a number of taxonomies that are in essence a branch or modification of  another5.  As the need for information exchange, and incident reporting increases, not to mention an increase in the  use of automation in incident response, it is becoming evident that there is a need for common ground.  This common ground would assist incident handlers dealing with technical incidents on a daily basis to deal  with the abovementioned needs. Moreover, it could assist policy decision makers by offering a single  reference point for discussing and drafting relevant policies such as the EU cyber security strategy and The  Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive). Following a discussion amongst  the CSIRT community during the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting 6(15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands), it was  concluded that there is an urgent need for a taxonomy list and name everyone could rely on and refer to.  This is where the Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy Task Force comes into play.  1https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/common_taxonomy_for_the_national_network_of_ csirts.pdf  2 http://www.ecsirt.net/cec/service/documents/wp4-clearinghouse-policy-v12.html#HEAD6  3 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/Incident-Classification-Taxonomy.pdf  4 https://www.cncs.gov.pt/certpt/  5 https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies  6 https://tf-csirt.org/tf-csirt/meetings/51st-meeting/  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  05  2 Background  2.1 Past work on Taxonomies  ENISA has recently published two reports related to Incident Taxonomies:   ENISA Report: Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement (Dec 2015)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies- between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport   ENISA Report: A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  (Dec 2016)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention- detection/at_download/fullReport  In the first report, the main objective was to enhance cooperation both between the Member States (MS)  of the EU and between related Network and Information Security (NIS) communities. It aimed at collecting  and presenting information on projects facilitating information sharing between Member States CSIRTs  and Law Enforcement. It also aimed at investigating which information can be shared between CSIRTs and  Law Enforcement and how this can be achieved technically and organisationally. The following are some of  the relevant proposals provided in this report:   (to select) A taxonomy for the exchange of information based on desk research and based on the  approval of the majority of the community.   (to define) An update model for the taxonomy, to answer new requirements that could arise from  the CSIRTs and the LEAs.   (to develop) A roadmap for the implementation of the taxonomy in the exchange of information  across CSIRTs and LEAs and the potential use of a sharing mechanism.  As an outcome of the report, a taxonomy was chosen as the best fitted to act as the nexus between LEAs  and CSIRTs communities.  In the second report, the main objective was to provide relevant good practices in terms of taxonomies for  incident detection and prevention for the CSIRT community. Additionally, it also provides conclusions and  recommendations based on the qualitative assessment of taxonomies within the current taxonomy  landscape on improvements that can be made on current taxonomies, such as what fields can be extended  or added to existing taxonomies. Among the conclusions were the following:   A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be  set up by ENISA.   A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should be agreed upon by CSIRTs at the  EU level.   An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the owners of taxonomies as an indicator  to revise taxonomies, if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same  type.   A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be  established at the EU level by the CSIRTs Network.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection/at_download/fullReport  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  06  2.2 Trigger for Task Force  During the “51st TF-CSIRT meeting” (15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands), members of the CSIRT  community discussed the following points (amongst others):   There are two prominent taxonomies in the CSIRT community: “Common Taxonomy for Law  Enforcement and CSIRTs”, and “eCSIRT.net mkVI”.   MISP7 caters for “Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and CSIRTs”, while IntelMQ caters for  the general categories.   11 categories are fixed, whilst the incident types (2nd column) is usually customised differently by  teams.   This topic cannot be decided by TF-CSIRT alone, it has to be coordinated with EC3, standardization  would be a solution.   The general conclusion – There is the need for a taxonomy list and name everyone could rely on  and refer to.   ENISA will set up a Task Force in this regard.  7 MISP – Malware Information Sharing Platform - Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform & Open Standards for  Threat Information Sharing  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  07  3 Task Force  3.1 Aim and Objectives  As mentioned in the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting, “there is the need for a taxonomy list and name everyone  could rely on and refer to”. As the need for information exchange, and incident reporting increases, not to  mention an increase in the use of automation in incident response, it is becoming evident that there is  need for some common ground. This common ground would assist incident handlers dealing with technical  incidents on a daily basis to deal with the abovementioned needs. The aim of this task force is to enable  the CSIRT community in reaching a consensus on a reference taxonomy. It should be noted that details  such as identifying suitable sharing mechanisms are outside of the current scope. The objectives of the  task force are the following:   Develop Reference Document (Classifications, incident types or examples, and definition) using  eCSIRT.net as a starting point.   Define and develop an Update and Versioning Mechanism   Host reference document   Organise regular physical meetings with the stakeholders   In the 2nd phase broader working group with non-European teams (FIRST) to achieve global  consensus on incident reference taxonomy  3.1.1 Upcoming Tasks  The next meeting will be during the “53rd TF-CSIRT meeting” 8(5-7 February 2018 co-located with FIRST in  Hamburg, Germany). Below are some of the tasks that need to be addressed by the task force.   Decide on two elemental points  o Use eCSIRT.net as starting point  o Decide whether to focus on Incident Type or incident Example in the second column   Review and consolidate Incident Classifications and definitions in the reference taxonomy (starting  with eCSIRT.net)   Define update workflow and Versioning Mechanism   Decide about who will be Hosting online reference taxonomy (ENISA/Dedicated site, etc.)   Propose way forward, e.g.: to meet periodically   Decide on name (reference taxonomy/eCSIRT.net/other…)  3.2 First Task Force Meeting  Following the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting, a call for expression of interest for participation in the Reference  Incident Classification Taxonomy Task Force was sent out via the TF-CSIRT mailing list, and the first task  force meeting was set up back to back with the 52nd TF-CSIRT meeting (See Current Members below).  Below are some of the discussion points and conclusions from this meeting:   Different CSIRTs use their own taxonomy, or modified version of an existing eCSIRT.net taxonomy.  A reference taxonomy will help us find a middle ground, even though CSIRTs will have their own  implementation.  8 https://first.org/events/symposium/hamburg2018/  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  08   Reference Document (Classifications, types (and decision on their importance), and definition))   Update and Versioning Mechanism.   We need to decide on the hosting of the reference document.   Following the upcoming meeting during TF-CSIRT in Hamburg, the reference taxonomy should be  presented to other organisations such as FIRST9 and ITF.   There are differences in incident classification between CSIRTs and LEAs. However, they do go  hand in hand and it is important to proceed accordingly.   Fortunately, there are members that are both in the Reference Taxonomy task force, and the  Taxonomy Governance Group of the CSIRT-LEA taxonomy which can ensure a harmonious  evolution of the “Reference CSIRT incident Taxonomy” and the “Common Taxonomy for Law  Enforcement and CSIRTs”  o Mapping between the reference taxonomy and “Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement  and CSIRTs” is important  o Consider including “Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and CSIRTs” with link to  legal framework as an annex.   It is important to define the objectives and outputs for the reference taxonomy (eg: statistics,  information sharing and automation).   Scope and Motivation  o Taxonomy for CSIRT technical incidents  o To ensure that CSIRTs are speaking the same language.  o To facilitate sharing across CSIRTs.  o To facilitate the harmonization of statistics between the CSIRT community.  o To facilitate translation between different taxonomies, without disruption or need for  major overhaul.  o Could be useful mapping within the context of NIS directive   The eCSIRT.net taxonomy seems to be a good starting point as a reference taxonomy.   To discuss formal name of the new reference incident classification taxonomy.  3.3 Current Members  It is important that amongst the members of the task force are members of CSIRT teams, the Common  Taxonomy Governance Group (including representatives from ENISA and EC3), tool developers  (MISP/IntelMQ…), and taxonomy owners (owner of eCSIRT.net). A mailing list has been set up in order to  facilitate communication between the task force members.  See Annex A for the current list of participants.  9 FIRST - the global Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  09  4 Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  To give a better understanding of how a reference taxonomy can benefit the community, we demonstrate  a high level mapping of 4 taxonomies: eCSIRT.net (reference taxonomy), Common Taxonomy for LE and  CSIRTs, and two CSIRT provided taxonomies (CIRCL.LU and CERT.LV).  4.1 Starting Point – ecsirt.net taxonomy  The main action item following the first task force meeting was to determine whether the eCSIRT.net  taxonomy was a suitable candidate as a starting point for the reference taxonomy. The official latest  version is the eCSIRT.net mkVI:  INCIDENT  CLASSIFICATION  INCIDENT EXAMPLES DESCRIPTION  Abusive Content  Spam  or \"Unsolicited Bulk Email\", this means that the recipient has not granted  verifiable permission for the message to be sent and that the message is  sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having a functionally  comparable content  Harmful Speech  Discreditation or discrimination of somebody (e.g. cyber stalking, racism  and threats against one or more individuals)  Child/Sexual/Violence/ ...  Child pornography, glorification of violence, ...  Malicious Code  Virus  Software that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a  harmful purpose. A user interaction is normally necessary to activate the  code.  Worm  Trojan  Spyware  Dialler  Rootkit  Information Gathering  Scanning  Attacks that send requests to a system to discover weak points. This  includes also some kind of testing processes to gather information about  hosts, services and accounts. Examples: fingerd, DNS querying, ICMP,  SMTP (EXPN, RCPT, …), port scanning.  Sniffing Observing and recording of network traffic (wiretapping).  Social engineering  Gathering information from a human being in a non‐technical way (e.g.  lies, tricks, bribes, or threats).  Intrusion Attempts  Exploiting known  vulnerabilities  An attempt to compromise a system or to disrupt any service by exploiting  vulnerabilities with a standardised identifier such as CVE name (e.g. buffer  overflow, backdoor, cross site scripting, etc.).  Login attempts Multiple login attempts (Guessing / cracking of passwords, brute force).  New attack signature An attempt using an unknown exploit.  Intrusions  Privileged account  compromise A successful compromise of a system or application (service). This can  have been caused remotely by a known or new vulnerability, but also by  an unauthorized local access. Also includes being part of a botnet. Unprivileged account  compromise  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  10  Application  compromise  Bot  Availability  DoS By this kind of an attack a system is bombarded with so many packets that  the operations are delayed or the system crashes. DoS examples are ICMP  and SYN floods, Teardrop attacks and mail-bombing. DDoS often is based  on DoS attacks originating from botnets, but also other scenarios exist like  DNS Amplification attacks. However, the availability also can be affected  by local actions (destruction, disruption of power supply, etc.) – or by Act  of God, spontaneous failures or human error, without malice or gross  neglect being involved.  DDoS  Sabotage  Outage (no malice)  Information Content  Security  Unauthorised access  to information  Besides a local abuse of data and systems the information security can be  endangered by a successful account or application compromise.  Furthermore, attacks are possible that intercept and access information  during transmission (wiretapping, spoofing or hijacking).  Human/configuration/software error can also be the cause.  Unauthorised  modification of  information  Fraud  Unauthorized use of  resources  Using resources for unauthorized purposes including profit-making  ventures (E.g. the use of e-mail to participate in illegal profit chain letters  or pyramid schemes).  Copyright  Offering or Installing copies of unlicensed commercial software or other  copyright protected materials (Warez).  Masquerade  Type of attacks in which one entity illegitimately assumes the identity of  another in order to benefit from it.  Phishing  Masquerading as another entity in order to persuade the user to reveal a  private credential.  Vulnerable Open for abuse  Open resolvers, world readable printers, vulnerability apparent from  Nessus etc scans, virus signatures not up-to-date, etc  Other  All incidents which do  not fit in one of the  given categories  should be put into this  class.  If the number of incidents in this category increases, it is an indicator that  the classification scheme must be revised.  Test Meant for testing Meant for testing  Table 1: eCSIRT.net mkVI  This is not necessarily an ideal taxonomy. However, it has many factors which make it very useful. In  particular, the main categories seem to be very practical and universal. Even though the taxonomy was  developed many years ago (and has gone over a number of adaptations), the main categories are still  current and can easily be used today. The same cannot be said about the subcategories which can  sometimes lead to problems with how to classify an incident. For example, it is not particularly useful any  more to make a distinction between DoS attacks and DDoS attacks or to determine what is a ’privileged  account compromise’, ’unprivileged account compromise’ or ’application compromise’. In practice,  subcategories became a part of the description rather than a concrete schema for classification. Nowadays  it is really difficult to determine if a particular malware is a virus, worm, Trojan, spyware or a dialler. The  functionality of malware changes and the honest approach is to classify it all as ‘malicious code’.  The eCSIRT.net classification is highly recommended. Despite some defects, it is still quite useful and good.  Many European CSIRTs use it, which will give teams the opportunity to team up with others later and be  able to compare and merge statistics.  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  11  4.2 Sources  During the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting, one of the main conclusions was that there is the need for a taxonomy  list and name everyone could rely on and refer to. When one considers the eCSIRT.net taxonomy, there  currently exist different sources where the taxonomy is hosted:  Trusted Introducer (Official document):   https://www.trusted-introducer.org/Incident-Classification-Taxonomy.pdf  ENISA’s page:   https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/community-projects/existing-taxonomies  MISP documentation and Github page:   https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/ecsirt/machinetag.json   http://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_ecsirt   https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.pdf  IntelMQ:   http://intelmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Data-Harmonization/  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/Incident-Classification-Taxonomy.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirt-cert-services/community-projects/existing-taxonomies https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/ecsirt/machinetag.json http://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_ecsirt https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.pdf http://intelmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Data-Harmonization/  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  12  4.3 Correlation between Reference Taxonomy and Common Taxonomy for LE and  CSIRTs  An advantage of the Reference Taxonomy is its tight correlation with the Common Taxonomy for LE and  CSIRTs, which is itself an adaptation of the CERT.PT taxonomy, which is an adaptation of the eCSIRT.net  mkVI. Here we will see a high level mapping of eCSIRT.net to the Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement  and CSIRTs.

In fact, there is almost a one-to-one  mapping of the existing categories in both taxonomies.

It outlines the differences in the “Incident Example” in the  Reference Taxonomy, and “Incident Type” in the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs. Moreover, the  Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs also includes a third column which includes the link to the legal  framework. This is not always directly relevant to the CSIRT community, however, it could very be useful  especially when cooperating with law enforcement. The mapping between these two taxonomies could  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  14  help to identify factors that could lead to the update or inclusion of new incident types. Consider for  example the incident types for the malware category of both the Reference Taxonomy, and Common  taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs. There are significant differences between the two, where the Reference  Taxonomy focuses more on the technical specification of the malware type, and the Common taxonomy  for LE and CSIRTs distinguishes between infection and distribution.  This does not seem to be considered in  the Reference Taxonomy. The task force could use these kinds of differences to determine whether or not  such incident types should be added to the reference taxonomy.  REFERENCE  TAXONOMY  INCIDENT  CLASSIFICATION  (1ST COLUMN)  INCIDENT EXAMPLES (2ND  COLUMN)  Malicious Code  Virus  Worm  Trojan  Spyware  Dialler  Rootkit  INCIDENT TYPE (2ND  COLUMN)  COMMON TAXONOMY  FOR LEA AND CSIRT  INCIDENT  CLASSIFICATION (1ST  COLUMN)  Infection  Malware  Distribution  C&C  Undetermined  Malicious Connection  4.4 Mapping other Taxonomies  As mentioned earlier, the Reference taxonomy contains a very practical and universal high level  categorisation. Below are examples of existing taxonomies (CERT.LV11, and CIRCL.LU12), demonstrating how  most of their high level categories map into one or more categories from the Reference Taxonomy. In the  case of CERT.LV, there is a clear one-to-one mapping with all (except testing) of the high level categories.  However, the mapping between CIRCL.LU and Reference Taxonomy is not as direct.  11 https://cert.lv/en/incidents  12 https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/circl/machinetag.json  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  15  REFERENCE TAXONOMY CERT.LV TAXONOMY  Abusive Content Abusive Content  Malicious Code Malicious Code  Information Gathering Information Gathering  Intrusion Attempts Intrusion Attempts  Intrusion Intrusion  Availability Availability  Information Content Security Information Content Security  Fraud Fraud  Vulnerable Vulnerable  Other Other  Test  Table 4: Reference Taxonomy vs CERT.LV taxonomy  CIRCL TAXONOMY REFERENCE TAXONOMY  Spam Abusive Content  malware Malicious Code  Scan  Information Gathering  Intrusion Attempts  system-compromise  Intrusions XSS  sql-injection  denial-of-service Availability  information-leak Information Content Security  copyright-issue  Fraud phishing,  Scam  vulnerability Vulnerable  Fastflux Other  Test  Table 5: CIRCL taxonomy vs Reference Taxonomy  4.5 Pivot Mapping  Given the tight correlation between the Reference Taxonomy and a number of other taxonomies such as  the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs, a mapping from a particular taxonomy to the Reference  Taxonomy, automatically generates a mapping between that taxonomy and other previously mapped  taxonomies. Consider the following example of how CIRCL.LU taxonomy can be mapped to the Common  Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs and the CERT.LV taxonomy by pivoting from one taxonomy to another.  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  16  Figure 1: Pivot Mapping  Notice that since both the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs, and CERT.LV Taxonomy have been  mapped onto the Reference Taxonomy, this provides a clear mapping between the Common Taxonomy for  LE and CSIRTs and the CERT.LV taxonomy, as well as any other taxonomy that would have already been  mapped to the Reference Taxonomy. This mapping can be extremely useful for cross-CSIRT collaboration,  as well as CSIRT-LEA collaboration by enabling CSIRTs to use the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs.  4.6 MISP mapping  MISP developers have provided a mapping of existing taxonomies.   https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/mapping/mapping.json   http://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_mapping_of_taxonomies  The MISP mapping taxonomy allows for the mapping of a single classification into a series of machine-tag  synonyms. The implemented approach for mapping is similar to the one described above, whereby a  https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/mapping/mapping.json http://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_mapping_of_taxonomies  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  17  number of categories are used as a central reference point and each of these points are mapped to  categories in other known taxonomies.  Figure 2: JSON values of MISP mapping taxonomy  Figure 2 shows how the taxonomies are mapped in the MISP taxonomy document.  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  18  5. Conclusion  While still in its infancy, the reference taxonomy task force is off to a good start. The members seem eager  and willing to contribute, and make use of the resulting reference taxonomy. The outcome of the  upcoming meetings will determine the success of this initiative. In these meetings, the task force plans to:   Decide on two elemental points  o Confirm eCSIRT.net as starting point  o Decide whether to focus on Incident Type or incident Example in the second column   Review and consolidate Incident Classifications and definitions  in the reference taxonomy  (starting with eCSIRT.net)   Define update workflow and Versioning Mechanism   Decide about who will be hosting online reference taxonomy (ENISA/Dedicated site,etc.)   Propose way forward, e.g.: to meet periodically   Decide on name (reference taxonomy/eCSIRT.net/other…)  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  19  Annex A: Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy Member List   Sebastien Schmitt (Gemalto)   Jan Kopriva (ALEF-CSIRT)   Toomas Lepik (Tallinn University)   Sven Gabriel (EGI-CSIRT)   Kris Caron (KBC Group CERT)   Silvio Oertli (SWITCH CERT)   Vladimir Bobor (Telia CERT)   Bilgehan Turan (EATM-CERT)   Vasileios Friligkos (EATM-CERT)   David Alfós (CaixaBank)   Marcolla, Sara Veronica (EC3)   Azofra Martínez, Álvaro (EC3)   Baiba Kaskina (CERT.LV/TF-CSIRT)   Pavel Kácha (CESNET)   Thomas Schreck (Siemens)   L.

Conclusion 18  Annex A: Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy Member List 19  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  04  1 Introduction  Over the past years there have been several discussions around the topic of security incident classification  taxonomies. A number of initiatives even resulted in new or modified taxonomies, such as the ‘Common  Taxonomy for (LE) Law Enforcement and CSIRTs,1 which was set up to simplify CSIRT and LEA cooperation.  This taxonomy resulted from collaboration initiatives such as the annual ENISA/EC3 Workshop which  involved CSIRTs, LEAs, ENISA, and EC3. Other examples include the eCSIRT.net taxonomy2 which was  developed in 2003, and the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy3 which is an adaptation of the original eCSIRT.net  taxonomy.  Creating a taxonomy is not a simple task. When dealing with topics like security incidents, there can be  different ways in which to classify incidents, and it is not always easy or possible to determine which the  best or correct classification is. Organisations defining a taxonomy are usually driven by different needs,  and since different CSIRTs have different expectations, teams often end up developing their own incident  classifications for internal use. In fact, the ‘Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs’ is itself an adaptation of  the CERT.PT taxonomy4, which is itself an adaptation of the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy. One main  advantage of the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs for its use in the context of law enforcement is that  it has been extended to also include a mapping of the incident classifications with a legal framework.  Similarly, there have been a number of taxonomies that are in essence a branch or modification of  another5.  As the need for information exchange, and incident reporting increases, not to mention an increase in the  use of automation in incident response, it is becoming evident that there is a need for common ground.  This common ground would assist incident handlers dealing with technical incidents on a daily basis to deal  with the abovementioned needs. Moreover, it could assist policy decision makers by offering a single  reference point for discussing and drafting relevant policies such as the EU cyber security strategy and The  Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive). Following a discussion amongst  the CSIRT community during the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting 6(15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands), it was  concluded that there is an urgent need for a taxonomy list and name everyone could rely on and refer to.  This is where the Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy Task Force comes into play.  1https://www.europol.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/common_taxonomy_for_the_national_network_of_ csirts.pdf  2 http://www.ecsirt.net/cec/service/documents/wp4-clearinghouse-policy-v12.html#HEAD6  3 https://www.trusted-introducer.org/Incident-Classification-Taxonomy.pdf  4 https://www.cncs.gov.pt/certpt/  5 https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies  6 https://tf-csirt.org/tf-csirt/meetings/51st-meeting/  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  05  2 Background  2.1 Past work on Taxonomies  ENISA has recently published two reports related to Incident Taxonomies:   ENISA Report: Information sharing and common taxonomies between CSIRTs and Law  Enforcement (Dec 2015)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies- between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport   ENISA Report: A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection  (Dec 2016)  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention- detection/at_download/fullReport  In the first report, the main objective was to enhance cooperation both between the Member States (MS)  of the EU and between related Network and Information Security (NIS) communities. It aimed at collecting  and presenting information on projects facilitating information sharing between Member States CSIRTs  and Law Enforcement. It also aimed at investigating which information can be shared between CSIRTs and  Law Enforcement and how this can be achieved technically and organisationally. The following are some of  the relevant proposals provided in this report:   (to select) A taxonomy for the exchange of information based on desk research and based on the  approval of the majority of the community.   (to define) An update model for the taxonomy, to answer new requirements that could arise from  the CSIRTs and the LEAs.   (to develop) A roadmap for the implementation of the taxonomy in the exchange of information  across CSIRTs and LEAs and the potential use of a sharing mechanism.  As an outcome of the report, a taxonomy was chosen as the best fitted to act as the nexus between LEAs  and CSIRTs communities.  In the second report, the main objective was to provide relevant good practices in terms of taxonomies for  incident detection and prevention for the CSIRT community. Additionally, it also provides conclusions and  recommendations based on the qualitative assessment of taxonomies within the current taxonomy  landscape on improvements that can be made on current taxonomies, such as what fields can be extended  or added to existing taxonomies. Among the conclusions were the following:   A centralised repository for hosting all relevant taxonomies along with their versions should be  set up by ENISA.   A small set of common taxonomies for specific use cases should be agreed upon by CSIRTs at the  EU level.   An “Other” or “Unknown”, “Tag” field should be used by the owners of taxonomies as an indicator  to revise taxonomies, if there is an increase in that category with incidents or events of the same  type.   A roadmap towards standardised exchange formats in the CSIRTs community should be  established at the EU level by the CSIRTs Network.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/information-sharing-and-common-taxonomies-between-csirts-and-law-enforcement/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection/at_download/fullReport https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection/at_download/fullReport  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  06  2.2 Trigger for Task Force  During the “51st TF-CSIRT meeting” (15 May 2017 in The Hague, Netherlands), members of the CSIRT  community discussed the following points (amongst others):   There are two prominent taxonomies in the CSIRT community: “Common Taxonomy for Law  Enforcement and CSIRTs”, and “eCSIRT.net mkVI”.   MISP7 caters for “Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and CSIRTs”, while IntelMQ caters for  the general categories.   11 categories are fixed, whilst the incident types (2nd column) is usually customised differently by  teams.   This topic cannot be decided by TF-CSIRT alone, it has to be coordinated with EC3, standardization  would be a solution.   The general conclusion – There is the need for a taxonomy list and name everyone could rely on  and refer to.   ENISA will set up a Task Force in this regard.  7 MISP – Malware Information Sharing Platform - Open Source Threat Intelligence Platform & Open Standards for  Threat Information Sharing  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  07  3 Task Force  3.1 Aim and Objectives  As mentioned in the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting, “there is the need for a taxonomy list and name everyone  could rely on and refer to”. As the need for information exchange, and incident reporting increases, not to  mention an increase in the use of automation in incident response, it is becoming evident that there is  need for some common ground. This common ground would assist incident handlers dealing with technical  incidents on a daily basis to deal with the abovementioned needs. The aim of this task force is to enable  the CSIRT community in reaching a consensus on a reference taxonomy. It should be noted that details  such as identifying suitable sharing mechanisms are outside of the current scope. The objectives of the  task force are the following:   Develop Reference Document (Classifications, incident types or examples, and definition) using  eCSIRT.net as a starting point.   Define and develop an Update and Versioning Mechanism   Host reference document   Organise regular physical meetings with the stakeholders   In the 2nd phase broader working group with non-European teams (FIRST) to achieve global  consensus on incident reference taxonomy  3.1.1 Upcoming Tasks  The next meeting will be during the “53rd TF-CSIRT meeting” 8(5-7 February 2018 co-located with FIRST in  Hamburg, Germany). Below are some of the tasks that need to be addressed by the task force.   Decide on two elemental points  o Use eCSIRT.net as starting point  o Decide whether to focus on Incident Type or incident Example in the second column   Review and consolidate Incident Classifications and definitions in the reference taxonomy (starting  with eCSIRT.net)   Define update workflow and Versioning Mechanism   Decide about who will be Hosting online reference taxonomy (ENISA/Dedicated site, etc.)   Propose way forward, e.g.: to meet periodically   Decide on name (reference taxonomy/eCSIRT.net/other…)  3.2 First Task Force Meeting  Following the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting, a call for expression of interest for participation in the Reference  Incident Classification Taxonomy Task Force was sent out via the TF-CSIRT mailing list, and the first task  force meeting was set up back to back with the 52nd TF-CSIRT meeting (See Current Members below).  Below are some of the discussion points and conclusions from this meeting:   Different CSIRTs use their own taxonomy, or modified version of an existing eCSIRT.net taxonomy.  A reference taxonomy will help us find a middle ground, even though CSIRTs will have their own  implementation.  8 https://first.org/events/symposium/hamburg2018/  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  08   Reference Document (Classifications, types (and decision on their importance), and definition))   Update and Versioning Mechanism.   We need to decide on the hosting of the reference document.   Following the upcoming meeting during TF-CSIRT in Hamburg, the reference taxonomy should be  presented to other organisations such as FIRST9 and ITF.   There are differences in incident classification between CSIRTs and LEAs. However, they do go  hand in hand and it is important to proceed accordingly.   Fortunately, there are members that are both in the Reference Taxonomy task force, and the  Taxonomy Governance Group of the CSIRT-LEA taxonomy which can ensure a harmonious  evolution of the “Reference CSIRT incident Taxonomy” and the “Common Taxonomy for Law  Enforcement and CSIRTs”  o Mapping between the reference taxonomy and “Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement  and CSIRTs” is important  o Consider including “Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement and CSIRTs” with link to  legal framework as an annex.   It is important to define the objectives and outputs for the reference taxonomy (eg: statistics,  information sharing and automation).   Scope and Motivation  o Taxonomy for CSIRT technical incidents  o To ensure that CSIRTs are speaking the same language.  o To facilitate sharing across CSIRTs.  o To facilitate the harmonization of statistics between the CSIRT community.  o To facilitate translation between different taxonomies, without disruption or need for  major overhaul.  o Could be useful mapping within the context of NIS directive   The eCSIRT.net taxonomy seems to be a good starting point as a reference taxonomy.   To discuss formal name of the new reference incident classification taxonomy.  3.3 Current Members  It is important that amongst the members of the task force are members of CSIRT teams, the Common  Taxonomy Governance Group (including representatives from ENISA and EC3), tool developers  (MISP/IntelMQ…), and taxonomy owners (owner of eCSIRT.net). A mailing list has been set up in order to  facilitate communication between the task force members.  See Annex A for the current list of participants.  9 FIRST - the global Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  09  4 Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  To give a better understanding of how a reference taxonomy can benefit the community, we demonstrate  a high level mapping of 4 taxonomies: eCSIRT.net (reference taxonomy), Common Taxonomy for LE and  CSIRTs, and two CSIRT provided taxonomies (CIRCL.LU and CERT.LV).  4.1 Starting Point – ecsirt.net taxonomy  The main action item following the first task force meeting was to determine whether the eCSIRT.net  taxonomy was a suitable candidate as a starting point for the reference taxonomy. The official latest  version is the eCSIRT.net mkVI:  INCIDENT  CLASSIFICATION  INCIDENT EXAMPLES DESCRIPTION  Abusive Content  Spam  or \"Unsolicited Bulk Email\", this means that the recipient has not granted  verifiable permission for the message to be sent and that the message is  sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having a functionally  comparable content  Harmful Speech  Discreditation or discrimination of somebody (e.g. cyber stalking, racism  and threats against one or more individuals)  Child/Sexual/Violence/ ...  Child pornography, glorification of violence, ...  Malicious Code  Virus  Software that is intentionally included or inserted in a system for a  harmful purpose. A user interaction is normally necessary to activate the  code.  Worm  Trojan  Spyware  Dialler  Rootkit  Information Gathering  Scanning  Attacks that send requests to a system to discover weak points. This  includes also some kind of testing processes to gather information about  hosts, services and accounts. Examples: fingerd, DNS querying, ICMP,  SMTP (EXPN, RCPT, …), port scanning.  Sniffing Observing and recording of network traffic (wiretapping).  Social engineering  Gathering information from a human being in a non‐technical way (e.g.  lies, tricks, bribes, or threats).  Intrusion Attempts  Exploiting known  vulnerabilities  An attempt to compromise a system or to disrupt any service by exploiting  vulnerabilities with a standardised identifier such as CVE name (e.g. buffer  overflow, backdoor, cross site scripting, etc.).  Login attempts Multiple login attempts (Guessing / cracking of passwords, brute force).  New attack signature An attempt using an unknown exploit.  Intrusions  Privileged account  compromise A successful compromise of a system or application (service). This can  have been caused remotely by a known or new vulnerability, but also by  an unauthorized local access. Also includes being part of a botnet. Unprivileged account  compromise  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  10  Application  compromise  Bot  Availability  DoS By this kind of an attack a system is bombarded with so many packets that  the operations are delayed or the system crashes. DoS examples are ICMP  and SYN floods, Teardrop attacks and mail-bombing. DDoS often is based  on DoS attacks originating from botnets, but also other scenarios exist like  DNS Amplification attacks. However, the availability also can be affected  by local actions (destruction, disruption of power supply, etc.) – or by Act  of God, spontaneous failures or human error, without malice or gross  neglect being involved.  DDoS  Sabotage  Outage (no malice)  Information Content  Security  Unauthorised access  to information  Besides a local abuse of data and systems the information security can be  endangered by a successful account or application compromise.  Furthermore, attacks are possible that intercept and access information  during transmission (wiretapping, spoofing or hijacking).  Human/configuration/software error can also be the cause.  Unauthorised  modification of  information  Fraud  Unauthorized use of  resources  Using resources for unauthorized purposes including profit-making  ventures (E.g. the use of e-mail to participate in illegal profit chain letters  or pyramid schemes).  Copyright  Offering or Installing copies of unlicensed commercial software or other  copyright protected materials (Warez).  Masquerade  Type of attacks in which one entity illegitimately assumes the identity of  another in order to benefit from it.  Phishing  Masquerading as another entity in order to persuade the user to reveal a  private credential.  Vulnerable Open for abuse  Open resolvers, world readable printers, vulnerability apparent from  Nessus etc scans, virus signatures not up-to-date, etc  Other  All incidents which do  not fit in one of the  given categories  should be put into this  class.  If the number of incidents in this category increases, it is an indicator that  the classification scheme must be revised.  Test Meant for testing Meant for testing  Table 1: eCSIRT.net mkVI  This is not necessarily an ideal taxonomy. However, it has many factors which make it very useful. In  particular, the main categories seem to be very practical and universal. Even though the taxonomy was  developed many years ago (and has gone over a number of adaptations), the main categories are still  current and can easily be used today. The same cannot be said about the subcategories which can  sometimes lead to problems with how to classify an incident. For example, it is not particularly useful any  more to make a distinction between DoS attacks and DDoS attacks or to determine what is a ’privileged  account compromise’, ’unprivileged account compromise’ or ’application compromise’. In practice,  subcategories became a part of the description rather than a concrete schema for classification. Nowadays  it is really difficult to determine if a particular malware is a virus, worm, Trojan, spyware or a dialler. The  functionality of malware changes and the honest approach is to classify it all as ‘malicious code’.  The eCSIRT.net classification is highly recommended. Despite some defects, it is still quite useful and good.  Many European CSIRTs use it, which will give teams the opportunity to team up with others later and be  able to compare and merge statistics.  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  11  4.2 Sources  During the 51st TF-CSIRT meeting, one of the main conclusions was that there is the need for a taxonomy  list and name everyone could rely on and refer to.

Here we will see a high level mapping of eCSIRT.net to the Common Taxonomy for Law Enforcement  and CSIRTs.

It outlines the differences in the “Incident Example” in the  Reference Taxonomy, and “Incident Type” in the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs. Moreover, the  Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs also includes a third column which includes the link to the legal  framework. This is not always directly relevant to the CSIRT community, however, it could very be useful  especially when cooperating with law enforcement. The mapping between these two taxonomies could  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  14  help to identify factors that could lead to the update or inclusion of new incident types. Consider for  example the incident types for the malware category of both the Reference Taxonomy, and Common  taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs. There are significant differences between the two, where the Reference  Taxonomy focuses more on the technical specification of the malware type, and the Common taxonomy  for LE and CSIRTs distinguishes between infection and distribution.  This does not seem to be considered in  the Reference Taxonomy. The task force could use these kinds of differences to determine whether or not  such incident types should be added to the reference taxonomy.  REFERENCE  TAXONOMY  INCIDENT  CLASSIFICATION  (1ST COLUMN)  INCIDENT EXAMPLES (2ND  COLUMN)  Malicious Code  Virus  Worm  Trojan  Spyware  Dialler  Rootkit  INCIDENT TYPE (2ND  COLUMN)  COMMON TAXONOMY  FOR LEA AND CSIRT  INCIDENT  CLASSIFICATION (1ST  COLUMN)  Infection  Malware  Distribution  C&C  Undetermined  Malicious Connection  4.4 Mapping other Taxonomies  As mentioned earlier, the Reference taxonomy contains a very practical and universal high level  categorisation. Below are examples of existing taxonomies (CERT.LV11, and CIRCL.LU12), demonstrating how  most of their high level categories map into one or more categories from the Reference Taxonomy. In the  case of CERT.LV, there is a clear one-to-one mapping with all (except testing) of the high level categories.  However, the mapping between CIRCL.LU and Reference Taxonomy is not as direct.  11 https://cert.lv/en/incidents  12 https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/circl/machinetag.json  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  15  REFERENCE TAXONOMY CERT.LV TAXONOMY  Abusive Content Abusive Content  Malicious Code Malicious Code  Information Gathering Information Gathering  Intrusion Attempts Intrusion Attempts  Intrusion Intrusion  Availability Availability  Information Content Security Information Content Security  Fraud Fraud  Vulnerable Vulnerable  Other Other  Test  Table 4: Reference Taxonomy vs CERT.LV taxonomy  CIRCL TAXONOMY REFERENCE TAXONOMY  Spam Abusive Content  malware Malicious Code  Scan  Information Gathering  Intrusion Attempts  system-compromise  Intrusions XSS  sql-injection  denial-of-service Availability  information-leak Information Content Security  copyright-issue  Fraud phishing,  Scam  vulnerability Vulnerable  Fastflux Other  Test  Table 5: CIRCL taxonomy vs Reference Taxonomy  4.5 Pivot Mapping  Given the tight correlation between the Reference Taxonomy and a number of other taxonomies such as  the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs, a mapping from a particular taxonomy to the Reference  Taxonomy, automatically generates a mapping between that taxonomy and other previously mapped  taxonomies. Consider the following example of how CIRCL.LU taxonomy can be mapped to the Common  Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs and the CERT.LV taxonomy by pivoting from one taxonomy to another.  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  16  Figure 1: Pivot Mapping  Notice that since both the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs, and CERT.LV Taxonomy have been  mapped onto the Reference Taxonomy, this provides a clear mapping between the Common Taxonomy for  LE and CSIRTs and the CERT.LV taxonomy, as well as any other taxonomy that would have already been  mapped to the Reference Taxonomy. This mapping can be extremely useful for cross-CSIRT collaboration,  as well as CSIRT-LEA collaboration by enabling CSIRTs to use the Common Taxonomy for LE and CSIRTs.  4.6 MISP mapping  MISP developers have provided a mapping of existing taxonomies.   https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/mapping/mapping.json   http://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_mapping_of_taxonomies  The MISP mapping taxonomy allows for the mapping of a single classification into a series of machine-tag  synonyms. The implemented approach for mapping is similar to the one described above, whereby a  https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies/blob/master/mapping/mapping.json http://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html#_mapping_of_taxonomies  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  17  number of categories are used as a central reference point and each of these points are mapped to  categories in other known taxonomies.  Figure 2: JSON values of MISP mapping taxonomy  Figure 2 shows how the taxonomies are mapped in the MISP taxonomy document.  Reference Incident Classification Taxonomy  January 2018  18  5. Conclusion  While still in its infancy, the reference taxonomy task force is off to a good start. The members seem eager  and willing to contribute, and make use of the resulting reference taxonomy. The outcome of the  upcoming meetings will determine the success of this initiative.

    "abstract": "This taxonomy resulted from collaboration initiatives such as the annual ENISA/EC3 Workshop which involved CSIRTs, LEAs, ENISA, and EC3. Other examples include the eCSIRT.net taxonomy2 which was developed in 2003, and the eCSIRT.net mkVI taxonomy3 which is an adaptation of the original eCSIRT.net taxonomy."

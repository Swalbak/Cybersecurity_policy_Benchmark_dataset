INTRODUCTION  If we look at modern history, the term “cyber” was first  coined by the French physicist André-Marie Ampère  who suggested that “the future science of governments  should be called “la cybernétique”.1 In the 1940s, the  term was taken up again by Norbert Wiener who  defined “Cybernetics” as “the science of control and  communication in the animal and the machine”.2  However, the word originally comes from the Greek  word ‘Κυβέρνηση’ (pronounced ‘Kyvérnisi’), which means  government.  In a democratic society, 'Cybersecurity'3 may also  involve ensuring the transparent operation of a  governance or election system. This protection should  include the integrity, availability and confidentiality of  election processes.  The original root of the word cyber takes on renewed  importance, as there are increasing reports of cyber- enabled threats with a potential to undermine  democratic processes across the EU and beyond.4 Of  particular significance is the possibility of interference  in elections by cyber means, due to the widespread use  of digital technology to support electoral processes. For  example, digital technology is used to support:  Confidential communications of politicians and  political parties;  Political campaigns;  Communication via the media;  The electoral register;  The casting of votes;  The counting of votes;  The dissemination of the results.  Vulnerabilities in relation to any of these elements  may form a target for exploitation by malicious actors  seeking to interfere in and undermine the legitimacy of  democratic elections. As a result, promoting a high level  of cybersecurity across the EU plays an important role in  safeguarding the whole election lifecycle. In this context,  1 Ampère, AM, Essai sur la philosophie des sciences, ou Exposition  analytique d'une classification naturelle de toutes les connaissances  humaines. Première partie, Paris, Bachelier, 1834. 2 Wiener, N, Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal  and the Machine. Technology Press, 1948. 3  Defined in the European Commission Proposal for a  Cybersecurity Act (COM/2017/0477) as “[…] all activities necessary  to protect network and information systems, their users, and affected  persons from cyber threats;” available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/ legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2017%3A0477%3AFIN  4 See: European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security, “ENISA Threat Landscape 2018”, January 2019, available at:  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape- report-2018  the 2019 European Parliament elections, which involve  election processes at national level in all EU Member  States, are fast approaching. Due to their scale and the  different electoral systems used in the various Member  States, these elections are susceptible to interference by  cyber means.  A recent Eurobarometer survey on democracy and  elections demonstrates public concern surrounding  election interference. In particular, 61 percent of  respondents expressed some level of concern about  the possibility of elections being manipulated through  cyberattacks.5  This paper presents ENISA’s opinion on the cybersecurity  of elections and provides concrete and forward-looking  recommendations to improve the cybersecurity of  electoral processes in the EU.  5 European Commission, Special Eurobarometer 477 “Democracy  and elections”, September 2018, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/ commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/ instruments/special/surveyky/2198  The original root of the  word cyber takes on  renewed importance,  as there are increasing  reports of cyber-enabled  threats with a potential  to undermine democratic  processes across the EU  and beyond.  OPINION PAPERS 5  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  3. MOTIVATIONS AND ACTORS  With the increase in the digitalisation of our lifestyles,  information can be transferred across the globe in  seconds. With regard to elections, the traditional sources  of information in the form of national broadcasters, and  paper media are diminishing and content is often being  provided and uploaded into the digital ecosystem by  individuals, e.g. on digital platforms and social media.  The threat actors often associated with cyber  interference in the election process include:6  Black hat hackers;  Terrorists;  Criminals;  Nation states / nation state sponsored actors;  Insiders;  Hacktivists;  Politically motivated groups.  Additionally, an evolving threat is the motivation behind  the actors interfering with the due process of elections  by cyber means. The motivation for the actors can be  manifold. Examples include:7  Financial gain;  Fame and reputation;  Provoking chaos / anarchy;  Foreign policy / national interests;  Vengeance;  Sowing social division;  Subverting political opposition;  Undermining trust in democracy.  The analysis of any cyber incident has to take into account  both the motivation and the type of actor, as well as their  associated capabilities. An additional complication is that  these actors with their motivations can generate cyber  interference using automated tools such as botnets.8  Botnets are now readily available at very low cost to  actors on the dark web and their potential effect should  not be underestimated. Another effect from using botnets  is that attribution can be difficult.  6 Defending Digital Democracy Project (D3P), “The State and  Local Election Cybersecurity Playbook,” Belfer Center for Science  and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, February 2018,  available at: https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/state-and- local-election-cybersecurity-playbook 7 Ibid. 8 Supra note 4, at p. 59-63.  Recommendation 1: Digital Service Providers, social  media, online platforms and messaging service  providers are advised to deploy technology that  will identify unusual traffic patterns that could be  associated with the spread of disinformation or  cyberattacks on election processes.  Recommendation 2: While it is recognised that  some of the above players have agreed to self- regulate and introduce disinformation policies,  consideration should be given to regulation of these  platforms at an EU level to ensure a consistent and  harmonised approach across the EU to tackling  online disinformation aimed at undermining the  democratic process.  Recommendation 3: Member States should continue  to actively work together with the aim to identify  and take down botnets.  OPINION PAPERS 6  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  4. AN EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE  FOR CYBER ATTACKS ON ELECTION  SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES Several methods can and have been used to influence  or undermine the integrity of electoral processes by  cyber means. As a result of the large attack surface that  is inherent to elections, the risks do not only concern  government election systems, but also extend to  individual candidates and individual political campaigns.  Examples of attack vectors that affect election processes  include:  Spear phishing;  Data theft;  Online disinformation;  Malware; and  (Distributed) Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  The “Compendium on the Cybersecurity of Election  Technology” prepared by the Cooperation Group set  up under the 2016 Network and Information Security  Directive, to which ENISA has contributed, contains  detailed information on examples of cyberattacks on  election processes. In recent years, there have been an  increasing number of reports of these techniques being  used to interfere with election processes.9  The risks are by no means limited to electronic voting or  voting machines. For example, DDoS attacks have been  reported targeting the Central Election Commission in  Bulgaria, and electoral websites in the Czech Republic.10  Other reported examples illustrate that politicians  and political campaigns may also form a target. These  examples include the 2016 Democratic National  Committee (DNC) email leak in the run-up to the US  presidential elections11 and the reported cyber meddling  in the 2017 French presidential elections12.  As the agency tasked with contributing to the network  and information security of the Union, ENISA is prepared  to support and advise on efforts that aim to improve  the resilience and preparedness of the election process  9 NIS Cooperation Group, “Compendium on Cyber Security of Election  Technology”, CG Publication 03/2018, July 2018, p. 49, available at:  https://www.ria.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/kuberturve/ cyber_security_of_election_technology.pdf 10 Ibid.  11 See e.g. Geller, E, “Inside the race to hack-proof the Democratic  Party”, Politico, 17 October 2018, available at: https://www.politico. com/story/2018/10/17/democrats-hacking-cybersecurity-dnc-909883  12 BBC News, “French election: Emmanuel Macron condemns ‘massive’  hack attack”, 6 May 2017, available at: https://www.bbc.com/news/ world-europe-39827244  across the EU. In particular, in view of the upcoming  European Parliament elections, ENISA also supports the  preparedness at Member State level by working with  the national electoral commission to test simulations of  cybersecurity incidents and disinformation campaigns  aimed at disrupting the electoral process13  Recommendation 4: ENISA supports the general and  specific technical proposals to mitigate the risks that  are documented in the Compendium on the Cyber  Security of Election Technology  Recommendation 5: Developing more exercises  aimed at testing election cybersecurity will  help improve preparedness, understanding and  responding to possible election-related cyber threats  and attack scenarios.14  13  ENISA ‘ENISA supports Portuguese National Cybersecurity  Exercise on electoral process’, 26 February 2019, available at https:// www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/jenisa-supports-portuguese- national-cybersecurity-exercise-on-electoral-process 14 See: Wolf, P, “Cybersecurity and Elections: An International IDEA  Round-table summary”, International Institute for Democracy and  Electoral Assistance (IDEA), 7 August 2017, available at: https://www. idea.int/news-media/news/cybersecurity-and-elections-international- idea-round-table-summary  As the agency tasked  with contributing  to the network and  information security  of the Union, ENISA is  prepared to support  and advise on efforts  that aim to improve  the resilience and  preparedness of the  election process  across the EU.  OPINION PAPERS 7  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  5. LIFECYCLE OF THE ELECTION  The election process and the risks associated with it can  be divided into a number of sections. These include:  The maintenance of the electoral register;  The public political campaigning process;  The voting process;  The delivery of the results.  The electoral register is a list of persons eligible to  vote in elections. Registration in the electoral register  is generally managed by the local authorities. Where  enrolment is not automatic, voter registration frequently  takes place through the action of physically registering at  the authority in question. As a result, many countries are  not dependent on a central registry. Postal distribution  is often used to notify registered persons of the election  process. In view of these factors, the cybersecurity  risk level associated with the electoral register is  considered medium.  As follows from the analysis provided in this opinion  paper, the public political campaigning process is  susceptible to cyber interference. Due to the high  complexity of this step in the election lifecycle, the  different attack vectors, and the reported examples  of disinformation and data leaks (see section 6), the  cybersecurity risk level in this area is considered high.  Given that the majority of Member States have either  postponed or discontinued the use of electronic  voting, the risk associated with the voting process can  be considered to be somewhat reduced. Examples  of countries that have postponed or discontinued  electronic voting include Ireland,15 the Netherlands,16  France,17 Finland18 and Germany.19 In the Netherlands in  2017, the government also decided to return to counting  votes by hand instead of the electronic counting due  15  O’Halloran, M and O’Regan, M, “E-voting machines to be disposed  of”, The Irish Times. 6 October 2010, available at: https://www. irishtimes.com/news/e-voting-machines-to-be-disposed-of-1.865193  16 Ritzen, G, “Kabinet: stemmen worden bij verkiezingen met de hand  geteld”, NRC, 1 February 2017, available at: https://www.nrc.nl/ nieuws/2017/02/01/kabinet-stemmen-worden-bij-verkiezingen-met- de-hand-geteld-a1544017  17 Reuters, “France drops electronic voting for citizens abroad over  cybersecurity fears”, 6 March 2017, available at: https://www.reuters. com/article/uk-france-election-cyber/france-drops-electronic-voting- for-citizens-abroad-over-cybersecurity-fears-idUKKBN16D235  18 Ministry of Justice Finland, “Working group: Risks of online  voting outweigh its benefits”, 19 December 2017, available at:  https://oikeusministerio.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/tyoryhma- nettiaanestyksen-riskit-suuremmat-kuin-hyodyt  19 Deutsche Welle, “German Court Rules E-Voting Unconstitutional”,  3 March 2009, available at: https://www.dw.com/en/german-court- rules-e-voting-unconstitutional/a-4069101  to cybersecurity concerns.20 Examples of countries  that make use of electronic voting technology include  Estonia21 and Belgium22.  Taking into consideration that, as noted above, the roll- out of electronic voting has been either discontinued  or postponed in a number of Member States, the  cybersecurity risk level in relation to the voting process is  considered medium. This cybersecurity risk level is likely  to be higher in countries where e-voting systems are  being implemented. A distinction should also be made  between online and offline e-voting systems, where the  former is likely to entail a higher cybersecurity risk level  than the latter.  Results are generally counted in election count stations,  which are accessible to the public in some jurisdictions.  The dissemination of the results is covered by the  media and typically takes place via several channels  of communication, including broadcast television,  online media, and print media. In view of these factors,  the cybersecurity risk level is considered medium.  The cybersecurity risk level is likely to be higher in  jurisdictions which use digital technology to count votes.  20 Supra note 16 21 Valimised.ee (Estonian elections website), “Internet voting in  Estonia”, available at: https://www.valimised.ee/en/internet-voting/ internet-voting-estonia  22 Flemish Parliament, “Digitaal Stemmen”, available at: https://www. vlaanderen.be/nl/vlaams-parlement/verkiezingen/digitaal-stemmen  OPINION PAPERS 8  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  Taking into account the above, from a cybersecurity  perspective, ENISA considers the cybersecurity risks  as follows:  Recommendation 6: Official channels/technologies for  the dissemination of the results should be identified.  Additionally, back-up channels/technologies should  be available to validate the results with the count  centres. Where websites are being used, DDoS  mitigation techniques should be in place.

THE ROLE OF HUMAN FACTORS  AND ONLINE DISINFORMATION  In addition to the technical aspects of election  cybersecurity, a number of human factors have to be  taken into account. For example, human error and poor  cyber hygiene23 (weak passwords and poorly configured  IT systems) can result in vulnerabilities that may be  exploited thereby resulting in interference to elections,  e.g. through data leaks.  Online disinformation represents another tool that may  be used by malicious actors in an attempt to influence  human decision-making. So-called “fake news” has  gained the attention of the media and policymakers due  to reports of its misuse in both the media and on social  networks with the intention to influence the opinions  of citizens, which potentially have a consequential  effect on voting choices. Examples include the alleged  interference in the British EU membership referendum24,  the 2016 US presidential elections25, and the 2017 French  presidential elections26. Other documented examples  include the use of social media profiling to target voters  without either their knowledge or their consent.27  23 See: European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security, “Review of Cyber Hygiene Practices”, December 2016, available  at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-hygiene  24 See e.g. House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport  Committee, “Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report”, July  2018, available at: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/ cmselect/cmcumeds/363/363.pdf  25 See e.g. Faris, R, et al. \"Partisanship, propaganda, and  disinformation: Online media and the 2016 US presidential  election\", August 16 2017, available at: https://cyber.harvard.edu/ publications/2017/08/mediacloud  26 See e.g. Ferrara, E, \"Disinformation and social bot operations in  the run up to the 2017 French presidential election\", 2017, available at:  https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.00086.pdf  27 See e.g. The Guardian, “The Cambridge Analytica Files”, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files  6.1 ADDRESSING ONLINE DISINFORMATION  In April 2018, ENISA published an opinion paper  outlining a number of policy recommendations in  relation to online disinformation28, which was provided  as input to the European Commission’s Communication  on this topic. Subsequently, a number of online  platforms, social networks and advertisers endorsed  a self-regulatory Code of Practice on Disinformation  proposed on the initiative of the Commission.29  In its fake news opinion paper, ENISA provided two  recommendations that are of particular importance in  the context of elections:  Recommendation 7: A legal obligation should be  considered to classify election systems, processes  and infrastructures as critical infrastructure so that  the necessary cybersecurity measures are put in  place; and  Recommendation 8: A legal obligation should be  put in place requiring political organisations to  deploy a high level of cybersecurity in their systems,  processes and infrastructures.  In relation to the designation of election systems as  critical infrastructure, the US Department of Homeland  Security has recently implemented such a policy.30 ENISA  also noted the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in  combating online disinformation. However, AI alone is  not a silver bullet. AI will have difficulty in addressing  cultural differences, political humour, cynicism, satire,  and other non-literal means of communication.  Consequently, the results of any AI analyses must be  validated by humans.  28 ENISA, “Strengthening Network & Information Security & Protecting  Against Online Disinformation (“fake news”)”, available at: https://www. enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/ fake-news  29  European Commission, “Code of Practice on Disinformation”,  Commission News Article, 26 September 2018, available at:  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/code-practice- disinformation  30 Since January 2017. See: Congressional Research Service, “The  Designation of Election Systems as Critical Infrastructure”, updated  January 28, 2019, available at: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10677.pdf  OPINION PAPERS 10  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  6.2 NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE APPROACHES  Approaches by different Member States to the problem  of online disinformation can be observed in the 2017  German Network Enforcement Act31, and the 2018  French law against manipulation of information32. The  use of legislation to tackle this problem is challenged  by the need to balance the freedom of expression with  the risk associated with the effects of disinformation on  the public interest. For example, the French legislative  proposal was declared constitutional following a  challenge before the Constitutional Council.33  Recommendation 9: Member States should consider  introducing national legislation to tackle the  challenges associated with online disinformation  while protecting to the maximum extent possible  the values set down in the Treaty of Lisbon and the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.  6.3 IMPROVING DATA PROTECTION  AND PRIVACY  Human factors also play a role from the perspective  of privacy and data protection, where the emails of  politicians and political campaign staff were targeted.  Reported examples include the 2016 Democratic  National Committee (DNC) email leak in the US and the  recent leak of politicians’ data in Germany34.  Appropriate trainings and guidance for politicians and  their personnel in terms of securing their data and their  communications contribute to addressing this issue.  Examples that represent good practices in this area in  some Member States include:  the French initiative where ANSSI (the National  Cybersecurity Agency of France) held a workshop on  cybersecurity for political parties and MPs.35  The UK, where the NCSC is working with  political parties to better protect their data and  31 See: Engels, S and Fuhrmann, T, “Network Enforcement Act in A  Nutshell”, DLA Piper IPT Germany Blog, 31 January 2018, available  at: https://blogs.dlapiper.com/iptgermany/2018/01/31/network- enforcement-act-in-a-nutshell/  32 Loi n° 2018-1202 relative à la lutte contre la manipulation de  l'information, 22 December 2018, available at: http://www.senat.fr/ dossier-legislatif/ppl17-623.html  33 Constitutional Council of France, Decisions n° 2018-773 and  2018-774 of 20 December 2018, available at: https://www.conseil- constitutionnel.fr/actualites/communique  34 The Guardian, “German politicians’ personal data leaked online”,  4 January 2019, available at: https://www.theguardian.com/ world/2019/jan/04/german-politicians-personal-data-hacked-and- posted-online  35 Baezner, M and Robin, P, “Cyber and Information Warfare in  elections in Europe”, December 2017, available at: http://www.css. ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for- securities-studies/pdfs/Cyber-Reports-2017-08.pdf  communications, for example by providing guidance  for political parties and their staff on protecting their  digital systems and online profiles.36  In Belgium, a guide for candidates and political staff  has been developed on joint initiative of the State  Security Service, the Centre for Cyber Security and  the General Information and Security Service.37  One notable example of an active measure used to  respond to cyber interference in the election process  was the Macron campaign’s use of counter-attack  methods to misdirect hackers in the context of the 2017  French presidential elections.38  Recommendation 10: The cybersecurity expertise  of the state should be used to assist political  practitioners in the securing of their data and their  communications. For example, CSIRT expertise can  be leveraged to support political parties.  Recommendation 11: Political parties should have  an incident response plan in place to address  and counter the scenario of data leaks and other  potential cyber-attacks.  36  UK National Cyber Security Centre, “Statement: Guidance for  political parties and their staff”, 17 May 2017, available at: https:// www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/statement-guidance-political-parties-and- their-staff  37 VSSE, CCB, and SGRS/ADIV, “Veilig online tijdens de  verkiezingscampagne/ Surfer en toute sécurité pendant la campagne  électorale”, February 2019, available at: https://www.ccb.belgium.be/ fr/actualit%C3%A9/surfer-en-toute-s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9-pendant- la-campagne-%C3%A9lectorale  38 Logeswaran, A, “How Macron's team thwarted the hackers with  one simple trick”, World Economic Forum, 11 May 2017, available at:  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/how-macrons-team- thwarted-the-hackers-with-one-simple-trick/  OPINION PAPERS 11  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  7. FOSTERING EUROPEAN  COOPERATION IN ELECTION  CYBERSECURITY The cybersecurity of elections is a common issue that  affects all the EU Member States. The cross-border  relevance of working towards more cyber secure  elections is all too evident in the context of the European  Parliament elections, where cyber interference in one  or more Member States has the potential to undermine  the legitimacy of the full European election process. If  malicious actors manage to give only the impression  that the election process has been tampered with or  has been conducted unfairly in one Member State, this  could be enough to create the illusion that the whole  European election process has been compromised.  Therefore, cooperation amongst Member States is even  more important.  In addition to cooperation between services within  the Member States, further investing in European  cooperation and information exchange efforts can play  an important role. Such efforts can facilitate effective  responses to cyber incidents, promote mutual learning  between Member States, and help tackle and coordinate  the issue of attribution.  Recommendation 12: Increased cooperation and  exchange of best practices and experiences between  the Member States and at EU-level can contribute  to strengthening cybersecurity across the EU,  including the cybersecurity of the election process.  Member States should also make use of the existing  frameworks and structures that are in place.

INTRODUCTION  If we look at modern history, the term “cyber” was first  coined by the French physicist André-Marie Ampère  who suggested that “the future science of governments  should be called “la cybernétique”.1 In the 1940s, the  term was taken up again by Norbert Wiener who  defined “Cybernetics” as “the science of control and  communication in the animal and the machine”.2  However, the word originally comes from the Greek  word ‘Κυβέρνηση’ (pronounced ‘Kyvérnisi’), which means  government.  In a democratic society, 'Cybersecurity'3 may also  involve ensuring the transparent operation of a  governance or election system. This protection should  include the integrity, availability and confidentiality of  election processes.  The original root of the word cyber takes on renewed  importance, as there are increasing reports of cyber- enabled threats with a potential to undermine  democratic processes across the EU and beyond.4 Of  particular significance is the possibility of interference  in elections by cyber means, due to the widespread use  of digital technology to support electoral processes. For  example, digital technology is used to support:  Confidential communications of politicians and  political parties;  Political campaigns;  Communication via the media;  The electoral register;  The casting of votes;  The counting of votes;  The dissemination of the results.  Vulnerabilities in relation to any of these elements  may form a target for exploitation by malicious actors  seeking to interfere in and undermine the legitimacy of  democratic elections. As a result, promoting a high level  of cybersecurity across the EU plays an important role in  safeguarding the whole election lifecycle.

Due to their scale and the  different electoral systems used in the various Member  States, these elections are susceptible to interference by  cyber means.  A recent Eurobarometer survey on democracy and  elections demonstrates public concern surrounding  election interference. In particular, 61 percent of  respondents expressed some level of concern about  the possibility of elections being manipulated through  cyberattacks.5  This paper presents ENISA’s opinion on the cybersecurity  of elections and provides concrete and forward-looking  recommendations to improve the cybersecurity of  electoral processes in the EU.  5 European Commission, Special Eurobarometer 477 “Democracy  and elections”, September 2018, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/ commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/ instruments/special/surveyky/2198  The original root of the  word cyber takes on  renewed importance,  as there are increasing  reports of cyber-enabled  threats with a potential  to undermine democratic  processes across the EU  and beyond.  OPINION PAPERS 5  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  3. MOTIVATIONS AND ACTORS  With the increase in the digitalisation of our lifestyles,  information can be transferred across the globe in  seconds. With regard to elections, the traditional sources  of information in the form of national broadcasters, and  paper media are diminishing and content is often being  provided and uploaded into the digital ecosystem by  individuals, e.g. on digital platforms and social media.  The threat actors often associated with cyber  interference in the election process include:6  Black hat hackers;  Terrorists;  Criminals;  Nation states / nation state sponsored actors;  Insiders;  Hacktivists;  Politically motivated groups.  Additionally, an evolving threat is the motivation behind  the actors interfering with the due process of elections  by cyber means. The motivation for the actors can be  manifold. Examples include:7  Financial gain;  Fame and reputation;  Provoking chaos / anarchy;  Foreign policy / national interests;  Vengeance;  Sowing social division;  Subverting political opposition;  Undermining trust in democracy.  The analysis of any cyber incident has to take into account  both the motivation and the type of actor, as well as their  associated capabilities. An additional complication is that  these actors with their motivations can generate cyber  interference using automated tools such as botnets.8  Botnets are now readily available at very low cost to  actors on the dark web and their potential effect should  not be underestimated. Another effect from using botnets  is that attribution can be difficult.  6 Defending Digital Democracy Project (D3P), “The State and  Local Election Cybersecurity Playbook,” Belfer Center for Science  and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School, February 2018,  available at: https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/state-and- local-election-cybersecurity-playbook 7 Ibid. 8 Supra note 4, at p. 59-63.  Recommendation 1: Digital Service Providers, social  media, online platforms and messaging service  providers are advised to deploy technology that  will identify unusual traffic patterns that could be  associated with the spread of disinformation or  cyberattacks on election processes.  Recommendation 2: While it is recognised that  some of the above players have agreed to self- regulate and introduce disinformation policies,  consideration should be given to regulation of these  platforms at an EU level to ensure a consistent and  harmonised approach across the EU to tackling  online disinformation aimed at undermining the  democratic process.  Recommendation 3: Member States should continue  to actively work together with the aim to identify  and take down botnets.  OPINION PAPERS 6  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  4. AN EVOLVING THREAT LANDSCAPE  FOR CYBER ATTACKS ON ELECTION  SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES Several methods can and have been used to influence  or undermine the integrity of electoral processes by  cyber means. As a result of the large attack surface that  is inherent to elections, the risks do not only concern  government election systems, but also extend to  individual candidates and individual political campaigns.  Examples of attack vectors that affect election processes  include:  Spear phishing;  Data theft;  Online disinformation;  Malware; and  (Distributed) Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks.  The “Compendium on the Cybersecurity of Election  Technology” prepared by the Cooperation Group set  up under the 2016 Network and Information Security  Directive, to which ENISA has contributed, contains  detailed information on examples of cyberattacks on  election processes. In recent years, there have been an  increasing number of reports of these techniques being  used to interfere with election processes.9  The risks are by no means limited to electronic voting or  voting machines. For example, DDoS attacks have been  reported targeting the Central Election Commission in  Bulgaria, and electoral websites in the Czech Republic.10  Other reported examples illustrate that politicians  and political campaigns may also form a target. These  examples include the 2016 Democratic National  Committee (DNC) email leak in the run-up to the US  presidential elections11 and the reported cyber meddling  in the 2017 French presidential elections12.  As the agency tasked with contributing to the network  and information security of the Union, ENISA is prepared  to support and advise on efforts that aim to improve  the resilience and preparedness of the election process  9 NIS Cooperation Group, “Compendium on Cyber Security of Election  Technology”, CG Publication 03/2018, July 2018, p. 49, available at:  https://www.ria.ee/sites/default/files/content-editors/kuberturve/ cyber_security_of_election_technology.pdf 10 Ibid.  11 See e.g. Geller, E, “Inside the race to hack-proof the Democratic  Party”, Politico, 17 October 2018, available at: https://www.politico. com/story/2018/10/17/democrats-hacking-cybersecurity-dnc-909883  12 BBC News, “French election: Emmanuel Macron condemns ‘massive’  hack attack”, 6 May 2017, available at: https://www.bbc.com/news/ world-europe-39827244  across the EU.

OPINION PAPERS 7  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  5. LIFECYCLE OF THE ELECTION  The election process and the risks associated with it can  be divided into a number of sections. These include:  The maintenance of the electoral register;  The public political campaigning process;  The voting process;  The delivery of the results.  The electoral register is a list of persons eligible to  vote in elections. Registration in the electoral register  is generally managed by the local authorities. Where  enrolment is not automatic, voter registration frequently  takes place through the action of physically registering at  the authority in question. As a result, many countries are  not dependent on a central registry. Postal distribution  is often used to notify registered persons of the election  process. In view of these factors, the cybersecurity  risk level associated with the electoral register is  considered medium.  As follows from the analysis provided in this opinion  paper, the public political campaigning process is  susceptible to cyber interference. Due to the high  complexity of this step in the election lifecycle, the  different attack vectors, and the reported examples  of disinformation and data leaks (see section 6), the  cybersecurity risk level in this area is considered high.  Given that the majority of Member States have either  postponed or discontinued the use of electronic  voting, the risk associated with the voting process can  be considered to be somewhat reduced. Examples  of countries that have postponed or discontinued  electronic voting include Ireland,15 the Netherlands,16  France,17 Finland18 and Germany.19 In the Netherlands in  2017, the government also decided to return to counting  votes by hand instead of the electronic counting due  15  O’Halloran, M and O’Regan, M, “E-voting machines to be disposed  of”, The Irish Times. 6 October 2010, available at: https://www. irishtimes.com/news/e-voting-machines-to-be-disposed-of-1.865193  16 Ritzen, G, “Kabinet: stemmen worden bij verkiezingen met de hand  geteld”, NRC, 1 February 2017, available at: https://www.nrc.nl/ nieuws/2017/02/01/kabinet-stemmen-worden-bij-verkiezingen-met- de-hand-geteld-a1544017  17 Reuters, “France drops electronic voting for citizens abroad over  cybersecurity fears”, 6 March 2017, available at: https://www.reuters. com/article/uk-france-election-cyber/france-drops-electronic-voting- for-citizens-abroad-over-cybersecurity-fears-idUKKBN16D235  18 Ministry of Justice Finland, “Working group: Risks of online  voting outweigh its benefits”, 19 December 2017, available at:  https://oikeusministerio.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/tyoryhma- nettiaanestyksen-riskit-suuremmat-kuin-hyodyt  19 Deutsche Welle, “German Court Rules E-Voting Unconstitutional”,  3 March 2009, available at: https://www.dw.com/en/german-court- rules-e-voting-unconstitutional/a-4069101  to cybersecurity concerns.20 Examples of countries  that make use of electronic voting technology include  Estonia21 and Belgium22.  Taking into consideration that, as noted above, the roll- out of electronic voting has been either discontinued  or postponed in a number of Member States, the  cybersecurity risk level in relation to the voting process is  considered medium. This cybersecurity risk level is likely  to be higher in countries where e-voting systems are  being implemented. A distinction should also be made  between online and offline e-voting systems, where the  former is likely to entail a higher cybersecurity risk level  than the latter.  Results are generally counted in election count stations,  which are accessible to the public in some jurisdictions.  The dissemination of the results is covered by the  media and typically takes place via several channels  of communication, including broadcast television,  online media, and print media. In view of these factors,  the cybersecurity risk level is considered medium.  The cybersecurity risk level is likely to be higher in  jurisdictions which use digital technology to count votes.  20 Supra note 16 21 Valimised.ee (Estonian elections website), “Internet voting in  Estonia”, available at: https://www.valimised.ee/en/internet-voting/ internet-voting-estonia  22 Flemish Parliament, “Digitaal Stemmen”, available at: https://www. vlaanderen.be/nl/vlaams-parlement/verkiezingen/digitaal-stemmen  OPINION PAPERS 8  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  Taking into account the above, from a cybersecurity  perspective, ENISA considers the cybersecurity risks  as follows:  Recommendation 6: Official channels/technologies for  the dissemination of the results should be identified.  Additionally, back-up channels/technologies should  be available to validate the results with the count  centres. Where websites are being used, DDoS  mitigation techniques should be in place.

THE ROLE OF HUMAN FACTORS  AND ONLINE DISINFORMATION  In addition to the technical aspects of election  cybersecurity, a number of human factors have to be  taken into account. For example, human error and poor  cyber hygiene23 (weak passwords and poorly configured  IT systems) can result in vulnerabilities that may be  exploited thereby resulting in interference to elections,  e.g. through data leaks.  Online disinformation represents another tool that may  be used by malicious actors in an attempt to influence  human decision-making. So-called “fake news” has  gained the attention of the media and policymakers due  to reports of its misuse in both the media and on social  networks with the intention to influence the opinions  of citizens, which potentially have a consequential  effect on voting choices. Examples include the alleged  interference in the British EU membership referendum24,  the 2016 US presidential elections25, and the 2017 French  presidential elections26. Other documented examples  include the use of social media profiling to target voters  without either their knowledge or their consent.27  23 See: European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security, “Review of Cyber Hygiene Practices”, December 2016, available  at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-hygiene  24 See e.g. House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport  Committee, “Disinformation and ‘fake news’: Interim Report”, July  2018, available at: https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/ cmselect/cmcumeds/363/363.pdf  25 See e.g. Faris, R, et al. \"Partisanship, propaganda, and  disinformation: Online media and the 2016 US presidential  election\", August 16 2017, available at: https://cyber.harvard.edu/ publications/2017/08/mediacloud  26 See e.g. Ferrara, E, \"Disinformation and social bot operations in  the run up to the 2017 French presidential election\", 2017, available at:  https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1707/1707.00086.pdf  27 See e.g. The Guardian, “The Cambridge Analytica Files”, available at:  https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files  6.1 ADDRESSING ONLINE DISINFORMATION  In April 2018, ENISA published an opinion paper  outlining a number of policy recommendations in  relation to online disinformation28, which was provided  as input to the European Commission’s Communication  on this topic. Subsequently, a number of online  platforms, social networks and advertisers endorsed  a self-regulatory Code of Practice on Disinformation  proposed on the initiative of the Commission.29  In its fake news opinion paper, ENISA provided two  recommendations that are of particular importance in  the context of elections:  Recommendation 7: A legal obligation should be  considered to classify election systems, processes  and infrastructures as critical infrastructure so that  the necessary cybersecurity measures are put in  place; and  Recommendation 8: A legal obligation should be  put in place requiring political organisations to  deploy a high level of cybersecurity in their systems,  processes and infrastructures.  In relation to the designation of election systems as  critical infrastructure, the US Department of Homeland  Security has recently implemented such a policy.30 ENISA  also noted the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in  combating online disinformation. However, AI alone is  not a silver bullet. AI will have difficulty in addressing  cultural differences, political humour, cynicism, satire,  and other non-literal means of communication.  Consequently, the results of any AI analyses must be  validated by humans.  28 ENISA, “Strengthening Network & Information Security & Protecting  Against Online Disinformation (“fake news”)”, available at: https://www. enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/ fake-news  29  European Commission, “Code of Practice on Disinformation”,  Commission News Article, 26 September 2018, available at:  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/code-practice- disinformation  30 Since January 2017. See: Congressional Research Service, “The  Designation of Election Systems as Critical Infrastructure”, updated  January 28, 2019, available at: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/IF10677.pdf  OPINION PAPERS 10  THE EU CYBERSECURITY AGENCY  6.2 NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE APPROACHES  Approaches by different Member States to the problem  of online disinformation can be observed in the 2017  German Network Enforcement Act31, and the 2018  French law against manipulation of information32. The  use of legislation to tackle this problem is challenged  by the need to balance the freedom of expression with  the risk associated with the effects of disinformation on  the public interest. For example, the French legislative  proposal was declared constitutional following a  challenge before the Constitutional Council.33  Recommendation 9: Member States should consider  introducing national legislation to tackle the  challenges associated with online disinformation  while protecting to the maximum extent possible  the values set down in the Treaty of Lisbon and the  Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.  6.3 IMPROVING DATA PROTECTION  AND PRIVACY  Human factors also play a role from the perspective  of privacy and data protection, where the emails of  politicians and political campaign staff were targeted.  Reported examples include the 2016 Democratic  National Committee (DNC) email leak in the US and the  recent leak of politicians’ data in Germany34.  Appropriate trainings and guidance for politicians and  their personnel in terms of securing their data and their  communications contribute to addressing this issue.  Examples that represent good practices in this area in  some Member States include:  the French initiative where ANSSI (the National  Cybersecurity Agency of France) held a workshop on  cybersecurity for political parties and MPs.35  The UK, where the NCSC is working with  political parties to better protect their data and  31 See: Engels, S and Fuhrmann, T, “Network Enforcement Act in A  Nutshell”, DLA Piper IPT Germany Blog, 31 January 2018, available  at: https://blogs.dlapiper.com/iptgermany/2018/01/31/network- enforcement-act-in-a-nutshell/  32 Loi n° 2018-1202 relative à la lutte contre la manipulation de  l'information, 22 December 2018, available at: http://www.senat.fr/ dossier-legislatif/ppl17-623.html  33 Constitutional Council of France, Decisions n° 2018-773 and  2018-774 of 20 December 2018, available at: https://www.conseil- constitutionnel.fr/actualites/communique  34 The Guardian, “German politicians’ personal data leaked online”,  4 January 2019, available at: https://www.theguardian.com/ world/2019/jan/04/german-politicians-personal-data-hacked-and- posted-online  35 Baezner, M and Robin, P, “Cyber and Information Warfare in  elections in Europe”, December 2017, available at: http://www.css. ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/cis/center-for- securities-studies/pdfs/Cyber-Reports-2017-08.pdf  communications, for example by providing guidance  for political parties and their staff on protecting their  digital systems and online profiles.36  In Belgium, a guide for candidates and political staff  has been developed on joint initiative of the State  Security Service, the Centre for Cyber Security and  the General Information and Security Service.37  One notable example of an active measure used to  respond to cyber interference in the election process  was the Macron campaign’s use of counter-attack  methods to misdirect hackers in the context of the 2017  French presidential elections.38  Recommendation 10: The cybersecurity expertise  of the state should be used to assist political  practitioners in the securing of their data and their  communications. For example, CSIRT expertise can  be leveraged to support political parties.

FOSTERING EUROPEAN  COOPERATION IN ELECTION  CYBERSECURITY The cybersecurity of elections is a common issue that  affects all the EU Member States. The cross-border  relevance of working towards more cyber secure  elections is all too evident in the context of the European  Parliament elections, where cyber interference in one  or more Member States has the potential to undermine  the legitimacy of the full European election process. If  malicious actors manage to give only the impression  that the election process has been tampered with or  has been conducted unfairly in one Member State, this  could be enough to create the illusion that the whole  European election process has been compromised.  Therefore, cooperation amongst Member States is even  more important.  In addition to cooperation between services within  the Member States, further investing in European  cooperation and information exchange efforts can play  an important role. Such efforts can facilitate effective  responses to cyber incidents, promote mutual learning  between Member States, and help tackle and coordinate  the issue of attribution.  Recommendation 12: Increased cooperation and  exchange of best practices and experiences between  the Member States and at EU-level can contribute  to strengthening cybersecurity across the EU,  including the cybersecurity of the election process.  Member States should also make use of the existing  frameworks and structures that are in place.

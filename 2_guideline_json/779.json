    "document(english)": "1  Introduction  This publication is designed to assist assessors validating the security posture of a cloud service in order to provide  organisations with independent assurance of security claims made by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). This publication  can also assist CSPs to offer secure cloud services.  An organisation’s cyber security team, cloud architects and business representatives should refer to the companion  document Cloud Computing Security for Tenants.  Cloud computing as defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-145, The  NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, offers organisations potential benefits such as improved business outcomes.  Mitigating the risks associated with using cloud services is a responsibility shared between the organisation (referred to  as the ‘tenant’) and the Cloud Service Provider, including their subcontractors (referred to as the ‘CSP’). However,  organisations are ultimately responsible for protecting their data and ensuring its confidentiality, integrity and  availability.  Organisations need to perform a risk assessment and implement associated mitigations before using cloud services.  Risks vary depending on factors such as the sensitivity and criticality of data to be stored or processed, how the cloud  service is implemented and managed, how the organisation intends to use the cloud service, and challenges associated  with the organisation performing timely incident detection and response. Organisations need to compare these risks  against an objective risk assessment of using in-house computer systems which might be poorly secured, have  inadequate availability or be unable to meet modern business requirements.  The scope of this publication covers Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a  Service (SaaS), provided by a CSP as part of a public cloud, community cloud and, to a lesser extent, a hybrid cloud or  outsourced private cloud.  This publication focuses on the use of cloud services for storing or processing sensitive and highly sensitive data. For  Commonwealth entities, and for the purposes of this publication, sensitive data is defined as OFFICIAL: Sensitive. Highly  sensitive data is defined as data classified as PROTECTED. Additionally, this publication can assist with mitigating risks to  the availability and integrity of non-sensitive data, defined for Commonwealth entities as unclassified publicly  releasable data. Mitigations are listed in no particular order of prioritisation.

Tenant’s data compromised in transit by malicious third party 4 - General Support and use ASD approved cryptographic controls to protect data in transit between the tenant and the CSP e.g. application layer TLS or IPsec VPN with approved algorithms, key length and key management.  5 - General Use ASD approved cryptographic controls to protect data in transit between the CSP’s data centres over insecure communication channels such as public internet infrastructure.  6 - General Support and use ASD approved cryptographic controls to protect data at rest on storage media in transit via post/courier between the tenant and the CSP when transferring data as part of on-boarding or off-boarding.  Tenant’s cloud service account credentials compromised by malicious third party2 3 4 5 7 - General Provide Identity and Access Management e.g. multi-factor authentication and account roles with varying privileges6 for the tenant to use and administer the cloud service via the CSP’s website control panel and API.  8 - General Support and use ASD approved cryptographic controls to protect credentials and administrative activity in transit when the tenant uses and administers the cloud service via the CSP’s website control panel and API.  9 - General Enable the tenant to download detailed time-synchronised logs and obtain real-time alerts generated for the tenant’s cloud service accounts used to access, and especially to administer, the cloud service.  Tenant’s data compromised by malicious CSP staff or malicious third party 10 - General Enable the tenant to download detailed time-synchronised logs and obtain real-time alerts generated by the cloud service used by the tenant e.g. operating system, web server and application logs.  11 - General Disclose the countries and legal jurisdictions where tenant data is (or will be in the coming months) stored, backed up, processed and accessed by CSP staff for troubleshooting, remote administration and customer support.  12 - General Perform background checks of CSP staff commensurate with their level of access to systems and data. Maintain security clearances for staff with access to highly sensitive data7.  13 - General Use physically secure data centres and offices that store tenant data or that can access tenant data8. Verify and record the identity of all staff and visitors. Escort visitors to mitigate them accessing data without authorisation.  14 - General Restrict CSP staff privileged access to systems and data based on their job tasks9. Require re-approval every three months for CSP staff requiring privileged access. Revoke access upon termination of CSP staff employment.  15 - General Promptly analyse logs of CSP staff actions that are logged to a secured and isolated log server. Implement separation of duties by requiring log analysis to be performed by CSP staff who have no other privileges or job roles.  16 - General Perform a due diligence review of suppliers before obtaining software, hardware or services, to assess the potential increase to the CSP’s security risk profile.  17 - General Use ASD approved cryptographic controls to protect highly sensitive data at rest. Sanitise storage media prior to repair, disposal, and tenant off-boarding with a non-disclosure agreement for data in residual backups.  Tenant’s data compromised by another malicious/compromised tenant10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 - General Implement multi-tenancy mechanisms to prevent the tenant’s data being accessed by other tenants. Isolate network traffic, storage, memory and computer processing. Sanitise storage media prior to its reuse.  Tenant’s data unavailable due to corruption, deletion19, or CSP terminating the account/service 19 - General Enable the tenant to perform up-to-date backups in a format that avoids CSP lock-in. If an account or cloud service is terminated, immediately notify the tenant and provide them with at least a month to download their data.  Tenant’s data unavailable or compromised due to CSP bankruptcy or other legal action 20 - General Contractually ensure that the tenant retains legal ownership of their data.  Cloud service unavailable due to CSP’s inadequate network connectivity 21 - General Support adequately high bandwidth, low latency, reliable network connectivity between the tenant and the cloud service to meet the claimed level of availability as required by the tenant.  Cloud service unavailable due to CSP error, planned outage, failed hardware or act of nature 22 - General Architect to meet the claimed level of availability as required by the tenant e.g. minimal single points of failure, clustering and load balancing, data replication, automated failover and real-time availability monitoring.  23 - General Develop and annually test a disaster recovery and business continuity plan to meet the claimed level of availability as required by the tenant, e.g. enacted for incidents that cause enduring loss of CSP staff or infrastructure.  Cloud service unavailable due to genuine spike in demand or bandwidth/CPU denial of service 24 - General Implement denial of service mitigations to meet the claimed level of availability as required by the tenant e.g. redundant high bandwidth external and internal network connectivity with traffic throttling and filtering.  25 - General Provide infrastructure capacity and responsive automated scaling to meet the claimed level of availability as required by the tenant.  Financial consequences of a genuine spike in demand or bandwidth/CPU denial of service 26 - General Enable the tenant to manage the cost of a genuine spike in demand or denial of service via contractual spending limits, real-time alerts, and configurable maximum limits for their use of the CSP’s infrastructure capacity.  CSP’s infrastructure compromised by malicious tenant or malicious third party 27 - General Use corporately approved and secured computers, jump servers, dedicated accounts, strong passphrases and multi-factor authentication, to provide customer support and administer cloud services and infrastructure.  28 - General Use ASD approved cryptographic controls to protect credentials and administrative activity in transit over insecure communication channels between the CSP’s data centre and CSP administrator / customer support staff.  29 - General Implement network segmentation and segregation20 between the internet, CSP infrastructure used by tenants, the network that the CSP uses to administer cloud services and infrastructure, and the CSP’s corporate LAN.  30 - General Utilise secure programming practices for software developed by the CSP21 22 23.  31 - General Perform secure configuration, ongoing vulnerability management, prompt patching, annual third party security reviews and penetration testing of cloud services and underlying infrastructure.  32 - General Train all CSP staff, especially administrators, on commencement of employment and annually, to protect tenant data, maintain cloud service availability, and proactively identify security incidents e.g. via prompt log analysis.  Most Effective Risk Mitigations Particularly Relevant to IaaS  Tenant’s Virtual Machine (VM) compromised by malicious third party24 1 - IaaS Provide network access controls enabling the tenant to implement network segmentation and segregation25, including a network filtering capability to disallow remote administration of their VMs except from their IP address.  2 - IaaS Provide the tenant with securely configured and patched VM template images. Avoid assigning a weak administrative passphrase to newly provisioned VMs.  Most Effective Risk Mitigations Particularly Relevant to PaaS  Tenant’s data compromised by malicious third party 1 - PaaS Harden and securely configure operating system, web server and platform software. Limit inbound and outbound network connectivity to only required ports/protocols. Promptly perform patching and log analysis.  Most Effective Risk Mitigations Particularly Relevant to SaaS  Tenant’s data compromised by malicious third party 1 - SaaS Implement security controls specific to the cloud service e.g. for email delivered as a service, provide features including content filtering with automated dynamic analysis of emails and email attachments.  2 - SaaS Implement general security controls26 e.g. limited inbound and outbound network connectivity to only required ports/protocols, antivirus software updated daily, intrusion prevention systems and prompt log analysis.  3  Further information  The Information Security Manual is a cyber security framework that organisations can apply to protect their systems  and data from cyber threats.

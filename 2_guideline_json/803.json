WATCH OUT FOR SCAMS  Cybercriminals use email, SMS, phone calls  and social media to trick you into opening  an attachment, visiting a website, revealing  account login details, revealing sensitive  information or transferring money or gift  cards. These messages are made to appear  as if they were sent from individuals or  organisations you think you know, or you  think you should trust.  To spot scam messages, stop and think:  Authority: Is the message claiming to be  from someone official?  Urgency: Are you told you have a limited  time to respond?  Emotion: Does the message make you  panic, fearful, hopeful or curious?  Scarcity: Is the message offering something  in short supply?  Current events: Is the message related to  current news stories, big events or specific  times of year (like tax reporting)?  To check if a message is legitimate:  Go back to something you can trust. Visit  the official website, log in to your account,  or phone their advertised phone number.  Don’t use the links or contact details in the  message you have been sent or given over  the phone.  Check to see if the official source has already  told you what they will never ask you.  For example, your bank may have told you  that they will never ask for your password.

Protecting the security of this information infrastructure is not easy. Often the information  infrastructure is run by several organisations and uses different types of information technology  from different companies. This report deals with the issue of how to enforce an adequate level of  security across a sector of service providers.  By way of response, we give an overview of 12 different audit frameworks or certification schemes  for auditing security measures, used in different settings and sectors, which are aimed at ensuring  that providers comply with certain security requirements.  In particular we look at the following audit frameworks and certification schemes:   ISO 27001   COBIT 5   Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)   NERC Reliability Standards   ISPS Code   HIPAA   Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)   Trust Services   PCI-DSS   BASEL II   BSI-IT Grundschutz   CESG  For each scheme we describe the overall setup and we depict the different entities and their roles in  assessing or certifying compliance to the security requirements. Some of these audit frameworks are  sector-specific and backed by specific legislation. Some large well-known frameworks (ISO27001 for  example) are not sector-specific and are adopted across sectors on a voluntary basis. In some  settings the auditing is delegated to auditors, and sometimes these auditors have to be licensed by  an authority. In other settings this delegation is absent or done by a governing authority overseeing  the overall scheme. In this paper we also introduce a single model that captures the most common  features.  We conclude with some general remarks about the listed audit frameworks:   Every scheme is different: Perhaps what is most striking about the different schemes is the  fact that they are all so different. In each scheme the actual auditing is delegated to third- party auditors, but the construction used is different every time. The optimal structure for  this kind of delegation depends on many factors, on the size and maturity of the sector, the  resources and skills of the government authority, whether or not there are well-functioning  industry initiatives, and so on.   Assessing certification authorities: The generic model in Section 4 shows the key processes  the involved authorities are executing or delegating: 1) auditing (what security measures are  checked and how), 2) licensing of auditors (what skills sets or exams are required), 3)  validation of monitoring tools (which scans or features are required), and 4) certification on  the security requirements (how audit reports and monitoring reports are assessed). A  governing authority could evaluate an auditing/certification authority by looking at these 4  key processes.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  iv   Continuous monitoring vs point-in-time assessment: Most of the frameworks are based  around periodic, point-in-time assessment of a provider or a service. In the IT industry, with  the rapid changes of technology and products, the effectiveness of a point-in-time  assessment might be limited – especially when considering online or cloud services that  change continuously.   Incident reporting: Whatever structure is used in the auditing scheme, the governing body  should have a way to make a cross-check to assess the overall effectiveness of the  framework in place, including the quality of the certification authority and the quality of the  auditors. An objective way of assessing the overall framework or any of the constituent  parts, is by looking at incident reports and/or independent test results.   Preventive auditing vs. post-incident investigations: In most certification and audit  frameworks the focus is on preventive and periodic audits. The goal of a preventive audit is  to check whether or not all the necessary security measures are in place. Post-incident  investigation is even more important, because it helps to understand the root cause of the  incident, what are the lessons learnt and what could have prevented the incident. This is  important to improve security and possibly the audit scheme itself too.   Compliance burden and entry barriers: The digital society is rapidly changing. New services  (cloud e.g.), new products (smartphones e.g.), new usage scenarios (smart grids e.g.) are  emerging continuously. An important goal of EU Member States and the European  commission is to foster innovation. It is important to take into account the effect of a high  compliance burden on smaller providers. Large (incumbent) providers have the resources  and (arguably) the need to set up advanced and sophisticated governance processes. In  general it is important to take into account the impact of legislation on innovation and  competition, and be particularly careful when obliging providers across a sector to submit to  a fixed set of audit requirements or partake in a specific audit framework.   Auditing vs certification: the scope of this document is limited to auditing frameworks and  the most common schemes that are used to conduct an audit against security measures.  Some of the auditing frameworks we describe below, have become certification  frameworks, meaning that the audit goes one step further and compliance can be certified.  This is the only meaning of certification in the context of this document.

For example, in the EU electronic communication providers must  take appropriate security measures under Article 13a of the Framework directive, and in the US  health care providers must take security measures under legislation called HIPAA (Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act). In different settings different approaches are taken: In some  settings compliance is mandated by law (for example, by national regulators under Article 13a), in  some settings compliance is voluntary (for example, for datacentres, ISO 27001 is often a matter of  choice), or mandated by an industry association (for example, the Payment Card Industry (PCI)  demands all payment processors to comply). In some settings the auditors are explicitly certified to  audit the security measures (for example, ISO 27001), while in other settings anyone can audit the  security measures (for example, HIPAA). This is just a taste of the different variations. In this  document we give an overview of different settings where there is a need to comply with security  measures to show the differences and similarities. Target audience  This paper is intended to provide background material for regulatory authorities, government  authorities, national ministries, and experts in the EU involved (in passive or active role) in  enforcing  compliance to security legislation/security measures across providers in a sector; i.e. national  regulatory authorities that need to audit the security measures proposed under Article13a,  governmental authorities that need to transpose into legislation these requirements et cetera.  Goal  There is a plethora of different frameworks and standards for IT security measures. We do not give  an exhaustive overview in this paper of all these different schemes, but we focus on schemes with  the following characteristics:  1. Wide adoption, possibly across sectors: We focus on security measures standard and  auditing frameworks which are widely adopted.  2. Related to critical sectors: We focus on critical sectors such as energy, government, health  care, finance, et cetera.  3. Different sectors, different approaches: The goal of this paper is to show different  approaches across different sectors. We do not go into the details of an auditing scheme if  similar to another scheme already discussed.  We stress that the goal of this paper is not to give an exhaustive overview of governance schemes.  Schemes or settings not addressed here are by no means inferior or less interesting topics for  discussion.  Structure of this document  The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the general problem these  auditing frameworks or certification schemes are trying to address. In Section 3 we derive a single  model with the entities and roles that are most common across the schemes. In the conclusions we  draw conclusions about the auditing schemes discussed in this paper.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  2  2 Information Security Governance  The need to enforce compliance to information security requirements across a group of providers  (businesses, government organisations, et cetera) is evident throughout different sector in society.  We gave examples in the introduction.  In this section we explain the general problem, by introducing a simple model in the diagram below  (Fig. 1).  Figure 1 Abstract model depicting the issue of governance of information security requirements  The model has three types of entities (providers, users, government authority):   Providers: Entities providing services to users (sometimes for a fee), ranging from equipment  vendors, to online service providers, outsourcing firms, consultancy firms, and e- government, et cetera. Providers can be subdivided in sectors (see the dashed box). A sector  is a subset of service providers which provide a specific set of services. For example, the  energy sector is a group of service providers providing power (electricity, usually).   Users: Entities consuming services provided by providers, including citizens, businesses,  organisations, government organisations - in a role of consumer of services.   Government authority: Entity set up or supported by law and/or with a legislative mandate  to address security incidents with an impact on society or users, ranging from government  bodies, governmental agencies, regulators, data-protection authorities, to non- governmental organizations, PPPs, or industry associations.  The government authority mandates (possibly sector-specific) security requirements which should  be implemented by providers1. The authority normally seeks evidence of compliance – i.e. that  security requirements are met. In practice the details of such a set-up are very different in different  settings. In this document we examine different settings to show these differences.  1  Users may still have further, stricter, requirements, which may be dealt with bilaterally in agreements  between provider and user.

Some audit frameworks have a legal or regulatory backing. Some  frameworks are voluntary, industry-led. Some audit frameworks are sector-specific, while others are  not.  We discuss and summarize the following audit frameworks:   ISO 27001   COBIT   Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)   NERC Reliability Standards   ISPS Code   HIPAA   Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)   Trust Services   PCI-DSS   BASEL II   BSI-IT Grundschutz   CESG  For each framework we provide a general introduction, we discuss the overall control and audit  framework, the roles of the different actors involved, and the enforcement mechanisms.  We would like to remark that although there are several audit frameworks, the content of these  frameworks is often similar. There have been initiatives to converge and align the different security  standards and audit frameworks. UCF is an example2.  3.1 ISO 27001  The ISO/IEC 27001:2005 3 , 4  is a well-known information security standard published by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 5  and the International Electro-technical  Commission (IEC)6. ISO27001 is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards .  Although ISO 27001  is not tied to a particular country's legislation, it is very popular among security practitioners  worldwide, and a number of countries have adopted localized variants of the ISO 27001 standard as  a primary source of recommended security controls (e.g. Revised Turnbull Guidelines on Internal  Control Oct 20057, Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 4360:1999 Risk Management8, etc.).  2 Among others: Unified Compliance Framework, http://www.unifiedcompliance.com  3 Full title is ISO/IEC 27001:2005 - Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security  management systems -- Requirements.  4  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42103  5  http://www.iso.org  6  http://www.iec.ch  7 http://www.frc.org.uk/documents/pagemanager/frc/Revised%20Turnbull%20Guidance%20October%202005.  pdf  8  http://www.standards.org.au  http://www.unifiedcompliance.com/ http://www.frc.org.uk/documents/pagemanager/frc/Revised%20Turnbull%20Guidance%20October%202005.pdf http://www.frc.org.uk/documents/pagemanager/frc/Revised%20Turnbull%20Guidance%20October%202005.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  4  3.1.1 ISO 27001 Framework  ISO 27001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,  reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System  (ISMS) within the context of the organization's overall business risks. The standard is designed to  ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect information assets  and give confidence to interested parties. It is accompanied by the ISO 27002 standard9 10, which  establishes guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving  information security management in an organization. Security measures are called controls. The  objectives of security measures are called control objectives. In a way, ISO 27001 is taxonomy of  possible controls, whereas ISO 27002 provides recommended practices for the implementation of  controls. While there is no formal requirement that the two aforementioned standards (ISO 27001 &  ISO 27002, respectively) must be used in conjunction, they are usually used together. The ISO 27001  standard can be used in a formal certification against the control objectives described.  It should be mentioned that ISO 27001 gives auditors a certain degree of freedom, in order to ensure  effective and efficient implementation of an ISMS according to the specific information security  requirements of the organization under question.  Below is depicted the overall set-up of ISO 27001  framework (Fig. 2).  National  Accreditation  Body  EC-Enterprise/ Industry  Certification  Body  Certification  Body  ISMS ISMS ISMS ISMS  accreditation  certification and audit  IRCA  certification of the  key auditor  ISO 2700x  Figure 2 ISO 27001 audit framework  3.1.2 ISO 27001 Roles  In order to ensure equally high standards of certification across Europe, the European Commission  for Enterprise and Industry set out a European-wide policy for accreditation11. This ensures  consistency in the accreditation market and is designed to protect the consumer. Accordingly, it is  mandatory for every European Member State to have a single National Accreditation Body (NAB).  Outside of Europe, there is not a set regulation – e.g., in the USA there are multiple Accreditation  9  Full name: Information technology -- Security techniques -- Code of practice for information security  management  10  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50297  11  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:218:0030:01:EN:HTML  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  5  Bodies (AB), whereas within Australasia there is the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New  Zealand12. For those countries without a designated National Accreditation Body, the International  Accreditation Forum13 lists member Accreditation Bodies that only accredit competent bodies,  providing buyer confidence; certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC  27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited Certification Body (CB) is functionally  equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC 27001 itself.  An ISMS may be certified compliant with ISO 27001 by a number of Certification Bodies worldwide,  which, in turn, must be accredited themselves by an International Accreditation Body for that  scheme (e.g. UKAS in the United Kingdom14).  The key personnel conducting the ISMS audit has also  to be accredited as ISMS Lead Auditor(s) from a NAB-accredited Certification Body, or the  International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA)15.  The Accreditation Bodies accredit the competent Certification Bodies according to various scopes of  ISMS accreditation1617; moreover, they perform periodic audits on Certification Bodies in order to  ensure conformance with the accreditation standards (e.g. in the case of UKAS, the accreditation is  confirmed on an annual basis by surveillance visits, with a full re-assessment every fourth year. In  addition, the first surveillance visit takes place 6 months after the Grant of Accreditation). Sanctions  to violators are immediately enforced18. More information about the accreditation process can be  found on the UKAS site19.  3.1.3 ISO 27001 Enforcement and Compliance  Certification Bodies with competent personnel re-assess the certified ISMS periodically, usually  yearly. Certification Bodies, in turn, are subject to compliance audits from their respective  Accreditation Bodies.  ISO 2700x is a horizontal, cross-sector family of information security standards and as such, they can  be used in a variety of cases. It has to be noted that the ISO 27001 standard itself provides a  structured way for auditing the implementation of the organization’s information security, and lists  an indicative pool of potential controls in a certain taxonomy (which may be extended by the  implementer in an ad-hoc basis, according to the security needs of the organization); the  responsibility of controls’ selection and, more importantly, the intensity of the selected controls lies  solely with the organization.  12  http://www.jas-anz.com.au/  13  http://www.iaf.nu/  14  http://www.ukas.com/default.asp  15

COBIT, originally ‘Control Objectives for Information and related Technology’ but used in acronym  only since 2009, was first released in 1996 by ISACA. The current version, COBIT 5, was published in  2012.  COBIT 5 helps enterprises create optimal value from information and related technology (IT)  for their stakeholders by maintaining a balance between realizing benefits and optimizing risk levels  and resource use. The framework addresses both business and IT functional areas across an  enterprise and considers the IT-related interests of internal and external stakeholders. Enterprises of  all sizes, whether commercial, not-for- profit or in the public sector, can benefit from COBIT 5.  3.2.1 COBIT Framework  COBIT is positioned as a high level framework, addressing the governance and management of  enterprise information and related technology (GEIT) and has been aligned and harmonized with  other, more detailed, IT standards and good practices such as COSO, TOGAF, ITIL, ISO 27000 series,  PMBOK, etc.  The framework is used as IT Governance best practice guidance in many cases, both at  government and private sector20.  COBIT 5 creates a single reference base for the governance and management of information and  technology through its five principles. It establishes seven critical areas (enablers) that are relevant  to all enterprises in the governance and management of information. Using COBIT helps enterprises  to prepare for current and future compliance requirements.  Infotrmation security governance and management is a key aspet of GEIT – failure to adequately  secure information and technology assets and resources destroys stakeholder value.  To support  information security professions in their use of COBIT 5, ISACA has published ‘COBIT 5 for  Information Security’  21  .  This publication takes COBIT 5 as the base reference framework and  provides guidance to help IT and security professionals understand, utilize, implement and direct  important information security-related activities, and make more informed decisions while  maintaining awareness about emerging technologies and the accompanying threats.  An appendix  relates the COBIT 5 for Information Security guidance to ISO/IEC 27001/2, ISF and NIST guidance.  Also in support of specific user aspects related to COBIT 5, other guide publications have been  produced by ISACA, including:   COBIT 5 Implementation22   COBIT 5 for Assurance 23   COBIT 5 for Risk24   COBIT 5: Enabling Processes25  20  http://www.isaca.org/About-ISACA/Press-room/Pages/COBIT-Fact-Sheet.aspx  21  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx  22  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Implementation-product-page.aspx  23  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Assurance-product-page.aspx  24  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Risk-product-page.aspx  25 http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Enabling-Processes-product-page.aspx  http://www.coso.org/ http://www.itil-officialsite.com/ http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Implementation-product-page.aspx http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Enabling-Processes-product-page.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  7  3.2.2 COBIT Enforcement and Compliance  COBIT 5 is an internationally accepted governance and management framework from ISACA26,  focussed on enterprise information and related technology assets and resources.  COBIT 5 helps  enterprises build bridges between stakeholder needs, business goals, IT related goals and enabler  goals by providing a common non-technical base of reference for business and IT professionals to  work with.  COBIT 5 focuses primarily on information and technology related business enablers thatupport the  achievement of business goals through efficient and effective IT-related arrangements. Referring to  Porter's Generic Business Model 27 , core business activities (e.g., procurement, operations,  marketing, sales) are discussed, as well as support activities (e.g., human resources, administration,  information technology). As a consequence, COBIT adddreses the use of information and related  technology across the whole enterprise, not only within the IT department.  3.3 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  In a report to the US congress28, the government notes that for US federal agencies, on average, IT  security spending amounts cover up to 16% of total IT spending. The same report notes that in 2010  US-CERT handled 107,439 incident reports, and that approximately 41,776 of those were incidents in  federal agencies.  FISMA was passed as Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347) in December 200229 and  sets high level security requirements. FISMA requires each federal agency to develop, document,  and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information systems  that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by  another agency, contractor, or other source. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are  developed by NIST and approved by the US Secretary of Commerce. Legislative basis for FIPS are the  Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106) and the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-347). FIPS standards are also used by  other organizations around the world30, as a best practice for security requirements, especially in  regulated industry sectors (such as financial and health-care institutions) that process Sensitive But  Unclassified (SBU) information. FIPS does not apply to national security systems (as defined in Title  III, Information Security, of FISMA).  Federal agencies must adhere to FIPS 200 which “specifies minimum security requirements for  federal information and information systems and a risk-based process for selecting the security  controls necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements.” In essence, the high level security  requirements mandated by FISMA are further specialized through FIPS and other more detailed  standards, such as NIST SCAP. The interested reader can find a description of the FIPS framework in  the appendix.  26  www.isaca.org  27  M.

A model of FIPS framework is illustrated below (Fig. 3).  31  Indicative documents: “FIPS PUB 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and  Information Systems, 2006#”, and “NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for  Federal Information Systems#”, as updated.  32  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips200/FIPS-200-final-march.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  9  Congress NIST  FISMA FIPS  developsissues sec req  legal basis  OMB  gives guidance  General  Inspector  Federal  agency II  Federal  agency I  report sec  status  report sec status  assessment  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  Figure 3 FISMA audit framework  3.3.2 FISMA Roles  The following organizations play a role in implementing FISMA.   The USA Congress establishes top-level security requirements for federal agencies and  support contractors in the FISMA legislation.   NIST develops the security standards and guidelines (called FIPS) for FISMA implementation,  including a risk-based approach for selecting, implementing, and assessing security controls  for federal information systems and for determining risk to organizational operations and  assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.   Agency heads, in coordination with their Chief Information Officers and Senior Agency  Information Security Officers report the security status of their information systems to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with annual FISMA reporting  guidance.   Inspectors General provide an independent assessment of the security status of federal  information systems, also reporting results to OMB annually.  3.3.3 FISMA Enforcement and Compliance  FISMA compliance is mandatory for federal agencies of the USA. To achieve compliance with the  NIST Standards and Guidelines, the common practice is to base the detailed description of each  system’s technical configuration on the NIST derived, Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP33)  format34. Moreover, the OMB has required, in July 31st, 2007 memorandum to Federal CIOs35, that  \"Information technology providers must use SCAP validated tools, as they become available, to  certify their products do not alter these configurations, and agencies must use these tools when  33  http://scap.nist.gov/  34  The relevant specification (“The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2”) is available at the NIST site  35  http://www.cio.gov/documents/FDCC_memo.pdf  http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  10  monitoring use of these configurations.\"36. SCAP deals mainly with the technical configurations of  certain technologies (operating systems, databases and active network components), while the  support for secure configuration at the application level is limited, due to the custom character of  the applications themselves.  In the federal agencies of the USA there is a trend towards the automation of security requirements,  and therefore promoting the standardization of technical configurations of the ICT systems37.  Requirements to establish mandatory configuration settings derive from the FISMA as implemented  by FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Security Control CM-6, Configuration Settings), and  OMB 38  Policy. Federal CIOs must deploy appropriate configuration settings on commercial  information technology products that compose their organizational information systems. These  products include, for example, mainframe computers, workstations, portable and mobile devices,  and network components.  3.3.4 FIPS 140  The FIPS 140 series establishes requirements and standards for cryptography modules that include  both hardware and software components. The use of validated cryptographic modules is required by  the United States Government for all unclassified uses of cryptography.  In order to use a cryptography module in a production environment, the module has to be  accompanied by a validation certificate issued by an accredited laboratory through the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), a joint effort by the NIST and the  Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). Moreover, as a prerequisite action the  algorithms themselves are tested via the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), with  the same setting and philosophy as in CMVP. All of the tests under the CAVP are handled by third- party laboratories that are accredited as Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories by  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Vendors interested in validation  testing of their algorithm implementation may select any of the accredited laboratories. A certificate  is valid for the lifetime of that version of the product.  Vendors of cryptographic modules use independent, accredited Cryptographic and Security Testing  (CST) laboratories to test their modules. The CST laboratories use the Derived Test Requirements  (DTR), Implementation Guidance (IG) and applicable CMVP programmatic guidance to test  cryptographic modules against the applicable standards. NIST's Computer Security Division (CSD) and  CSEC jointly serve as the Validation Authorities for the program, validating the test results and  issuing certificates.  Cryptographic modules that conform to FIPS 140 use approved security functions such as  cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic key management techniques, and authentication  techniques. Approved security functions include those that are either:   specified in a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS),   or adopted in a FIPS and specified either in an appendix to the FIPS or in a document  referenced by the FIPS, or   specified in the list of Approved security functions.  36  http://nvd.nist.gov/scapproducts.cfm  37  http://www.ca.com/~/media/Files/whitepapers/20-cscs-wp.pdf  38  For a NASA-related audit report, refer here: http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf  http://www.ca.com/~/media/Files/whitepapers/20-cscs-wp.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  11  The audit process of the FIPS 140 implementation on behalf of the accredited laboratories is defined  in the “NIST Handbook 150-xx” standard series; numerous managerial, organizational, procedural  and technical countermeasures are defined in the “NIST Handbook 150-xx” standard series (many of  them with specific metrics, such as probabilities of false positives occurrence). The complementary  NVLAP standard “NIST Handbook 150” provides detailed controls for ensuring the adequacy of a  laboratory practices throughout its whole life cycle.  3.4 NERC Reliability standards  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)39 is an international, independent, not- for-profit, self-regulatory organization, that aims to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system in  North America. In 2007, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)40 granted NERC the  legal authority to enforce reliability standards with all users, owners, and operators of the bulk  power system in the United States, and made compliance with those standards mandatory and  enforceable.  3.4.1 NERC Framework  Reliability standards are the planning and operating rules that electric utilities follow to ensure  reliable systems. NERC’s reliability standards development process has been accredited by the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  The first set of enforceable standards was filed with FERC in 2006. In 2007, FERC approved 83 of the  102 proposed standards. Those 83 standards became mandatory and enforceable in the U.S. on June  18, 2007. The remaining standards are still being reviewed by FERC. The U.S. Department of Energy  designated NERC as the electricity sector coordinator for critical infrastructure protection. NERC  serves as the Information Sharing and Analysis Center for the electricity sector. The NERC's security  initiatives are coordinated by the Critical Infrastructure Protection Committee (CIPC), which also  works closely with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Public Safety and Emergency  Preparedness Canada to ensure that the critical infrastructure protection functions so vital to the  industry are fully integrated and coordinated with the governments of the Unites States and Canada.  Regarding the ICT security measures defined, there are multiple standards developed for US NERC  (“Reliability Standards”), with a number of them addressing cyber security issues; complementary to  this, specific and detailed audit programs have been developed with the aim of ensuring compliance  with the aforesaid Reliability Standards (e.g. “CIP-005-3a — Cyber Security — Electronic Security  Perimeter(s)”, “COM-001-1.1 — Telecommunications”, etc. These standards and their respective  audit programs are in a process of continuous update, in cooperation with the DHS and FERC, among  others. The focus is on security objectives and not on the actual implementations of specific  technologies, but a FISMA-like approach may be adopted for specific technologies (i.e. checklists,  tools, SCAP, etc.).  The NERC control and audit framework is represented below (Fig 4).  39  http://www.nerc.com  40  FERC (http://www.ferc.gov/) is a federal agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity (as  well as natural gas and oil). FERC oversees NERC in the U.S.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  12  Parlianment  NERC  oversight  authority  reports on  compliance  Auditing  standards  Organization  Third  party  auditor  audits  au di  ts  issu es  opinion after audit  com ply w  ith  m ay assign audit  North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)  Figure 4 NERC audit framework  3.4.2 NERC Roles  All bulk power system owners, operators, and users must comply with approved NERC reliability  standards. These entities are required to register with NERC through the appropriate regional entity.  NERC's compliance efforts comprise three key activities:  1. Compliance monitoring is the process used to assess, investigate, evaluate, and audit in  order to measure compliance with NERC standards;  2. Compliance enforcement is the process by which NERC issues sanctions and ensures  mitigation of confirmed violations of mandatory NERC reliability standards;  3. Due Process provides registered entities the opportunity to contest any finding of a violation  of a NERC reliability standard. The process allows for hearings at the regional entity and  appeals before NERC.  NERC works with eight regional entities to improve the reliability of the bulk power system. These  entities account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a portion of  Baja California Norte, Mexico41.  Regional compliance implementation plans42 are the strategic plans for the annual compliance  monitoring and enforcement activities implemented by each to fulfil its responsibility to monitor  compliance with NERC reliability standards as specified by each region's delegation agreements. All  41  http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=1|9|119  42 http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=3|23|209  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  13  regional entities submit their annual plans to NERC for consideration by November 1 every year, at  which point NERC reviews and subsequently approves the regional annual implementation plan. As  part of its oversight, NERC conducts periodic audits of each regional program. Reports generated  from these activities can be found on the NERC site43.  3.4.3 NERC Enforcement and Compliance  In the USA44, NERC and the eight regional entities charged with compliance enforcement monitor  compliance via a number of methods, including regular and scheduled compliance audits, random  spot checks, and specific investigations as warranted by indications that a standard may have been  violated. NERC and the Regional Entities work closely with each user, owner, or operator to review  and monitor plans to resolve any reliability issues as quickly as possible.  As part of these efforts, NERC can also issue remedial action directives to immediately address and  deter new or further violation(s), irrespective of the presence or status (i.e. confirmed or alleged) of  a violation. Sanctioning of confirmed violations is determined pursuant to the NERC Sanction  Guidelines and is based heavily upon the Violation Risk Factors and Violation Severity Levels of the  standards requirements violated and the violations' duration. Entities found in violation of any  standard must submit a mitigation plan for approval by NERC and, once approved, must execute this  plan as submitted.  Especially for the audits relevant to cyber-security measures implementation, the regions have  brought in cyber security experts in dedicated compliance enforcement roles for the additional  workload brought about by CIP45. For 2012, 328 CIP audits are scheduled46, whereas for the 2011  period 244 analogous audits were scheduled47, which shows a raise of 34% regarding CIP audits  activity.  In 2011 NERC published the first Compliance Analysis Report48, in which it analyses the standards  that have experienced a high frequency of violations since June 18, 2007, after the relevant audits.  Among them, the CIP-004 (Personnel and Training), CIP-001 (Sabotage Reporting), CIP-006 (Physical  Security of Critical Cyber Assets) and CIP-007 (Systems Security Management) are analysed.  An important concept is the inclusion of third-party independent organizations which act as auditors  on behalf of the NERC; such an example exists for the Regional Entity “Midwest Reliability  Organization (MRO)”, for which the audit was performed by the private firm Crowe Horwath LLP49.  For this specific audit, and with respect to the purely ICT security measures in place, only the  Internal IT Security Policy and the Data Classification Procedure Manual of the organization were  reviewed.  43  http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=3|23|210  44  Similar practices are followed in other North American countries where NERC operates.  45  http://www.nerc.com/files/2010%20CMEP%20Annual%20Report_posted.pdf  46  http://www.nerc.com/files/2012%20PUBLIC%20Audit%20Schedule.xls  47  http://www.nerc.com/files/2011%20PUBLIC%20Audit%20Schedule%20POSTED%2009_28_11.xls  48  http://www.nerc.com/files/Organization%20Certifications1.pdf  49  http://www.nerc.com/files/MRO_AUP_Final_Report_20100408.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  14  3.5 International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code  The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code50 is an amendment to the Safety of Life  at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988)51 mandating for minimum security arrangements for ships,  ports and government agencies. ISPS is detailed in the Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS (”Special measures  to enhance maritime security”) and has come into force in July 2004, signed by 108 Contracting  Governments (“CGs”). Europe has adopted the International regulations with EC Regulation (EC) No  725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004, on enhancing ship and  port facility security.  ISPS prescribes responsibilities to governments, shipping companies, shipboard personnel, and  port/facility personnel to \"detect security threats and take preventative measures against security  incidents affecting ships or port facilities used in international trade.\"52. In essence, the code takes  the approach that ensuring the security of ships and port facilities is a risk management activity and  that, to determine what security measures are appropriate, an assessment of the risks must be  made in each particular case.  The purpose of the code is to provide a standardised, consistent framework for evaluating risk,  enabling governments to offset changes in threat with changes in vulnerability for ships and port  facilities through determination of appropriate security levels and corresponding security measures.  The code (which does not refer to warships, naval auxiliaries or other ships owned or operated by a  Contracting Government and used only on Government non-commercial service), has a serious  impact on insurance rates.  3.5.1 ISPS Framework  The ISPS code is comprised of two parts: Part A is mandatory, describing minimum requirements for  security of ships and ports, while Part B provides implementation guidelines. The ISPS Code applies  to ships on international voyages (incl. passenger ships, cargo ships of 500 GT and upwards, and  mobile offshore drilling units) and the port facilities serving such ships. The code gives flexibility to  governments towards applying the code provisions even to port facilities that are used only  occasionally for international voyages; moreover, the extent of code application to the selected  ports lies solely with the governments. In a nutshell, the national governments are free to select the  port facilities and the intensity of the applied measures according to a security assessment carried  out as described in the code. Below is visualised the ISPS audit framework (Fig. 5).  50  http://www.imo.org/blast/mainframe.asp?topic_id=583&doc_id=2689  51  http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Safety- of-Life-at-Sea-%28SOLAS%29,-1974.aspx  52  ISPS Code, Part A, 1.2.1  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  15  Contracting Government/ administration  lim ite  d au th  orit y  dele ga  tio n  Recognised  Security  Organization  (RSO)  Designated  Authority (DA)  full authority  delegation  Ship/Port  Facility  Ship/Port  Facility  Ship/Port  Facility  co m  p lia  n ce  p  re p  ar at  io n  a ct  iv it  ie s  verificatio n  / certificatio  n  activities  verification/  certification activities  co m  plia nce  pre par  at io  n ac tiv  iti es  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code  re po  rt report  Figure 5 ISPS audit framework  Moreover, the code provides for three (3) security Levels, corresponding to a normal, heightened  and exceptional threat situations enacted by the Contracting Governments as follows:   Security level 1 means the level for which minimum appropriate protective security  measures shall be maintained at all times.   Security level 2 means the level for which appropriate additional protective security  measures shall be maintained for a period of time as a result of heightened risk of a security  incident.   Security level 3 means the level for which further specific protective security measures shall  be maintained for a limited period of time when a security incident is probable or imminent,  although it may not be possible to identify the specific target.  Because each ship (or class of ship) and each port facility present different risks, the method in  which they will meet the specific requirements of this Code will be determined and eventually be  approved by the Administration (i.e. flag state) or Contracting Government, as the case may be. In  that respect, the measures are defined in a generic form of security requirements while their correct  enforcement lies with the responsible party.  3.5.2 ISPS Roles  The ISPS Code is part of SOLAS, so compliance is mandatory for the 148 Contracting Parties to  SOLAS. In terms of the ISPS Code, the Contracting Governments have various responsibilities,  including:   Setting the security level;   Approving SSPs and any amendments to a previously approved plan;   Verifying compliance of ships with the provisions of the regulation;  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  16   Issuing the relevant International Ship Security Certificates (ISSC);   Determining which port facilities located within their territory are required to designate and  train a Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO);   Ensuring completion and approval of the port facility security assessment (PFSA) and port  facility security plan (PFSP) or any subsequent PFSP amendment;   Issuing statements of compliance for port facilities;   Exercising control and compliance measures over ships.  Regarding the responsibilities of the Company and the Ship, shipping companies are required to:   Designate and train a CSO (at least one per company) and to have in place designated and  trained SSOs for each of their ships;   Approval of each SSP is normally by the administration (flag state). Thereafter, the SSP is  used on board the ship with responsibility falling onto the SSO for successful  implementation;   While the setting of a security level is solely the responsibility of a contracting government, a  Master or SSO can enhance the security measures that are in place on board the ship at any  time (e.g. when the vessel is sailing through an area of increased vulnerability);   The training of the ship’s crew in terms of security practices linked to the SSP, as well for  ensuring proper security-related records are maintained and that any security equipment  used on board the ship is functioning properly;   Ships after the issuance of the ISSC by their administration, must maintain documentary  evidence of continued compliance with the legislation.  Finally, the responsibilities of the Port Facility are as follows:   The PFSO prepares and implements a suitable PFSP, ensuring the port always operates at  security level 1, and the additional measures / possible preparatory actions are in place to  operate at security levels 2 and 3, if necessary.   The PFSO is responsible for the training of port staff in terms of the PFSP procedures and the  carrying out of regular security related drills and exercises, as well as for the proper security- related records and maintenance.  3.5.3 ISPS Enforcement and Compliance  Involved entities are bound to code provisions from July 1st, 2004. Towards ensuring the proper  measures taken, the Contracting Government is responsible for communicating security-related  information to the International Maritime Organization and to the shipping and port industries. In  order to communicate the security threat to a port facility or a ship, the contracting government will  firstly set the appropriate security level based on its assessment of all available current security  intelligence. Whilst they can, if appropriate, designate or establish “Designated Authorities” (“DA”)  within government to undertake some of its’ security duties and allow Recognised Security  Organisations (RSOs)53 to carry out certain aspects of this work54, the final responsibility for the ISPS  code remains with the CG.  The initial security assessments (SSAs, PFSAs) can be delegated to a DA or a RSO, while the final PFSA  approval has to be approved by the contracting government or the designated authority concerned.  53  Competent organizations to perform certain tasks of the regulation, according to section 4.5, pg. 36 of the  Code.  54  Important exceptions (including setting of the security level), are detailed in the section 4.3, pg.7 of the  Code.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  17  Port Facility Security Assessments are periodically reviewed. With respect to the effectiveness of the  SSP / PFSP or the relevant amendments, these can, in the extent they consider appropriate, test the  effectiveness of the SSP / PFSP or the relevant amendments.  Testing can be performed by the contracting government, a designated authority or a recognised  security organisation. Finally, certain other tasks (such as assistance towards performing a PFSA,  verification and certification of compliance of ships with the requirements of the code, etc.) can be  assigned to an RSO. Typically, every contracting government creates a national recognised security  organisation registry after a relevant bid; thereafter, the eligible RSOs may be assigned certain tasks,  as prescribed by the code. Conflict of interest issues apply (e.g. an RSO should not be authorized to  evaluate a PFSP which has been developed by this specific RSO).  3.6 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  The USA’s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191,  mandates the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt and enforce national standards  for electronic health care transactions, health identifiers, security and privacy (Part 164).  The HIPAA evaluation standard (§ 164.308(a)(8)) also requires covered entities to perform a periodic  (technical and non-technical) evaluation to assess if security policies and procedures meet the  security requirements. This evaluation can be performed internally or by a third-party auditor.  3.6.1 HIPAA Framework  HIPAA defines security standards in the Subpart C, where privacy standards are defined in  the  Subpart E. Implementation specifications are ”Required” (mandatory) or “Addressable”  (optional) for “covered” (i.e. involved)  entities. The HIPAA security and privacy provisions are  expressed in a generic manner, independent of technology or specific implementations and cover  managerial, policy, organizational, procedural and technical aspects55. The organisations that have to  comply to HIPAA (‘covered entities’) are free to use whatever means they deem appropriate  according to the nature of their business, e.g. organisational structures, technical checklists for  hardening their IT systems, etc. The HIPPA overall set-up is shown in the following diagram (Fig. 6).  55 http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/index.html  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  18  US Congress  HHS (OCR)  Auditor  Hospital Hospital  HIPAA bill  Auditor  Hospital Hospital  Spot checks  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Figure 6 HIPAA audit framework  3.6.2 HIPAA Roles  HHS, and in particular the HHS’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is responsible for the enforcement of  HIPAA to the covered entities. HIPAA, with its (potentially) high penalties for non-compliance, has  led to a niche market specialized in HIPAA readiness.  3.6.3 HIPAA Enforcement and Compliance  HHS enforces the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules in several ways:   by investigating complaints;   by imposing financial sanctions;   by conducting compliance reviews to determine if covered entities are in compliance; and   by giving education to promote compliance with HIPAA  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act56 of 2009, in Section 13411 of the HITECH Act,  requires HHS to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and business associates are  complying with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and Breach Notification standards.  To  implement this mandate, Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is piloting a program to perform up to 150  audits of covered entities to assess privacy and security compliance.  Until recently HHS has limited its efforts to educating about HIPAA and dealing with complaints. To  reassess HIPAA effectiveness and efficiency (and mandated by Section 13411 of the HITECH Act), an  HHS audit program was started in late 2011 to asses compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security  Rules and Breach Notification standards.  56  http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr1enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr1enr.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  19  3.7 Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  The USA Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX)57 was adopted in 2002 to protect investors from fraudulent  accounting activities by businesses. SOX mandates strict reforms to improve financial disclosures  from corporations and prevent accounting fraud. SOX was adopted in response to the accounting  scandals in the early 2000s at Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom, to name a few.  All public companies  listed in New York Security Exchange (NY SEC) are bound to SOX Act58.  The key provisions of the SOX Act are:  1. Section 302: requires management to certify the accuracy of the reported financial  statement;  2. Section 404: requires that management and auditors establish internal controls and  reporting methods on the adequacy of those controls. Section 404 had very costly  implications for publicly traded companies as it is expensive to establish and maintain the  internal controls.  SOX 404 describes in a generic manner the recommended security measures, and focuses on the  desired outcome of the security measures. This approach aims to give flexibility to organisations to  implement appropriate security measures but it also left room for interpretation by auditors which  led to excessive compliance costs for organisations especially during the early years of the SOX  introduction. Often the security measures are a subset of COBIT and ISO 27002, with customized  security measures for this setting.  3.7.1 SOX Framework  Compliance to SOX is checked by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)59, which  is a non-profit organisation established by the US Congress for this purpose. The NY SEC has  oversight authority over the PCAOB.  The role of PCAOB is twofold:  1. PCAOB sets the general framework for accounting/audit firms (“registered firms”) who can  perform SOX 404 audits.  2. PCAOB audits in a periodic, risk-based manner the registered firms for proper practices.  The SOX control and audit framework is depicted below (Fig. 7).  57  http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/content-detail.htm  58  http://pcaobus.org/Information/Pages/PublicCompanies.aspx  59 http://pcaobus.org/About/Pages/default.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  20  NYSEC  Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board(PCAOB)  oversight  authority  reports of  registered firms  Auditor  audits  periodically  opinion after  audit  Auditor  iss ues  compliance with  organization  au d  its  Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  Figure 7 SOX audit framework  3.7.2 SOX Roles  There are three parties involved in checking compliance to SOX:   An accounting/audit firm (a ‘registered firm’) audits an organisation and issues an opinion  about the compliance of the organisation to SOX (usually through an integrated audit). This  opinion is then disclosed to the PCAOB and the SEC.   The PCAOB audits the effectiveness (primarily) and efficiency (secondary) of the  implementation of SOX, by checking organisations that have to comply to SOX and firms that  can perform SOX audits. PCAOB reports to the SEC and to certain state regulatory  authorities.   The SEC has oversight authority over the PCAOB, including the approval of PCAOB’s rules,  standards, and budget.  3.7.3 SOX Enforcement and Compliance  SOX 404 enforcement is split into the following parts:   Accounting/audit firms perform SOX 404 audits (usually as part of an integrated audit, i.e. in  conjunction with a financial statements audit).   The PCAOB inspects accounting/audit firms (‘registered firms’) for the purpose of assessing  compliance with laws, rules, and professional standards on auditing. PCAOB conducts  regular, periodic inspections of hundreds of firms60 PCAOB can impose severe sanctions to  both registered firms and individuals in case of SOX violations. SOX requires the PCAOB to  adopt a risk-based approach (annual inspections for firms audit reports for more than 100  60  http://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Pages/InspectedFirms.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  21  businesses, and at least triennially for smaller firms). In 2011, 10 registered firms were  audited annually.   PCAOB reports about these audits to the SEC and to certain state regulatory authorities.  PCAOB makes only portions of these reports available to the public61.  3.8 Trust Services  Trust Services is a framework of assurance and audit services, to address security and privacy risks –  mainly focussed on online service providers. The criteria and principles underlying Trust Services are  set by AICPA62. These criteria are used by auditors providing attestation services on systems in the  subject matters of security, availability, processing integrity, privacy, confidentiality, and certification  authorities63. The current version of Trust Services reflects application in the USA as reflected by the  references to the AICPA’s attestation section AT 101, I (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1). For  international issuers of WebTrust and SysTrust reports, practitioners may also refer to international  or domestic professional standards that are equivalent to AT 101.  SysTrust and WebTrust require accountants to conduct an independent examination that carries the  professional equivalency of a financial statement audit; the attestation and advisory services based  on Trust Services are discussed in the next section.  3.8.1 Trust Services Framework  The Trust Services framework has three types of assurances: examination, review, and agreed-upon  procedures engagements. In examination and review engagements, the auditor expresses an  opinion, for example, about whether there is the controls of a system were operating effectively to  meet the criteria for systems reliability. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner  does not express an opinion but rather performs an audit following agreed-up-on procedures, and  reports the findings. Attestation services are developed in accordance with AT section 101, Attest  Engagements (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1)64.  The following diagram shows the Trust  Service audit model (Fig. 8).  61  Note that in the latest (Jan. 2012) submission of the PCAOB performance review to the US SEC (“Review of  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Enforcement and Investigations Program”) reported that “...  the most significant issue facing the board’s enforcement program and its ability to effectively protect  investors was the statute-mandated non-public nature of disciplinary proceedings.”  62  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (http://www.aicpa.org)  63  The latest version can be found at http://www.webtrust.org/item27806.doc.  64  Trust Services Principles, criteria, and illustrations (2009)  http://www.webtrust.org/item27806.doc  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  22  AICPA Assurance  Service Executive  Committee  develops  Public Accounting  Firms  Trust services  (principles,  criteria,  illustrations)  is su  es  Licenced  auditor (CPA,  CA, etc)  Management  assertions  Organization  attests on  plans audits in  adherence with  reports on MA  Trust Services  Figure 8 Trust Services audit framework  The guidance on Trust Services sets out principles, which are broad statements of objectives, and  specific criteria that should be achieved to meet each principle. The Trust Services principles and  criteria are supported by a list of illustrative controls that, if operating effectively, enable a system to  meet the criteria. These illustrations are not intended to be all-inclusive and are presented as  examples only. The practitioner should identify and assess the relevant controls that the client has in  place.  3.8.2 Trust Services Roles  AICPA, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is responsible for review, assessment  and approval of the Trust Services on a periodic basis (the latest version is that of 2009. Audits  against the Trust Services criteria can only be done by licensed auditors (Certified Public  Accountants/CPAs, Chartered Accountants/CAs, or equivalent accounting professionals). Auditors  licensed65 to perform SysTrust and WebTrust services provide a report that gives assurance attesting  to an entity's compliance with the Trust Services Principles and Criteria. In case of a WebTrust  attestation, licensed auditors can provide a WebTrust seal that can be displayed on the client's web  site.  3.8.3 Trust Services Enforcement and Compliance  Trust Services attestation is professionally equivalent with a financial statement audit attestation.  Commercial agreements and partnerships often require a Trust Services attestation from an  independent auditor. For example, the inclusion of a vendor’s digital certificates in the Mozilla  project Root CA store66 and Microsoft Windows Root Certificate Program67, requires the vendor to  undergo some kind of audit: WebTrust for CAs, WebTrust EV are common options. Another common  option is an ETSI compliance report.  65  http://www.webtrust.org/homepage-documents/item27834.aspx  66  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/  67  http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1760.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  23  3.9 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)  The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)68, is a security standard for the  payment card industry. PCI DSS is developed and management by the PCI Security Standards Council  (PCI SSC) This council was set up by a number of large payment card brands (American Express,  Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard, Visa) to strengthen security controls  around cardholder data towards reducing credit card fraud, and, finally, enhance trust on electronic  payments.  PCI DSS contains technical and operational requirements (‘control objectives’) set by the PCI Security  Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect ‘cardholder data’. The PCI-DSS standard itself is comprised of  12 generic information security principles and it covers technical and operational system  components used for the processing of cardholder data. The PCI DSS standard includes security  measures which are technology-independent. PCI DSS also provides references to state-of-the-art  technologies and best practices used in the payment industry.  3.9.1 PCI-DSS Framework  PCI-DSS applies to all organisations that store, process or transmit cardholder data. PCI DSS gives  guidance to software developers and manufacturers of applications and devices used in payment  transactions. The overall process is overseen by the PCI Council. Especially regarding the operational  aspect, the Council manages programs that will help facilitate the assessment of compliance with PCI  DSS. They certify auditors, called Qualified Security Assessors (QSA) and vendors, called Approved  Scanning Vendor (ASV). Normally assessed entities have to provide annually two formally structured  documents: a) a Report On Compliance (ROC69) and b) an Attestation of Compliance for Service  Providers or Merchants 70 , both according to each payment brand’s respective reporting  requirements to ensure each payment brand acknowledges the entity’s compliance status. The ROC  guidance in the PCI DSS provides for a general template structure of the report document, regarding  content and format; certain reporting requirements may be imposed by the specific programmes of  payment brands71.  Below we depict the PCI-DSS framework (Fig. 9).  68  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?document=pci_dss_v2- 0#pci_dss_v2-0  69  Please refer to the VISA Levels/Tiers of merchants and the VISA requirements for reporting here:  http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp_merchants.html where ROC is mandatory for VISA  Level 1 merchants  70  See http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp_service_providers.html for the VISA case  71  See \"Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures Version 2.0 October 2010\", section \"Instructions  and Content for Report on Compliance\", pg. 14.

Merchants and  service providers must prove compliance and report their compliance status annually to the  payment card brand they work with. So while the PCI Security Standards Council sets the  standards, merchants and service providers participating in certain payment schemes have  to comply with the requirements of their partners.   The PCI Security Standards Council is responsible for managing the security standards  lifecycle (including the amending process, member consultation, setup of working groups  etc), while compliance with the PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of  the Council. QSAs are approved by the PCI Security Standards Council to assess compliance  with PCI DSS. QSA’s have unlimited liability, as imposed an agreement between the PCI  Security Standards Council and the prospective QSAs, and this has led to a number of  organisations abandoning their nomination as QSAs, to avoid the high risks related to  indemnifications in case of a damage or loss incurred during or after security assessment.  The process of becoming (and be maintained as) a qualified approved security company  (QSA, ASV, etc) is rigorous, towards ensuring the quality of the security checks at the highest  level possible72 and the PCI Security Standards Council mandates annual reassessment.   ASVs are approved by the PCI Security Standards council to perform vulnerability scans of  Internet-facing systems of merchants and service providers.  72  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?category=validation  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  25  Finally, for smaller companies in the payment card industry that fall under PCI DSS mandate there is  a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (PCI DSS SAQ), which can be used by merchants and service  providers that are not required to undergo an on-site assessment per the PCI DSS Security  Assessment Procedures. Banks who do transaction with these smaller companies may ask the  company to share the results of the PCI DSS self-assessment73 .  3.9.3 PCI-DSS Enforcement and Compliance  Enforcement of compliance with the PCI DSS and determination of any non-compliance penalties are  carried out by the individual payment card brands and not by the PCI Security Standards council.  Operational issues regarding compliance by involved entities are directed to the payment brands  themselves.  Every assessed entity has to submit to payment card brands the details about annual assessments by  a QSA, and details about the quarterly security scans carried out by an ASV. Assessment reports are  considered non-compliant if these reports contains “open items”, or items that will be finished at a  future date. The merchant/service provider must address these items before being able to complete  validation. After open items are addressed by the merchant/service provider, the assessor will then  reassess to validate that the remediation occurred and that all requirements are satisfied. After  revalidation, the assessor will issue a new Report on Compliance, verifying that the cardholder data  environment is fully compliant, and submit it consistent with instructions. The complete procedure  and supporting material is available on the PCI SSC website (www.pcisecuritystandards.org).  Regarding the eligibility of approved security companies74 to provide PCI-DSS compliance audits,  their nomination may be redrawn, even immediately, in case of failure to meet the PCI SSC  requirements. In case of an incident to an assessed entity, the relevant procedures of individual  payment brands are applied. For example the procedures used by VISA75 76) contain detailed  instructions and strict deadlines about alerts of involved parties, reports of compromise,  independent forensic investigations, and so on.  3.10 Basel Accords (BASEL) II  Basel II is the second of the Basel Capital Accords77, (now extended and effectively superseded by  Basel III), which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision78 (“Committee”). BASEL II builds on an evolving framework for  managing risk in financial services transactions. In contrast to the First Capital Accord of 1988,  information risk and information technology (IT) have become decisive factors in shaping modern  business, and many financial services organizations have undergone a fundamental transformation  in terms of IT infrastructures, applications and IT-related internal controls79.  73  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/self_assessment_form.php  74  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/  75  http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_what_to_do_if_compromised.pdf  76  http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_responding_to_a_data_breach.pdf  77  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords  78  http://www.bis.org/bcbs/about.htm?ql=1  79  ITGI, 2007, IT Control Objectives for Basel II, the Importance of Governance and Risk Management for  Compliance  http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/ https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/ http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_what_to_do_if_compromised.pdf http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_responding_to_a_data_breach.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords http://www.bis.org/bcbs/about.htm?ql=1  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  26  While the committee is not a legal entity and BASEL II is not a regulation per se, they heavily  influence the financial organizations around the globe; BASEL II has been transposed (in various  forms and degrees of compliance, either as a national law or secondary legislation issued by a  national bank.  Basel II uses a \"three pillars\" concept, as follows:  1. Minimum Capital Requirements (addressing risk),  2. Supervisory Review and  3. Market Discipline.  Of particular interest is the operational risk (Pillar 2), which is defined as “the risk of direct or indirect  loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external  events”80 and it is closely relates with ICT-security controls implementation. Below we focus on how  BASEL II manages operational risks.  3.10.1 BASEL II Framework  In BASEL II operational risks are calculated and dealt with using customized methods, specific for  financial institutions81, but the overall approach is similar to IT risk management frameworks.  Measures to mitigate risks are technology-dependent, meaning that the financial institution has the  freedom to implement controls objectives in a suitable way. The usual approach is to adopt a  structured approach such as ISO 27001/2 or COBIT.  BIS (Bank for International Settlements (among other organizations) has issued a number of  guidance documents such as the “Operational Risk Consultative Document” (2001),  “Implementation of Basel II: Practical Considerations” (2004)82, “Enhancing corporate governance for  banking organisations” (2006)83, etc. It is important to note that only control requirements are  discussed, while no focus on specific technologies or implementations is given. The BASEL II audit  framework is shown below (Fig. 10).  80  BIS, 2001, Operational Risk Consultative Document, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf  81  BIS, 2001, Operational Risk Consultative Document, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf  82  http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs109.htm  83  http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs122.pdf  http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  27  BASEL Committee  supervised by  BASSEL II  issues  NCB  Financial  Body I  Financial  Body II  issues penalties  send report send re  port  Basel Accords (BASEL) II  Figure 10 BASEL II audit framework  3.10.2 BASEL II Roles  The supervision of BASEL II is carried out by the national financial sector supervisor, typically  National Central Banks (NCBs). The supervised entities (financial institutions) are required to report  to national supervisors periodically. Article 156 of the EU Directive on Capital Requirements requires  the European Commission to periodically monitor whether the directive has significant effects on  the economic cycle. In the light of the examination, the Commission has to submit a bi-annual report  together with any appropriate remedial measures to the European Parliament and to the European  Council. National reporting to the Commission is the responsibility of the national supervisor. The  first report has been issued in 201084.  3.10.3 BASEL II Enforcement and Compliance  In each country where BASEL II is used, the national supervisor has the right to impose on supervised  entities appropriate administrative penalties, as provided for by the applicable legislation on credit  institutions, in case of violation of legal and regulatory provisions concerning the conduct of their  activities or the obstruction of supervisory control. These penalties may be imposed in conjunction  with other administrative penalties and corrective measures, pursuant to applicable laws.  As discussed above, BASEL II is adopted by the major financial institutions around the world. For the  EU the European Banking Association site85 gives an overview of related laws, regulations, and  administrative rules and provides guidance on regulation and supervision.  84  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/docs/regcapital/monitoring/23062010_report_en.pdf  85  http://www.eba.europa.eu/Supervisory-Disclosure.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  28  3.11 Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) - Federal  Office for Information Security  The Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) focuses on information security in  public authorities. The BSI Standards contain recommendations by BSI on methods, processes,  procedures, approaches and measures relating to information security. The BSI certifies information  domains86.  3.11.1 BSI Framework  The IT-Grundschutz standard is the BSI's best known publication on information security. It was  published in 1994 and updated in 2005. IT-Grundschutz is a standard for establishing and  maintaining an appropriate level of protection for all information assets in an organisation, and  provides a methodology for management of information security.  The BSI certification involves auditing of the information security management system as well as  auditing of the specific information security measures on the basis of IT-Grundschutz. The BSI  certification always includes an official ISO certification in accordance with ISO 27001 but, due to the  additionally audited technical aspects, is more comprehensive than only ISO certification.  The aim of IT-Grundschutz is to achieve an appropriate level of security for all types of information  of an organization. IT-Grundschutz focuses on the protection of business-related information, which  has normal security requirements. IT-Grundschutz may be useful also for IT systems and applications  with high security requirements. We explain the different IT Grundschutz standards in more detail in  an annex to this section.  3.11.2 BSI Roles  The BSI framework and the different roles are depicted below (Fig. 11). BSI defines standards,  accredits certification authorities for the issuance of certificates, and licenses auditors. Licensed  auditors can perform an audit, and the audit report is used by a certification authority to issue a  certificate of compliance. The certificate can be used by the provider to show customers that it  implements security measures according to BSI’s IT Grundschutz standards.  To become a licensed auditor, auditors have to prove they have the appropriate technical  background and expertise by providing evidence of more than two years of professional experience  in the area of IT security and experience in three projects relating to IT-Grundschutz. Candidates  must attend a training course and an exam to obtain a license. The licence is valid for a period of five  years.  During this period BSI organizes events for the exchange of experiences between auditors so  as to ensure the uniformity of audits and improve the overall scheme. The license of an auditor can  be revoked if the auditor fails to participate in these events or if an auditor negligently contravenes  the framework.  86  Information domains are defined as “the interaction between infrastructural, organisational, personnel and  technical components that enable business processes and tasks to be performed”  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  29  accreditation  checks  implements  licences  au d  it  o  u tc  o m  e  Auditor  Provider  BSI  Standards  defines  BSI  100-1  BSI  100-2  BSI  100-3  BSI  100-4  Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  Federal German  Government  implements  BSI Certification  authority  Figure 11 BSI-IT Grundschutz audit framework  3.11.3 BSI Enforcement and Compliance  The BSI standards recommend a standardised set of security measures for IT systems. The purpose  of these standards is to achieve a baseline of security which is reasonable and adequate to satisfy  basic security requirements. The standards could also be used for IT assets with higher security  requirements.  The BSI is implemented mostly on a voluntary basis. Compliance with the IT-Grundschutz standards  is optional. BSI also provides a subscription service, which provides registered users with news and  updates about IT-Grundschutz and IT security topics. Registered users also participate in user  surveys which are used by BSI to improve the methodology and standards. Numerous companies  and public agencies use IT-Grundschutz Catalogues as the basis for their security measures.  3.11.4  BSI Standards  The BSI IT Grundschutz standard consists of 5 parts.   BSI Standard 100-1 Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)   BSI-Standard 100-2: IT-Grundschutz Methodology   BSI-Standard 100-3: Risk Analysis based on IT-Grundschutz   BSI-Standard 100-4: Business Continuity Management   IT-Grundschutz Catalogues  In this part we go over them in more detail.   BSI Standard 100-1 Information Security Management Systems (ISMS): The BSI standard  100-1 Information Security Management Systems defines the general requirements of an  ISMS and describes how an ISMS could be implemented. It is based on the ISO 27001 and  27002 standards. The BSI Standard 100-1 provides readers with an easy to understand and  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  30  systematic instruction manual, providing a brief and clear overview of the most important  tasks of security management. The standard can be used irrespective of the precise ISMS an  organization wants to use to implement.   BSI Standard 100-2 IT-Grundschutz Methodology: The IT-Grundschutz Methodology (BSI  standard 100-2) shows how a management system for information security can be  developed and operated in practice. The IT-Grundschutz Methodology explains in detail how  a policy for information security can be developed, which information security measures can  be selected and what are pitfalls when implementing the information security policies.   BSI Standard 100-3 Risk Analysis based on IT-Grundschutz: The BSI standard “Risk Analysis  based on IT-Grundschutz” (BSI standard 100-3) outlines a methodology for determining  assets that should be protected and how to perform a risk assessment. The standard uses  the threats specified in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogue. It presents a method for performing a  risk analysis that is optimised for use with the IT-Grundschutz methodology. The BSI has  worked out a methodology for risk analysis on the basis of IT-Grundschutz. This approach  can be used when companies or public agencies are already working successfully with IT- Grundschutz and would like to add an additional security analysis to the IT-Grundschutz  analysis as seamlessly as possible.   BSI-Standard 100-4: Business Continuity Management: The BSI Standard 100-4 explains a  method for establishing and maintaining business continuity processes. The focus is on  threats which could severely impact an organization (natural disasters for example) and on  security measures to protect from those threats. The standard can be used by any  organization (large or small). It is based on the previously mentioned BSI standards but it can  also be used stand-alone.   IT-Grundschutz Catalogues: Since 2005 the IT-Grundschutz Manual is called IT-Grundschutz  Catalogues. The IT Grundschutz catalogue provides an overview and a categorization of  different threats. The IT-Grundschutz Catalogues describe the standard security measures in  detail, including:  o Standard security measures for typical IT systems with \"normal\" protection  requirements  o A description of the threat scenario which is globally assumed  o Detailed descriptions of measures to assist with their implementation  o A description of the process involved in attaining and maintaining an appropriate  level of IT security  o A simple methodology for ascertaining the level of IT security attained by comparing  the target with the actual system status.  3.12 CESG: Communications Electronics Security Group  CESG is the UK’s national technical authority for information assurance (IA). Information Assurance is  defined (by CESG) as obtaining confidence that information systems will protect the information  they process, that they function as they need to, and when they need to, under control by legitimate  users.  CESG aims to protect the vital interests of the UK by providing advice and assistance on the security  of communications and electronic data. CESG focusses on training people, such as auditors and  professionals managing/implementing information systems. CESG’s primary customers are civil  departments, government agencies and the military, industries forming part of critical national  infrastructure (such as power supply and water supply). CESG also works with organisations in the  wider public sector and with the private sector, including local government, health sector and law  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  31  enforcement. CESG offers a range of products and services including technical consultancy and  advice, policy documentation, product evaluation and training.  3.12.1 CESG Framework  CESG provides:   IA Products and Services (CAS, CAPS, CAS-T, CLAS, etc.)   IA Policy and Guidance   IA Awareness and Training  CESG has developed a framework for certifying IA professionals who meet competency and skill  requirements for IA related roles and responsibilities. The CESG framework is consistent with ISO  17024 and has been developed in consultation with government departments, academia, industry,  certification bodies, and members of the CESG listed advisor scheme (CLAS) which is a partnership  with private sector consultants.  3.12.2 CESG Roles  The CESG framework includes a set of IA role definitions and a certification process. The different  roles and process are depicted below (Fig. 12).  The IA roles are defined using 3 different levels. The skills and responsibilities per role are defined in  the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). The skills are based on the set of skills defined  by the Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP). The CESG framework supplements the  IISP2 skills with definitions to aid assessments of skills.  The certification process has been defined in detail and is operated by three Certification Bodies  (CBs) appointed by CESG (APM Group, BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT Professionals, and IISP (a  RHUL and CREST consortium). The process assesses applicants against the requirements of the role  definitions and issues certificates endorsed by CESG stating the IA role and responsibility level at  which the applicant has been assessed.  http://www.cesg.gov.uk/ServiceCatalogue http://www.cesg.gov.uk/PolicyGuidance http://www.cesg.gov.uk/AwarenessTraining  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  32  Governments  Departments  Academia  &Industry  CLAS  community  CESG  advice & feedback advice & feedback advice &  feedback  intends training  courses upon  Set of IA  Roles and  Skills  IA Policy  Portfolio  Certification  Bodies  defines appoints 3 CBs  IA  Professionals  access standards  apply to  certif y  Public Sector  Organizations  Industry  employed  by  employed by  CLAS  become m ember o  f  APM  Group  BCS  IISP  RHUL  CREST  Communications Electronics Security Group (CESG)  IA Services  (Telcos,  Health,  Industry)  provides IA Products provides  Figure 12 CESG certification framework  There are six IA roles in the CESG framework:   Accreditor: To act as an impartial assessor of the risks that an information system may be  exposed to in the course of meeting the business requirement and to formally accredit that  system on behalf of the Board of Directors.   IA Auditor: To assess compliance with security objectives, policies, standards and processes.   Communications Security Officer / Crypto Custodian and deputy/alternate custodian: To  manage cryptographic systems as detailed in HMG IA Standard No 4 (reference [i]) and in  relevant product specific security procedures.   IT Security Officer/ Information Security System Manager/ Information Security System  Officer:  To provide governance, management and control of IT security.   Security & Information Risk Advisor: To provide business driven advice on the management  of security and information risk consistent with HMG IA policy, standards and guidance.   IA Architect: To drive beneficial security change into the business through the development  or review of architectures so that they:  o fit business requirements for security  o mitigate the risks and conform to the relevant security policies  o balance information risk against cost of countermeasures  3.12.3 CESG Enforcement and Compliance  The CESG framework is implemented mostly on a voluntary basis by helping to increase the level of  Information Assurance awareness and professionalism across the public sector and its supply chains,  which will lead to improved management of information risk and strong cyber defence. Through the  collaboration with a range of stakeholders including other government departments, professional  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  33  bodies, academia and industry, CESG intends to create an environment in which public sector  employees and suppliers have access to the appropriate IA professionalism, knowledge and skills to  do their job.  Certification Bodies (CBs) assess competence of professionals depending on the skills needed for a  role. The assessment process will typically include review of written evidence, knowledge testing,  input from referees, an interview, recommendation from assessors, and a final decision by a  ratifying panel. For roles that are more senior, the assessment is more extensive. CESG has  appointed three CBs who will assess IA Professionals against the requirements of the role  definitions. IA Professionals can use their certificates as evidence to prospective employers, clients  or promotion panels of their competence to perform the defined role at the level to which they have  been certified. CBs will charge IA Professionals for their certification.  3.12.4 CAS(T) - CESG  An example of one of the services that CESG offers, is the certification scheme for  telecommunications services, called CAS(T). The CAS(T) framework is a set of processes set up by  CESG specifically for electronic communications providers and services. The CAS(TP) model is  illustrated in Figure 13.

In the diagram below we present a single model of the entities and roles that recur in most of the  schemes we surveyed in the previous section. In individual schemes one or more roles are  sometimes combined, or sometimes the roles are split. For example, there may be a different entity  responsible for licensing auditors, or this might be done by the governing body.

Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  35   Licensing: The certification authority licenses auditors, for example by requiring them to take  exams to assess their expertise and knowledge. Audit reports from licensed auditors can be  used to obtain certification from a certification authority.  Sometimes licensing is done by an   Validation: The certification authority validates monitoring tools, for example by requiring  specific measurements or scans as a baseline.   Accreditation: The governing authority accredits certification authorities, basically asserting  that the processes for licensing auditors, validating monitoring tools, certification of service  or providers, are implemented in a sound way. The governing authority can accredit one or  more certification authorities.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  36  5 Conclusions  In this paper we gave an overview of different certification schemes and audit frameworks, and we  derived a single model that covers most of the different schemes.  Every scheme is different: Perhaps what is most striking about the different certification and audit  schemes is the fact that they are all so different. In each scheme the actual auditing is delegated to  third-party auditors, but the construction used is different every time. Sometimes the third party is  governmental – for example a ministry delegating to an agency. Sometimes the third party is non- governmental – for example an agency delegating to an audit firm. Sometimes auditing is delegated  to an accreditation body, who accredits auditors, who in turn audit providers. In each of these cases  the work of auditing providers is (structurally or on an ad-hoc basis) outsourced. The optimal  structure for this kind of delegation depends on many factors, on the size and maturity of the sector,  the resources and skills of the government authority, whether or not there are well-functioning  industry initiatives, and so on.  Assessing certification authorities: The generic model in Section 4 shows the key processes  certification authorities are executing or delegating: 1) auditing (what security measures are  checked, how), 2) licensing of auditors (what skills sets or exams are required), 3) validation of  monitoring tools (which scans or features are required), and 4) certification (how audit reports and  monitoring reports are assessed). A governing authority could evaluate a certification authority by  looking at these 4 processes.  Continuous monitoring vs point-in-time assessment: Most of the frameworks are based around  periodic, point-in-time assessment of a provider or a service. Such an approach might be adequate in  a situation where technology is fairly static (children seats for cars for example), but in the IT  industry, with the rapid changes of technology and products, the effectiveness of a one-off  certification is limited – especially when considering online or cloud services.  Incident reporting: Whatever structure is used in the certification or auditing scheme, the governing  body should have a way to make a cross-check to assess the overall effectiveness of the framework  in place, or the quality of the certification authority, or the quality of the auditors. An objective way  of assessing the overall framework or any of the parts, is by looking at incident reports and/or  independent test results.  Preventive auditing vs. post-incident investigations: In most certification and audit frameworks the  focus is on preventive and periodic audits. The goal of a preventive audit is to check whether or not  all the necessary security measures are in place. Post-incident investigation is even more important,  because it helps to understand the root cause of the incident, what are the lessons learnt and what  could have prevented the incident. This is important to improve security and possibly the audit  scheme itself too.  Compliance burden and entry barriers: The digital society is rapidly changing. New services (cloud  e.g.), new products (smartphones e.g.), new usage scenarios (smart grids e.g.) are emerging  continuously. An important goal of EU Member States and the European commission is to foster  innovation. It is important to take into account the effect of a high compliance burden on smaller  providers. Large (incumbent) providers have the resources and (arguably) the need to set up  advanced and sophisticated governance processes. For these incumbents it is relatively easy to  partake in one or more elaborate audit frameworks. But for a smaller provider to even a single audit  could be already be prohibitively costly. In any sector or market it is important to take into account  also the smaller providers where less is at stake. In general it is important to take into account the  impact of legislation on innovation and competition, and be particularly careful when obliging  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  37  providers across a sector to submit to a fixed set of audit requirements or partake in a specific audit  framework.

Protecting the security of this information infrastructure is not easy. Often the information  infrastructure is run by several organisations and uses different types of information technology  from different companies. This report deals with the issue of how to enforce an adequate level of  security across a sector of service providers.  By way of response, we give an overview of 12 different audit frameworks or certification schemes  for auditing security measures, used in different settings and sectors, which are aimed at ensuring  that providers comply with certain security requirements.  In particular we look at the following audit frameworks and certification schemes:   ISO 27001   COBIT 5   Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)   NERC Reliability Standards   ISPS Code   HIPAA   Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)   Trust Services   PCI-DSS   BASEL II   BSI-IT Grundschutz   CESG  For each scheme we describe the overall setup and we depict the different entities and their roles in  assessing or certifying compliance to the security requirements. Some of these audit frameworks are  sector-specific and backed by specific legislation. Some large well-known frameworks (ISO27001 for  example) are not sector-specific and are adopted across sectors on a voluntary basis. In some  settings the auditing is delegated to auditors, and sometimes these auditors have to be licensed by  an authority. In other settings this delegation is absent or done by a governing authority overseeing  the overall scheme. In this paper we also introduce a single model that captures the most common  features.  We conclude with some general remarks about the listed audit frameworks:   Every scheme is different: Perhaps what is most striking about the different schemes is the  fact that they are all so different. In each scheme the actual auditing is delegated to third- party auditors, but the construction used is different every time. The optimal structure for  this kind of delegation depends on many factors, on the size and maturity of the sector, the  resources and skills of the government authority, whether or not there are well-functioning  industry initiatives, and so on.   Assessing certification authorities: The generic model in Section 4 shows the key processes  the involved authorities are executing or delegating: 1) auditing (what security measures are  checked and how), 2) licensing of auditors (what skills sets or exams are required), 3)  validation of monitoring tools (which scans or features are required), and 4) certification on  the security requirements (how audit reports and monitoring reports are assessed). A  governing authority could evaluate an auditing/certification authority by looking at these 4  key processes.

Some of the auditing frameworks we describe below, have become certification  frameworks, meaning that the audit goes one step further and compliance can be certified.  This is the only meaning of certification in the context of this document.

For example, in the EU electronic communication providers must  take appropriate security measures under Article 13a of the Framework directive, and in the US  health care providers must take security measures under legislation called HIPAA (Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act). In different settings different approaches are taken: In some  settings compliance is mandated by law (for example, by national regulators under Article 13a), in  some settings compliance is voluntary (for example, for datacentres, ISO 27001 is often a matter of  choice), or mandated by an industry association (for example, the Payment Card Industry (PCI)  demands all payment processors to comply). In some settings the auditors are explicitly certified to  audit the security measures (for example, ISO 27001), while in other settings anyone can audit the  security measures (for example, HIPAA). This is just a taste of the different variations. In this  document we give an overview of different settings where there is a need to comply with security  measures to show the differences and similarities. Target audience  This paper is intended to provide background material for regulatory authorities, government  authorities, national ministries, and experts in the EU involved (in passive or active role) in  enforcing  compliance to security legislation/security measures across providers in a sector; i.e. national  regulatory authorities that need to audit the security measures proposed under Article13a,  governmental authorities that need to transpose into legislation these requirements et cetera.  Goal  There is a plethora of different frameworks and standards for IT security measures. We do not give  an exhaustive overview in this paper of all these different schemes, but we focus on schemes with  the following characteristics:  1. Wide adoption, possibly across sectors: We focus on security measures standard and  auditing frameworks which are widely adopted.  2. Related to critical sectors: We focus on critical sectors such as energy, government, health  care, finance, et cetera.  3. Different sectors, different approaches: The goal of this paper is to show different  approaches across different sectors. We do not go into the details of an auditing scheme if  similar to another scheme already discussed.  We stress that the goal of this paper is not to give an exhaustive overview of governance schemes.  Schemes or settings not addressed here are by no means inferior or less interesting topics for  discussion.  Structure of this document  The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2 we introduce the general problem these  auditing frameworks or certification schemes are trying to address. In Section 3 we derive a single  model with the entities and roles that are most common across the schemes. In the conclusions we  draw conclusions about the auditing schemes discussed in this paper.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  2  2 Information Security Governance  The need to enforce compliance to information security requirements across a group of providers  (businesses, government organisations, et cetera) is evident throughout different sector in society.  We gave examples in the introduction.  In this section we explain the general problem, by introducing a simple model in the diagram below  (Fig. 1).  Figure 1 Abstract model depicting the issue of governance of information security requirements  The model has three types of entities (providers, users, government authority):   Providers: Entities providing services to users (sometimes for a fee), ranging from equipment  vendors, to online service providers, outsourcing firms, consultancy firms, and e- government, et cetera. Providers can be subdivided in sectors (see the dashed box). A sector  is a subset of service providers which provide a specific set of services. For example, the  energy sector is a group of service providers providing power (electricity, usually).   Users: Entities consuming services provided by providers, including citizens, businesses,  organisations, government organisations - in a role of consumer of services.   Government authority: Entity set up or supported by law and/or with a legislative mandate  to address security incidents with an impact on society or users, ranging from government  bodies, governmental agencies, regulators, data-protection authorities, to non- governmental organizations, PPPs, or industry associations.  The government authority mandates (possibly sector-specific) security requirements which should  be implemented by providers1. The authority normally seeks evidence of compliance – i.e. that  security requirements are met. In practice the details of such a set-up are very different in different  settings. In this document we examine different settings to show these differences.  1  Users may still have further, stricter, requirements, which may be dealt with bilaterally in agreements  between provider and user.

Some audit frameworks have a legal or regulatory backing. Some  frameworks are voluntary, industry-led. Some audit frameworks are sector-specific, while others are  not.  We discuss and summarize the following audit frameworks:   ISO 27001   COBIT   Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)   NERC Reliability Standards   ISPS Code   HIPAA   Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)   Trust Services   PCI-DSS   BASEL II   BSI-IT Grundschutz   CESG  For each framework we provide a general introduction, we discuss the overall control and audit  framework, the roles of the different actors involved, and the enforcement mechanisms.  We would like to remark that although there are several audit frameworks, the content of these  frameworks is often similar. There have been initiatives to converge and align the different security  standards and audit frameworks. UCF is an example2.  3.1 ISO 27001  The ISO/IEC 27001:2005 3 , 4  is a well-known information security standard published by the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 5  and the International Electro-technical  Commission (IEC)6. ISO27001 is part of the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards .  Although ISO 27001  is not tied to a particular country's legislation, it is very popular among security practitioners  worldwide, and a number of countries have adopted localized variants of the ISO 27001 standard as  a primary source of recommended security controls (e.g. Revised Turnbull Guidelines on Internal  Control Oct 20057, Australian/New Zealand Standard AS/NZS 4360:1999 Risk Management8, etc.).  2 Among others: Unified Compliance Framework, http://www.unifiedcompliance.com  3 Full title is ISO/IEC 27001:2005 - Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information security  management systems -- Requirements.  4  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42103  5  http://www.iso.org  6  http://www.iec.ch  7 http://www.frc.org.uk/documents/pagemanager/frc/Revised%20Turnbull%20Guidance%20October%202005.  pdf  8  http://www.standards.org.au  http://www.unifiedcompliance.com/ http://www.frc.org.uk/documents/pagemanager/frc/Revised%20Turnbull%20Guidance%20October%202005.pdf http://www.frc.org.uk/documents/pagemanager/frc/Revised%20Turnbull%20Guidance%20October%202005.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  4  3.1.1 ISO 27001 Framework  ISO 27001 specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,  reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented Information Security Management System  (ISMS) within the context of the organization's overall business risks. The standard is designed to  ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security controls that protect information assets  and give confidence to interested parties. It is accompanied by the ISO 27002 standard9 10, which  establishes guidelines and general principles for initiating, implementing, maintaining, and improving  information security management in an organization. Security measures are called controls. The  objectives of security measures are called control objectives. In a way, ISO 27001 is taxonomy of  possible controls, whereas ISO 27002 provides recommended practices for the implementation of  controls. While there is no formal requirement that the two aforementioned standards (ISO 27001 &  ISO 27002, respectively) must be used in conjunction, they are usually used together. The ISO 27001  standard can be used in a formal certification against the control objectives described.  It should be mentioned that ISO 27001 gives auditors a certain degree of freedom, in order to ensure  effective and efficient implementation of an ISMS according to the specific information security  requirements of the organization under question.  Below is depicted the overall set-up of ISO 27001  framework (Fig. 2).

This ensures  consistency in the accreditation market and is designed to protect the consumer. Accordingly, it is  mandatory for every European Member State to have a single National Accreditation Body (NAB).  Outside of Europe, there is not a set regulation – e.g., in the USA there are multiple Accreditation  9  Full name: Information technology -- Security techniques -- Code of practice for information security  management  10  http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50297  11  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:218:0030:01:EN:HTML  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  5  Bodies (AB), whereas within Australasia there is the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New  Zealand12. For those countries without a designated National Accreditation Body, the International  Accreditation Forum13 lists member Accreditation Bodies that only accredit competent bodies,  providing buyer confidence; certification against any of the recognized national variants of ISO/IEC  27001 (e.g. JIS Q 27001, the Japanese version) by an accredited Certification Body (CB) is functionally  equivalent to certification against ISO/IEC 27001 itself.  An ISMS may be certified compliant with ISO 27001 by a number of Certification Bodies worldwide,  which, in turn, must be accredited themselves by an International Accreditation Body for that  scheme (e.g. UKAS in the United Kingdom14).  The key personnel conducting the ISMS audit has also  to be accredited as ISMS Lead Auditor(s) from a NAB-accredited Certification Body, or the  International Register of Certificated Auditors (IRCA)15.  The Accreditation Bodies accredit the competent Certification Bodies according to various scopes of  ISMS accreditation1617; moreover, they perform periodic audits on Certification Bodies in order to  ensure conformance with the accreditation standards (e.g. in the case of UKAS, the accreditation is  confirmed on an annual basis by surveillance visits, with a full re-assessment every fourth year. In  addition, the first surveillance visit takes place 6 months after the Grant of Accreditation). Sanctions  to violators are immediately enforced18. More information about the accreditation process can be  found on the UKAS site19.  3.1.3 ISO 27001 Enforcement and Compliance  Certification Bodies with competent personnel re-assess the certified ISMS periodically, usually  yearly. Certification Bodies, in turn, are subject to compliance audits from their respective  Accreditation Bodies.  ISO 2700x is a horizontal, cross-sector family of information security standards and as such, they can  be used in a variety of cases. It has to be noted that the ISO 27001 standard itself provides a  structured way for auditing the implementation of the organization’s information security, and lists  an indicative pool of potential controls in a certain taxonomy (which may be extended by the  implementer in an ad-hoc basis, according to the security needs of the organization); the  responsibility of controls’ selection and, more importantly, the intensity of the selected controls lies  solely with the organization.  12  http://www.jas-anz.com.au/  13  http://www.iaf.nu/  14  http://www.ukas.com/default.asp  15

COBIT, originally ‘Control Objectives for Information and related Technology’ but used in acronym  only since 2009, was first released in 1996 by ISACA. The current version, COBIT 5, was published in  2012.  COBIT 5 helps enterprises create optimal value from information and related technology (IT)  for their stakeholders by maintaining a balance between realizing benefits and optimizing risk levels  and resource use. The framework addresses both business and IT functional areas across an  enterprise and considers the IT-related interests of internal and external stakeholders. Enterprises of  all sizes, whether commercial, not-for- profit or in the public sector, can benefit from COBIT 5.  3.2.1 COBIT Framework  COBIT is positioned as a high level framework, addressing the governance and management of  enterprise information and related technology (GEIT) and has been aligned and harmonized with  other, more detailed, IT standards and good practices such as COSO, TOGAF, ITIL, ISO 27000 series,  PMBOK, etc.  The framework is used as IT Governance best practice guidance in many cases, both at  government and private sector20.  COBIT 5 creates a single reference base for the governance and management of information and  technology through its five principles. It establishes seven critical areas (enablers) that are relevant  to all enterprises in the governance and management of information. Using COBIT helps enterprises  to prepare for current and future compliance requirements.  Infotrmation security governance and management is a key aspet of GEIT – failure to adequately  secure information and technology assets and resources destroys stakeholder value.  To support  information security professions in their use of COBIT 5, ISACA has published ‘COBIT 5 for  Information Security’  21  .  This publication takes COBIT 5 as the base reference framework and  provides guidance to help IT and security professionals understand, utilize, implement and direct  important information security-related activities, and make more informed decisions while  maintaining awareness about emerging technologies and the accompanying threats.  An appendix  relates the COBIT 5 for Information Security guidance to ISO/IEC 27001/2, ISF and NIST guidance.  Also in support of specific user aspects related to COBIT 5, other guide publications have been  produced by ISACA, including:   COBIT 5 Implementation22   COBIT 5 for Assurance 23   COBIT 5 for Risk24   COBIT 5: Enabling Processes25  20  http://www.isaca.org/About-ISACA/Press-room/Pages/COBIT-Fact-Sheet.aspx  21  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx  22  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Implementation-product-page.aspx  23  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Assurance-product-page.aspx  24  http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Risk-product-page.aspx  25 http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Enabling-Processes-product-page.aspx  http://www.coso.org/ http://www.itil-officialsite.com/ http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/Information-Security-Product-Page.aspx http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Implementation-product-page.aspx http://www.isaca.org/COBIT/Pages/COBIT-5-Enabling-Processes-product-page.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  7  3.2.2 COBIT Enforcement and Compliance  COBIT 5 is an internationally accepted governance and management framework from ISACA26,  focussed on enterprise information and related technology assets and resources.  COBIT 5 helps  enterprises build bridges between stakeholder needs, business goals, IT related goals and enabler  goals by providing a common non-technical base of reference for business and IT professionals to  work with.  COBIT 5 focuses primarily on information and technology related business enablers thatupport the  achievement of business goals through efficient and effective IT-related arrangements. Referring to  Porter's Generic Business Model 27 , core business activities (e.g., procurement, operations,  marketing, sales) are discussed, as well as support activities (e.g., human resources, administration,  information technology). As a consequence, COBIT adddreses the use of information and related  technology across the whole enterprise, not only within the IT department.  3.3 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  In a report to the US congress28, the government notes that for US federal agencies, on average, IT  security spending amounts cover up to 16% of total IT spending. The same report notes that in 2010  US-CERT handled 107,439 incident reports, and that approximately 41,776 of those were incidents in  federal agencies.  FISMA was passed as Title III of the E-Government Act (Public Law 107-347) in December 200229 and  sets high level security requirements. FISMA requires each federal agency to develop, document,  and implement an agency-wide program to provide information security for the information systems  that support the operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by  another agency, contractor, or other source. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) are  developed by NIST and approved by the US Secretary of Commerce. Legislative basis for FIPS are the  Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106) and the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-347). FIPS standards are also used by  other organizations around the world30, as a best practice for security requirements, especially in  regulated industry sectors (such as financial and health-care institutions) that process Sensitive But  Unclassified (SBU) information. FIPS does not apply to national security systems (as defined in Title  III, Information Security, of FISMA).  Federal agencies must adhere to FIPS 200 which “specifies minimum security requirements for  federal information and information systems and a risk-based process for selecting the security  controls necessary to satisfy the minimum requirements.” In essence, the high level security  requirements mandated by FISMA are further specialized through FIPS and other more detailed  standards, such as NIST SCAP. The interested reader can find a description of the FIPS framework in  the appendix.  26  www.isaca.org  27  M.

A model of FIPS framework is illustrated below (Fig. 3).  31  Indicative documents: “FIPS PUB 200 Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and  Information Systems, 2006#”, and “NIST Special Publication 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for  Federal Information Systems#”, as updated.  32  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips200/FIPS-200-final-march.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  9  Congress NIST  FISMA FIPS  developsissues sec req  legal basis  OMB  gives guidance  General  Inspector  Federal  agency II  Federal  agency I  report sec  status  report sec status  assessment  Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  Figure 3 FISMA audit framework  3.3.2 FISMA Roles  The following organizations play a role in implementing FISMA.   The USA Congress establishes top-level security requirements for federal agencies and  support contractors in the FISMA legislation.   NIST develops the security standards and guidelines (called FIPS) for FISMA implementation,  including a risk-based approach for selecting, implementing, and assessing security controls  for federal information systems and for determining risk to organizational operations and  assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation.   Agency heads, in coordination with their Chief Information Officers and Senior Agency  Information Security Officers report the security status of their information systems to the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with annual FISMA reporting  guidance.   Inspectors General provide an independent assessment of the security status of federal  information systems, also reporting results to OMB annually.  3.3.3 FISMA Enforcement and Compliance  FISMA compliance is mandatory for federal agencies of the USA. To achieve compliance with the  NIST Standards and Guidelines, the common practice is to base the detailed description of each  system’s technical configuration on the NIST derived, Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP33)  format34. Moreover, the OMB has required, in July 31st, 2007 memorandum to Federal CIOs35, that  \"Information technology providers must use SCAP validated tools, as they become available, to  certify their products do not alter these configurations, and agencies must use these tools when  33  http://scap.nist.gov/  34  The relevant specification (“The Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2”) is available at the NIST site  35  http://www.cio.gov/documents/FDCC_memo.pdf  http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/ http://scap.nist.gov/  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  10  monitoring use of these configurations.\"36. SCAP deals mainly with the technical configurations of  certain technologies (operating systems, databases and active network components), while the  support for secure configuration at the application level is limited, due to the custom character of  the applications themselves.  In the federal agencies of the USA there is a trend towards the automation of security requirements,  and therefore promoting the standardization of technical configurations of the ICT systems37.  Requirements to establish mandatory configuration settings derive from the FISMA as implemented  by FIPS 200 and NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Security Control CM-6, Configuration Settings), and  OMB 38  Policy. Federal CIOs must deploy appropriate configuration settings on commercial  information technology products that compose their organizational information systems. These  products include, for example, mainframe computers, workstations, portable and mobile devices,  and network components.  3.3.4 FIPS 140  The FIPS 140 series establishes requirements and standards for cryptography modules that include  both hardware and software components. The use of validated cryptographic modules is required by  the United States Government for all unclassified uses of cryptography.  In order to use a cryptography module in a production environment, the module has to be  accompanied by a validation certificate issued by an accredited laboratory through the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP), a joint effort by the NIST and the  Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC). Moreover, as a prerequisite action the  algorithms themselves are tested via the Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP), with  the same setting and philosophy as in CMVP. All of the tests under the CAVP are handled by third- party laboratories that are accredited as Cryptographic and Security Testing (CST) Laboratories by  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP). Vendors interested in validation  testing of their algorithm implementation may select any of the accredited laboratories. A certificate  is valid for the lifetime of that version of the product.  Vendors of cryptographic modules use independent, accredited Cryptographic and Security Testing  (CST) laboratories to test their modules. The CST laboratories use the Derived Test Requirements  (DTR), Implementation Guidance (IG) and applicable CMVP programmatic guidance to test  cryptographic modules against the applicable standards. NIST's Computer Security Division (CSD) and  CSEC jointly serve as the Validation Authorities for the program, validating the test results and  issuing certificates.  Cryptographic modules that conform to FIPS 140 use approved security functions such as  cryptographic algorithms, cryptographic key management techniques, and authentication  techniques. Approved security functions include those that are either:   specified in a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS),   or adopted in a FIPS and specified either in an appendix to the FIPS or in a document  referenced by the FIPS, or   specified in the list of Approved security functions.  36  http://nvd.nist.gov/scapproducts.cfm  37  http://www.ca.com/~/media/Files/whitepapers/20-cscs-wp.pdf  38  For a NASA-related audit report, refer here: http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf  http://www.ca.com/~/media/Files/whitepapers/20-cscs-wp.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf http://oig.nasa.gov/NASA2010ManagementChallenges.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  11  The audit process of the FIPS 140 implementation on behalf of the accredited laboratories is defined  in the “NIST Handbook 150-xx” standard series; numerous managerial, organizational, procedural  and technical countermeasures are defined in the “NIST Handbook 150-xx” standard series (many of  them with specific metrics, such as probabilities of false positives occurrence). The complementary  NVLAP standard “NIST Handbook 150” provides detailed controls for ensuring the adequacy of a  laboratory practices throughout its whole life cycle.  3.4 NERC Reliability standards  The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)39 is an international, independent, not- for-profit, self-regulatory organization, that aims to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system in  North America. In 2007, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)40 granted NERC the  legal authority to enforce reliability standards with all users, owners, and operators of the bulk  power system in the United States, and made compliance with those standards mandatory and  enforceable.  3.4.1 NERC Framework  Reliability standards are the planning and operating rules that electric utilities follow to ensure  reliable systems. NERC’s reliability standards development process has been accredited by the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI).  The first set of enforceable standards was filed with FERC in 2006. In 2007, FERC approved 83 of the  102 proposed standards. Those 83 standards became mandatory and enforceable in the U.S. on June  18, 2007. The remaining standards are still being reviewed by FERC. The U.S. Department of Energy  designated NERC as the electricity sector coordinator for critical infrastructure protection. NERC  serves as the Information Sharing and Analysis Center for the electricity sector. The NERC's security  initiatives are coordinated by the Critical Infrastructure Protection Committee (CIPC), which also  works closely with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Public Safety and Emergency  Preparedness Canada to ensure that the critical infrastructure protection functions so vital to the  industry are fully integrated and coordinated with the governments of the Unites States and Canada.  Regarding the ICT security measures defined, there are multiple standards developed for US NERC  (“Reliability Standards”), with a number of them addressing cyber security issues; complementary to  this, specific and detailed audit programs have been developed with the aim of ensuring compliance  with the aforesaid Reliability Standards (e.g. “CIP-005-3a — Cyber Security — Electronic Security  Perimeter(s)”, “COM-001-1.1 — Telecommunications”, etc. These standards and their respective  audit programs are in a process of continuous update, in cooperation with the DHS and FERC, among  others. The focus is on security objectives and not on the actual implementations of specific  technologies, but a FISMA-like approach may be adopted for specific technologies (i.e. checklists,  tools, SCAP, etc.).  The NERC control and audit framework is represented below (Fig 4).  39  http://www.nerc.com  40  FERC (http://www.ferc.gov/) is a federal agency that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity (as  well as natural gas and oil). FERC oversees NERC in the U.S.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  12  Parlianment  NERC  oversight  authority  reports on  compliance  Auditing  standards  Organization  Third  party  auditor  audits  au di  ts  issu es  opinion after audit  com ply w  ith  m ay assign audit  North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)  Figure 4 NERC audit framework  3.4.2 NERC Roles  All bulk power system owners, operators, and users must comply with approved NERC reliability  standards. These entities are required to register with NERC through the appropriate regional entity.  NERC's compliance efforts comprise three key activities:  1. Compliance monitoring is the process used to assess, investigate, evaluate, and audit in  order to measure compliance with NERC standards;  2. Compliance enforcement is the process by which NERC issues sanctions and ensures  mitigation of confirmed violations of mandatory NERC reliability standards;  3. Due Process provides registered entities the opportunity to contest any finding of a violation  of a NERC reliability standard. The process allows for hearings at the regional entity and  appeals before NERC.  NERC works with eight regional entities to improve the reliability of the bulk power system. These  entities account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a portion of  Baja California Norte, Mexico41.  Regional compliance implementation plans42 are the strategic plans for the annual compliance  monitoring and enforcement activities implemented by each to fulfil its responsibility to monitor  compliance with NERC reliability standards as specified by each region's delegation agreements. All  41  http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=1|9|119  42 http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=3|23|209  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  13  regional entities submit their annual plans to NERC for consideration by November 1 every year, at  which point NERC reviews and subsequently approves the regional annual implementation plan. As  part of its oversight, NERC conducts periodic audits of each regional program. Reports generated  from these activities can be found on the NERC site43.  3.4.3 NERC Enforcement and Compliance  In the USA44, NERC and the eight regional entities charged with compliance enforcement monitor  compliance via a number of methods, including regular and scheduled compliance audits, random  spot checks, and specific investigations as warranted by indications that a standard may have been  violated. NERC and the Regional Entities work closely with each user, owner, or operator to review  and monitor plans to resolve any reliability issues as quickly as possible.  As part of these efforts, NERC can also issue remedial action directives to immediately address and  deter new or further violation(s), irrespective of the presence or status (i.e. confirmed or alleged) of  a violation. Sanctioning of confirmed violations is determined pursuant to the NERC Sanction  Guidelines and is based heavily upon the Violation Risk Factors and Violation Severity Levels of the  standards requirements violated and the violations' duration. Entities found in violation of any  standard must submit a mitigation plan for approval by NERC and, once approved, must execute this  plan as submitted.  Especially for the audits relevant to cyber-security measures implementation, the regions have  brought in cyber security experts in dedicated compliance enforcement roles for the additional  workload brought about by CIP45. For 2012, 328 CIP audits are scheduled46, whereas for the 2011  period 244 analogous audits were scheduled47, which shows a raise of 34% regarding CIP audits  activity.  In 2011 NERC published the first Compliance Analysis Report48, in which it analyses the standards  that have experienced a high frequency of violations since June 18, 2007, after the relevant audits.  Among them, the CIP-004 (Personnel and Training), CIP-001 (Sabotage Reporting), CIP-006 (Physical  Security of Critical Cyber Assets) and CIP-007 (Systems Security Management) are analysed.  An important concept is the inclusion of third-party independent organizations which act as auditors  on behalf of the NERC; such an example exists for the Regional Entity “Midwest Reliability  Organization (MRO)”, for which the audit was performed by the private firm Crowe Horwath LLP49.  For this specific audit, and with respect to the purely ICT security measures in place, only the  Internal IT Security Policy and the Data Classification Procedure Manual of the organization were  reviewed.  43  http://www.nerc.com/page.php?cid=3|23|210  44  Similar practices are followed in other North American countries where NERC operates.  45  http://www.nerc.com/files/2010%20CMEP%20Annual%20Report_posted.pdf  46  http://www.nerc.com/files/2012%20PUBLIC%20Audit%20Schedule.xls  47  http://www.nerc.com/files/2011%20PUBLIC%20Audit%20Schedule%20POSTED%2009_28_11.xls  48  http://www.nerc.com/files/Organization%20Certifications1.pdf  49  http://www.nerc.com/files/MRO_AUP_Final_Report_20100408.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  14  3.5 International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code  The International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code50 is an amendment to the Safety of Life  at Sea (SOLAS) Convention (1974/1988)51 mandating for minimum security arrangements for ships,  ports and government agencies. ISPS is detailed in the Chapter XI-2 of the SOLAS (”Special measures  to enhance maritime security”) and has come into force in July 2004, signed by 108 Contracting  Governments (“CGs”). Europe has adopted the International regulations with EC Regulation (EC) No  725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004, on enhancing ship and  port facility security.  ISPS prescribes responsibilities to governments, shipping companies, shipboard personnel, and  port/facility personnel to \"detect security threats and take preventative measures against security  incidents affecting ships or port facilities used in international trade.\"52. In essence, the code takes  the approach that ensuring the security of ships and port facilities is a risk management activity and  that, to determine what security measures are appropriate, an assessment of the risks must be  made in each particular case.  The purpose of the code is to provide a standardised, consistent framework for evaluating risk,  enabling governments to offset changes in threat with changes in vulnerability for ships and port  facilities through determination of appropriate security levels and corresponding security measures.  The code (which does not refer to warships, naval auxiliaries or other ships owned or operated by a  Contracting Government and used only on Government non-commercial service), has a serious  impact on insurance rates.  3.5.1 ISPS Framework  The ISPS code is comprised of two parts: Part A is mandatory, describing minimum requirements for  security of ships and ports, while Part B provides implementation guidelines. The ISPS Code applies  to ships on international voyages (incl. passenger ships, cargo ships of 500 GT and upwards, and  mobile offshore drilling units) and the port facilities serving such ships. The code gives flexibility to  governments towards applying the code provisions even to port facilities that are used only  occasionally for international voyages; moreover, the extent of code application to the selected  ports lies solely with the governments. In a nutshell, the national governments are free to select the  port facilities and the intensity of the applied measures according to a security assessment carried  out as described in the code. Below is visualised the ISPS audit framework (Fig. 5).  50  http://www.imo.org/blast/mainframe.asp?topic_id=583&doc_id=2689  51  http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-for-the-Safety- of-Life-at-Sea-%28SOLAS%29,-1974.aspx  52  ISPS Code, Part A, 1.2.1  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  15  Contracting Government/ administration  lim ite  d au th  orit y  dele ga  tio n  Recognised  Security  Organization  (RSO)  Designated  Authority (DA)  full authority  delegation  Ship/Port  Facility  Ship/Port  Facility  Ship/Port  Facility  co m  p lia  n ce  p  re p  ar at  io n  a ct  iv it  ie s  verificatio n  / certificatio  n  activities  verification/  certification activities  co m  plia nce  pre par  at io  n ac tiv  iti es  International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code  re po  rt report  Figure 5 ISPS audit framework  Moreover, the code provides for three (3) security Levels, corresponding to a normal, heightened  and exceptional threat situations enacted by the Contracting Governments as follows:   Security level 1 means the level for which minimum appropriate protective security  measures shall be maintained at all times.   Security level 2 means the level for which appropriate additional protective security  measures shall be maintained for a period of time as a result of heightened risk of a security  incident.   Security level 3 means the level for which further specific protective security measures shall  be maintained for a limited period of time when a security incident is probable or imminent,  although it may not be possible to identify the specific target.  Because each ship (or class of ship) and each port facility present different risks, the method in  which they will meet the specific requirements of this Code will be determined and eventually be  approved by the Administration (i.e. flag state) or Contracting Government, as the case may be. In  that respect, the measures are defined in a generic form of security requirements while their correct  enforcement lies with the responsible party.  3.5.2 ISPS Roles  The ISPS Code is part of SOLAS, so compliance is mandatory for the 148 Contracting Parties to  SOLAS. In terms of the ISPS Code, the Contracting Governments have various responsibilities,  including:   Setting the security level;   Approving SSPs and any amendments to a previously approved plan;   Verifying compliance of ships with the provisions of the regulation;  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  16   Issuing the relevant International Ship Security Certificates (ISSC);   Determining which port facilities located within their territory are required to designate and  train a Port Facility Security Officer (PFSO);   Ensuring completion and approval of the port facility security assessment (PFSA) and port  facility security plan (PFSP) or any subsequent PFSP amendment;   Issuing statements of compliance for port facilities;   Exercising control and compliance measures over ships.  Regarding the responsibilities of the Company and the Ship, shipping companies are required to:   Designate and train a CSO (at least one per company) and to have in place designated and  trained SSOs for each of their ships;   Approval of each SSP is normally by the administration (flag state). Thereafter, the SSP is  used on board the ship with responsibility falling onto the SSO for successful  implementation;   While the setting of a security level is solely the responsibility of a contracting government, a  Master or SSO can enhance the security measures that are in place on board the ship at any  time (e.g. when the vessel is sailing through an area of increased vulnerability);   The training of the ship’s crew in terms of security practices linked to the SSP, as well for  ensuring proper security-related records are maintained and that any security equipment  used on board the ship is functioning properly;   Ships after the issuance of the ISSC by their administration, must maintain documentary  evidence of continued compliance with the legislation.  Finally, the responsibilities of the Port Facility are as follows:   The PFSO prepares and implements a suitable PFSP, ensuring the port always operates at  security level 1, and the additional measures / possible preparatory actions are in place to  operate at security levels 2 and 3, if necessary.   The PFSO is responsible for the training of port staff in terms of the PFSP procedures and the  carrying out of regular security related drills and exercises, as well as for the proper security- related records and maintenance.  3.5.3 ISPS Enforcement and Compliance  Involved entities are bound to code provisions from July 1st, 2004. Towards ensuring the proper  measures taken, the Contracting Government is responsible for communicating security-related  information to the International Maritime Organization and to the shipping and port industries. In  order to communicate the security threat to a port facility or a ship, the contracting government will  firstly set the appropriate security level based on its assessment of all available current security  intelligence. Whilst they can, if appropriate, designate or establish “Designated Authorities” (“DA”)  within government to undertake some of its’ security duties and allow Recognised Security  Organisations (RSOs)53 to carry out certain aspects of this work54, the final responsibility for the ISPS  code remains with the CG.  The initial security assessments (SSAs, PFSAs) can be delegated to a DA or a RSO, while the final PFSA  approval has to be approved by the contracting government or the designated authority concerned.  53  Competent organizations to perform certain tasks of the regulation, according to section 4.5, pg. 36 of the  Code.  54  Important exceptions (including setting of the security level), are detailed in the section 4.3, pg.7 of the  Code.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  17  Port Facility Security Assessments are periodically reviewed. With respect to the effectiveness of the  SSP / PFSP or the relevant amendments, these can, in the extent they consider appropriate, test the  effectiveness of the SSP / PFSP or the relevant amendments.  Testing can be performed by the contracting government, a designated authority or a recognised  security organisation. Finally, certain other tasks (such as assistance towards performing a PFSA,  verification and certification of compliance of ships with the requirements of the code, etc.) can be  assigned to an RSO. Typically, every contracting government creates a national recognised security  organisation registry after a relevant bid; thereafter, the eligible RSOs may be assigned certain tasks,  as prescribed by the code. Conflict of interest issues apply (e.g. an RSO should not be authorized to  evaluate a PFSP which has been developed by this specific RSO).  3.6 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  The USA’s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), Public Law 104-191,  mandates the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt and enforce national standards  for electronic health care transactions, health identifiers, security and privacy (Part 164).  The HIPAA evaluation standard (§ 164.308(a)(8)) also requires covered entities to perform a periodic  (technical and non-technical) evaluation to assess if security policies and procedures meet the  security requirements. This evaluation can be performed internally or by a third-party auditor.  3.6.1 HIPAA Framework  HIPAA defines security standards in the Subpart C, where privacy standards are defined in  the  Subpart E. Implementation specifications are ”Required” (mandatory) or “Addressable”  (optional) for “covered” (i.e. involved)  entities. The HIPAA security and privacy provisions are  expressed in a generic manner, independent of technology or specific implementations and cover  managerial, policy, organizational, procedural and technical aspects55. The organisations that have to  comply to HIPAA (‘covered entities’) are free to use whatever means they deem appropriate  according to the nature of their business, e.g. organisational structures, technical checklists for  hardening their IT systems, etc. The HIPPA overall set-up is shown in the following diagram (Fig. 6).  55 http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/index.html  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  18  US Congress  HHS (OCR)  Auditor  Hospital Hospital  HIPAA bill  Auditor  Hospital Hospital  Spot checks  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Figure 6 HIPAA audit framework  3.6.2 HIPAA Roles  HHS, and in particular the HHS’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is responsible for the enforcement of  HIPAA to the covered entities. HIPAA, with its (potentially) high penalties for non-compliance, has  led to a niche market specialized in HIPAA readiness.  3.6.3 HIPAA Enforcement and Compliance  HHS enforces the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules in several ways:   by investigating complaints;   by imposing financial sanctions;   by conducting compliance reviews to determine if covered entities are in compliance; and   by giving education to promote compliance with HIPAA  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act56 of 2009, in Section 13411 of the HITECH Act,  requires HHS to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and business associates are  complying with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and Breach Notification standards.  To  implement this mandate, Office of Civil Rights (OCR) is piloting a program to perform up to 150  audits of covered entities to assess privacy and security compliance.  Until recently HHS has limited its efforts to educating about HIPAA and dealing with complaints. To  reassess HIPAA effectiveness and efficiency (and mandated by Section 13411 of the HITECH Act), an  HHS audit program was started in late 2011 to asses compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security  Rules and Breach Notification standards.  56  http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr1enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr1enr.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  19  3.7 Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  The USA Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX)57 was adopted in 2002 to protect investors from fraudulent  accounting activities by businesses. SOX mandates strict reforms to improve financial disclosures  from corporations and prevent accounting fraud. SOX was adopted in response to the accounting  scandals in the early 2000s at Enron, Tyco, and WorldCom, to name a few.  All public companies  listed in New York Security Exchange (NY SEC) are bound to SOX Act58.  The key provisions of the SOX Act are:  1. Section 302: requires management to certify the accuracy of the reported financial  statement;  2. Section 404: requires that management and auditors establish internal controls and  reporting methods on the adequacy of those controls. Section 404 had very costly  implications for publicly traded companies as it is expensive to establish and maintain the  internal controls.  SOX 404 describes in a generic manner the recommended security measures, and focuses on the  desired outcome of the security measures. This approach aims to give flexibility to organisations to  implement appropriate security measures but it also left room for interpretation by auditors which  led to excessive compliance costs for organisations especially during the early years of the SOX  introduction. Often the security measures are a subset of COBIT and ISO 27002, with customized  security measures for this setting.  3.7.1 SOX Framework  Compliance to SOX is checked by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)59, which  is a non-profit organisation established by the US Congress for this purpose. The NY SEC has  oversight authority over the PCAOB.  The role of PCAOB is twofold:  1. PCAOB sets the general framework for accounting/audit firms (“registered firms”) who can  perform SOX 404 audits.  2. PCAOB audits in a periodic, risk-based manner the registered firms for proper practices.  The SOX control and audit framework is depicted below (Fig. 7).  57  http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ204/content-detail.htm  58  http://pcaobus.org/Information/Pages/PublicCompanies.aspx  59 http://pcaobus.org/About/Pages/default.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  20  NYSEC  Public Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board(PCAOB)  oversight  authority  reports of  registered firms  Auditor  audits  periodically  opinion after  audit  Auditor  iss ues  compliance with  organization  au d  its  Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  Figure 7 SOX audit framework  3.7.2 SOX Roles  There are three parties involved in checking compliance to SOX:   An accounting/audit firm (a ‘registered firm’) audits an organisation and issues an opinion  about the compliance of the organisation to SOX (usually through an integrated audit). This  opinion is then disclosed to the PCAOB and the SEC.   The PCAOB audits the effectiveness (primarily) and efficiency (secondary) of the  implementation of SOX, by checking organisations that have to comply to SOX and firms that  can perform SOX audits. PCAOB reports to the SEC and to certain state regulatory  authorities.   The SEC has oversight authority over the PCAOB, including the approval of PCAOB’s rules,  standards, and budget.  3.7.3 SOX Enforcement and Compliance  SOX 404 enforcement is split into the following parts:   Accounting/audit firms perform SOX 404 audits (usually as part of an integrated audit, i.e. in  conjunction with a financial statements audit).   The PCAOB inspects accounting/audit firms (‘registered firms’) for the purpose of assessing  compliance with laws, rules, and professional standards on auditing. PCAOB conducts  regular, periodic inspections of hundreds of firms60 PCAOB can impose severe sanctions to  both registered firms and individuals in case of SOX violations. SOX requires the PCAOB to  adopt a risk-based approach (annual inspections for firms audit reports for more than 100  60  http://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Pages/InspectedFirms.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  21  businesses, and at least triennially for smaller firms). In 2011, 10 registered firms were  audited annually.   PCAOB reports about these audits to the SEC and to certain state regulatory authorities.  PCAOB makes only portions of these reports available to the public61.  3.8 Trust Services  Trust Services is a framework of assurance and audit services, to address security and privacy risks –  mainly focussed on online service providers. The criteria and principles underlying Trust Services are  set by AICPA62. These criteria are used by auditors providing attestation services on systems in the  subject matters of security, availability, processing integrity, privacy, confidentiality, and certification  authorities63. The current version of Trust Services reflects application in the USA as reflected by the  references to the AICPA’s attestation section AT 101, I (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1). For  international issuers of WebTrust and SysTrust reports, practitioners may also refer to international  or domestic professional standards that are equivalent to AT 101.  SysTrust and WebTrust require accountants to conduct an independent examination that carries the  professional equivalency of a financial statement audit; the attestation and advisory services based  on Trust Services are discussed in the next section.  3.8.1 Trust Services Framework  The Trust Services framework has three types of assurances: examination, review, and agreed-upon  procedures engagements. In examination and review engagements, the auditor expresses an  opinion, for example, about whether there is the controls of a system were operating effectively to  meet the criteria for systems reliability. In an agreed-upon procedures engagement, the practitioner  does not express an opinion but rather performs an audit following agreed-up-on procedures, and  reports the findings. Attestation services are developed in accordance with AT section 101, Attest  Engagements (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1)64.  The following diagram shows the Trust  Service audit model (Fig. 8).  61  Note that in the latest (Jan. 2012) submission of the PCAOB performance review to the US SEC (“Review of  the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Enforcement and Investigations Program”) reported that “...  the most significant issue facing the board’s enforcement program and its ability to effectively protect  investors was the statute-mandated non-public nature of disciplinary proceedings.”  62  American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (http://www.aicpa.org)  63  The latest version can be found at http://www.webtrust.org/item27806.doc.  64  Trust Services Principles, criteria, and illustrations (2009)  http://www.webtrust.org/item27806.doc  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  22  AICPA Assurance  Service Executive  Committee  develops  Public Accounting  Firms  Trust services  (principles,  criteria,  illustrations)  is su  es  Licenced  auditor (CPA,  CA, etc)  Management  assertions  Organization  attests on  plans audits in  adherence with  reports on MA  Trust Services  Figure 8 Trust Services audit framework  The guidance on Trust Services sets out principles, which are broad statements of objectives, and  specific criteria that should be achieved to meet each principle. The Trust Services principles and  criteria are supported by a list of illustrative controls that, if operating effectively, enable a system to  meet the criteria. These illustrations are not intended to be all-inclusive and are presented as  examples only. The practitioner should identify and assess the relevant controls that the client has in  place.  3.8.2 Trust Services Roles  AICPA, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is responsible for review, assessment  and approval of the Trust Services on a periodic basis (the latest version is that of 2009. Audits  against the Trust Services criteria can only be done by licensed auditors (Certified Public  Accountants/CPAs, Chartered Accountants/CAs, or equivalent accounting professionals). Auditors  licensed65 to perform SysTrust and WebTrust services provide a report that gives assurance attesting  to an entity's compliance with the Trust Services Principles and Criteria. In case of a WebTrust  attestation, licensed auditors can provide a WebTrust seal that can be displayed on the client's web  site.  3.8.3 Trust Services Enforcement and Compliance  Trust Services attestation is professionally equivalent with a financial statement audit attestation.  Commercial agreements and partnerships often require a Trust Services attestation from an  independent auditor. For example, the inclusion of a vendor’s digital certificates in the Mozilla  project Root CA store66 and Microsoft Windows Root Certificate Program67, requires the vendor to  undergo some kind of audit: WebTrust for CAs, WebTrust EV are common options. Another common  option is an ETSI compliance report.  65  http://www.webtrust.org/homepage-documents/item27834.aspx  66  http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/  67  http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1760.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  23  3.9 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)  The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)68, is a security standard for the  payment card industry. PCI DSS is developed and management by the PCI Security Standards Council  (PCI SSC) This council was set up by a number of large payment card brands (American Express,  Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard, Visa) to strengthen security controls  around cardholder data towards reducing credit card fraud, and, finally, enhance trust on electronic  payments.  PCI DSS contains technical and operational requirements (‘control objectives’) set by the PCI Security  Standards Council (PCI SSC) to protect ‘cardholder data’. The PCI-DSS standard itself is comprised of  12 generic information security principles and it covers technical and operational system  components used for the processing of cardholder data. The PCI DSS standard includes security  measures which are technology-independent. PCI DSS also provides references to state-of-the-art  technologies and best practices used in the payment industry.  3.9.1 PCI-DSS Framework  PCI-DSS applies to all organisations that store, process or transmit cardholder data. PCI DSS gives  guidance to software developers and manufacturers of applications and devices used in payment  transactions. The overall process is overseen by the PCI Council. Especially regarding the operational  aspect, the Council manages programs that will help facilitate the assessment of compliance with PCI  DSS. They certify auditors, called Qualified Security Assessors (QSA) and vendors, called Approved  Scanning Vendor (ASV). Normally assessed entities have to provide annually two formally structured  documents: a) a Report On Compliance (ROC69) and b) an Attestation of Compliance for Service  Providers or Merchants 70 , both according to each payment brand’s respective reporting  requirements to ensure each payment brand acknowledges the entity’s compliance status. The ROC  guidance in the PCI DSS provides for a general template structure of the report document, regarding  content and format; certain reporting requirements may be imposed by the specific programmes of  payment brands71.  Below we depict the PCI-DSS framework (Fig. 9).  68  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?document=pci_dss_v2- 0#pci_dss_v2-0  69  Please refer to the VISA Levels/Tiers of merchants and the VISA requirements for reporting here:  http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp_merchants.html where ROC is mandatory for VISA  Level 1 merchants  70  See http://usa.visa.com/merchants/risk_management/cisp_service_providers.html for the VISA case  71  See \"Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures Version 2.0 October 2010\", section \"Instructions  and Content for Report on Compliance\", pg. 14.

Merchants and  service providers must prove compliance and report their compliance status annually to the  payment card brand they work with. So while the PCI Security Standards Council sets the  standards, merchants and service providers participating in certain payment schemes have  to comply with the requirements of their partners.   The PCI Security Standards Council is responsible for managing the security standards  lifecycle (including the amending process, member consultation, setup of working groups  etc), while compliance with the PCI set of standards is enforced by the founding members of  the Council. QSAs are approved by the PCI Security Standards Council to assess compliance  with PCI DSS. QSA’s have unlimited liability, as imposed an agreement between the PCI  Security Standards Council and the prospective QSAs, and this has led to a number of  organisations abandoning their nomination as QSAs, to avoid the high risks related to  indemnifications in case of a damage or loss incurred during or after security assessment.  The process of becoming (and be maintained as) a qualified approved security company  (QSA, ASV, etc) is rigorous, towards ensuring the quality of the security checks at the highest  level possible72 and the PCI Security Standards Council mandates annual reassessment.   ASVs are approved by the PCI Security Standards council to perform vulnerability scans of  Internet-facing systems of merchants and service providers.  72  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?category=validation  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  25  Finally, for smaller companies in the payment card industry that fall under PCI DSS mandate there is  a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (PCI DSS SAQ), which can be used by merchants and service  providers that are not required to undergo an on-site assessment per the PCI DSS Security  Assessment Procedures. Banks who do transaction with these smaller companies may ask the  company to share the results of the PCI DSS self-assessment73 .  3.9.3 PCI-DSS Enforcement and Compliance  Enforcement of compliance with the PCI DSS and determination of any non-compliance penalties are  carried out by the individual payment card brands and not by the PCI Security Standards council.  Operational issues regarding compliance by involved entities are directed to the payment brands  themselves.  Every assessed entity has to submit to payment card brands the details about annual assessments by  a QSA, and details about the quarterly security scans carried out by an ASV. Assessment reports are  considered non-compliant if these reports contains “open items”, or items that will be finished at a  future date. The merchant/service provider must address these items before being able to complete  validation. After open items are addressed by the merchant/service provider, the assessor will then  reassess to validate that the remediation occurred and that all requirements are satisfied. After  revalidation, the assessor will issue a new Report on Compliance, verifying that the cardholder data  environment is fully compliant, and submit it consistent with instructions. The complete procedure  and supporting material is available on the PCI SSC website (www.pcisecuritystandards.org).  Regarding the eligibility of approved security companies74 to provide PCI-DSS compliance audits,  their nomination may be redrawn, even immediately, in case of failure to meet the PCI SSC  requirements. In case of an incident to an assessed entity, the relevant procedures of individual  payment brands are applied. For example the procedures used by VISA75 76) contain detailed  instructions and strict deadlines about alerts of involved parties, reports of compromise,  independent forensic investigations, and so on.  3.10 Basel Accords (BASEL) II  Basel II is the second of the Basel Capital Accords77, (now extended and effectively superseded by  Basel III), which are recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision78 (“Committee”). BASEL II builds on an evolving framework for  managing risk in financial services transactions. In contrast to the First Capital Accord of 1988,  information risk and information technology (IT) have become decisive factors in shaping modern  business, and many financial services organizations have undergone a fundamental transformation  in terms of IT infrastructures, applications and IT-related internal controls79.  73  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/self_assessment_form.php  74  https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/  75  http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_what_to_do_if_compromised.pdf  76  http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_responding_to_a_data_breach.pdf  77  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords  78  http://www.bis.org/bcbs/about.htm?ql=1  79  ITGI, 2007, IT Control Objectives for Basel II, the Importance of Governance and Risk Management for  Compliance  http://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/ https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/ http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_what_to_do_if_compromised.pdf http://usa.visa.com/download/merchants/cisp_responding_to_a_data_breach.pdf http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_Accords http://www.bis.org/bcbs/about.htm?ql=1  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  26  While the committee is not a legal entity and BASEL II is not a regulation per se, they heavily  influence the financial organizations around the globe; BASEL II has been transposed (in various  forms and degrees of compliance, either as a national law or secondary legislation issued by a  national bank.  Basel II uses a \"three pillars\" concept, as follows:  1. Minimum Capital Requirements (addressing risk),  2. Supervisory Review and  3. Market Discipline.  Of particular interest is the operational risk (Pillar 2), which is defined as “the risk of direct or indirect  loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external  events”80 and it is closely relates with ICT-security controls implementation. Below we focus on how  BASEL II manages operational risks.  3.10.1 BASEL II Framework  In BASEL II operational risks are calculated and dealt with using customized methods, specific for  financial institutions81, but the overall approach is similar to IT risk management frameworks.  Measures to mitigate risks are technology-dependent, meaning that the financial institution has the  freedom to implement controls objectives in a suitable way. The usual approach is to adopt a  structured approach such as ISO 27001/2 or COBIT.  BIS (Bank for International Settlements (among other organizations) has issued a number of  guidance documents such as the “Operational Risk Consultative Document” (2001),  “Implementation of Basel II: Practical Considerations” (2004)82, “Enhancing corporate governance for  banking organisations” (2006)83, etc. It is important to note that only control requirements are  discussed, while no focus on specific technologies or implementations is given. The BASEL II audit  framework is shown below (Fig. 10).  80  BIS, 2001, Operational Risk Consultative Document, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf  81  BIS, 2001, Operational Risk Consultative Document, available at http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf  82  http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs109.htm  83  http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs122.pdf  http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbsca07.pdf  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  27  BASEL Committee  supervised by  BASSEL II  issues  NCB  Financial  Body I  Financial  Body II  issues penalties  send report send re  port  Basel Accords (BASEL) II  Figure 10 BASEL II audit framework  3.10.2 BASEL II Roles  The supervision of BASEL II is carried out by the national financial sector supervisor, typically  National Central Banks (NCBs). The supervised entities (financial institutions) are required to report  to national supervisors periodically. Article 156 of the EU Directive on Capital Requirements requires  the European Commission to periodically monitor whether the directive has significant effects on  the economic cycle. In the light of the examination, the Commission has to submit a bi-annual report  together with any appropriate remedial measures to the European Parliament and to the European  Council. National reporting to the Commission is the responsibility of the national supervisor. The  first report has been issued in 201084.  3.10.3 BASEL II Enforcement and Compliance  In each country where BASEL II is used, the national supervisor has the right to impose on supervised  entities appropriate administrative penalties, as provided for by the applicable legislation on credit  institutions, in case of violation of legal and regulatory provisions concerning the conduct of their  activities or the obstruction of supervisory control. These penalties may be imposed in conjunction  with other administrative penalties and corrective measures, pursuant to applicable laws.  As discussed above, BASEL II is adopted by the major financial institutions around the world. For the  EU the European Banking Association site85 gives an overview of related laws, regulations, and  administrative rules and provides guidance on regulation and supervision.  84  http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/docs/regcapital/monitoring/23062010_report_en.pdf  85  http://www.eba.europa.eu/Supervisory-Disclosure.aspx  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  28  3.11 Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) - Federal  Office for Information Security  The Bundesamtes für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI) focuses on information security in  public authorities. The BSI Standards contain recommendations by BSI on methods, processes,  procedures, approaches and measures relating to information security. The BSI certifies information  domains86.  3.11.1 BSI Framework  The IT-Grundschutz standard is the BSI's best known publication on information security. It was  published in 1994 and updated in 2005. IT-Grundschutz is a standard for establishing and  maintaining an appropriate level of protection for all information assets in an organisation, and  provides a methodology for management of information security.  The BSI certification involves auditing of the information security management system as well as  auditing of the specific information security measures on the basis of IT-Grundschutz. The BSI  certification always includes an official ISO certification in accordance with ISO 27001 but, due to the  additionally audited technical aspects, is more comprehensive than only ISO certification.  The aim of IT-Grundschutz is to achieve an appropriate level of security for all types of information  of an organization. IT-Grundschutz focuses on the protection of business-related information, which  has normal security requirements. IT-Grundschutz may be useful also for IT systems and applications  with high security requirements. We explain the different IT Grundschutz standards in more detail in  an annex to this section.  3.11.2 BSI Roles  The BSI framework and the different roles are depicted below (Fig. 11). BSI defines standards,  accredits certification authorities for the issuance of certificates, and licenses auditors. Licensed  auditors can perform an audit, and the audit report is used by a certification authority to issue a  certificate of compliance. The certificate can be used by the provider to show customers that it  implements security measures according to BSI’s IT Grundschutz standards.  To become a licensed auditor, auditors have to prove they have the appropriate technical  background and expertise by providing evidence of more than two years of professional experience  in the area of IT security and experience in three projects relating to IT-Grundschutz. Candidates  must attend a training course and an exam to obtain a license. The licence is valid for a period of five  years.  During this period BSI organizes events for the exchange of experiences between auditors so  as to ensure the uniformity of audits and improve the overall scheme. The license of an auditor can  be revoked if the auditor fails to participate in these events or if an auditor negligently contravenes  the framework.  86  Information domains are defined as “the interaction between infrastructural, organisational, personnel and  technical components that enable business processes and tasks to be performed”  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  29  accreditation  checks  implements  licences  au d  it  o  u tc  o m  e  Auditor  Provider  BSI  Standards  defines  BSI  100-1  BSI  100-2  BSI  100-3  BSI  100-4  Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)  Federal German  Government  implements  BSI Certification  authority  Figure 11 BSI-IT Grundschutz audit framework  3.11.3 BSI Enforcement and Compliance  The BSI standards recommend a standardised set of security measures for IT systems. The purpose  of these standards is to achieve a baseline of security which is reasonable and adequate to satisfy  basic security requirements. The standards could also be used for IT assets with higher security  requirements.  The BSI is implemented mostly on a voluntary basis. Compliance with the IT-Grundschutz standards  is optional. BSI also provides a subscription service, which provides registered users with news and  updates about IT-Grundschutz and IT security topics. Registered users also participate in user  surveys which are used by BSI to improve the methodology and standards. Numerous companies  and public agencies use IT-Grundschutz Catalogues as the basis for their security measures.  3.11.4  BSI Standards  The BSI IT Grundschutz standard consists of 5 parts.   BSI Standard 100-1 Information Security Management Systems (ISMS)   BSI-Standard 100-2: IT-Grundschutz Methodology   BSI-Standard 100-3: Risk Analysis based on IT-Grundschutz   BSI-Standard 100-4: Business Continuity Management   IT-Grundschutz Catalogues  In this part we go over them in more detail.   BSI Standard 100-1 Information Security Management Systems (ISMS): The BSI standard  100-1 Information Security Management Systems defines the general requirements of an  ISMS and describes how an ISMS could be implemented. It is based on the ISO 27001 and  27002 standards. The BSI Standard 100-1 provides readers with an easy to understand and  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  30  systematic instruction manual, providing a brief and clear overview of the most important  tasks of security management. The standard can be used irrespective of the precise ISMS an  organization wants to use to implement.   BSI Standard 100-2 IT-Grundschutz Methodology: The IT-Grundschutz Methodology (BSI  standard 100-2) shows how a management system for information security can be  developed and operated in practice. The IT-Grundschutz Methodology explains in detail how  a policy for information security can be developed, which information security measures can  be selected and what are pitfalls when implementing the information security policies.   BSI Standard 100-3 Risk Analysis based on IT-Grundschutz: The BSI standard “Risk Analysis  based on IT-Grundschutz” (BSI standard 100-3) outlines a methodology for determining  assets that should be protected and how to perform a risk assessment. The standard uses  the threats specified in the IT-Grundschutz Catalogue. It presents a method for performing a  risk analysis that is optimised for use with the IT-Grundschutz methodology. The BSI has  worked out a methodology for risk analysis on the basis of IT-Grundschutz. This approach  can be used when companies or public agencies are already working successfully with IT- Grundschutz and would like to add an additional security analysis to the IT-Grundschutz  analysis as seamlessly as possible.   BSI-Standard 100-4: Business Continuity Management: The BSI Standard 100-4 explains a  method for establishing and maintaining business continuity processes. The focus is on  threats which could severely impact an organization (natural disasters for example) and on  security measures to protect from those threats. The standard can be used by any  organization (large or small). It is based on the previously mentioned BSI standards but it can  also be used stand-alone.   IT-Grundschutz Catalogues: Since 2005 the IT-Grundschutz Manual is called IT-Grundschutz  Catalogues. The IT Grundschutz catalogue provides an overview and a categorization of  different threats. The IT-Grundschutz Catalogues describe the standard security measures in  detail, including:  o Standard security measures for typical IT systems with \"normal\" protection  requirements  o A description of the threat scenario which is globally assumed  o Detailed descriptions of measures to assist with their implementation  o A description of the process involved in attaining and maintaining an appropriate  level of IT security  o A simple methodology for ascertaining the level of IT security attained by comparing  the target with the actual system status.  3.12 CESG: Communications Electronics Security Group  CESG is the UK’s national technical authority for information assurance (IA). Information Assurance is  defined (by CESG) as obtaining confidence that information systems will protect the information  they process, that they function as they need to, and when they need to, under control by legitimate  users.  CESG aims to protect the vital interests of the UK by providing advice and assistance on the security  of communications and electronic data. CESG focusses on training people, such as auditors and  professionals managing/implementing information systems. CESG’s primary customers are civil  departments, government agencies and the military, industries forming part of critical national  infrastructure (such as power supply and water supply). CESG also works with organisations in the  wider public sector and with the private sector, including local government, health sector and law  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  31  enforcement. CESG offers a range of products and services including technical consultancy and  advice, policy documentation, product evaluation and training.  3.12.1 CESG Framework  CESG provides:   IA Products and Services (CAS, CAPS, CAS-T, CLAS, etc.)   IA Policy and Guidance   IA Awareness and Training  CESG has developed a framework for certifying IA professionals who meet competency and skill  requirements for IA related roles and responsibilities. The CESG framework is consistent with ISO  17024 and has been developed in consultation with government departments, academia, industry,  certification bodies, and members of the CESG listed advisor scheme (CLAS) which is a partnership  with private sector consultants.  3.12.2 CESG Roles  The CESG framework includes a set of IA role definitions and a certification process. The different  roles and process are depicted below (Fig. 12).  The IA roles are defined using 3 different levels. The skills and responsibilities per role are defined in  the Skills Framework for the Information Age (SFIA). The skills are based on the set of skills defined  by the Institute of Information Security Professionals (IISP). The CESG framework supplements the  IISP2 skills with definitions to aid assessments of skills.  The certification process has been defined in detail and is operated by three Certification Bodies  (CBs) appointed by CESG (APM Group, BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT Professionals, and IISP (a  RHUL and CREST consortium). The process assesses applicants against the requirements of the role  definitions and issues certificates endorsed by CESG stating the IA role and responsibility level at  which the applicant has been assessed.  http://www.cesg.gov.uk/ServiceCatalogue http://www.cesg.gov.uk/PolicyGuidance http://www.cesg.gov.uk/AwarenessTraining  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  32  Governments  Departments  Academia  &Industry  CLAS  community  CESG  advice & feedback advice & feedback advice &  feedback  intends training  courses upon  Set of IA  Roles and  Skills  IA Policy  Portfolio  Certification  Bodies  defines appoints 3 CBs  IA  Professionals  access standards  apply to  certif y  Public Sector  Organizations  Industry  employed  by  employed by  CLAS  become m ember o  f  APM  Group  BCS  IISP  RHUL  CREST  Communications Electronics Security Group (CESG)  IA Services  (Telcos,  Health,  Industry)  provides IA Products provides  Figure 12 CESG certification framework  There are six IA roles in the CESG framework:   Accreditor: To act as an impartial assessor of the risks that an information system may be  exposed to in the course of meeting the business requirement and to formally accredit that  system on behalf of the Board of Directors.   IA Auditor: To assess compliance with security objectives, policies, standards and processes.   Communications Security Officer / Crypto Custodian and deputy/alternate custodian: To  manage cryptographic systems as detailed in HMG IA Standard No 4 (reference [i]) and in  relevant product specific security procedures.   IT Security Officer/ Information Security System Manager/ Information Security System  Officer:  To provide governance, management and control of IT security.   Security & Information Risk Advisor: To provide business driven advice on the management  of security and information risk consistent with HMG IA policy, standards and guidance.   IA Architect: To drive beneficial security change into the business through the development  or review of architectures so that they:  o fit business requirements for security  o mitigate the risks and conform to the relevant security policies  o balance information risk against cost of countermeasures  3.12.3 CESG Enforcement and Compliance  The CESG framework is implemented mostly on a voluntary basis by helping to increase the level of  Information Assurance awareness and professionalism across the public sector and its supply chains,  which will lead to improved management of information risk and strong cyber defence. Through the  collaboration with a range of stakeholders including other government departments, professional  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  33  bodies, academia and industry, CESG intends to create an environment in which public sector  employees and suppliers have access to the appropriate IA professionalism, knowledge and skills to  do their job.  Certification Bodies (CBs) assess competence of professionals depending on the skills needed for a  role. The assessment process will typically include review of written evidence, knowledge testing,  input from referees, an interview, recommendation from assessors, and a final decision by a  ratifying panel. For roles that are more senior, the assessment is more extensive. CESG has  appointed three CBs who will assess IA Professionals against the requirements of the role  definitions. IA Professionals can use their certificates as evidence to prospective employers, clients  or promotion panels of their competence to perform the defined role at the level to which they have  been certified. CBs will charge IA Professionals for their certification.  3.12.4 CAS(T) - CESG  An example of one of the services that CESG offers, is the certification scheme for  telecommunications services, called CAS(T). The CAS(T) framework is a set of processes set up by  CESG specifically for electronic communications providers and services. The CAS(TP) model is  illustrated in Figure 13.

In the diagram below we present a single model of the entities and roles that recur in most of the  schemes we surveyed in the previous section. In individual schemes one or more roles are  sometimes combined, or sometimes the roles are split. For example, there may be a different entity  responsible for licensing auditors, or this might be done by the governing body.

Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  35   Licensing: The certification authority licenses auditors, for example by requiring them to take  exams to assess their expertise and knowledge. Audit reports from licensed auditors can be  used to obtain certification from a certification authority.  Sometimes licensing is done by an   Validation: The certification authority validates monitoring tools, for example by requiring  specific measurements or scans as a baseline.   Accreditation: The governing authority accredits certification authorities, basically asserting  that the processes for licensing auditors, validating monitoring tools, certification of service  or providers, are implemented in a sound way. The governing authority can accredit one or  more certification authorities.  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  36  5 Conclusions  In this paper we gave an overview of different certification schemes and audit frameworks, and we  derived a single model that covers most of the different schemes.  Every scheme is different: Perhaps what is most striking about the different certification and audit  schemes is the fact that they are all so different. In each scheme the actual auditing is delegated to  third-party auditors, but the construction used is different every time. Sometimes the third party is  governmental – for example a ministry delegating to an agency. Sometimes the third party is non- governmental – for example an agency delegating to an audit firm. Sometimes auditing is delegated  to an accreditation body, who accredits auditors, who in turn audit providers. In each of these cases  the work of auditing providers is (structurally or on an ad-hoc basis) outsourced. The optimal  structure for this kind of delegation depends on many factors, on the size and maturity of the sector,  the resources and skills of the government authority, whether or not there are well-functioning  industry initiatives, and so on.  Assessing certification authorities: The generic model in Section 4 shows the key processes  certification authorities are executing or delegating: 1) auditing (what security measures are  checked, how), 2) licensing of auditors (what skills sets or exams are required), 3) validation of  monitoring tools (which scans or features are required), and 4) certification (how audit reports and  monitoring reports are assessed). A governing authority could evaluate a certification authority by  looking at these 4 processes.  Continuous monitoring vs point-in-time assessment: Most of the frameworks are based around  periodic, point-in-time assessment of a provider or a service. Such an approach might be adequate in  a situation where technology is fairly static (children seats for cars for example), but in the IT  industry, with the rapid changes of technology and products, the effectiveness of a one-off  certification is limited – especially when considering online or cloud services.  Incident reporting: Whatever structure is used in the certification or auditing scheme, the governing  body should have a way to make a cross-check to assess the overall effectiveness of the framework  in place, or the quality of the certification authority, or the quality of the auditors. An objective way  of assessing the overall framework or any of the parts, is by looking at incident reports and/or  independent test results.  Preventive auditing vs. post-incident investigations: In most certification and audit frameworks the  focus is on preventive and periodic audits. The goal of a preventive audit is to check whether or not  all the necessary security measures are in place. Post-incident investigation is even more important,  because it helps to understand the root cause of the incident, what are the lessons learnt and what  could have prevented the incident. This is important to improve security and possibly the audit  scheme itself too.  Compliance burden and entry barriers: The digital society is rapidly changing. New services (cloud  e.g.), new products (smartphones e.g.), new usage scenarios (smart grids e.g.) are emerging  continuously. An important goal of EU Member States and the European commission is to foster  innovation. It is important to take into account the effect of a high compliance burden on smaller  providers. Large (incumbent) providers have the resources and (arguably) the need to set up  advanced and sophisticated governance processes. For these incumbents it is relatively easy to  partake in one or more elaborate audit frameworks. But for a smaller provider to even a single audit  could be already be prohibitively costly. In any sector or market it is important to take into account  also the smaller providers where less is at stake. In general it is important to take into account the  impact of legislation on innovation and competition, and be particularly careful when obliging  Auditing Security Measures  An Overview of schemes for auditing security measures  September 2013  Page  37  providers across a sector to submit to a fixed set of audit requirements or partake in a specific audit  framework.

    "abstract": "Across society there are now critical services which rely on computers, networks and servers. Protecting the security of this information infrastructure is not easy. Often the information infrastructure is run by several organisations and uses different types of information technology from different companies. This report deals with the issue of how to enforce an adequate level of security across a sector of service providers. ENISA in this report presents an overview of the auditing schemes on security measures that exist across the globe: twelve different audit frameworks or certification schemes for auditing security measures, used in different settings and sectors, at ensuring that providers comply with certain security requirements. The conclusion introduces a single auditing model that captures the most common features, creating a preliminary meta-framework."

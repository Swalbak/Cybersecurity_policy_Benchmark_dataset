ENISA works with these groups to develop advice and recommendations on good practice in information  security. It assists EU member states in implementing relevant EU legislation and works to improve the  resilience of Europe’s critical information infrastructure and networks. ENISA seeks to enhance existing  expertise in EU member states by supporting the development of cross-border communities committed to  improving network and information security throughout the EU.

No text of specified style in document.  |  sensitive-csirtS network only  |  December 2017  03  Executive Summary  The common model used for gauging CSIRT maturity in the CSIRTs community is the Security Incident  Management Maturity Model (SIM3). ENISA has added to SIM3 a three-stage approach for maturity  assessment, with maturity increasing via the basic and intermediate stages to finally certifiable as highest  stage. A self-assessment tool and peer review methodology were coupled to that, which are being piloted  in the CSIRTs Network.  As an accompanying measure, a project was defined aimed to give to teams pragmatically implementable  information on how to reach the higher maturity levels– notably so, the levels 3 and 4 of the SIM3 model.  This project was to explain for all 44 SIM3 parameters, how to reach those levels 3 and 4 – with examples  and templates to be made available where possible. Given the sensitive nature of the collected  information the results are meant to be available only to members of the CSIRTs Network.  The target audience for this study is primarily the middle management layer in the CSIRTs, responsible for  increasing the team’s maturity. The study will help them to more easily and quickly implement real  maturity improvement, following self-assessment and peer review process.  This Maturity Reference Document is the first part of the results of that project. It contains the general  framework needed to understand how to reach higher levels of CSIRT maturity – and then it goes on to  describe more in detail how to do this for the first 8 parameters of SIM3 model for which the highest  maturity demands (level 4) are in place, in the context of the “certifiable” level as has been defined in  ENISA’s three-stage approach. Two more parameters were added (O-7 and O-10) for which the  “certifiable” demand is one degree lower (level 3) – as these two parameters are seen to be logically  complementary to the group of Organisational (‘O’) parameters at this stage of the project.  In the next version of this Maturity Reference Document, due early 2018, this approach will be extended to  cover all 44 SIM3 parameters.

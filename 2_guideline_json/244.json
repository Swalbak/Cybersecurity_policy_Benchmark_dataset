Analysing how well cybersecurity products, services and processes succeed in the market is a  key step in understanding how to improve their market diffusion, importance, quality and  acceptance. Though cybersecurity has been considered in the past within market analysis  efforts, the customisation and scoping of cybersecurity market analyses is still at low levels of  maturity. Moreover, market data on cybersecurity products, services and processes are scarcely  taken into account in the cybersecurity development life-cycle, e.g. within decision-making  processes for the launching and development of cybersecurity initiatives, product ideas, policy  actions, research funding, and deployments. By initiating this activity, ENISA delivers an  important contribution towards a more targeted, market-driven decision-making process for the  conception, launching and maintenance of cybersecurity products, services and processes  within the EU.  This document is the cornerstone of ENISA activities in analysing the EU cybersecurity market:  it presents a cybersecurity market analysis framework as a “cookbook” on how EU  cybersecurity market analyses can be performed and be:  • More transparent: the fact that analysis method, parametrization, cybersecurity value  chain, market trends and market stakeholders are fixed, leads to a more transparency as  regards the results of the analysis.  • More comparable: by having set both the content of various components and the steps of  the analysis process, the achieved results are more comparable, and thus reusable among  various analyses performed.  • More targeted towards specific cybersecurity value chains: the availability of a standard  taxonomy of cybersecurity value chains, allows for more targeted analysis with regard to  specific cybersecurity areas, products, services and processes.  • More customizable towards technology and market trends: the possibility to customize an  analysis according to various trends, allows for consideration of market dynamics by  means for forecasts, market gaps and market niches.  • More agile: the inherent flexibility of setting market analysis foci and adapting accordingly  the performed analysis process, increases agility of the proposed market analysis method.  • More comprehensive: the inclusion of all possible variables, criteria and contextual  information on cybersecurity, as well as requirements and dependencies both from the  supply and the demand sides, increases the comprehensiveness of the proposed market  analysis method.  • More coherence: the use of the framework to perform market analyses facilitates  information exchanges among specific market analysis reports by means of re-usability  and coherence of created/maintained market information (both raw market data and  analysis results).  The framework presented in this report is at its initial development phase. With increasing  performance of cybersecurity market analyses, but also with interactions with stakeholders,  ENISA will continuously develop, update and maintain the current framework to increase its  efficiency and practicability. To this extent, it constitutes rather the starting point of a journey  than a destination.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  In 2021, ENISA has initiated its activities in analysing the cybersecurity market. The  Cybersecurity Act (CSA1) has stipulated the task of performing market analyses in the area of  cybersecurity  (see also Section 1.1 below). Performing market analyses in the area of  cybersecurity, constitutes a quite novel, yet challenging task because of the following:  • Given the considerable multiplicity of cybersecurity products, services and processes, a  market analysis in this area may need to go significantly deeper than current market  analysis practices;  • Cybersecurity functions are often “packaged” within existing products and services. As there  is no established taxonomy or metrics in this area, it is difficult to collect and analyse  information about detailed cybersecurity functions available. However, a detailed  decomposition approach is often needed in order to assess various market characteristics of  products, such as role, level of market penetration, market value, etc.;  • While until now market analyses and assessments have been performed mainly by experts  with an economic background, cybersecurity market analysis requires significant, technically  oriented cybersecurity knowledge;  • Finally yet importantly, the fact that cybersecurity products, services and processes entail a  certain “blurriness” in their scope and boundaries, may introduce a certain degree of  uncertainty in analyses and assessments, especially when innovation niches are in focus.  These facts indicate the need for developing differentiated analysis approaches, in order to  encompass in the market analysis cybersecurity characteristics: unlike the rather high-level  analysis of product and service markets, the analysis of cybersecurity market require novel  approaches, based on novel market modelling, combined with cross-fertilization of skills.  The current document is an initial attempt to develop a market assessment approach and is  meant to be a collection of tools to be used for cybersecurity market analyses. The developed  approach comprises the ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF). The  present output is expected to be an initial building block, an initial part of the content to be  gradually developed in consecutive years. It will facilitate the analysis of the required market  assessment, involved mechanisms and tools. On the outset, the definition of the cybersecurity  market and its key components - in terms of products and services - will be addressed. During  this development, market dynamics will gradually become integral part of this analysis2, as the  toolset developed will cover variety of needs and analysis requirements that will emerge through  a series of cybersecurity market-analysis foci and objectives.  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  As it has been stipulated in Article 8, as well as in Title III of the CSA1, the consideration of  developments in cybersecurity market constitutes a main focal point within CSA, in particular in  the context of certification. Certification is considered as the main instrument to “avoiding the  fragmentation of the internal market”3. In setting up Cybersecurity Certification, the main goal is  “to improve the functioning of the internal market” (Art. 56 CSA). To achieve this goal, CSA  foresees a number of actions to analyse market trends. These actions are mentioned in CSA,  in particular where it provides that:  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EL/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN, accessed November 2021.  2 Market dynamics (and the cybersecurity market in general) are highly dependent on what is happening outside the EU,  therefore defining the market geographically-wise would be needed.  3 See Article 1 par. 1 (b) CSA.  With ECSMAF,  ENISA has  created a toolbox  for the  performance of  Cybersecurity  Market Analyses.  It introduces  related content  for targeted  cybersecurity  market analyses.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EL/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  7  • “ENISA shall perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main trends in the  cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to fostering the  cybersecurity market in the Union” (Art. 8 par. 7 CSA);  • “ENISA should develop and maintain a ‘market observatory’ by performing regular analyses  and disseminating information on the main trends in the cybersecurity market, on both the  demand and supply sides” (Recital 42 CSA).  In performing these tasks, ENISA receives advice and guidance from the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (hereinafter, SCCG). The SCCG:  • “upon request, advise[s] ENISA on general and strategic matters concerning ENISA’s tasks  relating to market, cyberse-curity certification, and standardisation” (Art. 22 par. 3 (b) CSA).  The ENISA work on the EU cybersecurity market aims to contribute to reduce the EU internal  market fragmentation and provides input to:  • The Union Rolling Work Programme for European Cybersecurity Certification by means of  “market demand” (Art. 47 CSA);  • The promotion of “the use of European cybersecurity certification, with a view to avoiding the  fragmentation of the internal market [emphasis added]. ENISA shall contribute to the  establishment and maintenance of a European cybersecurity certification framework in  accordance with Title III of this Regulation, with a view to increasing the transparency of the  cybersecurity of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, thereby strengthening  trust in the digital internal market and its competitiveness” [emphasis added] (Art 4.6  CSA).  Moreover, based on market information, ENISA provides support in the coordination of the  Member States’ efforts in the area of market surveillance for supervision of certification4: The  CSA provides that:  • The National cybersecurity certification authorities “supervise and enforce rules included in  European cybersecurity certification scheme [...] for the monitoring of the compliance of ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes with the requirements of the European cybersecurity  certificates that have been issued in their respective territories, in cooperation with other relevant  market surveillance authorities” [emphasis added] (Art. 58 par 7 (a) CSA).  The ENISA Single Programming Document 2012-2023 (SPD)5 takes into account these  provisions and sets up corresponding actions under Activity 7, with the aim to “to foster  cybersecurity market in the Union and the development of the cybersecurity industry, in  particular SMEs and start-ups, to reduce dependence from outside the Union and to reinforce  supply chains inside the Union. It involves actions to promote and implement ‘security by  design’ and ‘security by default’ measures in ICT products, services and processes, including  through standardisation”.  4 Knowing that this effort concerns mainly compliance issues of certification, it might provide valuable information on various  aspects of the Cybersecurity Market. Thus, it may be used as a tool to obtain valuable information on the cybersecurity  market. Though this facility is not yet operational, ENISA will coordinate efforts with Member States/Commission to  increase the usability of this source within the context of the Activity 7 of the ENISA Single Programming Document (SPD)  2021-2023 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021- 2023, accessed November 2021).  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023,  accessed November 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  8  By delivering information on cybersecurity market, ENISA provides support towards the  implementation of various Commission initiatives helping companies (SMEs, micro-enterprise)  improve business/production processes, products, or services using digital technologies:  • European Digital Innovation Hubs6: market analyses provide evidence towards helping “SMEs  expand and tap into other markets, develop EU value chains, create new business opportunities for  companies or help commercialise earlier innovation experiments or pilots”7  • Emerging industries and value chains8: market analysis is an important instrument that may “help  SMEs to innovate and develop cross-sectoral value chains by bringing different sectors and areas of  expertise together to create new value chains across the EU and Horizon 2020 associated  countries”.  1.2 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The purpose of the developed cybersecurity market framework is to serve a number of ENISA- internal, as well as Stakeholder needs. As regards ENISA-internal needs, one can highlight the  following ones:  • To define a market analysis method capable of addressing the cybersecurity product, service and  process market;  • To serve as a basis for amalgamation of knowledge emanating from market analysis and  cybersecurity into a single knowledge source;  • To provide contextually detailed references to other related work, both within ENISA (e.g. areas  such as research and innovation, cybersecurity index, policy development, knowledge and  information) and outside ENISA (e.g. national market observatories, and national statistic  organisations); and  • To be used as a model for prospective development of tools to support this task within ENISA, e.g.  as a schema for storage of collected cybersecurity market data.  The satisfaction of these needs will empower ENISA to meet the following objectives:  • To identify potentially interesting cybersecurity fields that are innovative, emerging and represent a  potential for both demand and supply;  • To identify cybersecurity market opportunities and risks based on demand and supply  requirements;  • To assess the importance of relevant market segments to assess potential impact of  incidents/threats/risks;  • To assess market needs for cybersecurity certification, and  • To leverage cybersecurity market data for informed decisions within EU and Member States  cybersecurity policy actions.  As regards stakeholder needs, the proposed cybersecurity market framework aims at9:  • Serving as a model of reference for any stakeholder willing to engage in market analysis efforts;  • Helping vendors of cybersecurity products, services and processes to update their Go-To-Market  strategies;  • Facilitating procurement and/or “make-or-buy” decisions, based on cybersecurity market data;  • Providing specific information about market developments w.r.t. cybersecurity products, services  and processes;  • Identifying cybersecurity market trends w.r.t. market penetration of various cybersecurity products;  6 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs, accessed January 2022.  7 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324, accessed January 2022.  8 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en, accessed January  2022.  9 Stakeholder needs-list is indicative and non-exhaustive. Needs mentioned here are the ones assessed by ENISA so far.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  9  • Assessing cybersecurity requirements to products, services and processes formulated by the  demand side, and  • Providing terminology to understand of market segmentation in the area of cybersecurity;  It should be noted, that the proposed framework aims at analysing classes of cybersecurity  products, processes and services, but not individual ones (i.e. by means of individual  evaluations).  This initial version of ECSMAF lays the foundation for a robust structure that can be applied to  existing market data and deliver satisfactory results.  The framework has been piloted and validated by means of an analysis in the area of  interconnected devices. While the experience gained from this pilot are already fed back to the  present methodology, an ongoing extensive review from the established Ad Hoc Working Group  (AHWG) on the EU Cybersecurity Market10 is currently being performed. The received feedback  will be taken account of in the continuous development effort of the framework.  For 2021, the validation of the developed framework is based on data and analysis prepared by  external market analysts. As the knowledge on the ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis  Framework matures, additional information sources will be included, such as own surveys,  stakeholder feedback and OSINT.  As regards the supply and demand side, the current focus is on business-to-business  relationships. The focus is mainly on companies that are in the “radar” of market analysis firms,  and especially the ones dominating individual market segments. Emphasis has been given to  requirements of operators of essential services (OESs) as well as regulated areas.  It should be noted, that when using the proposed framework, the size of business to be  addressed (both demand and supply sides) depends on the survey scope. If desired, any size  of business can be addressed. Depending on the scope, different stakeholder engagement and  specific surveying techniques will be needed.  The proposed framework can be used for various market segments, in particular those that are  related to cybersecurity (see also discussion about possible market stakeholder types and  vertical industries in Section 2.2.4). In doing so, the framework can also be utilized to analyse  certification market requirements, or market coverage of certified solutions in various vertical  industries. Equally, it can be used to analyse market penetration of various cybersecurity  products, services and processes, as they also make up a specific vertical industry. The  introduced cybersecurity value chain and value stack components will enable an analysis at  various levels of detail (see also Section 2.2.2).  In its current, initial, version, the framework remains at a relatively high level as regards its  modules and their content. This is due to the relatively coarse granularity of available market  data, as result of the low penetration of cybersecurity content at the level of market analysis  organizations. In forthcoming versions, when alternative information collections methods will be  used, a higher level of details regarding cybersecurity content will be striven for.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  By constituting a set of tools and general-purpose components for cybersecurity market  analyses, ECSMAF is potentially useful for a variety of stakeholders engaging directly or  10 The ENISA AHWG on the EU Cybersecurity Market has been established following the Call for expression of interest  published at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market,  accessed November 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  10  indirectly in the area of market analysis. Below we provide some examples of such  stakeholders, by stating potential elements of their market analysis related focus:  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIBAs) (e.g. DG-CNECT, DG-GROW, DG-JRC,  European Cybersecurity Competence Centre - ECCC, DG-RTD, DG-TRADE, Eurostat,  etc.): EU regulation often takes into account market issues, especially if it targets the EU  internal market. Moreover, market analysis can be part of performed impact assessments  of various decision-making activities prior to regulative texts. Market analysis activities hold  a central role in any kind of statistics developed to assess market trends, as well as  product related demand and supply issues. For all these use-cases, EUIBAs may use the  content of ECSMAF to perform targeted market analyses covering market penetration of  cybersecurity products, services and processes. Finally, the structuring presented within  this work, can be a useful source of ideas to cover other areas (e.g. by adapting the  taxonomy used to other thematic areas, by using the proposed scoping and  parametrization workflow, and by using trending method).  • Member States/Public Authorities (e.g. Cybersecurity Authorities): The creation of  cybersecurity market-surveillance activities at the level of EU Member States is subject of  regulation (e.g. CSA). Reportedly, various EU Member States are about to create such  capabilities, particularly in the area of market surveillance11. Just as described above for  the EUIBAs, Member States may use the proposed framework in a similar way. Moreover,  ideas and practices developed by Member States may be consolidated in ECSMAF. This  will facilitate mutual use of (open source) collected data, allowing thus for the  implementation of synergies (e.g. data exchange, comparability of market analysis, and  definition of common efforts).  • ENISA Stakeholder Groups (e.g. ECCG, SCCG, ENISA Advisory Group): By playing an  important role in the area of EU-wide certification, members of these stakeholder groups  may use the developed material to oversee market parameters affected by certification  efforts. The developed material can serve as a decision-making basis for prioritizing  certification efforts that are related to needs/requirements of both supply and demand.  Moreover, ECSMAF can serve as guidance in spotting market gaps, providing thus  outlooks for future certification activities.  • Industry and Industry Associations (Ecosystem of Certification, EU TIC Council, Vendors /  Manufacturers, ECSO): The cybersecurity industry will be in the position to perform  targeted market analyses for various cybersecurity products and for various sectors by  supporting a variety of foci. Gap analysis (e.g. demand requirements vs. supply  functions/features) may lead to early identification of market trends, thus enhancing time- to-market for new products, services and processes. Both elements can lead to the  creation of competitive advantages to EU industry players and support the internal market  for product, process and processes in the area of cybersecurity.  • Consumer Organisations/Associations: By using the proposed method/framework, such  organisations may assess existing good practices for products, services and processes  targeting the sector of their associated members. Moreover, they can capture  requirements from the demand side, identify relevant gaps in the cybersecurity market,  and assess market penetration of members’ products, services and processes. Such  information may be useful for cybersecurity product-, service- or process-procurement  decisions.  11 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/building-blocks/market-surveillance/organisation_en, accessed January  2022.  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/building-blocks/market-surveillance/organisation_en  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  11  • Research Institutions and Research related entities: Given their inherent interest in  performing research creating competitive advantages in the European market, research  institutions may:  o use the proposed methodology to assess market areas that can affect the maturity of  existing products;  o cover market niches;  o provide products, services and processes for emerging technology areas; and  o use the proposed methodology to assess the market impact of deployed results.  1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The present document is organised as follows:  • Chapter 1 (this chapter) presents the policy context, the purpose, objectives and scope of  this report, the target audience, and the structure of the report.  • Chapter 2 presents the entire structure, modules and content of ECSMAF. Besides the  number of foreseen modules, it also presents a series of contextualized components, that  is, components that capture cybersecurity related content and parametrization options for  setting the scope of analyses (see chapter 2).  • Chapter 3 presents the main interfaces of ECSMAF with other topics/ENISA activities,  illustrating thus the “interaction” of the proposed method with other related work, both  within and outside ENISA. This discussion sets the broader relationship of cybersecurity  market analysis with activities in the area of cybersecurity, helping thus the reader to  comprehend existing dependencies and interfaces (see chapter 3).  • Chapter four concludes the report by stating various issues encountered and formulating  conclusions and future work (see chapter 4).  • Annex A contains examples of outcomes of the ECSMAF modules. This supporting  information aims at increasing the understanding of the purpose of the developed  framework (see Annex 4.1A).  • Annex B contains a table with Main Abbreviations.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  12  2. CONTENT OF THE ENISA  CYBERSECURITY MARKET  ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK  (ECSMAF)  This chapter gives an overview and provides the details of the various modules of the  developed ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF). It delivers an overview  and describes the various components. It has to be noted that in 2021 an initial version of the  framework has been developed. With increasing experience in the field of market analysis, the  proposed structure and components will be further specified/adapted to cover all aspects  emerging during specific analyses.  The material presented below consists of two main component categories:  • Logical blocks/modules of ECSMAF: These modules represent the various aspects  covered within an analysis and correspond to various content groups/phases performed  for various market report types. These modules originate from generic market analysis  techniques (see Section 2.1) rather than cybersecurity knowledge; and  • Components that establish the cybersecurity context: These are components  capturing the structure and peculiarities of cybersecurity and helping to parametrise  ECSMAF according to the selected scope of the analysis. They deliver scoping methods  for cybersecurity market analysis based on typical cybersecurity-centred approaches (e.g.  asset, threat and risk based, policy relevance, market measures, etc.). Moreover, they  cover thematic topics of cybersecurity by means of a cybersecurity taxonomy to capture  the entire value chain and value stack of cybersecurity products, services and processes.  Cybersecurity trends and cybersecurity market stakeholder participating in the market  roundup the cybersecurity market analysis context (see Section 2.2).  This chapter provides the available details of these categories of ECSMAF components.  2.1 LOGICAL BLOCKS/MODULES OF ECSMAF  The set of logical components of the developed framework are depicted in Figure 1 below.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  13  Figure 1: Logical blocks/modules of ECSMAF  As can be seen in the figure above, the modules cover several elements required by CSA1,  such as the distinction between supply and demand, the inclusion of supply-chain, the  consideration of trends, the consideration of socio-economic, policy and regulation aspects, as  well as technology trends.  The six modules of the proposed method are subject to parametrization, prior to their execution  (see Section 2.2.1). Parametrisation of the framework creates the scope for the analysis to be  performed. It may lead to selective execution of the modules according to the needs of the  analysis. To this extent, the modules are not performed in a sequential manner (i.e. waterfall  model), but they can be configured in an agile way according to the analysis needs.  In the following sections, we give an overview of the various modules (see six ECSMAF  modules in the figure above) and provide some examples demonstrating the kind of information  that may be delivered through each module. The rest of the elements shown in Figure 1,  namely Method, and Target Groups are discussed in Sections 2.2.5 and 1.3, respectively.  Report Types are presented by means of examples in the Annex A (see Annexes A1-A4).  2.1.1 Market structure and segmentation  The module Market Structure and Segmentation has an important role in the entire market  analysis. It is the phase where the scoping of the market analysis is being set. It consists of two  main steps: the determination of value chain at scope and the determination  corresponding value stack. The used definitions for value chain and value stack are as  follows:  • Value Chain: the term is used in accordance with the Porter’s Value Chain12. Given the  technological background focus of cybersecurity, emphasis is given to the primary value  chain elements operations and services, as well as the secondary elements, infrastructure,  technology development and procurement.  12 https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dstools/value-chain-/, accessed November 2021.  https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dstools/value-chain-/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  14  • Value Stack: value stack is a collection of various activities contributing to the value  production of an organisation. These activities may be manifold, supportive to a product or  service and are necessary/vital for a value production fulfilling certain standards (e.g.  quality, security, compliance, etc.). The Value Stack is considered particularly relevant for  technology13. Following a similar approach, we consider the value stack as an element to  decompose cybersecurity related topics. In ECSMAF, the value stack follows the structure  of the introduced cybersecurity market taxonomy, representing a decomposition of  cybersecurity topics and products, services and processes hereof. The cybersecurity  market taxonomy, and conversely the value stack, is a notion that transcends ECSMAF  and is used in various modules. A detail description of the cybersecurity taxonomy can be  found in Section 2.2.1.  Figure 2 depicts these two steps (determination of value chain at scope and the determination  of the corresponding value stack) as part of Market Structure and segmentation module.  Figure 2: Structure and steps within the module Market Structure and Segmentation  As regards the applicability of the above two steps, they heavily depend on the scoping  workflow foreseen before the use of the five modules described. This workflow –described in a  dedicated section below (see Section 2.2.2) - is of great importance for the identification of  primary and secondary value chain elements and the depth of their decomposition via the value  stack.  Main parameters for the scoping are:  • The market-research questions that need to be covered by the analysis;  • The identification of the necessary depth of analysis; and  • The availability of resources and sources for the market analysis (see examples of sources  in Figure 2).  13 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-stack-4-powers-creation-tech-companies-daan-witteveen/, accessed November  2021.  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-stack-4-powers-creation-tech-companies-daan-witteveen/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  15  Given the business sector, product, service or process under analysis, and the expectation of a  reasonable depth in the analysis, the determination of value chain at scope and the  determination of the corresponding value stack may result in:  • An infrastructure diagram within the boundaries of the defined focus;  • A set of products, service processes in focus;  • Any related technical and organisational assets involved in the above (e.g. procurement);  • Cybersecurity related elements (products, services and processes) involved, and  • Market parameters of the above regarding market sizes, cost structures (e.g. CAPEX,  OPEX, growth projections and geographic distribution).  Examples of information derived via the module Market Structure and Segmentation are given  in Annex A.1.  2.1.2 Demand-side research  Although research on demand-side is a well-established topic in market research14 , if it is  placed within a cybersecurity focus it implements an important and rather novel element: it aims  at capturing a variety of market-related information from (business-) end-users of cybersecurity  market products, services and processes. This includes information about value-chain and  value-stack of the relevant industry (i.e. the business value-chain to be protected), demand  volume and growth, market trends, maturity of operations, and requirements (e.g. derived from  the value-chain/value stack of the demand side, including thus procurement, operations and  infrastructure). In other words, demand-side research contributes towards understanding  protection requirements of valuable business assets. What it makes this module special is that it  encompasses:  • User-needs emerging from dynamic changes of threat exposure of available business  (through changes in the threat landscape);  • Requirements emerging from business and technological developments, and  • Experienced impact on businesses.  These dynamic changes are capable of leaving their footprint in the market at a high speed.  The structure of this module is depicted in Figure 3 below.  14 https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp, accessed November 2021.  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  16  Figure 3: Structure and steps within the module Demand-side Research  It is worth mentioning that the value-chain and value stack information of the demand side will  not be identical with the ones of supply. While the demand side is an analysis of user-needs  and requirements, supply side research takes into account market products offerings. The  juxtaposition of these two views allows for the identification of market gaps, a very desirable  piece of information in cybersecurity market analysis. Expectedly, potential market gaps will be  visible from the assessed market trends of the demand side (i.e. comparison between demand  requirements and functional characteristics of available product). On the contrary, assessed  maturity levels and requirements may be useful for the identification of available offerings of the  supply side.  The content of this ECSMAF module is created through an iterative process with the content of  the previous model, Market Structure and Segmentation:  the results from the execution of the  previous module (see Market Structure and Segmentation above) deliver input for Demand-side  Research. This happens by means of the value-chain elements identified in market structure.  Demand-side should detail value-chains (e.g. by providing value stack information), or, in case a  demand-side value-chain emerges in the demand-side assessment, it needs to be checked  upon compliance to the market structure/segmentation results. Value-chain and value stack  data have to be kept consistent in both modules.  As regards the results from the analysis, one can note the following:  • Demand volume and growth can be analysed starting from basic financial data.  However, depending on the detail of the analysis (e.g. value stack), such data might be  difficult to find/collect. Hereto, corresponding data sources will need to be used.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  17  • Market trends can be of manifold nature. Some industries - typically with low risk - might  need to follow technological developments. Others might orient themselves towards  changes in the threat landscape affecting their sector. In those cases, market trends can  be connected to technology foresight and threat analysis/landscaping, respectively.  • Cybersecurity maturity can be analysed through the penetration of cybersecurity products  in the value-chain of an organisation, through the ratio of cybersecurity spending in IT- investments, through the number of incidents impacting their business, level of  cybersecurity capability, etc.  • Security requirements – the most appropriate way to express demand needs – will be  possible/efficient for rather detailed analyses focussing on detail elements of value-chain.  Such data are usually difficult to find, especially if the market analysis scope included  various stakeholders with variating maturity. For some areas, however, it will be possible  and meaningful to track such requirements (e.g. in the area of certified products, services  and processes).  Examples of information derived via the module Demand-side research are given in Annex  4.1A.2.  2.1.3 Supply-side research  The module Supply-side research aims at analysing suppliers of cybersecurity products,  services and processes. The research of supply is a very commonly performed activity within  market analysis efforts. It is a baseline activity in market analysis and comprises a well-defined  and highly matured domain of market research15,16,17. So are the types of market reports  covering the supply-side analysis, e.g. Market Guides, Market Maps, Vendor Profile Ratings,  Market Shares and Market Size and Forecast. The structure of this module is depicted in Figure  4 below.  15 https://www.coursehero.com/file/53744086/supply-side-substitution-2682pdf/, accesses November 2021.  16 https://www.biblio.com/book/macroeconomics-private-public-choice-gwartney-james/d/1438025693, accessed November  2021.  17 http://faculty.citadel.edu/sobel/GwartneyEcon14e.pdf, accessed November 2021.  https://www.coursehero.com/file/53744086/supply-side-substitution-2682pdf/ https://www.biblio.com/book/macroeconomics-private-public-choice-gwartney-james/d/1438025693 http://faculty.citadel.edu/sobel/GwartneyEcon14e.pdf  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  18  Figure 4: Structure and steps within the module Supply-side Research  The three activities within this module have the following purpose:  • Select supplier types: Given the focus of the market analysis (see also section 2.2.2), a  set of supplier types will be selected. The various types of market stakeholders are drawn  from the collection of market stakeholder types (see also section 2.2.4). Corresponding  value-chain elements describing the products, services and processes will be identified for  each supplier type taken into consideration. The level of detail for the value chain will  depend on the focus of the market analysis exercise and will be in terms of value stack  elements (including cybersecurity-related value stack elements as described in Section  2.2.1).  • Create supplier mapping: Within this activity, the mapping of the vendors meeting value- chain, value stack and other criteria (e.g. geographies, sizes and growth) is being  performed. Some of these criteria are defined in module Market Structure and  Segmentation, while value-chain and value stack are subject of the parametrization, on the  one hand, and meet demand-side criteria/requirements on the other.  • Create supplier analysis report(s): In this activity, a supply-side report is created  consolidating the information created in the previous two phases (which are Select  supplier types and Create supplier mapping). The types of report should be selected  according to the market research questions and the target group of the analysis. Most  common report types for supplier-side research are (but not restricted to):  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  19  o Market Guide/Market Landscaping18: which is an overview of representative vendors;  o Market Map19: which defines the market from a supply-side perspective and should  be as comprehensive as possible w.r.t. value chain and value stack, in particular if it  is used as a baseline for market share analysis. The market map is a critical element  to estimate vendor revenues per market segment; (see report example 4.1A.3.1);  o Vendor Profiles20 and Rating21: where vendors are profiled and rated based on  different methodologies e.g. Company overview, SWOT profiling (Strengths /  Weaknesses / Opportunities / Threats), Magic Quadrant and Vendor Rating. Key  results are typically used / referenced in the market map e.g. vendor overall rating;  (see report example 4.1A.3.2);  o Market Share22: which is a report predominantly quantitative but usually  complemented with qualitative observations;  o Market Size and Forecast 23: where the baseline for market size is the revenue  determined by a market map.  In order to draw parts of the content of supply-side research, iteration cycles with demand-side  research, technology research and market structure will be necessary.  Examples of information derived via the module Supply-side research are given in Annex  4.1A.3.  2.1.4 Technology research  The aim of this module is to assess the impact of future technology and innovation in the  relevant market. While it takes into account technology foresight, it also assesses state-of-play  in research, thus estimating the readiness of available technology research results towards  market deployment. Based on this information, this module evaluates the impact of the adoption  of new technologies in the market, as well as time horizons for technology adoption. Though  instruments of the latter kind already exist24, the contextualization of such analyses for the area  of cybersecurity is still out of the scope: Important variables to such a contextualization for  cybersecurity technology may depend on different factors than in products, such as threats,  cybersecurity challenges, impact statements, compliance, etc. As an example hereto, one can  mention the necessity to map more generic trending information (e.g. digitization of everything)  to the specific sector/scope at hand (e.g. how digitization of everything applies to the automotive  sector).  Besides delivering evidence to perform market projections for prospective market sizes,  technology research delivers information about trends. Hence, it contributes to the other  modules - especially demand-side research -, by providing forecasts about upcoming demand- side requirements and technology-adoption preparedness and plans.  The activities of this module are presented in Figure 5 below:  18 https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/library/nonprofit-management-tools-and-trends/market-mapping-and-landscape- analysis, accessed November 2021.  19 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_mapping, accessed November 2021.  20 https://rfp360.com/vendor-profiles/, accessed November 2021.  21 https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/vendor-rating, accessed November 2021.  22 https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/market-share, accessed November 2021.  23 https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/market-sizing.htm, accessed November 2021.  24 https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle, accessed November 2021.  https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/library/nonprofit-management-tools-and-trends/market-mapping-and-landscape-analysis https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/library/nonprofit-management-tools-and-trends/market-mapping-and-landscape-analysis https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_mapping https://rfp360.com/vendor-profiles/ https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/vendor-rating https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/market-share https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/market-sizing.htm https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  20  Figure 5: Structure and steps within the module Technology research  The various steps depicted in Figure 5 above make up the full scale of the activities of the  module technology research. Below a short description of each step is given:  • Set forecast scope: In this step, the scope of the module is being set. It consists of  defining the objectives by means of concentrating on a certain part of technology and time- horizon, by also taking into account the overall scoping of the cybersecurity market  analysis scoping and customisation, as described in Section 2.2.2 below. Within the remits  of this customisation, a horizon-scanning activity, followed by the selection of the relevant  technologies and trends within the defined period is being performed.  • Scenario and technology map: By means of scenarios built for the use of the technology  in scope, indicative development of trends is simulated. The scenario-building activity is  important for understanding the context of technology-adoption within a use-case and its  stakeholders, helping understanding its effects in all dimensions of the use-case. Based on  the scenarios, a technology map is being developed to demonstrate the role/adoption of  each technology in scope in the scenario constellation. For each particular scenario, an  initial threat and risk assessment is being developed.  • Identify challenges: Besides the assessed threat and risks of the previous step,  stakeholder requirements for the various scenarios are being collected. Together the  outcome of the threat/risk assessment of the previous step, requirements build up the  basis for envisaging mitigation options/actions. Mitigation of risks, reduction of threat  surface and fulfilment option of stakeholder requirements is the main source for the  identification of cybersecurity challenges in relation to new technologies. Further to that,  additional, cybersecurity-independent challenges are being envisaged. Technology  challenges are related to deployment, operational and societal issues of technology  adoption.  • Check research readiness: In this step, research results – relevant to technology areas  in scope - from various open source research activities (e.g. European projects, national  and international research actions/projects), will be assessed in terms of their readiness  levels25. In this way, the maturity of available research results will be estimated. This  information leads to the identification of gaps and opportunities related to the successful  deployment of available research results that might influence innovation in the market  25 https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/technology_readiness_revisited_-_icegov2020.pdf, accessed November 2021.  https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/technology_readiness_revisited_-_icegov2020.pdf  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  21  segment in scope. As this task is highly prioritized within EU (e.g. European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre, European Innovation Council, ENISA and in particular the work of the  ENISA Research and Innovation Team26), it is tightly related to actions around  strengthening European research and innovation agenda.  • Perform market forecasts: The above-mentioned information is used in the performance  of forecasts for adoption options of (cybersecurity) technology in the market. It will mainly  be based on the assessed opportunities for the analysed use-cases/scenarios. If required,  it may also propose corrective actions for filling identified gaps, should those being sought  as enablers of major marked drivers in the technology field, sector and geographical area  in scope. The resulting proposals constitute market adoption measures for the  technologies at scope.  As indicated in Figure 5, the majority of the discussed steps (1-4), are related to other  disciplines than purely those relevant to market analysis. In particular, steps 1-3 (Set forecast  scope, Scenario and technology map, and Identify challenges) are subject of the thematic area  of foreseeing, an activity that is included in the ENISA Single Programming Document and  covered by already published ENISA work27. Whereas step 4 (Check research readiness) is a  component of the work area of Research and Innovation, covered by a dedicated team within  ENISA28. These interfaces underline the links of cybersecurity market analysis with other  disciplines and establish important knowledge exchanges hereto. By activating these interfaces  within cybersecurity market research, all available ENISA results will be fully integrated into  market analysis efforts.  Examples of information derived via the module Technology Research are given in Annex  4.1A.4.  2.1.5 Macro-Environmental Factors and Economic Market  Characteristics  Market analysis is typically carried out by considering multiple perspectives, in order to provide  a compressive overview of key trends. In this respect, the PEST analysis29 is one of the most  frequently applied measurement tool used to analyse how four external factors (Political,  Economic, Social and Technology)30 affect the operations of an organisation or a specific  market segment  Once analysed through PEST, these factors would help public and private organisations  understand potential impacts through scenarios, take better decisions, allocate resources more  efficiently and introduce changes to generate improvements in suboptimal and impacted areas.  PEST methodology is also employed for tracking developments across these four factors,  identify current and future opportunities and risks, allowing for effective preparation of how to  best manage them.  The process for carrying out the PEST analysis typically include the following main stages:  • Identification of the key events within the four external factors;  • Analysis of possible impacts on the organisation or market segment;  • Categorization into opportunities and threats: and  • Tracking of the trends.  26 See ENISA organisational chart, in particular Research and Innovation team (RIT): https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about- enisa/structure-organization, accessed December 2021.  27 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/foresight-challenges, accessed December 2021.  28 ENISA organisational chart: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization, accessed December 2021.  29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEST_analysis, accessed December 2021.  30 Variants that build on the PEST framework include PESTLE, which puts more emphasis on the legal and environmental  factors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/foresight-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEST_analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  22  On this basis, organizations can develop corrective or pre-emptive strategic actions.  The following PEST analysis example clarifies how the four external factors work and what type  of information should be included in the analysis:  Table 1: PEST analysis example  Due to its wider applicability and good-practice status, PEST analysis is used within ECSMAF in  the Macro-Environmental Factors and Economic Market Characteristics modules (see Figure 1)  to determine how these external factors affect the performance and trends of a market segment  under examination. PEST analysis will complement the other insight layers adding new  perspectives and potential scenarios, especially technology research, where trends are  assessed.  The present section provides additional details regarding the external factors part of the PEST  analysis with illustrative examples for each factor.  The Political factor of the PEST methodology aims to assess how new government policies  and changes in legislation affect a specific market segment or organizations’ operations. Typical  examples are tax, employment, environmental and judicial laws. The Political factor also  encompasses aspects such the general political climate of a country, the degree of government  stability, as well as its international relations and posture, as well as issued regulations.  The Economic factor of the PEST methodology aims to assess the key determinants of a  certain economy’s performance such as the inflation rates, exchange rates, cost of production,  economic growth, disposable income of consumers and, unemployment rate. These  determinants may have a direct or indirect impact on organizations and market segments, for  example, a trend in a certain direction may affect the purchasing power of consumers and could  change the demand/supply models in the economy. As a result, the way organisations price  their products and services on the market can also change.  The Social factor refers to the demographic characteristics, cultural attitudes and customs of  the population within which organizations operate. Typically, this includes trends such as the  population growth rate, age distribution, income distribution, cultural barriers and, emerging  Factor Political Economic Social Technological  Event  e.g. increased  geopolitical  tensions;  e.g. cost of  production  e.g. emerging  cultural  consciousness  e.g. technological  advancements  Possible impact  e.g. trade barriers  to protect domestic  suppliers;  e.g. high energy  price may increase  cost of production  e.g. adjust to new  consumers’  preferences such as  environmental  concerns  e.g. new technology  can be adopted to  be ahead of  competitors  Type of impact  (opportunity and  threat)  negative possibly negative unknown positive  Tendency unchanged increasing increasing unchanged  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  23  lifestyle attitudes and consciousness (e.g. environmental, privacy and health) affecting  consumers’ behaviours and preferences.  The technological factor pertains to innovations in technology that may affect the operations of  organizations and a specific market segment. This factor refers to technology advancement and  maturity, the emergence of disruptive technologies, the level of innovation, automation,  research and development (R&D) activity, technological change and the amount of  technological awareness that a market possesses. These factors may influence decisions to  adopt new technologies, enter or not other sectors, launch or not other products or outsource  production activities.  An overview of the PEST method is given in the figure below (see Figure 6):  Figure 6: Overview of PEST method as adopted within ECSMAF  Some examples of the various PEST components are given in Annex 4.1A.4.3  2.2 CONTEXTUALIZED ECSMAF COMPONENTS  As the content and structure of market analysis effort heavily depends on the scope and  purpose, so does also cybersecurity market analysis. Hence, within ECSMAF, parametrization  holds a significant role. Through a series of ECSMAF-internal elements, the analysis can be  adapted to the needs, be it the definition of the value chain, the selection of the reports type to  be produced, the number of ECSMAF modules to be performed, the method for information  collection, etc.  In this section, we present the elements of the proposed method that allow for the customisation  of the scope and content that will be covered in the analysis. It has to be noted, that the need  for such components emerges from the complexity of cybersecurity value chains.  In the below sections, the parametrized elements of ECSMAF are discussed in more detail.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  24  2.2.1 Scoping the analysis and ECSMAF parametrization  During the development of ECSMAF, but also through a performed pilot in the area of IoT31 and  discussions within the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Cybersecurity Market32, it became  apparent that for the purpose of each cybersecurity market research analysis effort, it is key to  identify the scope, prior to the performance of the analysis. In other words, the use of the  proposed frameworks needs to possess an inherent agility, to cover the specific needs of any  potential analysis focus (i.e. depth and breadth of the analysis).  The foreseen agility of the method will lead to a selection of the modules to be performed, while  it will allow for different types of reports, data collection methods and outcomes. All these  variables will heavily depend on the scope of the analysis. This fact underlines the non-waterfall  nature of the proposed framework, as regards the use and sequence of the presented modules:  only the elements that lead to the coverage of the proposed scope will be subject of a  cybersecurity market analysis effort.  In order to perform necessary parametrization of ECSMAF during setting the scope, a workflow  has been developed. The structure and content of the workflow is presented in Figure 7 below.  Figure 7: Structure and content of the ECSMAF parametrization workflow  The above workflow consists of various phases (depicted through various rectangles) as  described below:  • Stakeholders: These are actors that are entitled/mandated to propose ideas for priorities  for the performance of cybersecurity market analysis. They might be institutional  stakeholders participating in the ENISA process (e.g. Member States, Commission and  other EUIBAs), Industrial Associations, Stakeholder Groups, but also ENISA-internal  stakeholders, such as ENISA Management Team, and ENISA Advisory Group (AG). For  this initial market analysis framework, input in this respect is provided by the ENISA  Management Team and by the Members of the newly established ENISA ad hoc Working  Group on EU Cybersecurity MarketError! Bookmark not defined..  31 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grids, accessed April 2022.  32 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market, accessed  November 2012.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cybersecurity-market-analysis-iot-in-distribution-grids https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  25  • Set the scope: the input of stakeholders is “passed” through an activity whose purpose is  to set the scope of the proposed cybersecurity market-analysis effort and identify their  priority. For this purpose, proposed ideas are checked upon a number of criteria that allow  for the assessment of their relevance/priority. The criteria check the relevance of a  submitted cybersecurity market analysis idea w.r.t. various facts, such as:  • What is the trigger of the cybersecurity market analysis (e.g. policy action, investment  strategy, market intervention policy, market-supportive measures, incident/threat,  necessary risk mitigation, observed market trends, etc.)?  • What intended to be part of an analysis (demand, supply, market penetration of  products, market requirements, etc.)?  • What is the exact content of the value-chain and value stack in scope (depth vs.  breadth)?  • What are the main economic criteria for the market scanning (e.g. market size, demand  size, growth, market gaps, etc.)?  In this initial framework such criteria are quite basic; hence, they are used currently in a  rather qualitative manner. Some work on in this area is planned for the forthcoming version  of ECSMAF, following initial experiences collected by the classification/mapping of  currently submitted proposals. Obviously, due some urgent topics that can emerge, ad hoc  cybersecurity market analysis requests may also arise, e.g. due to some incidents, and  global happenings in cybersecurity. This depicted in the figure through the rectangle  labelled as “Ad hoc requests”. All produced proposals (including the criteria met), will  undergo a validation by ENISA stakeholders (i.e. ENISA Management and ENISA bodies).  • Cybersecurity market-research questions: In this phase, the scope set for a specific  analysis is translated into a set of so-called “market-research” questions. These are  obviously the questions that the particular cybersecurity market analysis is supposed to  answer. Those questions allow for the identification of the content of the resulting analysis.  Therefore, at this stage, an estimation of the effort needs to be performed. By taking into  account the available resources the feasibility of the analysis should be checked (see  rectangle labelled “Resources”). If the comparison does not balance, an adaptation of the  questions and/or the available resources might be necessary.  • Market-research domain: This activity stands for the identification of the domain/sector to  be analysed. It consists of identifying the infrastructure at stake, the value chain/value  stack of the domain and the various assets and actors involved (both at the demand and  supply-side, depending on the scope). Though this activity is independent from market  analysis subjects, it is essential for the understanding of the sector/domain in scope. Its  performance will require solid sectoral knowledge that will need to be brought in to the  market analysis effort through sector/domain experts.  • ECSMAF modules customisation (embracing Selection of ECSMAF modules, Research  Methodology and Report Types): In this phase, once the scope, the market-research  questions, the identification of the relevant domain/sector have been performed, a decision  about the ECSMAF modules to be included in the analysis is being made. The selection  takes into account available resources. In order to accompany the analysis and run the  effort, relevant stakeholders, partners and tools are identified (see rectangle labelled  ENISA Market Research Resources, Stakeholders and Partners).  Although the elements of the above-mentioned parametrisation have been identified at this  stage of ECSMAF development, further work regarding their quantification is necessary. Within  the performed pilot of the framework, the parametrisation was oriented towards empirical  methods proposed by the pilot project team. Additional input is expected from the experience  collected by the work of the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on this matter (i.e. prioritisation of  prospective cybersecurity market research areas).  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  26  2.2.2 Cybersecurity market taxonomy  The main challenge in cybersecurity market analysis is the “blurriness” in the identification of the  offerings included existing cybersecurity products, services and processes. A typical example is  the market segment of Managed Security Services: while some companies include Security  Operation Centre functions, Threat Analysis, Penetration testing, etc., others are more  protection-device oriented, covering firewalls, end-point security, configuration management,  etc. This diversification of services that are sold under the same name, makes market analyses  for this market sector imprecise and often incomparable, both regarding supply and demand  sides (e.g.33 and 34). The complexity of cybersecurity offerings comes to aggravate the  “blurriness” issue of performed analyses.  In order to alleviate this deficiency, the proposed framework adopts the concept of a  cybersecurity product, service and process taxonomy. Its aim is to deliver widely  recognised, sharply defined categories for cybersecurity offerings. The cybersecurity taxonomy  used within ECSMAF has been derived from relevant work already performed within the EU, in  particular within a cooperation between the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre  (JRC)35 and the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO)36. While the ECSMAF  taxonomy is based on this material, some minor (structural) adaptations have been performed,  in order to adjust it to the detail and structure conceived for mapping cybersecurity market  offerings. To this extent, the taxonomy presented in this section is an initial version: both  through experiences gained from cybersecurity market analysis pilots and through an envisaged  cooperation between ENISA, JRC and ECSO, a consolidation back to the original JRC- taxonomy37 will be performed. Aim of this cooperation is to create a single, multi-purpose and  managed reference, while at the same time make it as comprehensive as possible w.r.t.  additional cybersecurity elements38. Additional steps to ensure the acceptance of this material  will be initiated (e.g. open dialogue with private and public actors in this area).  Just as it is required within the various modules of ECSMAF, the used cybersecurity taxonomy  is split into three levels, covering various levels of value stack details, each one decomposing its  predecessor. The level of detail to be considered in each cybersecurity market analysis  depends on the selected scope and the depth. To this extent, the selection of the detail of the  analysis is parametrised during the scoping of the analysis, so as to better match the objectives  set (see also section 2.2.1).  At this point it should be noted, that the introduction of a cybersecurity taxonomy within market  analysis efforts is a novelty. None of the contemporary market analysis methods seems to  introduce such an instrument in order to enhance transparency, comparability and “sharpness”  within market analyses.  The developed taxonomy concentrates mainly on cybersecurity value stack. Other, non-security  related value chains and value stack elements that will be encountered through market analysis  (i.e. vertical industries, see also Figure 8), are not covered in this version of the document.

The identification of market trends is explicitly mentioned in CSA1. The challenge  with market trends lies mainly on the fact that they emerge from a variety of factors, while they  may be of generic nature, but also sector-specific. The identification of the degree of relevance  of market trends for a specific analysis requires a multi-level assessment to cover all these  dimensions. ECSMAF takes this challenge fully into account.  Firstly, it foresees the identification of technology trends at the level of the module Technology  Research. These are trends related to generic technology development/emergence issues, as  result of generic, sector-independent foresight efforts46. Secondly, trends will be identified within  the defined scope of the cybersecurity market analysis through the activities of the ECSMAF  modules Marco-Environmental Factors and Economic Market Characteristics (see also  Section 2.1.5). The scope-related trend assessments are going to be performed under the  context of supply and demand characteristics of the current analysis, thus adding an additional  level of detail to the more generic trends assessment.  Subsequently, identified trends will be taken into account in the activities of ECSMAF modules  Demand-side research (see Section 2.1.2) and Supply-side research (see Section 2.1.3).  As an experience gained from the performed ECSMAF pilot in 2021, one can note the following:  depending on the market research method chosen (in this case using an external market  analysis organisation/service) and the foreseen analysis resources, available trending  information can be used as-is (i.e. as provided by the contractor), without performing the  corresponding ECSMAF modules. This approach can deliver satisfactory results, when the  trends happen to be already identified by market analysts. In case of “deeper” analyses of  emerging sectors/technologies, however, it might be meaningful to perform these modules to  identify trends in a more targeted manner for the area/sector in focus. The costs of such an  effort might be justified by the benefit of the analysis precision.  After the performance of cybersecurity market analyses, the identified market trends will be – as  far as possible – consolidated back to relevant trending information provided by relevant ENISA  projects/efforts to a single trending record, enhancing thus comprehensiveness of available  trending knowledge.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  32  2.2.4 Market stakeholder types  The identification of market stakeholder types that are subject to a specific cybersecurity  market analysis are very important for the achievement of the analysis objectives. They are  primarily determined from the scope of the analysis (i.e. which types of businesses the market  analysis should concentrate on?), but also from various other factors, such as types of market  stakeholder dynamics (i.e. innovation power, quick rates, niche-product development, research  oriented, etc.).  Another important element in market stakeholder type identification is the association to a  specific vertical industry. The importance of this piece of information is twofold:  • Firstly, the use of a uniform vertical industry name convention increases transparency and  comparability of achieved analysis reports.  • Secondly, to every vertical industry, a certain value chain (including value stack) can be  assumed, that characterize their core business. This allows performance of more precise  mappings of their turnover. Furthermore, his will further enhance transparency and  comparability and also help highlight nuances among various market stakeholders acting  in the same industry.  It is worth mentioning, that stakeholder types and vertical industries are used within both the  demand- and supply-side market research.  As regards first experiences in the performed pilot regarding stakeholder types, some indicative  ones are provided below, including value chain and value stack information, both for their main  business and cybersecurity services:  • Multi-domain industrial asset vendors: Have a broad and solid market offering when it  comes to the provision of products, services and processes in a certain domain. Below  some examples of their offerings:  Value Chain: Hardware, Software, Implementation, Advisory and Consulting, Managed  Services.  Value Stack IT: Management Platforms, Connectivity, Remote Sensors, Remote  Operation.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Application security software, Cloud security, Data security,  Identity and access management, Infrastructure protection software, Network security,  Advisory, Implementation, Managed security services.  • Multi-domain vendors: Have capabilities in those areas that are critical to collect,  manage and maintain user requirements and information on product, services and  processes, offering thus customised solutions. Below some examples of their offerings:  Value Chain: Software, Implementation, Advisory and Consulting, Managed Services.  Value Stack IT: Management Platforms, Connectivity.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Application security software, Cloud security, Data security,  Identity and access management, Infrastructure protection software, Network security,  Advisory, Implementation, Managed security services.  • Single-domain specialised vendors: Have targeted, specialised capabilities in a specific  domain, covering wide range of customer requirements in a narrow technological  spectrum. Below some examples of their offerings:  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  33  Value Chain: Hardware, Software, Advisory, Implementation.  Value Stack IT: Management Platforms, Connectivity, Fault detection, Remote Operation.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Application security software, Cloud security, Data security,  Identity and access management, Infrastructure protection software, Network security,  Advisory, Implementation, Managed security services.  • Cybersecurity specialist vendors: Are specialised in cybersecurity market segments,  often ones that are not part of core portfolios of by larger vendors. They emerged in  developing cybersecurity market segments where they leverage innovative, state-of-the-art  cybersecurity technologies to ensure differentiation. Below some examples of their  offerings:  Value Cain: Hardware, Software and Advisory.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Identity and access management, Network security, Hardware  security modules, Advisory, Threat analysis, Risk Management, Penetration testing.  As regards vertical industries, an initial proposal is presented in Figure 8 below. With increasing  experience in cybersecurity market analysis but also by considering available best practices40,  this list is going to be updated/consolidated accordingly. It is worth mentioning, that these  vertical industries in the current version do not entail any cybersecurity related industries.  Cybersecurity is assumed as “horizontal” to these industries. Moreover, the core value chain  and value stack (i.e. product, service and process offerings) of those industries may entail  cybersecurity as an integrated part of the offering that is built-in feature of their offerings and not  as their main product.  40 https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/10/january-2021-cyber-attacks-statistics/, accessed December 2021.  https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/10/january-2021-cyber-attacks-statistics/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  34  Figure 8: Proposed list of vertical industries (initial, non-exhaustive)  2.2.5 Methods for collecting market data  The method chosen for the collection of market analysis data is of major role for the utilization of  the available resources and the achievement of the targeted quality of findings, in accordance to  the scope of the analysis (see also discussion in Section 2.2.1).  The existing methods for data collection41 (also depicted in Figure 1 through the box labelled  Method) consist of:  • Primary research: Consists of collection of data directly from organization that is targeted  by the market analysis effort (i.e. relevant market stakeholder types from relevant vertical  41 https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/blog/how-conduct-market-research-small-businesses, accessed December 2021.  https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/blog/how-conduct-market-research-small-businesses  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  35  industry, see Section 2.2.4). Primary research is usually implemented through surveys and  interviews (online, per phone or mail). This method has the advantage of direct  involvement in the collection, the possibility to steer the discussion with interviewed  organizations and the ownership of the collected data. A disadvantage of this methods is  that it might imply quite significant costs.  • Secondary research: This research consists of data collection from already published,  open source (OSINT) market analysis information. It is usually sufficient to provide a good  generic overview on market issues related to a specific domain. It should be the principal  choice in the starting phases of market research efforts, for example during the scoping of  an analysis (see also Section 2.2.1). The advantage of this method is its low costs, its  efficiency and ownership of collected data. A disadvantage might be that the information  publicly available might be limited or inaccurate.  • Use of market analyst services: The research can be contracted to external market  analyst companies. They provide “turnkey” market analyses given a number of “(market)  research questions”. Though this method leverages on existing skills and data collection  infrastructure, it is necessary to precisely formulate the research questions and ensure that  the analysis will produce the desired results in the desired manner (i.e. report types). This  can be achieved, for example, by performing a scoping exercise, as described in Section  2.2.1 above, prior to contracting a market analyst organisation. A disadvantage of this  method is that the collected data will reside by the contractor.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  36  3. RELATED AREAS  As mentioned in CSA1, cybersecurity market analysis is a multi-purpose tool that can be used in  a variety of ways towards developing cybersecurity within Europe. In this chapter we provide  information on how cybersecurity market analysis interacts with other areas, respectively how  other areas may contribute or may profit from available market analysis efforts.  • Certification: Cybersecurity market analysis very relevant for certification. Through  targeted market analyses, the market effects of certification can be identified: market  analysis can help assessing the market penetration of various certification labels (including  prospective EU labels). Moreover, market analysis can provide insights about the size and  value chains of organisations engaging in certification businesses, with the objective, for  example, to strengthen their market presence. From initial experience through the  ECSMAF pilotError! Bookmark not defined., it became apparent, that cybersecurity certification  market analyses will need to have a narrower scope. In order to assess certification needs,  for example, the efficiency of current protection policies need to be illuminated. This  means, that “deeper” levels of the cybersecurity value stack will need to be taken into  account; or detailed assets exposure to threats need to be considered. In both cases, the  analysis will need to embrace particular details of the relevant assets in scope. Having  said that, it seems more appropriate to analyse certification needs vial second or even  third tire “dives” into product, service and process structures to assess the effects of or the  need for certification. The interaction between cybersecurity certification and market  analysis may be:  Cybersecurity certification -> Cybersecurity market analysis: may support cybersecurity  market analysis during the phase of setting the scope, by providing distinct sector and the  elements (assets) of the infrastructure to be analysed.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity certification: Market analysis can provide  proposals for areas to be taken into account for cybersecurity certification. These may be  particular infrastructure parts that have been assessed by means of market gaps, while  they are considered to be important parts/enabler of value stack elements.  • Cybersecurity Research and Innovation: Cybersecurity market analysis has a strong  relevance to research and innovation. This is manifested via the role of technology trends  for supply and demand market dynamics in the resulting market analysis. Such trends may  be developed within research and innovation work. Moreover, innovation actions, in  particular (e.g. deployment activities, establishment of research priorities, innovation  activities, etc.), generate market drivers that will affect internal market. Hence, research  and innovation information is best suited as input towards parametrization of ECSMAF for  targeted cybersecurity market analyses. On the other hand, cybersecurity market analysis  can provide valuable input regarding market gaps and niches that can affect research and  innovation strategies, aiming at strengthening internal market.  Cybersecurity research and innovation -> Cybersecurity market analysis: may provide  trending information according to identified research and innovation priorities. It may  provide scoping information for areas/technologies/sectors that have been addressed in  research activities and seem to be good candidates for deployment actions.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity research and innovation: Cybersecurity  market analysis can be performed prior to the identification of research and innovation  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  37  actions, as a form of “market scouting” effort. By extrapolating market gap / market niche  information to existing (matured) research results and/or innovation areas, for example,  one can assess their adequacy/potential as market enablers.  • Policy actions: Cybersecurity market analysis can be an important tool during impact  assessments performed within policy proposals. As market is a strong indicator, but also  discrete focus of most polity actions, the performance of analyses within the scope of  policy actions is very useful. One point that could be stated at this point as example is the  policy area of strategic autonomy and sovereignty: cybersecurity market analysis can  contribute towards identification of dependencies of cybersecurity supply chains, degree of  market domination by various types of vendors in various cybersecurity topics,  identification of (regional) demand requirements, etc. Such information may generate  strong evidence for prospective targeted policy actions in the area of cybersecurity. On the  other hand, policy actions can deliver proper scoping information towards targeted market  analyses (e.g. market segment, desired market outcomes and market stakeholder types  (demand and supply sides)).  Policy actions -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Policy actions can provide concrete scope  for cybersecurity market analysis, either within impact assessment, or for the purpose of  evaluation of issued policy actions for various market segments.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Policy actions: Cybersecurity market analysis can deliver  valuable information regarding estimated market trends and/or observed market effects of  policy actions. It can also provide insights about discrete parts of cybersecurity value  chain, in support of evidence needed to issue new or further develop existing policy  actions. In addition, market analysis is a key element of market observatories, mentioned  in various policy documents (see also next bullet point).  • Cybersecurity market observatories: Market observatories perform wide-scope  assessments w.r.t. various market parameters (i.e. dynamics, price development, demand  development, identification of market players, etc.)42,43,44. Cybersecurity market analysis  overlaps with observatories, as far as a broader scope is taken into account. Here, a clear  synergy potential does exist, as far as used analysis techniques and experiences on  market analyses is concerning. This is particularly interesting in cases of observatories  established within Member States and/or EU-Institutions: here the synergies with ENISA  are evident, as a stronger exchange, both at the level of analysis method and market data  exchange may emerge.  Cybersecurity market observatories -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Multiple synergies  can be implemented, both regarding knowledge transfers regarding the used market  analysis method and collected information (both raw data and market analysis findings).  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity market observatories: All relevant outputs  from cybersecurity market analysis can be easily adopted by cybersecurity observatories,  depending on the maturity level available or planned capabilities. As regards institutional  observatories of EU/Member States, ENISA actively seeks for cooperation opportunities,  among other things by means of the established ad hoc Working Group of EU  Cybersecurity MarketError! Bookmark not defined..  • Incidents / threats /risks landscaping: Cybersecurity market analysis uses incident,  threat and risk information/assessments in order to identify market trends and possibly  42 https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/, accessed December 2021.  43 https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/cyber-security-europe/, accessed December 2021.  44 https://www.cyberwatching.eu/, accessed December 2021.  https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/ https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/cyber-security-europe/ https://www.cyberwatching.eu/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  38  scoping information for analysis: often, observed incidents and threat exposures lead to  the deployment of new products (e.g. ransomware protection offerings45). Moreover, threat  exposure and incident statistics have been turned to be a useful criterion in scoping the  ECSMAF pilot performed in 2021. Though possible, we do not assume at the time being  that cybersecurity market analysis can contribute to incidents, threat and risk landscapes  content-wise. Nonetheless, market analysis may contribute to the assessment of demand- requirements, as well as usage of products, services and processes related to incident,  threat and risk management (i.e. management platforms, managed services and product  offerings).  Incidents / threats /risks landscaping -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Cybersecurity  market analysis can process landscaping information as an important criterion to set foci of  market analyses.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Incidents / threats /risks landscaping: Cybersecurity  market analysis may analyse market data of existing offerings w.r.t. products, services and  processes covering incident, threat and risk assessment and management.  • Emerging trends - Foresight46: As indicated in the discussion so far, emerging trends  play a multiple role within cybersecurity market analysis. Firstly within the module  technology research; but are also part of macro-economic factors. Furthermore, they are  also a useful insight even at the scoping phase. For these reasons, it is expected that an  intense interaction between market analysis and foresight will be necessary. But also  market analysis results may be useful for foresight: it might be the case, that the  performance of a market analysis produces trending information for a certain, relatively  narrow-scoped area/sector that might be an interesting feedback for foresight (i.e. was  originally out of scope of a certain foresight focus). Such information, if deemed relevant,  may be fed to consecutive iterations of the foresing exercise, or serve as validation of  already created forecasts.  Emerging trends – Foresight -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Emerging trends provide  valuable information to cybersecurity market analysis by means of trending information  that can be used for technology research and potentially for macro-environmental factors.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Emerging trends – Foresight: Cybersecurity market  analysis may provide some more detailed information to foresight, related to some  “deeper” trends that have been assessed within analyses with more specific foci.  • Cybersecurity index: An ENISA-activity in the area of cybersecurity index aims at the  creation of composite cybersecurity index providing for an aggregated assessment of the  maturity level of cybersecurity across the EU. Its aim is to map the impact of cybersecurity  by means of quantitative and qualitative indexes and on developing cybersecurity  taxonomies and (quantitative and qualitative) assessments of cybersecurity. As it can be  assumed that cybersecurity market maturity is one key dimension for the cybersecurity  maturity within the EU, market analysis results may directly flow in the cybersecurity index  as additional qualitative/quantitative data. Equally important is the use of a consolidated  taxonomy, as it will enable comparability of cybersecurity topics. Another element is the  provision of scoping information to market analysis: maturity cybersecurity (from low to  high) can become an interesting focus for market analysis.

Last but not least,  product, service and process maturity issues are subject of market analysis too (see  demand-side research in Section 2.1.2). This information can be mutually exchanged  among cybersecurity index and market analysis as described below:  Cybersecurity index -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Cybersecurity index can provide  scoping information for cybersecurity market analysis. Moreover, it maintains a taxonomy  that can be input to and/or consolidated with the cybersecurity market taxonomy.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity index: Cybersecurity market can assess  maturity of products, services and processes. Should they be in the focus of a market  analysis, they can serve as input to the cybersecurity index. Equally, the developed  cybersecurity market taxonomy can be used as input to and/or consolidated with the  cybersecurity index taxonomy.  Concluding this chapter, we would like to state that quite few of the interaction points mentioned  above are covered through regular interactions/coordination, mainly with ENISA-internal  stakeholders/units, but also external ones. Some of those are going to lead to activities in 2022,  and are covered in the forthcoming chapter by means of future work (see Section 4.1).  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  40  4. ISSUES, CONSIDERATIONS,  CONCLUSIONS  In 2021, ENISA was in the position to start building capabilities in the area of cybersecurity  market analysis. The framework presented in this report, an initial pilot of the framework and the  creation of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on the EU Cybersecurity Market have been the  main activities performed by the Agency in 2021 in this area.  4.1 GENERAL REMARKS  The market research for the pilot of the framework has been conducted by a major market  analyst organisation. From this initial experience in the area of market analysis, the issues  surfaced can be summarized as follows and some general remarks can be made:  • Cybersecurity market analysis is at a crossroad: When cybersecurity meets market  analysis, one can speak about a meeting point of two different disciplines: a highly,  structured, relatively new technological area comes to profit from one area of economics  with much longer record and established methods. In order to establish the mutual  understanding of these disciplines, a significant knowledge transfer is necessary:  cybersecurity specialists need to understand the functioning rules of the market, while  economists/analysts need to gain an insight of the cybersecurity product, service and  process landscape. It seems that this is the root-cause for vivid discussions between  cybersecurity experts and market analysts e.g. regarding terminology and used analysis  methods, report content and structure. It has become evident, that there some time is  needed for both disciplines to mutually understand each-other, and that the development  of some basic tools to pass this knowledge are necessary (e.g. cybersecurity market  taxonomy).  • Scoping is the key to success: Scoping, in Scoping the analysis, in particular defining  the area of the cybersecurity market to focus the analysis on, is maybe the most important,  yet not simplest step in market analysis efforts. Firstly, because security is a matter that  can only be analysed when a certain depth of knowledge has been reached. Secondly,  because of the divergence of views and methodological backgrounds between involved  experts (see also previous point). Hence, at the current stage of “bridging” cybersecurity  and market analysis, knowledge exchanges need to take place in order to understand how  a cybersecurity scope can be formulated, how can it be “translated” into (market-) research  questions, and how much effort is necessary to achieve the expected outcome at the  expected quality.  • Your data vs. my data vs. our market data: The data collection strategy has to be  selected in accordance with to the market analysis strategy. There are a number of  questions that matter in this respect, such as: Is market data collection and analysis going  to be mostly contracted or mostly done in-house? Are the market analysis objectives for a  certain domain/sector fixed, or they might variate over time? What are the long-term  approaches for cybersecurity market analysis efforts (one-off, repetitive, iterative,  evolutionary, dynamic, variating)? Are raw data for a certain analysis interesting for longer  term, or just the market analysis results count? Are raw data for the defined scope the  already available, or need to be raised through dedicated surveys? Are available data free  of bias! Answering these questions should be a priority for the determination of the amount  of resources, for selecting market research methods (primary, secondary, outsourcing), for  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  41  selecting a data management approach and for establishing a corresponding human and  toll infrastructure (including confidentiality issues, see next point).  • Confidentiality issue emerging from collected market data: Given the nature of raw  market data, - both at the supply and demand sides - they entail a mix of competitive,  confidential and intellectual property related information. Hence, specific confidentiality  requirements emerge for the use/processing of this information, or even parts of it (i.e.  processing, storage, management, dissemination, etc.). The inhered confidentiality of  market information may be an inhibitor for the motivation of stakeholder to provide this  information, unless a trust relationship and evidence for adequate processing techniques  are available (i.e. data protection in transit and at rest, anonymization, implementation of  relevant security controls, etc.). These issues need to be addressed, the latest when this  information is stored and processed locally.  4.2 OPEN ISSUES AND WAYS FORWARD  Concluding this report, we would like to highlight a series of open issues that should constitute  the short to middle term priorities in advancing the work on the EU cybersecurity market. ENISA  will draw from these points the actions to be performed in the area of market analysis in 2022  and 2023. Identified open points that fall in the responsibility of other players in the EU  ecosystem are proposal that will be validated by, discussed and followed up with the  corresponding entities.  Cybersecurity Market and ENISA:  • Streamline ECSMAF content: The content of the framework needs to be better specified  in a greater detail level for some ECSMAF modules and horizontal components. This will  include identification of economic sizes to be measured, consolidation of vertical industries  and identification of content of report types. The highest priority will be the creation of a  coherent/consolidate taxonomy, allowing for usage within various cybersecurity topics  (incidents, threats, market analysis, cybersecurity index, etc.). Hereto, a cooperation with  JRC is envisaged.  • Perform scoping exercises: Scoping of analysis is a key activity within ECSMAF. It will  be very important to gain experience with this activity, including defining criteria, checking  parametrization techniques to cover variating foci (e.g. wide vs. deep analyses, thematic  vs. generic analyses, iterative vs. one-off analyses, etc.). This work will help towards better  representing scope for various cybersecurity market analysis topics and various detail  levels of analysis (e.g. certification).  • Tooling for Cybersecurity Market Analysis: The development of necessary tools for the  performance of primary and secondary market research is important for the market  analyses. These tools include tools for storage of collected information (database),  creation of reports based on analytics, and availability of a means for performing own  primary research (surveys, questions).  • Continue coordination: As indicated in Chapter 3, cybersecurity market analysis has  various interfaces to other ENISA activities. The coordination of this work will be a main  priority for 2022 and beyond.  Cybersecurity Market and Member States:  • Identify and establish synergies: Member States have already or are about to establish  cybersecurity market surveillance functions, notably for “monitoring the compliance of ICT  products […] with the requirements of the European cybersecurity certificates”1. Such  activities will create important synergies in the area of cybersecurity market analysis, both  within Member States and with ENISA. The identification of the state-of-play with regard to  development of market surveillance in Member States will be a priority for ENISA in 2022  and beyond.  Cybersecurity Market and Commission:  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  42  • Identification of potential cybersecurity market analysis needs: Cybersecurity market  analysis may become an important tool for the need of EU policy actions. It will be  important to assess potential foci of EU cybersecurity market analysis in order to identify  resources and needs for know-how transfer. Moreover, in order to follow ENISA work in  this area, the European Commission and interested Member States may desire to play an  observer role within the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Cybersecurity Market, to  provide support regarding e.g. scoping exercises.

The new coalition government has unveiled its programme, with a number of priorities  and timeframe for implementation. One of them includes the approval within one year of new  laws, which increase the rate of corporate taxation and introduce subsidies to support local  business. A foreign company established in this country for 10 years has assessed the potential  impact of these new policies and had determined that they would adversely affect the  company’s operations and increase the degree of competition from local players. In addition, as  these measures enjoy a widespread consensus among citizens, it is very likely that the new  government would strive to implement them, especially as the next election will be organized  next year. As a result, this company is considering moving its operations in another country with  a more favorable and competitive business environment.  Example of an Economic Factor: Because of a new legislation, an SME forecasted a 40%  growth in the demand of its Industrial Control Systems solutions in the upcoming years. In order  to satisfy the future demand, this SME has decided to expand its operations, by making  investments to finance the opening of a new laboratory in another country, purchase new  machinery as well as starting a recruitment process. This investment decision is expected to  indebt the organization for the upcoming years, after which a return on investments is made. In  order to lower the impact of the debt over the years, the analysists of this organization have  monitored for the last six months the economic indicators in a number of countries. This helps  identifying combining a number of favorable economic conditions, such as a low interest rate on  corporate loans, an IT-savvy workforce associated with reasonable labor costs, and an  affordable price of electricity (relative to other countries), which has remained stable over a  period of five years.  Example of Social Factor: The smartphone industry has been object of a negative media  coverage in one of its most profitable country, due to the insufficient measures to decrease its  carbon footprint (e.g. e-waste, end-of-life) and ensure an appropriate level of data protection of  smartphone devices. A survey clearly shows that adult consumers between 30-60 years old,  living in the country’s largest cities, are the most sensitive to environmental and privacy aspects.  These consumers represent the industry’s main target audience and the wealthiest group of the  country. In addition, the vast majority of this group declared that the sustainability practices  employed by companies and the provision of clear information regarding the data protection  features of IT devices are key elements influencing their purchases. These findings partly  explain the steady and continuous decrease of the smartphones sales of leading companies in  this country in favour of more sustainable and more privacy-friendly ones. As a result, one  smartphone company is considering to support initiative for sustainable and ethical  smartphones, develop a Corporate Social Responsibility programme, commit to use 80%  recycled materials, introduce privacy-by-default features in its devices, allow options to install  alternative operating systems and create a label to help consumers understand its privacy  policy.  Example of Technological Factor: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shopping centers have been  obliged to implement the new government restrictions, aiming to limit human contacts and the  number of people entering a shop in a given timeframe. Many stores have adopted e-payment  methods to speed up the checkout process while contributing to maintain a safer environment  for both employees and customers.  To be ahead of its competitors and ensure compliance with the new rules, a supermarket chain  has decided to make full use of digital technology. As a result, the IT department has developed  a mobile shopping app, which makes it convenient for consumers to browse and shop online,  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  49  and book a home delivery service. In addition, the online and physical stores of this chain have  decided to accept a growing number of e-payment options. The chain has also started its own  brand-specific mobile wallet app that would facilitate transactions both online and in physical  stores, further encouraging touchless and secure e-payments. In addition, thanks to these  technology uptakes, the accounting department of the chain will be able to process transactions  more easily and quicker.

Analysing how well cybersecurity products, services and processes succeed in the market is a  key step in understanding how to improve their market diffusion, importance, quality and  acceptance. Though cybersecurity has been considered in the past within market analysis  efforts, the customisation and scoping of cybersecurity market analyses is still at low levels of  maturity. Moreover, market data on cybersecurity products, services and processes are scarcely  taken into account in the cybersecurity development life-cycle, e.g. within decision-making  processes for the launching and development of cybersecurity initiatives, product ideas, policy  actions, research funding, and deployments. By initiating this activity, ENISA delivers an  important contribution towards a more targeted, market-driven decision-making process for the  conception, launching and maintenance of cybersecurity products, services and processes  within the EU.  This document is the cornerstone of ENISA activities in analysing the EU cybersecurity market:  it presents a cybersecurity market analysis framework as a “cookbook” on how EU  cybersecurity market analyses can be performed and be:  • More transparent: the fact that analysis method, parametrization, cybersecurity value  chain, market trends and market stakeholders are fixed, leads to a more transparency as  regards the results of the analysis.  • More comparable: by having set both the content of various components and the steps of  the analysis process, the achieved results are more comparable, and thus reusable among  various analyses performed.  • More targeted towards specific cybersecurity value chains: the availability of a standard  taxonomy of cybersecurity value chains, allows for more targeted analysis with regard to  specific cybersecurity areas, products, services and processes.  • More customizable towards technology and market trends: the possibility to customize an  analysis according to various trends, allows for consideration of market dynamics by  means for forecasts, market gaps and market niches.  • More agile: the inherent flexibility of setting market analysis foci and adapting accordingly  the performed analysis process, increases agility of the proposed market analysis method.  • More comprehensive: the inclusion of all possible variables, criteria and contextual  information on cybersecurity, as well as requirements and dependencies both from the  supply and the demand sides, increases the comprehensiveness of the proposed market  analysis method.  • More coherence: the use of the framework to perform market analyses facilitates  information exchanges among specific market analysis reports by means of re-usability  and coherence of created/maintained market information (both raw market data and  analysis results).  The framework presented in this report is at its initial development phase. With increasing  performance of cybersecurity market analyses, but also with interactions with stakeholders,  ENISA will continuously develop, update and maintain the current framework to increase its  efficiency and practicability. To this extent, it constitutes rather the starting point of a journey  than a destination.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  In 2021, ENISA has initiated its activities in analysing the cybersecurity market. The  Cybersecurity Act (CSA1) has stipulated the task of performing market analyses in the area of  cybersecurity  (see also Section 1.1 below). Performing market analyses in the area of  cybersecurity, constitutes a quite novel, yet challenging task because of the following:  • Given the considerable multiplicity of cybersecurity products, services and processes, a  market analysis in this area may need to go significantly deeper than current market  analysis practices;  • Cybersecurity functions are often “packaged” within existing products and services. As there  is no established taxonomy or metrics in this area, it is difficult to collect and analyse  information about detailed cybersecurity functions available. However, a detailed  decomposition approach is often needed in order to assess various market characteristics of  products, such as role, level of market penetration, market value, etc.;  • While until now market analyses and assessments have been performed mainly by experts  with an economic background, cybersecurity market analysis requires significant, technically  oriented cybersecurity knowledge;  • Finally yet importantly, the fact that cybersecurity products, services and processes entail a  certain “blurriness” in their scope and boundaries, may introduce a certain degree of  uncertainty in analyses and assessments, especially when innovation niches are in focus.  These facts indicate the need for developing differentiated analysis approaches, in order to  encompass in the market analysis cybersecurity characteristics: unlike the rather high-level  analysis of product and service markets, the analysis of cybersecurity market require novel  approaches, based on novel market modelling, combined with cross-fertilization of skills.  The current document is an initial attempt to develop a market assessment approach and is  meant to be a collection of tools to be used for cybersecurity market analyses. The developed  approach comprises the ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF). The  present output is expected to be an initial building block, an initial part of the content to be  gradually developed in consecutive years. It will facilitate the analysis of the required market  assessment, involved mechanisms and tools. On the outset, the definition of the cybersecurity  market and its key components - in terms of products and services - will be addressed. During  this development, market dynamics will gradually become integral part of this analysis2, as the  toolset developed will cover variety of needs and analysis requirements that will emerge through  a series of cybersecurity market-analysis foci and objectives.  1.1 POLICY CONTEXT  As it has been stipulated in Article 8, as well as in Title III of the CSA1, the consideration of  developments in cybersecurity market constitutes a main focal point within CSA, in particular in  the context of certification. Certification is considered as the main instrument to “avoiding the  fragmentation of the internal market”3. In setting up Cybersecurity Certification, the main goal is  “to improve the functioning of the internal market” (Art. 56 CSA). To achieve this goal, CSA  foresees a number of actions to analyse market trends. These actions are mentioned in CSA,  in particular where it provides that:  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EL/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN, accessed November 2021.  2 Market dynamics (and the cybersecurity market in general) are highly dependent on what is happening outside the EU,  therefore defining the market geographically-wise would be needed.  3 See Article 1 par. 1 (b) CSA.  With ECSMAF,  ENISA has  created a toolbox  for the  performance of  Cybersecurity  Market Analyses.  It introduces  related content  for targeted  cybersecurity  market analyses.  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EL/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32019R0881&from=EN  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  7  • “ENISA shall perform and disseminate regular analyses of the main trends in the  cybersecurity market on both the demand and supply sides, with a view to fostering the  cybersecurity market in the Union” (Art. 8 par. 7 CSA);  • “ENISA should develop and maintain a ‘market observatory’ by performing regular analyses  and disseminating information on the main trends in the cybersecurity market, on both the  demand and supply sides” (Recital 42 CSA).  In performing these tasks, ENISA receives advice and guidance from the Stakeholder  Cybersecurity Certification Group (hereinafter, SCCG). The SCCG:  • “upon request, advise[s] ENISA on general and strategic matters concerning ENISA’s tasks  relating to market, cyberse-curity certification, and standardisation” (Art. 22 par. 3 (b) CSA).  The ENISA work on the EU cybersecurity market aims to contribute to reduce the EU internal  market fragmentation and provides input to:  • The Union Rolling Work Programme for European Cybersecurity Certification by means of  “market demand” (Art. 47 CSA);  • The promotion of “the use of European cybersecurity certification, with a view to avoiding the  fragmentation of the internal market [emphasis added]. ENISA shall contribute to the  establishment and maintenance of a European cybersecurity certification framework in  accordance with Title III of this Regulation, with a view to increasing the transparency of the  cybersecurity of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, thereby strengthening  trust in the digital internal market and its competitiveness” [emphasis added] (Art 4.6  CSA).  Moreover, based on market information, ENISA provides support in the coordination of the  Member States’ efforts in the area of market surveillance for supervision of certification4: The  CSA provides that:  • The National cybersecurity certification authorities “supervise and enforce rules included in  European cybersecurity certification scheme [...] for the monitoring of the compliance of ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes with the requirements of the European cybersecurity  certificates that have been issued in their respective territories, in cooperation with other relevant  market surveillance authorities” [emphasis added] (Art. 58 par 7 (a) CSA).  The ENISA Single Programming Document 2012-2023 (SPD)5 takes into account these  provisions and sets up corresponding actions under Activity 7, with the aim to “to foster  cybersecurity market in the Union and the development of the cybersecurity industry, in  particular SMEs and start-ups, to reduce dependence from outside the Union and to reinforce  supply chains inside the Union. It involves actions to promote and implement ‘security by  design’ and ‘security by default’ measures in ICT products, services and processes, including  through standardisation”.  4 Knowing that this effort concerns mainly compliance issues of certification, it might provide valuable information on various  aspects of the Cybersecurity Market. Thus, it may be used as a tool to obtain valuable information on the cybersecurity  market. Though this facility is not yet operational, ENISA will coordinate efforts with Member States/Commission to  increase the usability of this source within the context of the Activity 7 of the ENISA Single Programming Document (SPD)  2021-2023 (https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021- 2023, accessed November 2021).  5 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023,  accessed November 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate-documents/enisa-single-programming-document-2021-2023  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  8  By delivering information on cybersecurity market, ENISA provides support towards the  implementation of various Commission initiatives helping companies (SMEs, micro-enterprise)  improve business/production processes, products, or services using digital technologies:  • European Digital Innovation Hubs6: market analyses provide evidence towards helping “SMEs  expand and tap into other markets, develop EU value chains, create new business opportunities for  companies or help commercialise earlier innovation experiments or pilots”7  • Emerging industries and value chains8: market analysis is an important instrument that may “help  SMEs to innovate and develop cross-sectoral value chains by bringing different sectors and areas of  expertise together to create new value chains across the EU and Horizon 2020 associated  countries”.  1.2 PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The purpose of the developed cybersecurity market framework is to serve a number of ENISA- internal, as well as Stakeholder needs. As regards ENISA-internal needs, one can highlight the  following ones:  • To define a market analysis method capable of addressing the cybersecurity product, service and  process market;  • To serve as a basis for amalgamation of knowledge emanating from market analysis and  cybersecurity into a single knowledge source;  • To provide contextually detailed references to other related work, both within ENISA (e.g. areas  such as research and innovation, cybersecurity index, policy development, knowledge and  information) and outside ENISA (e.g. national market observatories, and national statistic  organisations); and  • To be used as a model for prospective development of tools to support this task within ENISA, e.g.  as a schema for storage of collected cybersecurity market data.  The satisfaction of these needs will empower ENISA to meet the following objectives:  • To identify potentially interesting cybersecurity fields that are innovative, emerging and represent a  potential for both demand and supply;  • To identify cybersecurity market opportunities and risks based on demand and supply  requirements;  • To assess the importance of relevant market segments to assess potential impact of  incidents/threats/risks;  • To assess market needs for cybersecurity certification, and  • To leverage cybersecurity market data for informed decisions within EU and Member States  cybersecurity policy actions.  As regards stakeholder needs, the proposed cybersecurity market framework aims at9:  • Serving as a model of reference for any stakeholder willing to engage in market analysis efforts;  • Helping vendors of cybersecurity products, services and processes to update their Go-To-Market  strategies;  • Facilitating procurement and/or “make-or-buy” decisions, based on cybersecurity market data;  • Providing specific information about market developments w.r.t. cybersecurity products, services  and processes;  • Identifying cybersecurity market trends w.r.t. market penetration of various cybersecurity products;  6 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs, accessed January 2022.  7 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324, accessed January 2022.  8 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en, accessed January  2022.  9 Stakeholder needs-list is indicative and non-exhaustive. Needs mentioned here are the ones assessed by ENISA so far.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/edihs https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=70324 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/industry/strategy/cluster-policy/emerging-industries-and-value-chains_en  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  9  • Assessing cybersecurity requirements to products, services and processes formulated by the  demand side, and  • Providing terminology to understand of market segmentation in the area of cybersecurity;  It should be noted, that the proposed framework aims at analysing classes of cybersecurity  products, processes and services, but not individual ones (i.e. by means of individual  evaluations).  This initial version of ECSMAF lays the foundation for a robust structure that can be applied to  existing market data and deliver satisfactory results.  The framework has been piloted and validated by means of an analysis in the area of  interconnected devices. While the experience gained from this pilot are already fed back to the  present methodology, an ongoing extensive review from the established Ad Hoc Working Group  (AHWG) on the EU Cybersecurity Market10 is currently being performed. The received feedback  will be taken account of in the continuous development effort of the framework.  For 2021, the validation of the developed framework is based on data and analysis prepared by  external market analysts. As the knowledge on the ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis  Framework matures, additional information sources will be included, such as own surveys,  stakeholder feedback and OSINT.  As regards the supply and demand side, the current focus is on business-to-business  relationships. The focus is mainly on companies that are in the “radar” of market analysis firms,  and especially the ones dominating individual market segments. Emphasis has been given to  requirements of operators of essential services (OESs) as well as regulated areas.  It should be noted, that when using the proposed framework, the size of business to be  addressed (both demand and supply sides) depends on the survey scope. If desired, any size  of business can be addressed. Depending on the scope, different stakeholder engagement and  specific surveying techniques will be needed.  The proposed framework can be used for various market segments, in particular those that are  related to cybersecurity (see also discussion about possible market stakeholder types and  vertical industries in Section 2.2.4). In doing so, the framework can also be utilized to analyse  certification market requirements, or market coverage of certified solutions in various vertical  industries. Equally, it can be used to analyse market penetration of various cybersecurity  products, services and processes, as they also make up a specific vertical industry. The  introduced cybersecurity value chain and value stack components will enable an analysis at  various levels of detail (see also Section 2.2.2).  In its current, initial, version, the framework remains at a relatively high level as regards its  modules and their content. This is due to the relatively coarse granularity of available market  data, as result of the low penetration of cybersecurity content at the level of market analysis  organizations. In forthcoming versions, when alternative information collections methods will be  used, a higher level of details regarding cybersecurity content will be striven for.  1.3 TARGET AUDIENCE  By constituting a set of tools and general-purpose components for cybersecurity market  analyses, ECSMAF is potentially useful for a variety of stakeholders engaging directly or  10 The ENISA AHWG on the EU Cybersecurity Market has been established following the Call for expression of interest  published at https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market,  accessed November 2021.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/standards/adhoc_wg_calls/ad-hoc-working-group-on-cybersecurity-market  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  10  indirectly in the area of market analysis. Below we provide some examples of such  stakeholders, by stating potential elements of their market analysis related focus:  • EU institutions, bodies and agencies (EUIBAs) (e.g. DG-CNECT, DG-GROW, DG-JRC,  European Cybersecurity Competence Centre - ECCC, DG-RTD, DG-TRADE, Eurostat,  etc.): EU regulation often takes into account market issues, especially if it targets the EU  internal market. Moreover, market analysis can be part of performed impact assessments  of various decision-making activities prior to regulative texts. Market analysis activities hold  a central role in any kind of statistics developed to assess market trends, as well as  product related demand and supply issues. For all these use-cases, EUIBAs may use the  content of ECSMAF to perform targeted market analyses covering market penetration of  cybersecurity products, services and processes. Finally, the structuring presented within  this work, can be a useful source of ideas to cover other areas (e.g. by adapting the  taxonomy used to other thematic areas, by using the proposed scoping and  parametrization workflow, and by using trending method).  • Member States/Public Authorities (e.g. Cybersecurity Authorities): The creation of  cybersecurity market-surveillance activities at the level of EU Member States is subject of  regulation (e.g. CSA). Reportedly, various EU Member States are about to create such  capabilities, particularly in the area of market surveillance11. Just as described above for  the EUIBAs, Member States may use the proposed framework in a similar way. Moreover,  ideas and practices developed by Member States may be consolidated in ECSMAF. This  will facilitate mutual use of (open source) collected data, allowing thus for the  implementation of synergies (e.g. data exchange, comparability of market analysis, and  definition of common efforts).  • ENISA Stakeholder Groups (e.g. ECCG, SCCG, ENISA Advisory Group): By playing an  important role in the area of EU-wide certification, members of these stakeholder groups  may use the developed material to oversee market parameters affected by certification  efforts. The developed material can serve as a decision-making basis for prioritizing  certification efforts that are related to needs/requirements of both supply and demand.  Moreover, ECSMAF can serve as guidance in spotting market gaps, providing thus  outlooks for future certification activities.  • Industry and Industry Associations (Ecosystem of Certification, EU TIC Council, Vendors /  Manufacturers, ECSO): The cybersecurity industry will be in the position to perform  targeted market analyses for various cybersecurity products and for various sectors by  supporting a variety of foci. Gap analysis (e.g. demand requirements vs. supply  functions/features) may lead to early identification of market trends, thus enhancing time- to-market for new products, services and processes. Both elements can lead to the  creation of competitive advantages to EU industry players and support the internal market  for product, process and processes in the area of cybersecurity.  • Consumer Organisations/Associations: By using the proposed method/framework, such  organisations may assess existing good practices for products, services and processes  targeting the sector of their associated members. Moreover, they can capture  requirements from the demand side, identify relevant gaps in the cybersecurity market,  and assess market penetration of members’ products, services and processes. Such  information may be useful for cybersecurity product-, service- or process-procurement  decisions.  11 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/building-blocks/market-surveillance/organisation_en, accessed January  2022.  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/goods/building-blocks/market-surveillance/organisation_en  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  11  • Research Institutions and Research related entities: Given their inherent interest in  performing research creating competitive advantages in the European market, research  institutions may:  o use the proposed methodology to assess market areas that can affect the maturity of  existing products;  o cover market niches;  o provide products, services and processes for emerging technology areas; and  o use the proposed methodology to assess the market impact of deployed results.  1.4 STRUCTURE OF THE REPORT  The present document is organised as follows:  • Chapter 1 (this chapter) presents the policy context, the purpose, objectives and scope of  this report, the target audience, and the structure of the report.  • Chapter 2 presents the entire structure, modules and content of ECSMAF. Besides the  number of foreseen modules, it also presents a series of contextualized components, that  is, components that capture cybersecurity related content and parametrization options for  setting the scope of analyses (see chapter 2).  • Chapter 3 presents the main interfaces of ECSMAF with other topics/ENISA activities,  illustrating thus the “interaction” of the proposed method with other related work, both  within and outside ENISA. This discussion sets the broader relationship of cybersecurity  market analysis with activities in the area of cybersecurity, helping thus the reader to  comprehend existing dependencies and interfaces (see chapter 3).  • Chapter four concludes the report by stating various issues encountered and formulating  conclusions and future work (see chapter 4).  • Annex A contains examples of outcomes of the ECSMAF modules. This supporting  information aims at increasing the understanding of the purpose of the developed  framework (see Annex 4.1A).  • Annex B contains a table with Main Abbreviations.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  12  2. CONTENT OF THE ENISA  CYBERSECURITY MARKET  ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK  (ECSMAF)  This chapter gives an overview and provides the details of the various modules of the  developed ENISA Cybersecurity Market Analysis Framework (ECSMAF). It delivers an overview  and describes the various components. It has to be noted that in 2021 an initial version of the  framework has been developed. With increasing experience in the field of market analysis, the  proposed structure and components will be further specified/adapted to cover all aspects  emerging during specific analyses.  The material presented below consists of two main component categories:  • Logical blocks/modules of ECSMAF: These modules represent the various aspects  covered within an analysis and correspond to various content groups/phases performed  for various market report types. These modules originate from generic market analysis  techniques (see Section 2.1) rather than cybersecurity knowledge; and  • Components that establish the cybersecurity context: These are components  capturing the structure and peculiarities of cybersecurity and helping to parametrise  ECSMAF according to the selected scope of the analysis. They deliver scoping methods  for cybersecurity market analysis based on typical cybersecurity-centred approaches (e.g.  asset, threat and risk based, policy relevance, market measures, etc.). Moreover, they  cover thematic topics of cybersecurity by means of a cybersecurity taxonomy to capture  the entire value chain and value stack of cybersecurity products, services and processes.  Cybersecurity trends and cybersecurity market stakeholder participating in the market  roundup the cybersecurity market analysis context (see Section 2.2).  This chapter provides the available details of these categories of ECSMAF components.  2.1 LOGICAL BLOCKS/MODULES OF ECSMAF  The set of logical components of the developed framework are depicted in Figure 1 below.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  13  Figure 1: Logical blocks/modules of ECSMAF  As can be seen in the figure above, the modules cover several elements required by CSA1,  such as the distinction between supply and demand, the inclusion of supply-chain, the  consideration of trends, the consideration of socio-economic, policy and regulation aspects, as  well as technology trends.  The six modules of the proposed method are subject to parametrization, prior to their execution  (see Section 2.2.1). Parametrisation of the framework creates the scope for the analysis to be  performed. It may lead to selective execution of the modules according to the needs of the  analysis. To this extent, the modules are not performed in a sequential manner (i.e. waterfall  model), but they can be configured in an agile way according to the analysis needs.  In the following sections, we give an overview of the various modules (see six ECSMAF  modules in the figure above) and provide some examples demonstrating the kind of information  that may be delivered through each module. The rest of the elements shown in Figure 1,  namely Method, and Target Groups are discussed in Sections 2.2.5 and 1.3, respectively.  Report Types are presented by means of examples in the Annex A (see Annexes A1-A4).  2.1.1 Market structure and segmentation  The module Market Structure and Segmentation has an important role in the entire market  analysis. It is the phase where the scoping of the market analysis is being set. It consists of two  main steps: the determination of value chain at scope and the determination  corresponding value stack. The used definitions for value chain and value stack are as  follows:  • Value Chain: the term is used in accordance with the Porter’s Value Chain12. Given the  technological background focus of cybersecurity, emphasis is given to the primary value  chain elements operations and services, as well as the secondary elements, infrastructure,  technology development and procurement.  12 https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dstools/value-chain-/, accessed November 2021.  https://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/dstools/value-chain-/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  14  • Value Stack: value stack is a collection of various activities contributing to the value  production of an organisation. These activities may be manifold, supportive to a product or  service and are necessary/vital for a value production fulfilling certain standards (e.g.  quality, security, compliance, etc.). The Value Stack is considered particularly relevant for  technology13. Following a similar approach, we consider the value stack as an element to  decompose cybersecurity related topics. In ECSMAF, the value stack follows the structure  of the introduced cybersecurity market taxonomy, representing a decomposition of  cybersecurity topics and products, services and processes hereof. The cybersecurity  market taxonomy, and conversely the value stack, is a notion that transcends ECSMAF  and is used in various modules. A detail description of the cybersecurity taxonomy can be  found in Section 2.2.1.  Figure 2 depicts these two steps (determination of value chain at scope and the determination  of the corresponding value stack) as part of Market Structure and segmentation module.  Figure 2: Structure and steps within the module Market Structure and Segmentation  As regards the applicability of the above two steps, they heavily depend on the scoping  workflow foreseen before the use of the five modules described. This workflow –described in a  dedicated section below (see Section 2.2.2) - is of great importance for the identification of  primary and secondary value chain elements and the depth of their decomposition via the value  stack.  Main parameters for the scoping are:  • The market-research questions that need to be covered by the analysis;  • The identification of the necessary depth of analysis; and  • The availability of resources and sources for the market analysis (see examples of sources  in Figure 2).  13 https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-stack-4-powers-creation-tech-companies-daan-witteveen/, accessed November  2021.  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/value-stack-4-powers-creation-tech-companies-daan-witteveen/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  15  Given the business sector, product, service or process under analysis, and the expectation of a  reasonable depth in the analysis, the determination of value chain at scope and the  determination of the corresponding value stack may result in:  • An infrastructure diagram within the boundaries of the defined focus;  • A set of products, service processes in focus;  • Any related technical and organisational assets involved in the above (e.g. procurement);  • Cybersecurity related elements (products, services and processes) involved, and  • Market parameters of the above regarding market sizes, cost structures (e.g. CAPEX,  OPEX, growth projections and geographic distribution).  Examples of information derived via the module Market Structure and Segmentation are given  in Annex A.1.  2.1.2 Demand-side research  Although research on demand-side is a well-established topic in market research14 , if it is  placed within a cybersecurity focus it implements an important and rather novel element: it aims  at capturing a variety of market-related information from (business-) end-users of cybersecurity  market products, services and processes. This includes information about value-chain and  value-stack of the relevant industry (i.e. the business value-chain to be protected), demand  volume and growth, market trends, maturity of operations, and requirements (e.g. derived from  the value-chain/value stack of the demand side, including thus procurement, operations and  infrastructure). In other words, demand-side research contributes towards understanding  protection requirements of valuable business assets. What it makes this module special is that it  encompasses:  • User-needs emerging from dynamic changes of threat exposure of available business  (through changes in the threat landscape);  • Requirements emerging from business and technological developments, and  • Experienced impact on businesses.  These dynamic changes are capable of leaving their footprint in the market at a high speed.  The structure of this module is depicted in Figure 3 below.  14 https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp, accessed November 2021.  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  16  Figure 3: Structure and steps within the module Demand-side Research  It is worth mentioning that the value-chain and value stack information of the demand side will  not be identical with the ones of supply. While the demand side is an analysis of user-needs  and requirements, supply side research takes into account market products offerings. The  juxtaposition of these two views allows for the identification of market gaps, a very desirable  piece of information in cybersecurity market analysis. Expectedly, potential market gaps will be  visible from the assessed market trends of the demand side (i.e. comparison between demand  requirements and functional characteristics of available product). On the contrary, assessed  maturity levels and requirements may be useful for the identification of available offerings of the  supply side.  The content of this ECSMAF module is created through an iterative process with the content of  the previous model, Market Structure and Segmentation:  the results from the execution of the  previous module (see Market Structure and Segmentation above) deliver input for Demand-side  Research. This happens by means of the value-chain elements identified in market structure.  Demand-side should detail value-chains (e.g. by providing value stack information), or, in case a  demand-side value-chain emerges in the demand-side assessment, it needs to be checked  upon compliance to the market structure/segmentation results. Value-chain and value stack  data have to be kept consistent in both modules.  As regards the results from the analysis, one can note the following:  • Demand volume and growth can be analysed starting from basic financial data.  However, depending on the detail of the analysis (e.g. value stack), such data might be  difficult to find/collect. Hereto, corresponding data sources will need to be used.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  17  • Market trends can be of manifold nature. Some industries - typically with low risk - might  need to follow technological developments. Others might orient themselves towards  changes in the threat landscape affecting their sector. In those cases, market trends can  be connected to technology foresight and threat analysis/landscaping, respectively.  • Cybersecurity maturity can be analysed through the penetration of cybersecurity products  in the value-chain of an organisation, through the ratio of cybersecurity spending in IT- investments, through the number of incidents impacting their business, level of  cybersecurity capability, etc.  • Security requirements – the most appropriate way to express demand needs – will be  possible/efficient for rather detailed analyses focussing on detail elements of value-chain.  Such data are usually difficult to find, especially if the market analysis scope included  various stakeholders with variating maturity. For some areas, however, it will be possible  and meaningful to track such requirements (e.g. in the area of certified products, services  and processes).  Examples of information derived via the module Demand-side research are given in Annex  4.1A.2.  2.1.3 Supply-side research  The module Supply-side research aims at analysing suppliers of cybersecurity products,  services and processes. The research of supply is a very commonly performed activity within  market analysis efforts. It is a baseline activity in market analysis and comprises a well-defined  and highly matured domain of market research15,16,17. So are the types of market reports  covering the supply-side analysis, e.g. Market Guides, Market Maps, Vendor Profile Ratings,  Market Shares and Market Size and Forecast. The structure of this module is depicted in Figure  4 below.  15 https://www.coursehero.com/file/53744086/supply-side-substitution-2682pdf/, accesses November 2021.  16 https://www.biblio.com/book/macroeconomics-private-public-choice-gwartney-james/d/1438025693, accessed November  2021.  17 http://faculty.citadel.edu/sobel/GwartneyEcon14e.pdf, accessed November 2021.  https://www.coursehero.com/file/53744086/supply-side-substitution-2682pdf/ https://www.biblio.com/book/macroeconomics-private-public-choice-gwartney-james/d/1438025693 http://faculty.citadel.edu/sobel/GwartneyEcon14e.pdf  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  18  Figure 4: Structure and steps within the module Supply-side Research  The three activities within this module have the following purpose:  • Select supplier types: Given the focus of the market analysis (see also section 2.2.2), a  set of supplier types will be selected. The various types of market stakeholders are drawn  from the collection of market stakeholder types (see also section 2.2.4). Corresponding  value-chain elements describing the products, services and processes will be identified for  each supplier type taken into consideration. The level of detail for the value chain will  depend on the focus of the market analysis exercise and will be in terms of value stack  elements (including cybersecurity-related value stack elements as described in Section  2.2.1).  • Create supplier mapping: Within this activity, the mapping of the vendors meeting value- chain, value stack and other criteria (e.g. geographies, sizes and growth) is being  performed. Some of these criteria are defined in module Market Structure and  Segmentation, while value-chain and value stack are subject of the parametrization, on the  one hand, and meet demand-side criteria/requirements on the other.  • Create supplier analysis report(s): In this activity, a supply-side report is created  consolidating the information created in the previous two phases (which are Select  supplier types and Create supplier mapping). The types of report should be selected  according to the market research questions and the target group of the analysis. Most  common report types for supplier-side research are (but not restricted to):  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  19  o Market Guide/Market Landscaping18: which is an overview of representative vendors;  o Market Map19: which defines the market from a supply-side perspective and should  be as comprehensive as possible w.r.t. value chain and value stack, in particular if it  is used as a baseline for market share analysis. The market map is a critical element  to estimate vendor revenues per market segment; (see report example 4.1A.3.1);  o Vendor Profiles20 and Rating21: where vendors are profiled and rated based on  different methodologies e.g. Company overview, SWOT profiling (Strengths /  Weaknesses / Opportunities / Threats), Magic Quadrant and Vendor Rating. Key  results are typically used / referenced in the market map e.g. vendor overall rating;  (see report example 4.1A.3.2);  o Market Share22: which is a report predominantly quantitative but usually  complemented with qualitative observations;  o Market Size and Forecast 23: where the baseline for market size is the revenue  determined by a market map.  In order to draw parts of the content of supply-side research, iteration cycles with demand-side  research, technology research and market structure will be necessary.  Examples of information derived via the module Supply-side research are given in Annex  4.1A.3.  2.1.4 Technology research  The aim of this module is to assess the impact of future technology and innovation in the  relevant market. While it takes into account technology foresight, it also assesses state-of-play  in research, thus estimating the readiness of available technology research results towards  market deployment. Based on this information, this module evaluates the impact of the adoption  of new technologies in the market, as well as time horizons for technology adoption. Though  instruments of the latter kind already exist24, the contextualization of such analyses for the area  of cybersecurity is still out of the scope: Important variables to such a contextualization for  cybersecurity technology may depend on different factors than in products, such as threats,  cybersecurity challenges, impact statements, compliance, etc. As an example hereto, one can  mention the necessity to map more generic trending information (e.g. digitization of everything)  to the specific sector/scope at hand (e.g. how digitization of everything applies to the automotive  sector).  Besides delivering evidence to perform market projections for prospective market sizes,  technology research delivers information about trends. Hence, it contributes to the other  modules - especially demand-side research -, by providing forecasts about upcoming demand- side requirements and technology-adoption preparedness and plans.

Below a short description of each step is given:  • Set forecast scope: In this step, the scope of the module is being set. It consists of  defining the objectives by means of concentrating on a certain part of technology and time- horizon, by also taking into account the overall scoping of the cybersecurity market  analysis scoping and customisation, as described in Section 2.2.2 below. Within the remits  of this customisation, a horizon-scanning activity, followed by the selection of the relevant  technologies and trends within the defined period is being performed.  • Scenario and technology map: By means of scenarios built for the use of the technology  in scope, indicative development of trends is simulated. The scenario-building activity is  important for understanding the context of technology-adoption within a use-case and its  stakeholders, helping understanding its effects in all dimensions of the use-case. Based on  the scenarios, a technology map is being developed to demonstrate the role/adoption of  each technology in scope in the scenario constellation. For each particular scenario, an  initial threat and risk assessment is being developed.  • Identify challenges: Besides the assessed threat and risks of the previous step,  stakeholder requirements for the various scenarios are being collected. Together the  outcome of the threat/risk assessment of the previous step, requirements build up the  basis for envisaging mitigation options/actions. Mitigation of risks, reduction of threat  surface and fulfilment option of stakeholder requirements is the main source for the  identification of cybersecurity challenges in relation to new technologies. Further to that,  additional, cybersecurity-independent challenges are being envisaged. Technology  challenges are related to deployment, operational and societal issues of technology  adoption.  • Check research readiness: In this step, research results – relevant to technology areas  in scope - from various open source research activities (e.g. European projects, national  and international research actions/projects), will be assessed in terms of their readiness  levels25. In this way, the maturity of available research results will be estimated. This  information leads to the identification of gaps and opportunities related to the successful  deployment of available research results that might influence innovation in the market  25 https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/technology_readiness_revisited_-_icegov2020.pdf, accessed November 2021.  https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/technology_readiness_revisited_-_icegov2020.pdf  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  21  segment in scope. As this task is highly prioritized within EU (e.g. European Cybersecurity  Competence Centre, European Innovation Council, ENISA and in particular the work of the  ENISA Research and Innovation Team26), it is tightly related to actions around  strengthening European research and innovation agenda.  • Perform market forecasts: The above-mentioned information is used in the performance  of forecasts for adoption options of (cybersecurity) technology in the market. It will mainly  be based on the assessed opportunities for the analysed use-cases/scenarios. If required,  it may also propose corrective actions for filling identified gaps, should those being sought  as enablers of major marked drivers in the technology field, sector and geographical area  in scope. The resulting proposals constitute market adoption measures for the  technologies at scope.  As indicated in Figure 5, the majority of the discussed steps (1-4), are related to other  disciplines than purely those relevant to market analysis. In particular, steps 1-3 (Set forecast  scope, Scenario and technology map, and Identify challenges) are subject of the thematic area  of foreseeing, an activity that is included in the ENISA Single Programming Document and  covered by already published ENISA work27. Whereas step 4 (Check research readiness) is a  component of the work area of Research and Innovation, covered by a dedicated team within  ENISA28. These interfaces underline the links of cybersecurity market analysis with other  disciplines and establish important knowledge exchanges hereto. By activating these interfaces  within cybersecurity market research, all available ENISA results will be fully integrated into  market analysis efforts.  Examples of information derived via the module Technology Research are given in Annex  4.1A.4.  2.1.5 Macro-Environmental Factors and Economic Market  Characteristics  Market analysis is typically carried out by considering multiple perspectives, in order to provide  a compressive overview of key trends. In this respect, the PEST analysis29 is one of the most  frequently applied measurement tool used to analyse how four external factors (Political,  Economic, Social and Technology)30 affect the operations of an organisation or a specific  market segment  Once analysed through PEST, these factors would help public and private organisations  understand potential impacts through scenarios, take better decisions, allocate resources more  efficiently and introduce changes to generate improvements in suboptimal and impacted areas.  PEST methodology is also employed for tracking developments across these four factors,  identify current and future opportunities and risks, allowing for effective preparation of how to  best manage them.  The process for carrying out the PEST analysis typically include the following main stages:  • Identification of the key events within the four external factors;  • Analysis of possible impacts on the organisation or market segment;  • Categorization into opportunities and threats: and  • Tracking of the trends.  26 See ENISA organisational chart, in particular Research and Innovation team (RIT): https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about- enisa/structure-organization, accessed December 2021.  27 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/foresight-challenges, accessed December 2021.  28 ENISA organisational chart: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization, accessed December 2021.  29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEST_analysis, accessed December 2021.  30 Variants that build on the PEST framework include PESTLE, which puts more emphasis on the legal and environmental  factors.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/foresight-challenges https://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/structure-organization https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEST_analysis  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  22  On this basis, organizations can develop corrective or pre-emptive strategic actions.  The following PEST analysis example clarifies how the four external factors work and what type  of information should be included in the analysis:  Table 1: PEST analysis example  Due to its wider applicability and good-practice status, PEST analysis is used within ECSMAF in  the Macro-Environmental Factors and Economic Market Characteristics modules (see Figure 1)  to determine how these external factors affect the performance and trends of a market segment  under examination. PEST analysis will complement the other insight layers adding new  perspectives and potential scenarios, especially technology research, where trends are  assessed.  The present section provides additional details regarding the external factors part of the PEST  analysis with illustrative examples for each factor.  The Political factor of the PEST methodology aims to assess how new government policies  and changes in legislation affect a specific market segment or organizations’ operations. Typical  examples are tax, employment, environmental and judicial laws. The Political factor also  encompasses aspects such the general political climate of a country, the degree of government  stability, as well as its international relations and posture, as well as issued regulations.  The Economic factor of the PEST methodology aims to assess the key determinants of a  certain economy’s performance such as the inflation rates, exchange rates, cost of production,  economic growth, disposable income of consumers and, unemployment rate. These  determinants may have a direct or indirect impact on organizations and market segments, for  example, a trend in a certain direction may affect the purchasing power of consumers and could  change the demand/supply models in the economy. As a result, the way organisations price  their products and services on the market can also change.  The Social factor refers to the demographic characteristics, cultural attitudes and customs of  the population within which organizations operate. Typically, this includes trends such as the  population growth rate, age distribution, income distribution, cultural barriers and, emerging  Factor Political Economic Social Technological  Event  e.g. increased  geopolitical  tensions;  e.g. cost of  production  e.g. emerging  cultural  consciousness  e.g. technological  advancements  Possible impact  e.g. trade barriers  to protect domestic  suppliers;  e.g. high energy  price may increase  cost of production  e.g. adjust to new  consumers’  preferences such as  environmental  concerns  e.g. new technology  can be adopted to  be ahead of  competitors  Type of impact  (opportunity and  threat)  negative possibly negative unknown positive  Tendency unchanged increasing increasing unchanged  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  23  lifestyle attitudes and consciousness (e.g. environmental, privacy and health) affecting  consumers’ behaviours and preferences.  The technological factor pertains to innovations in technology that may affect the operations of  organizations and a specific market segment. This factor refers to technology advancement and  maturity, the emergence of disruptive technologies, the level of innovation, automation,  research and development (R&D) activity, technological change and the amount of  technological awareness that a market possesses. These factors may influence decisions to  adopt new technologies, enter or not other sectors, launch or not other products or outsource  production activities.  An overview of the PEST method is given in the figure below (see Figure 6):  Figure 6: Overview of PEST method as adopted within ECSMAF  Some examples of the various PEST components are given in Annex 4.1A.4.3  2.2 CONTEXTUALIZED ECSMAF COMPONENTS  As the content and structure of market analysis effort heavily depends on the scope and  purpose, so does also cybersecurity market analysis. Hence, within ECSMAF, parametrization  holds a significant role. Through a series of ECSMAF-internal elements, the analysis can be  adapted to the needs, be it the definition of the value chain, the selection of the reports type to  be produced, the number of ECSMAF modules to be performed, the method for information  collection, etc.  In this section, we present the elements of the proposed method that allow for the customisation  of the scope and content that will be covered in the analysis. It has to be noted, that the need  for such components emerges from the complexity of cybersecurity value chains.  In the below sections, the parametrized elements of ECSMAF are discussed in more detail.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  24  2.2.1 Scoping the analysis and ECSMAF parametrization  During the development of ECSMAF, but also through a performed pilot in the area of IoT31 and  discussions within the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Cybersecurity Market32, it became  apparent that for the purpose of each cybersecurity market research analysis effort, it is key to  identify the scope, prior to the performance of the analysis. In other words, the use of the  proposed frameworks needs to possess an inherent agility, to cover the specific needs of any  potential analysis focus (i.e. depth and breadth of the analysis).  The foreseen agility of the method will lead to a selection of the modules to be performed, while  it will allow for different types of reports, data collection methods and outcomes. All these  variables will heavily depend on the scope of the analysis. This fact underlines the non-waterfall  nature of the proposed framework, as regards the use and sequence of the presented modules:  only the elements that lead to the coverage of the proposed scope will be subject of a  cybersecurity market analysis effort.  In order to perform necessary parametrization of ECSMAF during setting the scope, a workflow  has been developed. The structure and content of the workflow is presented in Figure 7 below.  Figure 7: Structure and content of the ECSMAF parametrization workflow  The above workflow consists of various phases (depicted through various rectangles) as  described below:  • Stakeholders: These are actors that are entitled/mandated to propose ideas for priorities  for the performance of cybersecurity market analysis. They might be institutional  stakeholders participating in the ENISA process (e.g. Member States, Commission and  other EUIBAs), Industrial Associations, Stakeholder Groups, but also ENISA-internal  stakeholders, such as ENISA Management Team, and ENISA Advisory Group (AG). For  this initial market analysis framework, input in this respect is provided by the ENISA  Management Team and by the Members of the newly established ENISA ad hoc Working  Group on EU Cybersecurity MarketError!

For this purpose, proposed ideas are checked upon a number of criteria that allow  for the assessment of their relevance/priority. The criteria check the relevance of a  submitted cybersecurity market analysis idea w.r.t. various facts, such as:  • What is the trigger of the cybersecurity market analysis (e.g. policy action, investment  strategy, market intervention policy, market-supportive measures, incident/threat,  necessary risk mitigation, observed market trends, etc.)?  • What intended to be part of an analysis (demand, supply, market penetration of  products, market requirements, etc.)?  • What is the exact content of the value-chain and value stack in scope (depth vs.  breadth)?  • What are the main economic criteria for the market scanning (e.g. market size, demand  size, growth, market gaps, etc.)?  In this initial framework such criteria are quite basic; hence, they are used currently in a  rather qualitative manner. Some work on in this area is planned for the forthcoming version  of ECSMAF, following initial experiences collected by the classification/mapping of  currently submitted proposals. Obviously, due some urgent topics that can emerge, ad hoc  cybersecurity market analysis requests may also arise, e.g. due to some incidents, and  global happenings in cybersecurity. This depicted in the figure through the rectangle  labelled as “Ad hoc requests”. All produced proposals (including the criteria met), will  undergo a validation by ENISA stakeholders (i.e. ENISA Management and ENISA bodies).  • Cybersecurity market-research questions: In this phase, the scope set for a specific  analysis is translated into a set of so-called “market-research” questions. These are  obviously the questions that the particular cybersecurity market analysis is supposed to  answer. Those questions allow for the identification of the content of the resulting analysis.  Therefore, at this stage, an estimation of the effort needs to be performed. By taking into  account the available resources the feasibility of the analysis should be checked (see  rectangle labelled “Resources”). If the comparison does not balance, an adaptation of the  questions and/or the available resources might be necessary.  • Market-research domain: This activity stands for the identification of the domain/sector to  be analysed. It consists of identifying the infrastructure at stake, the value chain/value  stack of the domain and the various assets and actors involved (both at the demand and  supply-side, depending on the scope). Though this activity is independent from market  analysis subjects, it is essential for the understanding of the sector/domain in scope. Its  performance will require solid sectoral knowledge that will need to be brought in to the  market analysis effort through sector/domain experts.  • ECSMAF modules customisation (embracing Selection of ECSMAF modules, Research  Methodology and Report Types): In this phase, once the scope, the market-research  questions, the identification of the relevant domain/sector have been performed, a decision  about the ECSMAF modules to be included in the analysis is being made. The selection  takes into account available resources. In order to accompany the analysis and run the  effort, relevant stakeholders, partners and tools are identified (see rectangle labelled  ENISA Market Research Resources, Stakeholders and Partners).  Although the elements of the above-mentioned parametrisation have been identified at this  stage of ECSMAF development, further work regarding their quantification is necessary. Within  the performed pilot of the framework, the parametrisation was oriented towards empirical  methods proposed by the pilot project team. Additional input is expected from the experience  collected by the work of the ENISA ad hoc Working Group on this matter (i.e. prioritisation of  prospective cybersecurity market research areas).  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  26  2.2.2 Cybersecurity market taxonomy  The main challenge in cybersecurity market analysis is the “blurriness” in the identification of the  offerings included existing cybersecurity products, services and processes. A typical example is  the market segment of Managed Security Services: while some companies include Security  Operation Centre functions, Threat Analysis, Penetration testing, etc., others are more  protection-device oriented, covering firewalls, end-point security, configuration management,  etc. This diversification of services that are sold under the same name, makes market analyses  for this market sector imprecise and often incomparable, both regarding supply and demand  sides (e.g.33 and 34). The complexity of cybersecurity offerings comes to aggravate the  “blurriness” issue of performed analyses.  In order to alleviate this deficiency, the proposed framework adopts the concept of a  cybersecurity product, service and process taxonomy. Its aim is to deliver widely  recognised, sharply defined categories for cybersecurity offerings. The cybersecurity taxonomy  used within ECSMAF has been derived from relevant work already performed within the EU, in  particular within a cooperation between the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre  (JRC)35 and the European Cyber Security Organisation (ECSO)36. While the ECSMAF  taxonomy is based on this material, some minor (structural) adaptations have been performed,  in order to adjust it to the detail and structure conceived for mapping cybersecurity market  offerings. To this extent, the taxonomy presented in this section is an initial version: both  through experiences gained from cybersecurity market analysis pilots and through an envisaged  cooperation between ENISA, JRC and ECSO, a consolidation back to the original JRC- taxonomy37 will be performed. Aim of this cooperation is to create a single, multi-purpose and  managed reference, while at the same time make it as comprehensive as possible w.r.t.  additional cybersecurity elements38. Additional steps to ensure the acceptance of this material  will be initiated (e.g. open dialogue with private and public actors in this area).  Just as it is required within the various modules of ECSMAF, the used cybersecurity taxonomy  is split into three levels, covering various levels of value stack details, each one decomposing its  predecessor. The level of detail to be considered in each cybersecurity market analysis  depends on the selected scope and the depth. To this extent, the selection of the detail of the  analysis is parametrised during the scoping of the analysis, so as to better match the objectives  set (see also section 2.2.1).  At this point it should be noted, that the introduction of a cybersecurity taxonomy within market  analysis efforts is a novelty. None of the contemporary market analysis methods seems to  introduce such an instrument in order to enhance transparency, comparability and “sharpness”  within market analyses.  The developed taxonomy concentrates mainly on cybersecurity value stack. Other, non-security  related value chains and value stack elements that will be encountered through market analysis  (i.e. vertical industries, see also Figure 8), are not covered in this version of the document. This  information (also referred to as adjacent markets39 from the perspective of cybersecurity) is  33 https://www.ibm.com/security/services/managed-security-services, accessed December 2021.  34 https://services.global.ntt/en-us/services-and-products/security/managed-security-services, accessed December 2021.  35 The European Cybersecurity Taxonomy is available at: https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/science-update/european- cybersecurity-taxonomy, accessed November 2021.

The identification of market trends is explicitly mentioned in CSA1. The challenge  with market trends lies mainly on the fact that they emerge from a variety of factors, while they  may be of generic nature, but also sector-specific. The identification of the degree of relevance  of market trends for a specific analysis requires a multi-level assessment to cover all these  dimensions. ECSMAF takes this challenge fully into account.  Firstly, it foresees the identification of technology trends at the level of the module Technology  Research. These are trends related to generic technology development/emergence issues, as  result of generic, sector-independent foresight efforts46. Secondly, trends will be identified within  the defined scope of the cybersecurity market analysis through the activities of the ECSMAF  modules Marco-Environmental Factors and Economic Market Characteristics (see also  Section 2.1.5). The scope-related trend assessments are going to be performed under the  context of supply and demand characteristics of the current analysis, thus adding an additional  level of detail to the more generic trends assessment.  Subsequently, identified trends will be taken into account in the activities of ECSMAF modules  Demand-side research (see Section 2.1.2) and Supply-side research (see Section 2.1.3).  As an experience gained from the performed ECSMAF pilot in 2021, one can note the following:  depending on the market research method chosen (in this case using an external market  analysis organisation/service) and the foreseen analysis resources, available trending  information can be used as-is (i.e. as provided by the contractor), without performing the  corresponding ECSMAF modules. This approach can deliver satisfactory results, when the  trends happen to be already identified by market analysts. In case of “deeper” analyses of  emerging sectors/technologies, however, it might be meaningful to perform these modules to  identify trends in a more targeted manner for the area/sector in focus. The costs of such an  effort might be justified by the benefit of the analysis precision.  After the performance of cybersecurity market analyses, the identified market trends will be – as  far as possible – consolidated back to relevant trending information provided by relevant ENISA  projects/efforts to a single trending record, enhancing thus comprehensiveness of available  trending knowledge.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  32  2.2.4 Market stakeholder types  The identification of market stakeholder types that are subject to a specific cybersecurity  market analysis are very important for the achievement of the analysis objectives. They are  primarily determined from the scope of the analysis (i.e. which types of businesses the market  analysis should concentrate on?), but also from various other factors, such as types of market  stakeholder dynamics (i.e. innovation power, quick rates, niche-product development, research  oriented, etc.).  Another important element in market stakeholder type identification is the association to a  specific vertical industry. The importance of this piece of information is twofold:  • Firstly, the use of a uniform vertical industry name convention increases transparency and  comparability of achieved analysis reports.  • Secondly, to every vertical industry, a certain value chain (including value stack) can be  assumed, that characterize their core business. This allows performance of more precise  mappings of their turnover. Furthermore, his will further enhance transparency and  comparability and also help highlight nuances among various market stakeholders acting  in the same industry.  It is worth mentioning, that stakeholder types and vertical industries are used within both the  demand- and supply-side market research.  As regards first experiences in the performed pilot regarding stakeholder types, some indicative  ones are provided below, including value chain and value stack information, both for their main  business and cybersecurity services:  • Multi-domain industrial asset vendors: Have a broad and solid market offering when it  comes to the provision of products, services and processes in a certain domain. Below  some examples of their offerings:  Value Chain: Hardware, Software, Implementation, Advisory and Consulting, Managed  Services.  Value Stack IT: Management Platforms, Connectivity, Remote Sensors, Remote  Operation.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Application security software, Cloud security, Data security,  Identity and access management, Infrastructure protection software, Network security,  Advisory, Implementation, Managed security services.  • Multi-domain vendors: Have capabilities in those areas that are critical to collect,  manage and maintain user requirements and information on product, services and  processes, offering thus customised solutions. Below some examples of their offerings:  Value Chain: Software, Implementation, Advisory and Consulting, Managed Services.  Value Stack IT: Management Platforms, Connectivity.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Application security software, Cloud security, Data security,  Identity and access management, Infrastructure protection software, Network security,  Advisory, Implementation, Managed security services.  • Single-domain specialised vendors: Have targeted, specialised capabilities in a specific  domain, covering wide range of customer requirements in a narrow technological  spectrum. Below some examples of their offerings:  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  33  Value Chain: Hardware, Software, Advisory, Implementation.  Value Stack IT: Management Platforms, Connectivity, Fault detection, Remote Operation.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Application security software, Cloud security, Data security,  Identity and access management, Infrastructure protection software, Network security,  Advisory, Implementation, Managed security services.  • Cybersecurity specialist vendors: Are specialised in cybersecurity market segments,  often ones that are not part of core portfolios of by larger vendors. They emerged in  developing cybersecurity market segments where they leverage innovative, state-of-the-art  cybersecurity technologies to ensure differentiation. Below some examples of their  offerings:  Value Cain: Hardware, Software and Advisory.  Value Stack Cybersecurity: Identity and access management, Network security, Hardware  security modules, Advisory, Threat analysis, Risk Management, Penetration testing.  As regards vertical industries, an initial proposal is presented in Figure 8 below. With increasing  experience in cybersecurity market analysis but also by considering available best practices40,  this list is going to be updated/consolidated accordingly. It is worth mentioning, that these  vertical industries in the current version do not entail any cybersecurity related industries.  Cybersecurity is assumed as “horizontal” to these industries. Moreover, the core value chain  and value stack (i.e. product, service and process offerings) of those industries may entail  cybersecurity as an integrated part of the offering that is built-in feature of their offerings and not  as their main product.  40 https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/10/january-2021-cyber-attacks-statistics/, accessed December 2021.  https://www.hackmageddon.com/2021/02/10/january-2021-cyber-attacks-statistics/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  34  Figure 8: Proposed list of vertical industries (initial, non-exhaustive)  2.2.5 Methods for collecting market data  The method chosen for the collection of market analysis data is of major role for the utilization of  the available resources and the achievement of the targeted quality of findings, in accordance to  the scope of the analysis (see also discussion in Section 2.2.1).  The existing methods for data collection41 (also depicted in Figure 1 through the box labelled  Method) consist of:  • Primary research: Consists of collection of data directly from organization that is targeted  by the market analysis effort (i.e. relevant market stakeholder types from relevant vertical  41 https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/blog/how-conduct-market-research-small-businesses, accessed December 2021.  https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/blog/how-conduct-market-research-small-businesses  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  35  industry, see Section 2.2.4). Primary research is usually implemented through surveys and  interviews (online, per phone or mail). This method has the advantage of direct  involvement in the collection, the possibility to steer the discussion with interviewed  organizations and the ownership of the collected data. A disadvantage of this methods is  that it might imply quite significant costs.  • Secondary research: This research consists of data collection from already published,  open source (OSINT) market analysis information. It is usually sufficient to provide a good  generic overview on market issues related to a specific domain. It should be the principal  choice in the starting phases of market research efforts, for example during the scoping of  an analysis (see also Section 2.2.1). The advantage of this method is its low costs, its  efficiency and ownership of collected data. A disadvantage might be that the information  publicly available might be limited or inaccurate.  • Use of market analyst services: The research can be contracted to external market  analyst companies. They provide “turnkey” market analyses given a number of “(market)  research questions”. Though this method leverages on existing skills and data collection  infrastructure, it is necessary to precisely formulate the research questions and ensure that  the analysis will produce the desired results in the desired manner (i.e. report types). This  can be achieved, for example, by performing a scoping exercise, as described in Section  2.2.1 above, prior to contracting a market analyst organisation. A disadvantage of this  method is that the collected data will reside by the contractor.  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  36  3. RELATED AREAS  As mentioned in CSA1, cybersecurity market analysis is a multi-purpose tool that can be used in  a variety of ways towards developing cybersecurity within Europe. In this chapter we provide  information on how cybersecurity market analysis interacts with other areas, respectively how  other areas may contribute or may profit from available market analysis efforts.  • Certification: Cybersecurity market analysis very relevant for certification. Through  targeted market analyses, the market effects of certification can be identified: market  analysis can help assessing the market penetration of various certification labels (including  prospective EU labels). Moreover, market analysis can provide insights about the size and  value chains of organisations engaging in certification businesses, with the objective, for  example, to strengthen their market presence. From initial experience through the  ECSMAF pilotError! Bookmark not defined., it became apparent, that cybersecurity certification  market analyses will need to have a narrower scope. In order to assess certification needs,  for example, the efficiency of current protection policies need to be illuminated. This  means, that “deeper” levels of the cybersecurity value stack will need to be taken into  account; or detailed assets exposure to threats need to be considered. In both cases, the  analysis will need to embrace particular details of the relevant assets in scope. Having  said that, it seems more appropriate to analyse certification needs vial second or even  third tire “dives” into product, service and process structures to assess the effects of or the  need for certification. The interaction between cybersecurity certification and market  analysis may be:  Cybersecurity certification -> Cybersecurity market analysis: may support cybersecurity  market analysis during the phase of setting the scope, by providing distinct sector and the  elements (assets) of the infrastructure to be analysed.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity certification: Market analysis can provide  proposals for areas to be taken into account for cybersecurity certification. These may be  particular infrastructure parts that have been assessed by means of market gaps, while  they are considered to be important parts/enabler of value stack elements.  • Cybersecurity Research and Innovation: Cybersecurity market analysis has a strong  relevance to research and innovation. This is manifested via the role of technology trends  for supply and demand market dynamics in the resulting market analysis. Such trends may  be developed within research and innovation work. Moreover, innovation actions, in  particular (e.g. deployment activities, establishment of research priorities, innovation  activities, etc.), generate market drivers that will affect internal market. Hence, research  and innovation information is best suited as input towards parametrization of ECSMAF for  targeted cybersecurity market analyses. On the other hand, cybersecurity market analysis  can provide valuable input regarding market gaps and niches that can affect research and  innovation strategies, aiming at strengthening internal market.  Cybersecurity research and innovation -> Cybersecurity market analysis: may provide  trending information according to identified research and innovation priorities. It may  provide scoping information for areas/technologies/sectors that have been addressed in  research activities and seem to be good candidates for deployment actions.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity research and innovation: Cybersecurity  market analysis can be performed prior to the identification of research and innovation  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  37  actions, as a form of “market scouting” effort. By extrapolating market gap / market niche  information to existing (matured) research results and/or innovation areas, for example,  one can assess their adequacy/potential as market enablers.  • Policy actions: Cybersecurity market analysis can be an important tool during impact  assessments performed within policy proposals. As market is a strong indicator, but also  discrete focus of most polity actions, the performance of analyses within the scope of  policy actions is very useful. One point that could be stated at this point as example is the  policy area of strategic autonomy and sovereignty: cybersecurity market analysis can  contribute towards identification of dependencies of cybersecurity supply chains, degree of  market domination by various types of vendors in various cybersecurity topics,  identification of (regional) demand requirements, etc. Such information may generate  strong evidence for prospective targeted policy actions in the area of cybersecurity. On the  other hand, policy actions can deliver proper scoping information towards targeted market  analyses (e.g. market segment, desired market outcomes and market stakeholder types  (demand and supply sides)).  Policy actions -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Policy actions can provide concrete scope  for cybersecurity market analysis, either within impact assessment, or for the purpose of  evaluation of issued policy actions for various market segments.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Policy actions: Cybersecurity market analysis can deliver  valuable information regarding estimated market trends and/or observed market effects of  policy actions. It can also provide insights about discrete parts of cybersecurity value  chain, in support of evidence needed to issue new or further develop existing policy  actions. In addition, market analysis is a key element of market observatories, mentioned  in various policy documents (see also next bullet point).  • Cybersecurity market observatories: Market observatories perform wide-scope  assessments w.r.t. various market parameters (i.e. dynamics, price development, demand  development, identification of market players, etc.)42,43,44. Cybersecurity market analysis  overlaps with observatories, as far as a broader scope is taken into account. Here, a clear  synergy potential does exist, as far as used analysis techniques and experiences on  market analyses is concerning. This is particularly interesting in cases of observatories  established within Member States and/or EU-Institutions: here the synergies with ENISA  are evident, as a stronger exchange, both at the level of analysis method and market data  exchange may emerge.  Cybersecurity market observatories -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Multiple synergies  can be implemented, both regarding knowledge transfers regarding the used market  analysis method and collected information (both raw data and market analysis findings).  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity market observatories: All relevant outputs  from cybersecurity market analysis can be easily adopted by cybersecurity observatories,  depending on the maturity level available or planned capabilities. As regards institutional  observatories of EU/Member States, ENISA actively seeks for cooperation opportunities,  among other things by means of the established ad hoc Working Group of EU  Cybersecurity MarketError! Bookmark not defined..  • Incidents / threats /risks landscaping: Cybersecurity market analysis uses incident,  threat and risk information/assessments in order to identify market trends and possibly  42 https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/, accessed December 2021.  43 https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/cyber-security-europe/, accessed December 2021.  44 https://www.cyberwatching.eu/, accessed December 2021.  https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/ https://cyberstartupobservatory.com/cyber-security-europe/ https://www.cyberwatching.eu/  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  38  scoping information for analysis: often, observed incidents and threat exposures lead to  the deployment of new products (e.g. ransomware protection offerings45). Moreover, threat  exposure and incident statistics have been turned to be a useful criterion in scoping the  ECSMAF pilot performed in 2021. Though possible, we do not assume at the time being  that cybersecurity market analysis can contribute to incidents, threat and risk landscapes  content-wise. Nonetheless, market analysis may contribute to the assessment of demand- requirements, as well as usage of products, services and processes related to incident,  threat and risk management (i.e. management platforms, managed services and product  offerings).  Incidents / threats /risks landscaping -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Cybersecurity  market analysis can process landscaping information as an important criterion to set foci of  market analyses.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Incidents / threats /risks landscaping: Cybersecurity  market analysis may analyse market data of existing offerings w.r.t. products, services and  processes covering incident, threat and risk assessment and management.  • Emerging trends - Foresight46: As indicated in the discussion so far, emerging trends  play a multiple role within cybersecurity market analysis. Firstly within the module  technology research; but are also part of macro-economic factors. Furthermore, they are  also a useful insight even at the scoping phase. For these reasons, it is expected that an  intense interaction between market analysis and foresight will be necessary. But also  market analysis results may be useful for foresight: it might be the case, that the  performance of a market analysis produces trending information for a certain, relatively  narrow-scoped area/sector that might be an interesting feedback for foresight (i.e. was  originally out of scope of a certain foresight focus). Such information, if deemed relevant,  may be fed to consecutive iterations of the foresing exercise, or serve as validation of  already created forecasts.  Emerging trends – Foresight -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Emerging trends provide  valuable information to cybersecurity market analysis by means of trending information  that can be used for technology research and potentially for macro-environmental factors.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Emerging trends – Foresight: Cybersecurity market  analysis may provide some more detailed information to foresight, related to some  “deeper” trends that have been assessed within analyses with more specific foci.  • Cybersecurity index: An ENISA-activity in the area of cybersecurity index aims at the  creation of composite cybersecurity index providing for an aggregated assessment of the  maturity level of cybersecurity across the EU. Its aim is to map the impact of cybersecurity  by means of quantitative and qualitative indexes and on developing cybersecurity  taxonomies and (quantitative and qualitative) assessments of cybersecurity. As it can be  assumed that cybersecurity market maturity is one key dimension for the cybersecurity  maturity within the EU, market analysis results may directly flow in the cybersecurity index  as additional qualitative/quantitative data. Equally important is the use of a consolidated  taxonomy, as it will enable comparability of cybersecurity topics. Another element is the  provision of scoping information to market analysis: maturity cybersecurity (from low to  high) can become an interesting focus for market analysis. Hence, cybersecurity index can  45 https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware- protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_cont ent=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud- 755007040539:kwd- 13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkz MK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB, accessed December 2021.  46 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/step-towards-foresight-on-emerging-cybersecurity-challenges, accessed  November 2021.  https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware-protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_content=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud-755007040539:kwd-13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzMK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware-protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_content=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud-755007040539:kwd-13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzMK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware-protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_content=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud-755007040539:kwd-13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzMK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware-protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_content=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud-755007040539:kwd-13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzMK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware-protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_content=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud-755007040539:kwd-13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzMK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB https://www.antivirusguide.com/best-ransomware-protection/?lp=true&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&sgv_medium=search&utm_campaign=6478205166&utm_content=77388860066&utm_term=anti%20ransomware&cid=508925511743&pl=&feeditemid=&targetid=aud-755007040539:kwd-13149176227&mt=b&network=g&device=c&adpos=&p1=&p2=&geoid=9067692&gclid=Cj0KCQiAzMGNBhCyARIsANpUkzMK2cFBPpIf0r8MNEx9eQfzvQxXwA0m_nwN4AoyhMwmCEJZdLqcgzYaApvvEALw_wcB https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/step-towards-foresight-on-emerging-cybersecurity-challenges  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  39  act as an indication for the need to assess a specific market sector. Last but not least,  product, service and process maturity issues are subject of market analysis too (see  demand-side research in Section 2.1.2). This information can be mutually exchanged  among cybersecurity index and market analysis as described below:  Cybersecurity index -> Cybersecurity market analysis: Cybersecurity index can provide  scoping information for cybersecurity market analysis. Moreover, it maintains a taxonomy  that can be input to and/or consolidated with the cybersecurity market taxonomy.  Cybersecurity market analysis -> Cybersecurity index: Cybersecurity market can assess  maturity of products, services and processes. Should they be in the focus of a market  analysis, they can serve as input to the cybersecurity index. Equally, the developed  cybersecurity market taxonomy can be used as input to and/or consolidated with the  cybersecurity index taxonomy.  Concluding this chapter, we would like to state that quite few of the interaction points mentioned  above are covered through regular interactions/coordination, mainly with ENISA-internal  stakeholders/units, but also external ones. Some of those are going to lead to activities in 2022,  and are covered in the forthcoming chapter by means of future work (see Section 4.1).  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  40  4. ISSUES, CONSIDERATIONS,  CONCLUSIONS  In 2021, ENISA was in the position to start building capabilities in the area of cybersecurity  market analysis. The framework presented in this report, an initial pilot of the framework and the  creation of the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on the EU Cybersecurity Market have been the  main activities performed by the Agency in 2021 in this area.  4.1 GENERAL REMARKS  The market research for the pilot of the framework has been conducted by a major market  analyst organisation. From this initial experience in the area of market analysis, the issues  surfaced can be summarized as follows and some general remarks can be made:  • Cybersecurity market analysis is at a crossroad: When cybersecurity meets market  analysis, one can speak about a meeting point of two different disciplines: a highly,  structured, relatively new technological area comes to profit from one area of economics  with much longer record and established methods. In order to establish the mutual  understanding of these disciplines, a significant knowledge transfer is necessary:  cybersecurity specialists need to understand the functioning rules of the market, while  economists/analysts need to gain an insight of the cybersecurity product, service and  process landscape. It seems that this is the root-cause for vivid discussions between  cybersecurity experts and market analysts e.g. regarding terminology and used analysis  methods, report content and structure. It has become evident, that there some time is  needed for both disciplines to mutually understand each-other, and that the development  of some basic tools to pass this knowledge are necessary (e.g. cybersecurity market  taxonomy).  • Scoping is the key to success: Scoping, in Scoping the analysis, in particular defining  the area of the cybersecurity market to focus the analysis on, is maybe the most important,  yet not simplest step in market analysis efforts. Firstly, because security is a matter that  can only be analysed when a certain depth of knowledge has been reached. Secondly,  because of the divergence of views and methodological backgrounds between involved  experts (see also previous point). Hence, at the current stage of “bridging” cybersecurity  and market analysis, knowledge exchanges need to take place in order to understand how  a cybersecurity scope can be formulated, how can it be “translated” into (market-) research  questions, and how much effort is necessary to achieve the expected outcome at the  expected quality.  • Your data vs. my data vs. our market data: The data collection strategy has to be  selected in accordance with to the market analysis strategy. There are a number of  questions that matter in this respect, such as: Is market data collection and analysis going  to be mostly contracted or mostly done in-house? Are the market analysis objectives for a  certain domain/sector fixed, or they might variate over time? What are the long-term  approaches for cybersecurity market analysis efforts (one-off, repetitive, iterative,  evolutionary, dynamic, variating)? Are raw data for a certain analysis interesting for longer  term, or just the market analysis results count? Are raw data for the defined scope the  already available, or need to be raised through dedicated surveys? Are available data free  of bias! Answering these questions should be a priority for the determination of the amount  of resources, for selecting market research methods (primary, secondary, outsourcing), for  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  41  selecting a data management approach and for establishing a corresponding human and  toll infrastructure (including confidentiality issues, see next point).  • Confidentiality issue emerging from collected market data: Given the nature of raw  market data, - both at the supply and demand sides - they entail a mix of competitive,  confidential and intellectual property related information. Hence, specific confidentiality  requirements emerge for the use/processing of this information, or even parts of it (i.e.  processing, storage, management, dissemination, etc.). The inhered confidentiality of  market information may be an inhibitor for the motivation of stakeholder to provide this  information, unless a trust relationship and evidence for adequate processing techniques  are available (i.e. data protection in transit and at rest, anonymization, implementation of  relevant security controls, etc.). These issues need to be addressed, the latest when this  information is stored and processed locally.  4.2 OPEN ISSUES AND WAYS FORWARD  Concluding this report, we would like to highlight a series of open issues that should constitute  the short to middle term priorities in advancing the work on the EU cybersecurity market. ENISA  will draw from these points the actions to be performed in the area of market analysis in 2022  and 2023. Identified open points that fall in the responsibility of other players in the EU  ecosystem are proposal that will be validated by, discussed and followed up with the  corresponding entities.  Cybersecurity Market and ENISA:  • Streamline ECSMAF content: The content of the framework needs to be better specified  in a greater detail level for some ECSMAF modules and horizontal components. This will  include identification of economic sizes to be measured, consolidation of vertical industries  and identification of content of report types. The highest priority will be the creation of a  coherent/consolidate taxonomy, allowing for usage within various cybersecurity topics  (incidents, threats, market analysis, cybersecurity index, etc.). Hereto, a cooperation with  JRC is envisaged.  • Perform scoping exercises: Scoping of analysis is a key activity within ECSMAF. It will  be very important to gain experience with this activity, including defining criteria, checking  parametrization techniques to cover variating foci (e.g. wide vs. deep analyses, thematic  vs. generic analyses, iterative vs. one-off analyses, etc.). This work will help towards better  representing scope for various cybersecurity market analysis topics and various detail  levels of analysis (e.g. certification).  • Tooling for Cybersecurity Market Analysis: The development of necessary tools for the  performance of primary and secondary market research is important for the market  analyses. These tools include tools for storage of collected information (database),  creation of reports based on analytics, and availability of a means for performing own  primary research (surveys, questions).  • Continue coordination: As indicated in Chapter 3, cybersecurity market analysis has  various interfaces to other ENISA activities. The coordination of this work will be a main  priority for 2022 and beyond.  Cybersecurity Market and Member States:  • Identify and establish synergies: Member States have already or are about to establish  cybersecurity market surveillance functions, notably for “monitoring the compliance of ICT  products […] with the requirements of the European cybersecurity certificates”1. Such  activities will create important synergies in the area of cybersecurity market analysis, both  within Member States and with ENISA. The identification of the state-of-play with regard to  development of market surveillance in Member States will be a priority for ENISA in 2022  and beyond.  Cybersecurity Market and Commission:  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  42  • Identification of potential cybersecurity market analysis needs: Cybersecurity market  analysis may become an important tool for the need of EU policy actions. It will be  important to assess potential foci of EU cybersecurity market analysis in order to identify  resources and needs for know-how transfer. Moreover, in order to follow ENISA work in  this area, the European Commission and interested Member States may desire to play an  observer role within the ENISA Ad Hoc Working Group on EU Cybersecurity Market, to  provide support regarding e.g. scoping exercises.

The new coalition government has unveiled its programme, with a number of priorities  and timeframe for implementation. One of them includes the approval within one year of new  laws, which increase the rate of corporate taxation and introduce subsidies to support local  business. A foreign company established in this country for 10 years has assessed the potential  impact of these new policies and had determined that they would adversely affect the  company’s operations and increase the degree of competition from local players. In addition, as  these measures enjoy a widespread consensus among citizens, it is very likely that the new  government would strive to implement them, especially as the next election will be organized  next year. As a result, this company is considering moving its operations in another country with  a more favorable and competitive business environment.  Example of an Economic Factor: Because of a new legislation, an SME forecasted a 40%  growth in the demand of its Industrial Control Systems solutions in the upcoming years. In order  to satisfy the future demand, this SME has decided to expand its operations, by making  investments to finance the opening of a new laboratory in another country, purchase new  machinery as well as starting a recruitment process. This investment decision is expected to  indebt the organization for the upcoming years, after which a return on investments is made. In  order to lower the impact of the debt over the years, the analysists of this organization have  monitored for the last six months the economic indicators in a number of countries. This helps  identifying combining a number of favorable economic conditions, such as a low interest rate on  corporate loans, an IT-savvy workforce associated with reasonable labor costs, and an  affordable price of electricity (relative to other countries), which has remained stable over a  period of five years.  Example of Social Factor: The smartphone industry has been object of a negative media  coverage in one of its most profitable country, due to the insufficient measures to decrease its  carbon footprint (e.g. e-waste, end-of-life) and ensure an appropriate level of data protection of  smartphone devices. A survey clearly shows that adult consumers between 30-60 years old,  living in the country’s largest cities, are the most sensitive to environmental and privacy aspects.  These consumers represent the industry’s main target audience and the wealthiest group of the  country. In addition, the vast majority of this group declared that the sustainability practices  employed by companies and the provision of clear information regarding the data protection  features of IT devices are key elements influencing their purchases. These findings partly  explain the steady and continuous decrease of the smartphones sales of leading companies in  this country in favour of more sustainable and more privacy-friendly ones. As a result, one  smartphone company is considering to support initiative for sustainable and ethical  smartphones, develop a Corporate Social Responsibility programme, commit to use 80%  recycled materials, introduce privacy-by-default features in its devices, allow options to install  alternative operating systems and create a label to help consumers understand its privacy  policy.  Example of Technological Factor: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, shopping centers have been  obliged to implement the new government restrictions, aiming to limit human contacts and the  number of people entering a shop in a given timeframe. Many stores have adopted e-payment  methods to speed up the checkout process while contributing to maintain a safer environment  for both employees and customers.  To be ahead of its competitors and ensure compliance with the new rules, a supermarket chain  has decided to make full use of digital technology. As a result, the IT department has developed  a mobile shopping app, which makes it convenient for consumers to browse and shop online,  ENISA CYBERSECURITY MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (ECSMAF)  Version 1.0 | April 2022  49  and book a home delivery service. In addition, the online and physical stores of this chain have  decided to accept a growing number of e-payment options. The chain has also started its own  brand-specific mobile wallet app that would facilitate transactions both online and in physical  stores, further encouraging touchless and secure e-payments. In addition, thanks to these  technology uptakes, the accounting department of the chain will be able to process transactions  more easily and quicker.

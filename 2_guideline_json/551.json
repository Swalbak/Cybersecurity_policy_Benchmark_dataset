In this Security Guide we map a set of security risks with security requirements which can be applied  to vendors to prevent or mitigate those risks. The described risks and proposed security requirements  are based on findings from a desk top study, a questionnaire with 29 providers and interviews with 10  providers and 2 vendors.  We hope that the Security Guide for ICT Procurement will be useful for providers when negotiating  and collaborating with ICT product vendors or outsourcing partners and for vendors when developing  and managing the security of their portfolio of products and services.

In order to prevent or mitigate such  security risks, providers have the opportunity to apply specific security requirements to their suppliers  or outsourcing partners.  In discussions with providers, they indicated that there are sometimes problems or misunderstandings  in the vendor-provider relationships and outsourcing in general. More specifically, providers are not  always empowered to effectively manage the security risks involved in those relationships. For this  reason and in cooperation with providers in the ENISA Electronic Communications Reference Group  ENISA has studied this topic and developed this Security Guide for ICT Procurement that providers but  also vendors may use when entering into a contractual relationship regarding products and  outsourced services for core operations of electronic communications networks and services.  Goal and Scope  With this report ENISA’s objective is to support primarily electronic communications service providers  but also ICT vendors with practical guidelines to better manage the security risks impacting the  resilience of networks and services.  More specifically, it provides an overview of the security risks to be considered when procuring critical  ICT products or outsourcing critical ICT services to third parties. This report examines the risks in third  party products or services which could lead to the disruption of the electronic communications  services for the customers, and the report equips providers with specific and practical security  requirements aimed at vendors in order to prevent or mitigate such security risks, to better deal with  them in the procurement or outsourcing phase and avoid or recover from breaches in their core  services.  Target audience  The Security Guide for ICT Procurement is primarily targeted at providers and its experts responsible  for and involved in the procurement of key ICT products and services. It will support the providers in  the definition of security requirements which will be applied to their vendors and outsourcing partners  to guarantee the resilience and security of their networks and services. In addition, it can be used by  vendors in the development and security management of their products and services. This will help  them in meeting the expectations of the providers at the early phase of the procurement process.  Methodology  In order to gather experience and opinions from experts in the field, ENISA has:   launched an anonymous online survey to providers across the EU bringing insights from 29  providers about their main concerns and areas of focus when buying ICT equipment or  outsourcing ICT services to third parties, the type of security policy they have in place and the  main security requirements they apply to their suppliers to prevent or mitigate security risks;   performed interviews with experts from 10 providers and 2 vendors, from several countries  within Europe but also companies from other countries, and  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 2   performed a desktop research and analysed initiatives already taken by Governments,  National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and the industry including guidelines shared by  providers and vendors.1  By analysing these inputs, specific security requirements have been drafted, which could be applied  by vendors to ensure the security and resilience of electronic communication networks and services.  The findings from the survey, issues and concerns that providers have expressed, current applied  practices, our own observations, general recommendations to the sector as well as recommendations  to the providers, are all summarised in a separate report called Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic  Communications.2  Structure of this document  To stay consistent with ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Security Measures Version 2.0, and in line with  recommendations received from the interviewees, the Security Guide is structured according to  ENISA’s seven security domains (D1-7).3  D1: Governance and risk management  D2: Human resources security  D3: Security of systems and facilities  D4: Operations management  D5: Incident management  D6: Business continuity management  D7: Monitoring, auditing and testing  In section 2 the report maps the identified security risks to be addressed in the procurement or  outsourcing process, to security requirements which can be applied to the vendors to prevent or  mitigate those risks.  1 See references, page 22.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  3 Note that security requirements in this Security Guide are specifically addressed to vendors in their role as suppliers of products or services  for core operations of electronic communications networks and services, and they should not be mixed up with the security measures  described in the ENISA Technical Guideline on Security Measures (v 2.0), http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 3  2 Security requirements for vendors  The security requirements in this Security Guide for ICT Procurement are based on ENISA’s survey with  providers and vendors and on guidelines shared by providers and vendors, and they are also inspired  by good practises promoted by industry standards or by country regulated initiatives.  Please note that throughout this document “provider” refers to electronic communications network  and service providers while “vendor” refers to suppliers of ICT products or outsourcing partners.  These guidelines have been divided in the seven security domains and split across the 25 security  objectives (SO) defined in ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Security Measures Version 2.0.4 For each  security objective we describe one or several risks, and mapped to the risks we propose a set of  security requirements aimed at vendors.  2.1 Governance and risk management  SO1: Information security policy/ SO2: Governance and risk management  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to align its security practises to the provider’s security objectives.  Security requirements   The provider’s security objectives should be fully understood and integrated by the vendor.   The vendor selected should have an information security policy ensuring the security and  resilience of its products and services, and aligned with the provider’s high level security  objectives.   The vendor should provide evidence of its relevant internal information security policy  ensuring the security and resilience of its products and services for provider’s analysis.  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to meet the provider’s security objectives due to a lack of communication and  misunderstanding between the two parties regarding actions to be taken by the vendor.  Security requirements   A contract should be signed by the vendor enforcing specific security requirements, defined  by the provider and aligned with its security objectives. Security requirements should be  clear, precise, actionable and measurable.   Security requirements are defined by the provider during the Risk Assessment.   The provider should be able to request updates on the security requirements in light of any  tests/exercises or incidents affecting the provider’s systems and/or the vendor’s similar  products or services in the electronic communications sector. Updated security  requirements would then be implemented undisputedly by the vendor.  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 4  Security Risks  Provider’s failure to comply with national legal obligations imposed by law or secondary legislation  due to lack of support from the vendor.  Security requirements   The provider should be able to request the vendor to comply with legal obligations imposed  by law or secondary legislation on the provider without any increase of costs.  SO3: Security roles and responsibilities  Security Risks  Failure to clearly and/or correctly establish key roles and responsibilities regarding security risks  management between the provider and the vendor leading to:  - Confusion and misunderstanding between parties in case of a threat or incident;  - Incorrect implementation of security requirements;  - Lack of accountability in case of security breaches not recognised within the vendor’s  organization.  Security requirements   Clearly define and state responsibilities and roles within the contract to avoid confusion,  misunderstanding or abuses.   One person within the vendor’s organization should be accountable during the whole  contract lifecycle to ensure that:  - security risks and requirements are fully understood;  - appropriate processes are in place and a minimum acceptable level of residual risk is  agreed with the provider and duly accepted by each party;  - security risks are managed and appropriate processes are in place and communicated to  the provider;  - Appropriate support is provided to the provider through relevant helpdesk or other as  defined by the contract;  - Contractual clauses are respected.   Force Majeure which releases the vendor from its responsibility should be clearly defined  to avoid any abuses from the vendor.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 5  SO4: Security of third party assets  Security Risks  Provider’s exposure to additional security threats due to the vendor’s use of downstream  subcontractors to provide products or services to the provider. These threats include but are not  limited to:  - Lack of information regarding the downstream subcontractors;  - Lack of vendor’s competent supervision and effective control on its subcontractors;  Failure to enforce security requirements to the vendor’s subcontractors.  Security requirements   The vendor should provide information regarding existing and/or potential subcontractors  used to provide products and services to the provider. This information will be included in  the Risk Assessment performed by the provider and should be taken into account in the  definition of the security requirements.   The subcontractor must comply with the same or equivalent security measures as the ones  applied to the vendor.   The vendor should remain solely accountable for all the actions performed by its  subcontractors, responsible for managing security within its subcontractors and providing  assurance that security requirements operate efficiently to meet the provider’s security  objectives.  2.2 Human resources security  SO5: Background check  Security Risks  Unintentional or intentional alterations of products or systems performed by the vendor’s  employees including faulty changes or upgrades, configuration errors, bad maintenance, insider  attacks, etc.  Security requirements   Credentials of the vendor’s employees should be provided to demonstrate their relevant  experience in security risks management.   When legally permitted and justified by a level of criticality of service provided, the vendor  should do its due diligence to flag any criminal records in its employees’ background, to  avoid any sinister and intentional alterations of products or systems. Evidence of the due  diligence should be made available to the provider for consultation.

Security requirements   The vendor’s employees’ should receive appropriate training to implement and operate  security requirements applied by the provider.   The vendor should provide sufficient evidence regarding the training program of its  employees.   If requested by the provider, the vendor should have the required qualified personnel (e.g.  ISO certified).   A designated proportion of the vendor’s employees should follow regular training to stay  up-to-date in an evolved technological environment with changing security practises.   The vendor should provide sufficient evidence regarding the training program of its  employees.   The vendor should carry out its due diligence to ensure that its employees have sufficient  security and technical knowledge, skills and qualification, to avoid any unintentional  alterations of products or systems. Evidences of the due diligence should be available to  the provider for consultation.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 7  SO7: Personnel changes  Security Risks  Disrupted and inefficient management of security risks due to entry or change of personnel on the  vendor’s side with deviations from the contract specifications.  Security requirements   All personnel from the vendors or downstream subcontractors, who are given access to  confidential information or customer personal data related to the provider, should sign a  confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement with their employer. The vendor should also  have clauses regarding confidentiality and personal data protection included in the contract  signed with the provider.   Any change of personnel, as defined and agreed in the contract, should be mentioned to  the provider.   Any replacements of personnel in the scope of the service should be agreed with the  provider.   A knowledge transfer process should be defined and executed by the vendor between the  employees that get substituted.   Access right to the provider’s information systems should be timely revoked by the vendor  for personnel who have been discharged.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 8  2.3 Security of systems and facilities  SO9: Physical and environmental security  Security Risks  Unintentional or intentional alteration of products or systems due to weak or a lack of physical  access measures provided by the vendor.  Natural phenomenon’s impacts (Overheating, storms, floods, etc.) on products or systems due to  weak or a lack of physical security measures provided by the vendor.  Security requirements   The vendor should have specific security processes in place ensuring the physical security  of its products or systems, and preventing any unauthorized access to its physical facilities  and infrastructure including but not limited to:  - Procedures for securing manufacturing sites;  - Procedures for securing storage sites;  - Procedures for securing operational sites;  - Procedures for securing the packaging and the transport of equipment.   Evidence of the physical security processes should be shared with the provider for analysis.   Processes should be followed routinely by the vendor.   The effectiveness of the processes should be periodically assessed by the vendor and  revised when required, especially following any incidents and tests/exercises affecting the  provider’s systems and/or the vendor’s similar products or services in the electronic  communications sector.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 9  SO11: Access control to network and information systems  Security Risks  Unintentional or Intentional alteration of products or systems due to weak or a lack of logical  access measures provided by the vendor.  Security requirements   The vendor should have specific logical access controls in place ensuring the security of its  products or systems and preventing any unauthorized access to its networks and  information systems: including but not limited to:  - User identification and authentication;  - Unique ID;  - Segregation of duties;  - Privilege based access groups.   Evidence of logical access controls should be shared with the provider for analysis.   The effectiveness of the processes should be periodically assessed by the vendor and  revised when required, especially following tests/exercises or any incidents affecting the  provider’s systems and/or the vendor’s similar products or services in the electronic  communications sector.   Access to sensitive networks and information systems should be restricted to the vendor’s  employees who have a specific business need.   Access list with the vendor’s individuals authorized to access networks and information  systems with their rights and privileges should be regularly reviewed by the vendor.   A review of activity log should be performed by the vendor in order to flag any anomalous  behaviour. This review should be performed by a third party (e.g. independent quality  reviewer within the vendor organization).   Systems detecting and recording any attempted damage, amendment or unauthorized  access should be implemented by the vendor.   Note that these last 2 measures are relatively costly and severe to implement for a vendor.  It could be requested only in case highly critical provider's information systems are  involved.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 10  SO12: Integrity of network and information systems  Security Risks  Insertion of malicious content such as viruses, code or malware leading to an alteration of the  integrity and/or the functionality of a product or a system.  Security requirements   The vendor should validate the product’s or system’s integrity by performing appropriate  scanning and testing before its integration into the provider’s infrastructure.   Testing/Scanning procedures and results should be shared with the provider for analysis.   In case of counterfeit items, the vendor should take the appropriate measures to replace  it, ensuring the continuity of service for the provider with the same level of security.  2.4 Operations management  SO13: Operational procedures  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to run its daily operations according to the provider’s security requirements.  Security requirements   As part of the contract, the vendor should agree with the provider on a Service Level  Agreement (SLA) that specifies, in measurable terms, what services the vendor shall  provide. This includes:  - The minimum level of service that the provider will accept.  - The minimum level of residual risk (once controls have been implemented) that the  provider will accept. This minimum acceptable level of residual risk should be agreed  with the provider’s senior management.  - Security oriented Key Performance Indicators (KPI) under which the provider will assess  the vendor’s performance. KPIs should be precise and measurable.   The vendor’s performance will be regularly assessed and the provider will refer back to the  SLA.   The vendor should provide any supportive data, record or report which will facilitate the  assessment of its performance by the provider. In addition, the vendor should share the  knowledge necessary for the provider to fully understand the data, record or report.   The vendor should be exposed to penalties in case of insufficiencies or divergences with the  SLA. For highly critical systems, higher penalties should be agreed.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 11  SO14: Change management  Security Risks  Failed changes (e.g. update failure) leading to partial or complete disruption of services for the  providers due to lack or inefficient change management processes.  Inefficient security requirements due to weak or lack of change management processes in an  evolving environment with constant technological changes.  Security requirements   The vendor should maintain processes for change management. A different process can be  implemented based on the type of change required:  - Newly discovered vulnerability leading to adoption of additional security measures;  - Software update;  - Hardware replacement.   The change management process should include accurate and efficient testing (see SO 23).  More precisely, the vendor should test any software or hardware changes before its  integration into the life environment. Evidences should be provided to the provider.   The responsibilities for the change initiation and the additional cost payment should be  established in advance and stated in the contract.   The vendor should take responsibilities for changes related to:  - Any vendor initiated changes;  - Other changes agreed in the contract (e.g. update).  - Variations in the service levels caused by the vendor;  - Newly discovered vulnerabilities in vendor’s product or system;   Vendor’s corrective actions following a security incident.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 12  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to maintain a suitable security level and operate security requirements during the  transition process once the contract with the provider is terminated.  This includes the transition from the vendor back to the provider or to another vendor.  Security requirements   A contingency plan should be in place in case either party wishes to terminate the  relationship even before the end of the agreement.   The vendor should define and agree with the provider on a transition plan ensuring the  management of security until the handover to the provider or to another vendor is  completed.   The vendor should transfer all documents, procedures, configuration, records, etc. related  to the product or service which are necessary to guarantee a smooth continuation of the  service for the provider.   The vendor should return or destroy all files, records, documents containing provider’s  information.   In case the retention of some information is agreed with the provider, specific security  measures need to be agreed and implemented by the vendor to ensure the confidentiality  and the protection of the provider’s data.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 13  SO15: Asset management  Security Risks  Lack of timely replacement plan and efficient logistic function in case some components, products  or systems break sooner or become obsolete making the replacement* or update** of an element  impossible, and leading to a disruption of service for the provider.  *Vendors may discontinue the production of some of their products as technology advances very fast.  Components, products or systems can be unavailable for a provider. A replacement will not be possible.  ** As technology advances very fast, an update can be incompatible with an obsolete system or  infrastructure. An update will not be possible.  Security requirements   The vendor should maintain processes for change management (e.g. software update,  hardware replacement, etc.) (see SO14).   The vendor should consider the time frame within which its products or systems are  expected to become obsolete.   The vendor should perform regular checks on its products and systems to detect any early  signs of obsolescence.   A replacement or updating plan should be developed and implemented by the vendor  taking into account the availability of compatible products, spare parts and compatible  updates with the existing infrastructure to ensure the continuity of services for the provider.   The vendor should provide the evidence that it has an efficient logistic function managing  the inventory of its components, products and systems and ensuring the availability of them  or conformed substitutes in a reasonable time.   The vendor should warrant the replacement or updates of any critical components,  products or systems in the timeframe agreed with the provider in the contract in order to  avoid any breach of services for the provider (Refer to SO19).   The vendor should notify the provider when a product’s update is available.   Support should be provided by the vendor in case of replacement or update.   The minimum time for which the product will be supported by the vendor should be agreed  by both parties as part of the contract.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 14  2.5 Incident management  SO16: Incident management procedures  Security Risks  Extended impact of a disruption of service due to an inefficient management of incidents.  Security requirements   The vendor should have an emergency procedure in place to deal with incidents and/or  provide support to the provider to manage incidents. The procedure will include scenarios  per type of incidents, parties’ roles and responsibilities, escalation process, etc.   The vendor should have a service continuity plan (see SO19) and a disaster recovery plan  (see SO20) in place to minimize the impact of an incident on the provider’s service  availability.   The vendor should comply with the mean time to repair and mean time to recover defined  in the SLA and agreed with the provider.   Each incident management case should be evaluated by the vendor and a report should be  available for the provider (see SO18).   If required for improvement of the incident management procedure, some enhancement  actions (e.g. better workflows, new ways of contact, etc.) could be agreed with the provider  and implemented by the vendor (see SO18).  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 15  SO18: Incident reporting and communications  Security Risks  Failure to send timely early warning to inform the provider about any anomaly, suspected incident  or suspected near miss leading to a bad incident management and disruption of service.  Lack of information regarding past incidents, suspected incidents, near-misses, suspected near  misses or anomalies occurring within the provider’s infrastructure.  Security requirements   Processes should be implemented by the vendor to accurately and timely report to the  provider any security incidents and security breaches occurring with its products or services,  or any data breaches related to the provider, as well as any violations of security  requirements stated in the contract or required by law.  - The vendor should immediately raise an early warning in case of anomalies, suspected  incidents or suspected near missed;  - The vendor should report any past incidents, suspected incidents, near-misses,  suspected near misses or anomalies occurring within the provider’s infrastructure.   Some thresholds could be set up with the agreement of the provider to report only specific  alarms based on their criticality.   The vendor should also report to the provider, any incidents which occurred with its  products or services across the electronic communications industry (i.e. impacting other  providers), when that same products and services are also contracted by the provider.   A clear escalation process should be established between the vendor and the provider to  ensure a well-defined and efficient communication flow. It should define escalation  channels and contacts (primary and backup contacts) between both parties.   The vendor should investigate, support provider in the investigation or request a third party  to investigate past incidents to find the root causes. This can be agreed in the contract or  on a case by case basis.   If required to avoid further incidents, corrective actions could be agreed with the provider  and implemented by the vendor.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 16  2.6 Business continuity management  SO19: Services continuity strategy and contingency plans  Security Risks  Weak or lack of service continuity strategy defined to guarantee the availability of service for the  provider in case of an incident.  Security requirements   The vendor shall ensure by tools, skills, resources or processes that services of the provider  remain operational at all times, complying with the minimum level of service defined in the  SLA and accepted by the provider. This can include, i.a.:  - Spare parts5  - Back up  - Back up personnel to ensure critical functions are always maintained   The vendor should provide complete documentation of business continuity processes.   More specifically, the outsourcing service vendor should have a service continuity plan with  a strong emphasis on potential failures of power supplies. This is very significant given that  a failure of the power supplies can lead to a complete interruption of service for the  provider.   The vendor’s business continuity plan should consider its dependencies of subcontractors   The vendor should review its service continuity plan based on past incidents and past  experience and revise it if necessary.  5 A duplicate part to replace a lost or damaged part of a machine.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 17  SO20: Disaster recovery capabilities  Security Risks  Weak or lack of service recovery capabilities to restore the service of the provider in case of  disaster, major outage or complete interruption of service.  Security requirements   The vendor shall ensure by tools, skills, resources or processes that services of the provider  can recover from a major incident within the minimum time for recovery defined in the SLA.  This can include, i.a.:  - Spare parts6  - Back up  - Back up personnel to ensure critical functions are always maintained   The vendor’s recovery plan should consider its dependencies of subcontractors   The vendor should review its service recovery plan based on past incidents and past  experience and revise it if necessary.   If requested by the provider, the vendor could take part to a drill with the provider to  prepare them in potential big disruptions (storms, huge disaster, individual disruptions of  critical network equipment, etc.).  2.7 Monitoring, auditing and testing  SO21: Monitoring and logging policies  Security Risks  Undetected abnormal performance, bugs or malicious actions due to inefficient traffic or  equipment performance monitoring.  Security requirements   A constant monitoring should be performed by the vendor to detect any abnormal activity  that may indicate issues related to availability or integrity of the provider’s network and  system.   Any anomalies should be investigated by the vendor.   Any anomalies should be immediately reported to the provider (refer to SO18).  6 A duplicate part to replace a lost or damaged part of a machine.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 18  SO23: Network and information systems testing  Security Risks  Inadequate, ineffective or insufficient testing leading to vulnerabilities, malfunctions or other  failures of vendor’s products and services.  Security requirements   Quality and security of the product should be assessed by the vendor against specifications  defined in the contract before its integration into the provider’s system.  Some acceptance  criteria can be set up by the provider and the product or equipment can be rejected if it  does not comply with the provider’s expectations clearly defined in the contract. The  process is valid for new components, patches and update.   The vendor should do its due diligence to ensure regular, accurate and efficient testing and  provide the assurance that products and services are operating as they should:  - Testing should be performed along product/service lifecycle: from the development  stage, before and after its integration to the existing network and when any patches or  updates are performed;  - Testing should be made with the right configuration - in the testing environment,  simulating life environment configurations  (or substitute) when feasible ;  - Testing should be made by iterations to allow the vendor to apply fixes when required;  - Several types of testing should be performed including but not limited to known  vulnerabilities scans, penetration testing, source code analysis, etc.   Testing can be performed by the vendor, the provider, a third party and/or by a  collaborative lab (with provider’s and vendor’s testers). Parties accountable for the testing  need to be agreed and stated in the contract.   Testing frequency needs to be agreed and stated in the contract.   Testing plans and methodologies should be regularly reviewed based on, technology  changes, upgrades and past incidents.   The vendor should share a comprehensive testing report which shall include testing  procedures, identified vulnerabilities, any mitigating actions required and a clear escalation  process in case of further issues.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 19  SO24: Security assessments  Security Risks  Insufficient information about products’ or systems’ potential vulnerabilities before selecting a  vendor or a supplier of outsourcing services.  Weak preventive actions implemented to face the same.  Security requirements   Before entering into a relationship, the vendor should provide its client with documentation  on known products’ and systems’ potential vulnerabilities together with their criticality and  likelihood of being exposed.   A process should be implemented by the vendor to promptly notify the provider about any  newly discovered and exploitable vulnerability (refer to SO18).   The vendor should take into account the evolving threats landscape and should periodically  review the industry security alerts/standards to assess any new potential vulnerability.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 20  SO25: Compliance monitoring  Security Risks  Failure to gain assurance regarding the vendor’s compliance with the security requirements and  failure to ensure that security risks are correctly managed by the vendor.  For example:  - Controls not in place;  - Controls in place not aligned with the provider’s security objectives;  - Deviation in controls.  Security requirements   Regular meetings should be organized between the vendor and the provider to assess the  performance of the vendor regarding the application of the security requirements.   The assurance should be provided by the vendor that the security risks are managed and  the requirements are implemented and operate as agreed with the provider in the contract.  Parties should agree on the scope, the methodology and the frequency of the assurance  report. The assurance can be gained using several methods:  - The vendor can report the security status, risks, vulnerabilities and incidents, as part of  a service reporting.  - The vendor can request regular independent reviews of its service or production  processes and facilities, and reports to the provider the results and any corrective  action identified. Note that this measure is costly for the vendor so it is generally  applied on a case by case basis.  - The provider can have a right of audit or a right of review of its vendor’s service or  production processes including equipment, software, information, record, data or  person relating to it. This can also be performed by a third party if needed. Note that  this measure is costly for the provider so it is generally applied on a case by case basis.   Assurance can be gained through certification (e.g. ISO 27001).

In this Security Guide we map a set of security risks with security requirements which can be applied  to vendors to prevent or mitigate those risks. The described risks and proposed security requirements  are based on findings from a desk top study, a questionnaire with 29 providers and interviews with 10  providers and 2 vendors.  We hope that the Security Guide for ICT Procurement will be useful for providers when negotiating  and collaborating with ICT product vendors or outsourcing partners and for vendors when developing  and managing the security of their portfolio of products and services.

In order to prevent or mitigate such  security risks, providers have the opportunity to apply specific security requirements to their suppliers  or outsourcing partners.  In discussions with providers, they indicated that there are sometimes problems or misunderstandings  in the vendor-provider relationships and outsourcing in general. More specifically, providers are not  always empowered to effectively manage the security risks involved in those relationships. For this  reason and in cooperation with providers in the ENISA Electronic Communications Reference Group  ENISA has studied this topic and developed this Security Guide for ICT Procurement that providers but  also vendors may use when entering into a contractual relationship regarding products and  outsourced services for core operations of electronic communications networks and services.  Goal and Scope  With this report ENISA’s objective is to support primarily electronic communications service providers  but also ICT vendors with practical guidelines to better manage the security risks impacting the  resilience of networks and services.  More specifically, it provides an overview of the security risks to be considered when procuring critical  ICT products or outsourcing critical ICT services to third parties. This report examines the risks in third  party products or services which could lead to the disruption of the electronic communications  services for the customers, and the report equips providers with specific and practical security  requirements aimed at vendors in order to prevent or mitigate such security risks, to better deal with  them in the procurement or outsourcing phase and avoid or recover from breaches in their core  services.  Target audience  The Security Guide for ICT Procurement is primarily targeted at providers and its experts responsible  for and involved in the procurement of key ICT products and services. It will support the providers in  the definition of security requirements which will be applied to their vendors and outsourcing partners  to guarantee the resilience and security of their networks and services. In addition, it can be used by  vendors in the development and security management of their products and services. This will help  them in meeting the expectations of the providers at the early phase of the procurement process.  Methodology  In order to gather experience and opinions from experts in the field, ENISA has:   launched an anonymous online survey to providers across the EU bringing insights from 29  providers about their main concerns and areas of focus when buying ICT equipment or  outsourcing ICT services to third parties, the type of security policy they have in place and the  main security requirements they apply to their suppliers to prevent or mitigate security risks;   performed interviews with experts from 10 providers and 2 vendors, from several countries  within Europe but also companies from other countries, and  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 2   performed a desktop research and analysed initiatives already taken by Governments,  National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) and the industry including guidelines shared by  providers and vendors.1  By analysing these inputs, specific security requirements have been drafted, which could be applied  by vendors to ensure the security and resilience of electronic communication networks and services.  The findings from the survey, issues and concerns that providers have expressed, current applied  practices, our own observations, general recommendations to the sector as well as recommendations  to the providers, are all summarised in a separate report called Secure ICT Procurement in Electronic  Communications.2  Structure of this document  To stay consistent with ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Security Measures Version 2.0, and in line with  recommendations received from the interviewees, the Security Guide is structured according to  ENISA’s seven security domains (D1-7).3  D1: Governance and risk management  D2: Human resources security  D3: Security of systems and facilities  D4: Operations management  D5: Incident management  D6: Business continuity management  D7: Monitoring, auditing and testing  In section 2 the report maps the identified security risks to be addressed in the procurement or  outsourcing process, to security requirements which can be applied to the vendors to prevent or  mitigate those risks.  1 See references, page 22.  2 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors  3 Note that security requirements in this Security Guide are specifically addressed to vendors in their role as suppliers of products or services  for core operations of electronic communications networks and services, and they should not be mixed up with the security measures  described in the ENISA Technical Guideline on Security Measures (v 2.0), http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and- CIIP/Incidents-reporting/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/requirements-ecomms-vendors http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/Incidents-reporting/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures/technical-guideline-on-minimum-security-measures  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 3  2 Security requirements for vendors  The security requirements in this Security Guide for ICT Procurement are based on ENISA’s survey with  providers and vendors and on guidelines shared by providers and vendors, and they are also inspired  by good practises promoted by industry standards or by country regulated initiatives.  Please note that throughout this document “provider” refers to electronic communications network  and service providers while “vendor” refers to suppliers of ICT products or outsourcing partners.  These guidelines have been divided in the seven security domains and split across the 25 security  objectives (SO) defined in ENISA’s Technical Guideline on Security Measures Version 2.0.4 For each  security objective we describe one or several risks, and mapped to the risks we propose a set of  security requirements aimed at vendors.  2.1 Governance and risk management  SO1: Information security policy/ SO2: Governance and risk management  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to align its security practises to the provider’s security objectives.  Security requirements   The provider’s security objectives should be fully understood and integrated by the vendor.   The vendor selected should have an information security policy ensuring the security and  resilience of its products and services, and aligned with the provider’s high level security  objectives.   The vendor should provide evidence of its relevant internal information security policy  ensuring the security and resilience of its products and services for provider’s analysis.  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to meet the provider’s security objectives due to a lack of communication and  misunderstanding between the two parties regarding actions to be taken by the vendor.  Security requirements   A contract should be signed by the vendor enforcing specific security requirements, defined  by the provider and aligned with its security objectives. Security requirements should be  clear, precise, actionable and measurable.   Security requirements are defined by the provider during the Risk Assessment.   The provider should be able to request updates on the security requirements in light of any  tests/exercises or incidents affecting the provider’s systems and/or the vendor’s similar  products or services in the electronic communications sector. Updated security  requirements would then be implemented undisputedly by the vendor.  4 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/article-13/guideline-for-minimum-security-measures  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 4  Security Risks  Provider’s failure to comply with national legal obligations imposed by law or secondary legislation  due to lack of support from the vendor.  Security requirements   The provider should be able to request the vendor to comply with legal obligations imposed  by law or secondary legislation on the provider without any increase of costs.  SO3: Security roles and responsibilities  Security Risks  Failure to clearly and/or correctly establish key roles and responsibilities regarding security risks  management between the provider and the vendor leading to:  - Confusion and misunderstanding between parties in case of a threat or incident;  - Incorrect implementation of security requirements;  - Lack of accountability in case of security breaches not recognised within the vendor’s  organization.  Security requirements   Clearly define and state responsibilities and roles within the contract to avoid confusion,  misunderstanding or abuses.   One person within the vendor’s organization should be accountable during the whole  contract lifecycle to ensure that:  - security risks and requirements are fully understood;  - appropriate processes are in place and a minimum acceptable level of residual risk is  agreed with the provider and duly accepted by each party;  - security risks are managed and appropriate processes are in place and communicated to  the provider;  - Appropriate support is provided to the provider through relevant helpdesk or other as  defined by the contract;  - Contractual clauses are respected.   Force Majeure which releases the vendor from its responsibility should be clearly defined  to avoid any abuses from the vendor.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 5  SO4: Security of third party assets  Security Risks  Provider’s exposure to additional security threats due to the vendor’s use of downstream  subcontractors to provide products or services to the provider. These threats include but are not  limited to:  - Lack of information regarding the downstream subcontractors;  - Lack of vendor’s competent supervision and effective control on its subcontractors;  Failure to enforce security requirements to the vendor’s subcontractors.  Security requirements   The vendor should provide information regarding existing and/or potential subcontractors  used to provide products and services to the provider. This information will be included in  the Risk Assessment performed by the provider and should be taken into account in the  definition of the security requirements.   The subcontractor must comply with the same or equivalent security measures as the ones  applied to the vendor.   The vendor should remain solely accountable for all the actions performed by its  subcontractors, responsible for managing security within its subcontractors and providing  assurance that security requirements operate efficiently to meet the provider’s security  objectives.  2.2 Human resources security  SO5: Background check  Security Risks  Unintentional or intentional alterations of products or systems performed by the vendor’s  employees including faulty changes or upgrades, configuration errors, bad maintenance, insider  attacks, etc.  Security requirements   Credentials of the vendor’s employees should be provided to demonstrate their relevant  experience in security risks management.   When legally permitted and justified by a level of criticality of service provided, the vendor  should do its due diligence to flag any criminal records in its employees’ background, to  avoid any sinister and intentional alterations of products or systems. Evidence of the due  diligence should be made available to the provider for consultation.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 6  SO6: Security knowledge and training  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to allocate sufficient skilled and trained resources to effectively and efficiently  manage security risks.  Security requirements   The vendor’s employees’ should receive appropriate training to implement and operate  security requirements applied by the provider.   The vendor should provide sufficient evidence regarding the training program of its  employees.   If requested by the provider, the vendor should have the required qualified personnel (e.g.  ISO certified).   A designated proportion of the vendor’s employees should follow regular training to stay  up-to-date in an evolved technological environment with changing security practises.   The vendor should provide sufficient evidence regarding the training program of its  employees.   The vendor should carry out its due diligence to ensure that its employees have sufficient  security and technical knowledge, skills and qualification, to avoid any unintentional  alterations of products or systems. Evidences of the due diligence should be available to  the provider for consultation.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 7  SO7: Personnel changes  Security Risks  Disrupted and inefficient management of security risks due to entry or change of personnel on the  vendor’s side with deviations from the contract specifications.  Security requirements   All personnel from the vendors or downstream subcontractors, who are given access to  confidential information or customer personal data related to the provider, should sign a  confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement with their employer. The vendor should also  have clauses regarding confidentiality and personal data protection included in the contract  signed with the provider.   Any change of personnel, as defined and agreed in the contract, should be mentioned to  the provider.   Any replacements of personnel in the scope of the service should be agreed with the  provider.   A knowledge transfer process should be defined and executed by the vendor between the  employees that get substituted.   Access right to the provider’s information systems should be timely revoked by the vendor  for personnel who have been discharged.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 8  2.3 Security of systems and facilities  SO9: Physical and environmental security  Security Risks  Unintentional or intentional alteration of products or systems due to weak or a lack of physical  access measures provided by the vendor.  Natural phenomenon’s impacts (Overheating, storms, floods, etc.) on products or systems due to  weak or a lack of physical security measures provided by the vendor.  Security requirements   The vendor should have specific security processes in place ensuring the physical security  of its products or systems, and preventing any unauthorized access to its physical facilities  and infrastructure including but not limited to:  - Procedures for securing manufacturing sites;  - Procedures for securing storage sites;  - Procedures for securing operational sites;  - Procedures for securing the packaging and the transport of equipment.   Evidence of the physical security processes should be shared with the provider for analysis.   Processes should be followed routinely by the vendor.   The effectiveness of the processes should be periodically assessed by the vendor and  revised when required, especially following any incidents and tests/exercises affecting the  provider’s systems and/or the vendor’s similar products or services in the electronic  communications sector.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 9  SO11: Access control to network and information systems  Security Risks  Unintentional or Intentional alteration of products or systems due to weak or a lack of logical  access measures provided by the vendor.  Security requirements   The vendor should have specific logical access controls in place ensuring the security of its  products or systems and preventing any unauthorized access to its networks and  information systems: including but not limited to:  - User identification and authentication;  - Unique ID;  - Segregation of duties;  - Privilege based access groups.   Evidence of logical access controls should be shared with the provider for analysis.   The effectiveness of the processes should be periodically assessed by the vendor and  revised when required, especially following tests/exercises or any incidents affecting the  provider’s systems and/or the vendor’s similar products or services in the electronic  communications sector.   Access to sensitive networks and information systems should be restricted to the vendor’s  employees who have a specific business need.   Access list with the vendor’s individuals authorized to access networks and information  systems with their rights and privileges should be regularly reviewed by the vendor.   A review of activity log should be performed by the vendor in order to flag any anomalous  behaviour. This review should be performed by a third party (e.g. independent quality  reviewer within the vendor organization).   Systems detecting and recording any attempted damage, amendment or unauthorized  access should be implemented by the vendor.   Note that these last 2 measures are relatively costly and severe to implement for a vendor.  It could be requested only in case highly critical provider's information systems are  involved.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 10  SO12: Integrity of network and information systems  Security Risks  Insertion of malicious content such as viruses, code or malware leading to an alteration of the  integrity and/or the functionality of a product or a system.  Security requirements   The vendor should validate the product’s or system’s integrity by performing appropriate  scanning and testing before its integration into the provider’s infrastructure.   Testing/Scanning procedures and results should be shared with the provider for analysis.   In case of counterfeit items, the vendor should take the appropriate measures to replace  it, ensuring the continuity of service for the provider with the same level of security.  2.4 Operations management  SO13: Operational procedures  Security Risks  Vendor’s failure to run its daily operations according to the provider’s security requirements.  Security requirements   As part of the contract, the vendor should agree with the provider on a Service Level  Agreement (SLA) that specifies, in measurable terms, what services the vendor shall  provide. This includes:  - The minimum level of service that the provider will accept.  - The minimum level of residual risk (once controls have been implemented) that the  provider will accept. This minimum acceptable level of residual risk should be agreed  with the provider’s senior management.  - Security oriented Key Performance Indicators (KPI) under which the provider will assess  the vendor’s performance. KPIs should be precise and measurable.   The vendor’s performance will be regularly assessed and the provider will refer back to the  SLA.   The vendor should provide any supportive data, record or report which will facilitate the  assessment of its performance by the provider. In addition, the vendor should share the  knowledge necessary for the provider to fully understand the data, record or report.   The vendor should be exposed to penalties in case of insufficiencies or divergences with the  SLA. For highly critical systems, higher penalties should be agreed.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 11  SO14: Change management  Security Risks  Failed changes (e.g. update failure) leading to partial or complete disruption of services for the  providers due to lack or inefficient change management processes.  Inefficient security requirements due to weak or lack of change management processes in an  evolving environment with constant technological changes.  Security requirements   The vendor should maintain processes for change management. A different process can be  implemented based on the type of change required:  - Newly discovered vulnerability leading to adoption of additional security measures;  - Software update;  - Hardware replacement.   The change management process should include accurate and efficient testing (see SO 23).  More precisely, the vendor should test any software or hardware changes before its  integration into the life environment. Evidences should be provided to the provider.   The responsibilities for the change initiation and the additional cost payment should be  established in advance and stated in the contract.   The vendor should take responsibilities for changes related to:  - Any vendor initiated changes;  - Other changes agreed in the contract (e.g. update).  - Variations in the service levels caused by the vendor;  - Newly discovered vulnerabilities in vendor’s product or system;   Vendor’s corrective actions following a security incident.

Security requirements   A contingency plan should be in place in case either party wishes to terminate the  relationship even before the end of the agreement.   The vendor should define and agree with the provider on a transition plan ensuring the  management of security until the handover to the provider or to another vendor is  completed.   The vendor should transfer all documents, procedures, configuration, records, etc. related  to the product or service which are necessary to guarantee a smooth continuation of the  service for the provider.   The vendor should return or destroy all files, records, documents containing provider’s  information.   In case the retention of some information is agreed with the provider, specific security  measures need to be agreed and implemented by the vendor to ensure the confidentiality  and the protection of the provider’s data.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 13  SO15: Asset management  Security Risks  Lack of timely replacement plan and efficient logistic function in case some components, products  or systems break sooner or become obsolete making the replacement* or update** of an element  impossible, and leading to a disruption of service for the provider.  *Vendors may discontinue the production of some of their products as technology advances very fast.  Components, products or systems can be unavailable for a provider. A replacement will not be possible.  ** As technology advances very fast, an update can be incompatible with an obsolete system or  infrastructure. An update will not be possible.  Security requirements   The vendor should maintain processes for change management (e.g. software update,  hardware replacement, etc.) (see SO14).   The vendor should consider the time frame within which its products or systems are  expected to become obsolete.   The vendor should perform regular checks on its products and systems to detect any early  signs of obsolescence.   A replacement or updating plan should be developed and implemented by the vendor  taking into account the availability of compatible products, spare parts and compatible  updates with the existing infrastructure to ensure the continuity of services for the provider.   The vendor should provide the evidence that it has an efficient logistic function managing  the inventory of its components, products and systems and ensuring the availability of them  or conformed substitutes in a reasonable time.   The vendor should warrant the replacement or updates of any critical components,  products or systems in the timeframe agreed with the provider in the contract in order to  avoid any breach of services for the provider (Refer to SO19).   The vendor should notify the provider when a product’s update is available.   Support should be provided by the vendor in case of replacement or update.   The minimum time for which the product will be supported by the vendor should be agreed  by both parties as part of the contract.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 14  2.5 Incident management  SO16: Incident management procedures  Security Risks  Extended impact of a disruption of service due to an inefficient management of incidents.  Security requirements   The vendor should have an emergency procedure in place to deal with incidents and/or  provide support to the provider to manage incidents. The procedure will include scenarios  per type of incidents, parties’ roles and responsibilities, escalation process, etc.   The vendor should have a service continuity plan (see SO19) and a disaster recovery plan  (see SO20) in place to minimize the impact of an incident on the provider’s service  availability.   The vendor should comply with the mean time to repair and mean time to recover defined  in the SLA and agreed with the provider.   Each incident management case should be evaluated by the vendor and a report should be  available for the provider (see SO18).   If required for improvement of the incident management procedure, some enhancement  actions (e.g. better workflows, new ways of contact, etc.) could be agreed with the provider  and implemented by the vendor (see SO18).  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 15  SO18: Incident reporting and communications  Security Risks  Failure to send timely early warning to inform the provider about any anomaly, suspected incident  or suspected near miss leading to a bad incident management and disruption of service.  Lack of information regarding past incidents, suspected incidents, near-misses, suspected near  misses or anomalies occurring within the provider’s infrastructure.  Security requirements   Processes should be implemented by the vendor to accurately and timely report to the  provider any security incidents and security breaches occurring with its products or services,  or any data breaches related to the provider, as well as any violations of security  requirements stated in the contract or required by law.  - The vendor should immediately raise an early warning in case of anomalies, suspected  incidents or suspected near missed;  - The vendor should report any past incidents, suspected incidents, near-misses,  suspected near misses or anomalies occurring within the provider’s infrastructure.   Some thresholds could be set up with the agreement of the provider to report only specific  alarms based on their criticality.   The vendor should also report to the provider, any incidents which occurred with its  products or services across the electronic communications industry (i.e. impacting other  providers), when that same products and services are also contracted by the provider.   A clear escalation process should be established between the vendor and the provider to  ensure a well-defined and efficient communication flow. It should define escalation  channels and contacts (primary and backup contacts) between both parties.   The vendor should investigate, support provider in the investigation or request a third party  to investigate past incidents to find the root causes. This can be agreed in the contract or  on a case by case basis.   If required to avoid further incidents, corrective actions could be agreed with the provider  and implemented by the vendor.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 16  2.6 Business continuity management  SO19: Services continuity strategy and contingency plans  Security Risks  Weak or lack of service continuity strategy defined to guarantee the availability of service for the  provider in case of an incident.  Security requirements   The vendor shall ensure by tools, skills, resources or processes that services of the provider  remain operational at all times, complying with the minimum level of service defined in the  SLA and accepted by the provider. This can include, i.a.:  - Spare parts5  - Back up  - Back up personnel to ensure critical functions are always maintained   The vendor should provide complete documentation of business continuity processes.   More specifically, the outsourcing service vendor should have a service continuity plan with  a strong emphasis on potential failures of power supplies. This is very significant given that  a failure of the power supplies can lead to a complete interruption of service for the  provider.   The vendor’s business continuity plan should consider its dependencies of subcontractors   The vendor should review its service continuity plan based on past incidents and past  experience and revise it if necessary.  5 A duplicate part to replace a lost or damaged part of a machine.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 17  SO20: Disaster recovery capabilities  Security Risks  Weak or lack of service recovery capabilities to restore the service of the provider in case of  disaster, major outage or complete interruption of service.  Security requirements   The vendor shall ensure by tools, skills, resources or processes that services of the provider  can recover from a major incident within the minimum time for recovery defined in the SLA.  This can include, i.a.:  - Spare parts6  - Back up  - Back up personnel to ensure critical functions are always maintained   The vendor’s recovery plan should consider its dependencies of subcontractors   The vendor should review its service recovery plan based on past incidents and past  experience and revise it if necessary.   If requested by the provider, the vendor could take part to a drill with the provider to  prepare them in potential big disruptions (storms, huge disaster, individual disruptions of  critical network equipment, etc.).  2.7 Monitoring, auditing and testing  SO21: Monitoring and logging policies  Security Risks  Undetected abnormal performance, bugs or malicious actions due to inefficient traffic or  equipment performance monitoring.  Security requirements   A constant monitoring should be performed by the vendor to detect any abnormal activity  that may indicate issues related to availability or integrity of the provider’s network and  system.   Any anomalies should be investigated by the vendor.   Any anomalies should be immediately reported to the provider (refer to SO18).  6 A duplicate part to replace a lost or damaged part of a machine.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 18  SO23: Network and information systems testing  Security Risks  Inadequate, ineffective or insufficient testing leading to vulnerabilities, malfunctions or other  failures of vendor’s products and services.  Security requirements   Quality and security of the product should be assessed by the vendor against specifications  defined in the contract before its integration into the provider’s system.  Some acceptance  criteria can be set up by the provider and the product or equipment can be rejected if it  does not comply with the provider’s expectations clearly defined in the contract. The  process is valid for new components, patches and update.   The vendor should do its due diligence to ensure regular, accurate and efficient testing and  provide the assurance that products and services are operating as they should:  - Testing should be performed along product/service lifecycle: from the development  stage, before and after its integration to the existing network and when any patches or  updates are performed;  - Testing should be made with the right configuration - in the testing environment,  simulating life environment configurations  (or substitute) when feasible ;  - Testing should be made by iterations to allow the vendor to apply fixes when required;  - Several types of testing should be performed including but not limited to known  vulnerabilities scans, penetration testing, source code analysis, etc.   Testing can be performed by the vendor, the provider, a third party and/or by a  collaborative lab (with provider’s and vendor’s testers). Parties accountable for the testing  need to be agreed and stated in the contract.   Testing frequency needs to be agreed and stated in the contract.   Testing plans and methodologies should be regularly reviewed based on, technology  changes, upgrades and past incidents.   The vendor should share a comprehensive testing report which shall include testing  procedures, identified vulnerabilities, any mitigating actions required and a clear escalation  process in case of further issues.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 19  SO24: Security assessments  Security Risks  Insufficient information about products’ or systems’ potential vulnerabilities before selecting a  vendor or a supplier of outsourcing services.  Weak preventive actions implemented to face the same.  Security requirements   Before entering into a relationship, the vendor should provide its client with documentation  on known products’ and systems’ potential vulnerabilities together with their criticality and  likelihood of being exposed.   A process should be implemented by the vendor to promptly notify the provider about any  newly discovered and exploitable vulnerability (refer to SO18).   The vendor should take into account the evolving threats landscape and should periodically  review the industry security alerts/standards to assess any new potential vulnerability.  Security Guide for ICT Procurement  ICT Procurement Security Guide for Electronic Communications Service Providers  December 2014  Page 20  SO25: Compliance monitoring  Security Risks  Failure to gain assurance regarding the vendor’s compliance with the security requirements and  failure to ensure that security risks are correctly managed by the vendor.  For example:  - Controls not in place;  - Controls in place not aligned with the provider’s security objectives;  - Deviation in controls.  Security requirements   Regular meetings should be organized between the vendor and the provider to assess the  performance of the vendor regarding the application of the security requirements.   The assurance should be provided by the vendor that the security risks are managed and  the requirements are implemented and operate as agreed with the provider in the contract.  Parties should agree on the scope, the methodology and the frequency of the assurance  report. The assurance can be gained using several methods:  - The vendor can report the security status, risks, vulnerabilities and incidents, as part of  a service reporting.  - The vendor can request regular independent reviews of its service or production  processes and facilities, and reports to the provider the results and any corrective  action identified. Note that this measure is costly for the vendor so it is generally  applied on a case by case basis.  - The provider can have a right of audit or a right of review of its vendor’s service or  production processes including equipment, software, information, record, data or  person relating to it. This can also be performed by a third party if needed. Note that  this measure is costly for the provider so it is generally applied on a case by case basis.   Assurance can be gained through certification (e.g. ISO 27001).

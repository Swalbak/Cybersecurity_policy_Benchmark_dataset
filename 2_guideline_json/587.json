It introduces these mechanisms according to the CERT maturity levels that they address based  on eight predefined criteria including requirements that CERTs must meet; CERTs’ focus: type or  region; and definitions and terminology used.  A three-tier CERT maturity model was specifically developed for the purpose of this project, with  the tiers being three respective stages of a CERT development: fundamental, baseline and advanced.  At each stage of this progression, mechanisms from CERT community organisations provide guidance  and support to CERTs with regard to the defined categories.  For all three tiers the document highlights important commonalities and differences among the  mechanisms. This enables the identification of potential areas for harmonisation of the CERT  mechanisms, though this document does not aspire to determine how, when or by whom the  harmonisation efforts should be carried out.  As partly confirmed by direct consultations with them while preparing this paper, CERTs are in need  of harmonisation for the following reasons:   Requirements and validation process: CERTs need to meet and adhere to different  requirements, which is resource- and time-intensive. This would be much more effective and  easier based on harmonisation across the CERT community.   Definitions and terminology: Many terms and definitions used by CERT organisations are  already similar. Harmonising core terms such as CERT (CSIRT), constituency, or incident  would make these mechanisms significantly more compatible and make it easier for CERTs  to subscribe to, or utilise, various mechanisms.   CERT types (sectors): It could be beneficial for different mechanisms to harmonise their  definitions of sectors that vertical-specific CERTs typically focus on, and to specify clearly  various constituency types, as doing so would offer more clarity and transparency  surrounding CERT activities.   Training: Harmonisation could lead to synergies, proliferation of training opportunities for  CERTs, and more opportunities for CERTs to meet and share good practices. Good progress  has already taken place in this respect with several CERT organisations including ENISA and  FIRST supporting TERENA’s TRANSITS training for CERTs, and ENISA producing material that  actively is rolled out to CERTs on request.

Term “scheme” is used as a synonym to the term  “mechanism” in this regard.  There exist several mechanisms that support CERTs and their common processes. They can describe  how to set up the CERT and its daily life; the services teams provide; or the way they cooperate.  These CERT mechanisms vary depending on the maturity level of the CERTs concerned.  In this document we first provide an overview of the organisations behind these mechanisms and  the sort of criteria used to describe the maturity level of a CERT (section 2). Then we present a three- tier model of CERTs’ maturity specifically developed for this project (section 3), with the respective  tiers Fundamental, Baseline and Advanced. The individual CERT mechanisms of various CERT  organisations are attached to these respective tiers. In section 4 we identify the commonalities and  differences among the mechanisms within the three maturity tiers. In section 5 we provide some  recommendations for areas considered suitable for harmonisation efforts.  It should be stressed here that the document does not aim to provide any kind of rating of the  mechanisms, but rather to show what is currently in use by CERTs and which areas of these  mechanisms could be improved (harmonised).  1.2 Methodology  Extensive desk research was conducted to prepare this document, using mostly publicly available  sources linked to CERT mechanisms, CERT organisations and CERT communities. The sources are  always referenced in the text. A concise survey was also launched to gather stakeholders’ views on  the need for harmonisation of CERT schemes. Sixteen teams, mostly national/ governmental CERTs,  provided replies to the survey. The survey focused on the capabilities schemes followed by CERTs,  the need to harmonise these them and identify new areas for harmonisation.  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  2  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  Page 2  2 How do you assess a CERT's maturity?  A number of organisations,3 both in Europe and internationally, provide different mechanisms for  supporting and advancing CERT capabilities and therefore their maturity. These CERT community  organisations provide useful insights into the operations of CERTs and their cooperative efforts, as  well as the policies, procedures and tools used by different teams. As CERTs continue to develop  their capabilities and become more accepted by their constituents, they also cooperate more often  with other CERTs both in their home countries and internationally and look to gain recognition from  more partners. The maturation of CERTs and their use of different CERT mechanisms mean that  there is a greater need to explore whether harmonisation between them may be beneficial, and  which areas could potentially be harmonised.  This section of the report provides an overview of a number of mechanisms used frequently by  CERTs, which deal with and consider CERT capabilities. The mechanisms that have been introduced  vary in their objectives and means of achieving these objectives, and are thus used in different ways  by CERTs.  2.1 Which organisations support CERTs and promote their maturity?  CERTs can look to a number of organisations for suitable mechanisms and good practices. These  mechanisms range from being global in scope (e.g. FIRST) to regional (e.g. APCERT) or to more  service-specific oriented (e.g. ISO 27035). As discussed later in this report, these organisations  provide mechanisms and good practices for CERTs at various points in the CERT maturation process.  ENISA surveyed the European CERT community and asked them which mechanisms they follow.  Many of the respondents report following several different CERT capabilities mechanisms, with  Trusted Introducer (TI) and FIRST being named most often.  3  As used in this document, the term ‘organisation’ or ‘CERT-type organisation’‚ means any type of organisation,  association, gathering or institution whose aim is to provide a platform of cooperation among CERTs and/or provide  standards, guidance or good practices for their activities.  Page 3  Number of answers =16 (respondents had the option to choose more than one scheme)  Source: Survey conducted by ENISA to provide input into this document  2.1.1 ENISA  ENISA was established in 2004 to improve network and information security in the European Union  (EU). It was intended to be the EU's response to the emergence of cyber-security as a significant  issue impacting EU Member States and businesses. ENISA serves both EU institutions and Member  States, including public and private organisations.  In June 2013, the EU granted ENISA a further seven-year mandate with an expanded set of duties.4  In addition to enshrining ENISA's achievements in areas such as helping EU Member States set up  CERTs and provide cyber-security exercises, the new mandate:   Provides ENISA with instruments to support the fight against cybercrime based on  prevention and detection in cooperation with Europol's European Cybercrime Center;   Gives ENISA responsibility for supporting the development of EU cyber-security policy and  legislation;   Looks to ENISA to support research, development, and standardisation;   Charges ENISA with supporting the prevention, detection of, and response to cross-border  cyber-threats; and   Aligns ENISA more closely with the EU regulatory process for providing EU countries and  institutions with assistance and advice on cyber-security issues.  ENISA describes its role with regard to CERTs in Europe as a facilitator and information knowledge  broker rather than having an operational role. As the EU ‘expert body’ on CERTs, ENISA must remain  updated about key issues impacting CERTs, and establish and maintain contacts with important  global players in the CERT field, including those profiled in this report. ENISA also distributes good  4  Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013, available at http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new- regulation-for-eu-cybersecurity-agency-enisa-with-new-duties  10  8  5  2 2 2  1  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  FIRST TI (Accredited)  RFC 2350 ENISA (Baseline  Capabilities)  TI (Certified) TI (Listed) ISO 27035  Which CERT mechanism do you follow?

One of ENISA's priorities is to help EU Member States establish national/ governmental (n/g) CERTs  and support these teams’ efforts to reach a baseline level of capabilities as they mature. In addition  to the baseline mechanism, ENISA further supports CERTs’ efforts to enhance their capabilities by  providing, for example, tailored training.  ENISA originally published baseline capabilities documents for CERTs in 2009. The technical aspects  of these reports were extended by policy recommendations to n/g CERTs in 20105 as to the four  baseline capabilities that they should have. The latest update of the baseline capabilities  recommendations was completed in 2012.6  ENISA also regularly publishes a CERT Inventory map and an Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe  document. Both are updated twice a year and largely correspond to the Trusted Introducer database  of listed teams.7  In 2013 ENISA introduced its training courses for CERTs in the EU Member States. This is a new  initiative to promote and support CERT maturity in the MS by having exercises and technical hands- on training on different services, operations and cooperation in daily work of the teams.8  2.1.2 TF-CSIRT Trusted Introducer  TF-CSIRT Trusted Introducer (TF-CSIRT/TI)9 is the new name for the integrated TF-CSIRT and Trusted  Introducer operations under the Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association  (TERENA10) structure. It is an example of a CERT membership organisation that focuses on a  particular region. The Task Force for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (TF-CSIRT) was  established in 2000 and has evolved into a much-used forum by various CERTs for discussion of  experiences and knowledge. The Trusted Introducer (TI) service was spun off from TF-CSIRT in 2001  and has become a widely known accreditation and listing service in the CERT community.11  TF-CSIRT was historically open to any interested CERT in Europe, but more recently has adopted the  membership structure used by TI as part of formal incorporation of TI with TF-CSIRT. TF-CSIRT  describes itself as ‘a task force that promotes collaboration and coordination between CSIRTs in  Europe and neighbouring regions, whilst liaising with relevant organisations at the global level in  other regions’.12  TI describes itself as ‘the trusted backbone of the Security and Incident Response team community in  Europe’, and serves as the ‘listing, accreditation and certification service’ of TF-CSIRT. Trusted  Introducer provides two main services: (1) it keeps a list of all known European CERTs and (2) offers  accreditation and certification services to CERTs. The idea behind TI's accreditation services – as well  as its listing and certification services – is that these services help build up trust in the CERT  community in Europe. Essentially, TI's stamp of approval allows other parties to assume with  5  ENISA, Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs (2009, 2010)  6  ENISA, Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report (2012); ENISA,  Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Updated Recommendations (2012)  7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv/files/inventory-of-cert-activities-in-europe  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  9  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  10  http://www.terena.org/  11  TERENA, Proposal for Restructuring TF-CSIRT and the Trust Introducer Service (December 2011)  12  See TERENA website at www.terena.org  Page 5  confidence that a CERT has reached a certain level of maturity and functionality, which is important  to building trust throughout the CERT community.13  TF-CSIRT/TI offers three different mechanisms to European CERT: registration (listing), accreditation,  and certification. Registration with TF-CSIRT/TI is a relatively simple process, while accreditation is  more complex and certification even more so. Certification requires that a CERT meet a number of  requirements laid out in the Security Incident Management Maturity Model published by TI.14  2.1.3 FIRST  The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) was founded in 1990 as a worldwide  network of individual computer security incident response teams that cooperate voluntarily to  improve their abilities to deal with and prevent computer security problems. FIRST is a membership  organisation that is governed by an Operational Framework, and each member must designate a  primary and alternate representative to FIRST.  Participants in FIRST are part of a network of CERTs that work together voluntarily to deal with  computer security problems and their prevention.  FIRST distinguishes between two types of participants:   Full members represent organisations assisting defined constituencies in preventing and  handling computer security-related incidents.   Liaison members are individuals or representatives of organisations other than CERTs that  have a legitimate interest in and value to FIRST.15  2.1.4 The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open community of network designers, operators,  vendors and researchers focused on the evolution of Internet architecture. IETF is divided into  working groups based on topic area.16 IETF published the RFC-2350 document, which is a detailed  overview of the policies that it recommends a CERT pursues and the services that it is expected to  offer. Although published in 1998 and last updated in 2003, RFC-2350 still enjoys widespread use as  a reference document for CERT capabilities. RFC-2350 is an important document in the CERT  community because a large number of CERTs use it as a template for the self-assessment.17The TI  accredited and certified CERTs have adopted the RFC2350 as a basic requirement to fulfill.  2.1.5 CERT/CC  CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) is not a membership organisation in the same sense as FIRST or  TF-CSIRT/TI, but it is still an influential organisation in the CERT community. CERT/CC was created in  1988 in response to the Morris worm incident,18 and is hosted by Carnegie Mellon University within  the Software Engineering Institute. This organisation actually established the first CERT in the world.  13  See https://www.trusted-introducer.org/index.html  14  See https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/overview.html  15  See http://www.first.org/about  16  See http://www.ietf.org/about/  17  IETF, RFC-2350: Expectations for Computer Security Incident Response, available at  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2350.txt  18  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm  Page 6  Under its charter, CERT/CC works with the Internet community in detecting and resolving computer  security incidents by (1) providing a reliable, trusted, 24-hour, single point of contact for  emergencies; (2) facilitating communication among experts; (3) serving as a central point for  identifying and correcting computer system vulnerabilities; (4) maintaining close ties with research  activities; and (5) being proactive in raising awareness about computer security issues. It is also  involved in efforts to create standards in the CERT area, and has published open source tools for  activities that include vulnerability assessment, network traffic analysis, and facilitating digital  investigations.19  2.1.6 APCERT  The Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) is an example of a CERT  membership organisation that focuses on a particular region. According to APCERT, its purpose ‘is to  encourage and support coordination’ among CERT organisations in the Asia-Pacific region. By doing  this, it believes that it can ‘improve the region's awareness and competency’ with regard to  computer incident response.20  APCERT is open to all CERTs in the Asia-Pacific region that meet its qualification criteria. APCERT  members must also agree to support its objectives, respect information handling procedures, and, as  much as possible, provide assistance to other APCERT members.21  2.1.7 International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)  The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is a non-governmental organisation that is  made up of members from the national standards bodies of 163 countries. The ISO publishes  standards developed by panels of experts on technical committees.22 In 2011, ISO published a  consensus-based standards document with its own guidelines for security incident management for  large and medium-sized organisations. This publication, which is known as ISO 27035, purports to  provide ‘a structured and planned approach’ to issues such as (1) detecting, reporting, and assessing  information security incidents; (2) responding to and managing information security incidents; (3)  detecting, assessing, and managing information security vulnerabilities; and (4) continuously  improving information security and incident management as a result of managing information  security incidents and vulnerabilities. ISO 27035 also provides guidance for external organisations  providing information security incident management services.23  2.1.8 Other organisations  There are other organisations than the ones already discussed that have potentially suitable  mechanisms. For example, many corporations have internal CERT capabilities that allow them to  respond to incidents involving their products or services. These corporate-based mechanisms will  often target the corporation's employees, business partners and internal lines of business.24  A different example is the European Government CERT Group (EGC Group),25 an informal association  of more mature governmental CERTs in Europe. EGC Group members cooperate effectively on  matters of incident response while building upon mutual trust and understanding due to similarities  19  http://www.cert.org/meet_cert/  20  http://www.apcert.org/about/mission/index.html  21  See Instructions for joining AP-CERT, available at http://www.apcert.org/application/index.html  22  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm  23  See http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44379  24  See for example http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/emergency.x?i=56  25  http://www.egc-group.org/index.html  Page 7  in constituencies and problem sets. EGC Group has a technical focus. EGC teams are usually  members of FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI.  2.2  Maturity assessment criteria  The CERT community organisations discussed above provide a number of different mechanisms for  CERTs to use or to be part of. This section introduces the most important categories and topics that  pertain to these mechanisms and provides the foundation for identifying commonalities and  differences between them.  2.2.1 Type of approach (organisation model)  The approach adopted by a CERT community organisation is fundamental to its mechanism(s) and to  how it interacts with CERTs. An organisation's approach is an important determinant of the  relationships that it establishes with CERTs and the services that it provides. Organisations surveyed  for this report employ several different approaches to how they interact with CERTs:  Type of  organisation  Characteristics of the mechanism  Voluntary (good  practice and  recommendations)  The organisation is set up in a way that allows CERTs to participate in its  processes and events, but it does not have a formal membership process.  The organisation's focus is on providing good practices and  recommendations, rather than providing confirmation of a CERT's capabilities  or other services.  Subscribe  (Membership and  accreditation)  The organisation admits members through a formalised process. Its agenda  and activities are driven by its status as a membership organisation.  Membership in itself provides value through the receipt of member-only  services, as well as through processes such as accreditation.  Compulsory  (Standards)  The organisation has formal authority to require compliance with its  mechanism(s) and often exists for the purpose of disseminating standards.  Thus far, this approach has not been the norm for CERT community  organisations, but the approach may be used more often as efforts are made  to harmonise approaches and ensure that good practices are followed and  the same level of capabilities is achieved.  The approach that these organisations employ provides information about matters such as:   How an organisation interacts with CERTs, both members and non-members   What member or associated CERTs can expect from an organisation   What role an organisation envisions itself playing in the broader CERT community   How an organisation sees itself growing and evolving over time   Where an organisation can obtain operational and substantive input   How an organisation secures funding.  2.2.2 Requirements for CERTs  A given organisation’s mechanism may impose requirements on CERTs seeking to utilise the  mechanism or to associate with the organisation. Such requirements tend to reflect whether and to  what extent the organisation in question wants to limit its involvement and whether it wants its  Page 8  members to have similar capabilities and processes. Such organisations must also consider whether  or not stringent requirements would deter otherwise strong partner or member CERTs from seeking  involvement.  An organisation must also decide which specific requirements it will impose on CERTs in its  mechanisms. Various approaches are open to an organisation in terms of implementing such  requirements:   Creating its own unique list of requirements that it expects a partner or member to meet   Using an existing good practices guide for CERTs and requiring that a partner or member  meet either all of these practices or a certain percentage of them   Leaving the decision about cooperation with or involvement for a CERT to its existing  members, and allowing them to decide by vote on whether the CERT meets its standards. It  is up to the potential member (and possibly to its sponsors, which are already members of  the respective organisation) to demonstrate to other members that the applicant CERT  fulfils membership requirements.  2.2.3 Validation process  Organisations with membership requirements need a process by which to ensure these are met. For  example, once a CERT becomes a member, it becomes more challenging for the organisation to  backtrack and exert any control over the CERT.  An organisation can use different mechanisms to ensure that a CERT fulfils its requirements. There is  usually some sort of initial phase where a CERT provides the organisation with baseline information  about itself and its capabilities. This can then be checked against publicly available information  about the CERT, or potentially by asking existing CERT members of the organisation to evaluate  whether the applicant CERT meets the requirements.  The organisation has to decide whether it will put in place additional, more thorough means of  validating a CERT's capabilities. This could include requiring more proactive input from the applicant  CERT, including presenting its capabilities at a meeting of the organisation. Alternatively, on-site  visits to the CERT are another way to measure capabilities and resources, although this involves  more expense. There is also a distinction between processes where validation takes place at one  point in time (e.g. FIRST) or whether it is a continuing process (e.g. TI accredited/certified).  2.2.4 CERTs’ focus: type and region  The organisation also determines which types of parties it wants as members or users of its services.  There are advantages in having members with similar patterns or goals, both of which can be  influenced by factors such as geography or type of the constituency.  When it comes to the type of the CERT, there are a number of identified sectors that an organisation  could focus on. For a non-comprehensive list see the table below.  Page 9  CERT Types: Sector26  National / Governmental  Governmental  National  De facto national  Research and education  Governmental / Military  Service provider/ISP customer base  Non-commercial organisation  ICT vendor customer base  Commercial organisation  Financial sector  Energy sector  Industrial sector  Other...  This can either be done at an abstract level – e.g., academic or commercial CERTs – or through a  more concrete association with a corporation. This type of organisational limitation means that  CERTs seeking membership or association will tend to share common business models, concerns  about cyber-security, use of same technologies, and can be expected to have and use good practices  that apply across the specific constituency base. In terms of geography, CERT organisations can  either be open or be limited to specific geographic areas.  Limitations based on geography most often are set at a regional or country level, but could also be  set for a specific region or even a city within a country. Covering a specific geographic area enables a  CERT organisation to have member CERTs and constituents who share similar constituencies, have  the same legal code or agreed legal framework (e.g., EU Directives) or face common cultural and  linguistic challenges, and similar patterns of interactions with their governments. It may also  facilitate very important face-to-face meetings.  26  Updated ENISA list of CERTs available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv/certs- by-country-interactive-map  Page 10  2.2.5 Benefits and added value of a mechanism  A mechanism has to offer value to its CERT members or the CERTs that utilise it. This value can take a  number of forms:  Benefit/Value What it means  Affirmation Value comes from organisation's/ mechanism’s ability to provide trusted,  independent, third-party confirmation of a CERT's capabilities.  Contractual  Requirements  Value comes from organisation's/ mechanism’s ability to provide  certification of a CERT's capabilities that it needs for contractual or  regulatory reasons.  Recognition Value comes from the desire by the CERT to be recognised for the status it  has achieved and the fact that the mechanism can provide this recognition  widely.  Good practices Value comes from good practices that these organisations/ mechanisms  can provide based on their strong platforms, visibility and recognition.  Services Value comes from specific services that the organisation provides.  Networking Value comes from the opportunity these organisations can offer their  members to network with other CERTs and players.  Growth opportunities  (Maturity)  Value comes from these organisations offering CERTs the chance to grow  their teams through training and other exercises, or by helping them  establish clear goals for developing their teams.  2.2.6 Definitions and terminology  The definitions and terminology that are used are important within the mechanisms. Precise  definitions are often needed to make clear issues that are at the heart of CERTs' missions. These  definitions lay the foundation for the capabilities that CERTs will provide and how they will  otherwise conduct their business.  It is also important that organisations provide an overview of the types of specific definitions and  terminology that CERTs are expected to follow. These need not always be defined as tightly as some  other foundational terms, but they will often be at the heart of what a CERT does, and thus it is  important that expectations be stated clearly for it in this regard (e.g. n/g CERT definitions and  terminology put forward by ENISA or TF-CSIRT/TI).  2.2.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  An organisation's mechanism needs to be updated once it is put in place, which in turn requires that  a number of decisions are taken. One such decision is whether updates will be considered on a  regular basis at a defined time, or on an ad-hoc basis. This will influence how an organisation  considers changes and the likelihood of such changes being adopted.  Another question is how mechanisms will be updated. This relates to topics such as how potential  changes will be brought up for consideration, which bodies or individuals will consider and make  decisions about changes, what the standards for adopting updates or changes are, and how  Page 11  information about updates or changes will be disseminated to members or other CERTs associated  with the organisation.  An organisation also has to decide how much input CERT teams will have in developing and updating  their capability mechanism. The advantage of giving CERTs input is that the capability mechanism is  then more likely to reflect the issues CERTs see as important, and will also increase the odds that  they will accept and follow the mechanism. On the other hand, opening up an organisation's  mechanism broadly to input from CERTs risks moving the organisation away from its core focus and  could lead to disagreement between members.  2.2.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  CERT community organisations promote and advertise their capability mechanisms to different  extents. For some of them, promoting their mechanism is fundamental to their existence (e.g.  FIRST): their capability has to resonate within the CERT community, or there is really no reason for a  CERT to try to become a member of an organisation or associate with it. On the other hand, creators  of other mechanisms discussed in this report are less concerned with promoting their mechanism,  and may be satisfied with just creating a mechanism and then letting CERTs decide whether they  want to use it or adopt it (e.g. ISO model, RFC2350). CERTs and other stakeholders can also be  important disseminators of information about a particular capabilities mechanism, although their  willingness to engage in promotion will probably depend on their connections to the mechanism and  the extent to which they use the mechanism.  Organisations can follow two primary approaches in promoting themselves and their mechanisms.  First, they can do it themselves. This requires that they devote the necessary resources and establish  the right connections in the media to distribute information about their capabilities. Second,  organisations can rely on their CERT members, stakeholders, and other bodies in the area of cyber- security to promote their mechanism. This can be more effective than self-promotion and costs less,  but it is also riskier. This requires that an organisation have the right lines of communication open  with key stakeholders and other parties and make the effort to track its publicity from these types of  third parties.  Training programmes and exercises are also a core element of what some organisations do, and  training is an area where clear demand exists from CERTs and other players in the CERT arena. Both  CERTs and their constituents will rely on training offered by organisations as well as conferences and  other educational programmes that CERT organisations offer.  Organisations thus have to make decisions about the types of training they will offer, who they will  offer this training to, and the extent to which their membership bases or constituencies will drive  the content of the training that they offer. Given often limited resources, this may present a  challenge to some organisations and CERT teams, but the importance of these member and  constituent services mean that they cannot be overlooked.  Page 12  3 CERT Maturity Model  A CERT's development occurs broadly as a three-stage progression in which it moves from being  established to achieving a complete set of capabilities and stability within its community. At each  stage of this progression, mechanisms from CERT community organisations can provide guidance  and support to CERTs with regard to the assessment categories discussed in section 2.2 of this  document.  For the purpose of this document we applied a three-tier maturity model, which is based on the  ongoing work of the FIRST Education Committee.27 Individual mechanisms of CERT organisations are  attached to the three tiers with basic pre-defined characteristics. The mechanisms of the three Tiers  are then further explored in section 4 using a set of eight criteria.  CERT MATURITY MODEL  Summary Characteristics Organisation / Mechanisms  Tier 1 Fundamental  (Essential,  indispensable)  CERT is being established  and trying to earn  recognition in the CERT  community (based on  individual trust building).

These  capabilities are all  documented.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  Page 14  4 CERT mechanisms under the spotlight  This section provides a more detailed overview of the mechanisms that organisations offer to CERTs  in each of the three tiers (as described above in the CERT Maturity Model). This overview in the form  of tables should not be considered as a ranking of mechanisms as they are very different in nature.  For example, some of them are membership-based, while others take the form of guidelines and/or  recommendations for interested CERTs to follow. ENISA has identified the following eight categories  for the analysis of the individual mechanisms.  Assessment Categories  (1) Type of approach (organisation)  (2) Requirements for CERTs  (3) Validation process  (4) CERTs’ focus: type and region  (5) Benefits and added value of the mechanism  (6) Definitions and terminology  (7) Keeping the mechanism up to date  (8) Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  4.1 Tier 1 of the CERT Maturity Model  CERTs that are currently in Tier 1 are in the process of being established and gaining initial  recognition in the CERT community. CERT community organisations’ mechanisms can thus provide  Tier 1 CERTs with valuable guidance in terms of getting set up, establishing fundamental operations,  and helping to earn initial recognition within the CERT community.  The following mechanisms identified for Tier 1 were considered also for the analysis of  commonalities and differences of CERT mechanisms:   ENISA: A Step-by-Step Approach on How to Set up a CSIRT (2006)   ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs – operational aspects (2009)   ENISA: Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe – CERT Inventory Map (2005)   RARE CERT Task Force: Guide to Setting up a CERT (1993)   TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ status  4.1.1 Type of approach (organisation)  The five mechanisms identified for Tier 1 rely on fundamentally different organisational approaches.  Most importantly, ENISA do not use membership approaches at this level, while TF-CSIRT/TI is a  membership-based organisation. In addition, ENISA seeks to provide capabilities mechanisms to  CERTs even without a formal membership structure. That said, ENISA was established by the  European Union (EU) to improve network and information security in the EU, and takes a proactive  stance in serving as a facilitator and information broker for CERTs in EU Member States. Meanwhile,  TF-CSIRT/TI's mechanism is membership-based even at the Tier 1 level, although the criteria that a  Page 15  CERT must meet to obtain the ‘Listed’ status with TF-CSIRT/TI are less exacting at the earliest stage  than they become as the CERT’s maturity level increases.29 All of these mechanisms are provided on  a non-profit and voluntary basis.  Tier 1 Mechanism Type of approach (organisation) Voluntary/ subscribe /  compulsory form  ENISA: A Step-by- Step Approach on  How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This is universal step-by step-guidance on  how to set up a CSIRT. The target groups are  governmental as well as other institutions  that decide to set up a CERT to protect their  own infrastructure or that of their  stakeholders.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  ENISA: Baseline  Capabilities for  National/  Governmental  CERTs – operational  aspects (2009)  This mechanism was defined in 2009 for  newly established n/g CERTs to help them  understand and focus on a basic set of  capabilities so as to facilitate efficient and  effective incident response and  collaboration.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  ENISA: Inventory of  CERT Activities in  Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism was developed by ENISA in  2005 and gives the newly established team  an opportunity to gain recognition among  teams in Europe and other stakeholders  ENISA with which closely cooperates.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  RARE CERT Task  Force: Guide to  Setting up a CERT  (1993)  This mechanism was created in 1993 by the  CERT Task Force to ‘offer guidance to  networking organisations who wish to set up  CERTs’ and thus takes a voluntary approach.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’  Status  TF-CSIRT/TI is a formal membership  organisation open to all recognised CERTs  situated in Europe, while CERTs seeking to  achieve ‘listed’ status with TF-CSIRT/TI must  meet baseline requirements.  Voluntary (after meeting pre- defined requirements/criteria  offers the ‘listed’ status)  4.1.2 Requirements for CERTs  Because ENISA is not a membership organisation, it generally does not place requirements on CERTs  seeking to utilise its mechanisms, although ENISA's Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe is based  closely on TI database updates. On the other hand, TF-CSIRT/TI offers three levels of membership  classes, with the first level – Listing – being most applicable to Tier 1 CERTs. TF-CSIRT/TI allows any  organisation that has implemented a security or incident response capability or which provides  incident management services to register with it for listing. TF-CSIRT/TI does not further define this  29  Information from ENISA, CERT/CC, and TI homepages or reports  Page 16  requirement, which suggests a relatively low bar for CERTs wanting to achieve listed status under its  mechanism.30  Tier 1 Mechanism Requirements for CERTs  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it. Even though ENISA’s focus is on CERTs in Europe, this  guidance has proved its usability far behind the European borders.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism lists CERT teams in Europe, and tries to ‘give a  profile of the situation concerning CERT teams and their activities in  Europe.’ ENISA's inventory listing is largely based on TI  membership.  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism requires that an applicant for seeking ‘listed’ status  have implemented a security or incident response capability or  provide incident management services.  4.1.3 Validation process  ENISA does not have formal mechanisms for evaluating CERTs' capabilities. In 2012 ENISA carried out  follow-up assessments of whether n/g CERTs in Member States are following its baseline  recommendations, based on a survey of these organisations and desk research. TF-CSIRT/TI has a  validation process in place for its initial stage of membership: it requires that an applicant for listing  have the support of at least two existing members and notes that ‘if there is no support (for the  candidate) – or if there are even objections – the candidate will not be accepted’.31  Tier 1 Mechanism Validation process  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  There is no validation process associated with use of this  mechanism.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  There is no validation process associated with use of this  mechanism.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  This inventory of CERTs is updated based on discussions with CERT  teams and the latest CERT team updates on Trusted Introducer's  30  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/registration.html  31  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/registration.html  Page 17  constantly updated)  website, although other sources such as FIRST and TF-CSIRT are also  considered.  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  There is no validation process associated with the use of this  mechanism.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism requires an applicant for listing to have the support  of at least two existing members (accredited teams only) and notes  that if the candidate has no support or if any objections to the  candidate are raised, the candidate will not be accepted.  4.1.4 CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA's mandate makes clear that its focus is on CERTs in EU Member States, especially n/g CERTs,  and its revised mandate has provided it with an even broader purview in the area of cyber-security  in Europe. While ENISA works intensively with CERTs in EU Member States as they are set up or as  they extend their capabilities, it also publishes significant amounts of information about these topics  that could be useful for CERTs in similar positions anywhere. TF-CSIRT/TI describes itself as ‘the  trusted backbone of the security and incident response team community in Europe’, making clear  that its activities are also focused on Europe. This includes organisations and teams that work on a  global level or have a stake in Europe.  Tier 1 Mechanism CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  all types of CERTs/Europe  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  n/g CERTs in EU Member States  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  all types of CERTs/Europe  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  all types of CERTs  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status all types of CERTs/Europe  4.1.5 Benefits and added value of the mechanism  Organisations with useful mechanisms for Tier 1 CERTs offer varied benefits and value to CERTs.  ENISA's work in helping CERTs get off the ground is in line with its broader goal of ‘assisting EU  Member States in implementing relevant EU legislation and working to improve the resilience of  Europe's critical infrastructure and networks’.32 Thus, the value that CERTs take from ENISA is  32  ENISA, Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report (2012) at p. 3.  Page 18  through good practices and other advice on how to establish themselves and improve their  capabilities. It also enables EU Member States to gain assurance of compliance with relevant  communications of the EU Commission and recommendations of other EU institutions.  At this stage of a CERT's development, RARE CERT Task Force provides value to CERTs largely  through its good practices related to establishing a CERT, including topics such as defining a  constituency and developing a mission statement. TF-CSIRT/TI's value is slightly more diverse: it  offers baseline recognition of a CERT's capabilities, along with the promise of potentially greater  recognition as the CERT develops.  Tier 1 Mechanism Added value of the mechanism  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism provides value through good practices to its target  audience. It is very useful when building a CERT from scratch as it  lists all the steps necessary in the process of setting up a CERT.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism provides value through good practices to its target  audience. It enables the n/g CERTs in the EU to take part in  modification of this mechanism based on their experience and  needs. ENISA offers various platforms for the engagement of n/g  CERTs including CERT workshop and stocktaking reports. Additional  added value of the mechanism is that Member States establishing  n/g CERTs gain assurance of compliance with respective  communications and recommendations of the EU Commission and  other EU institutions.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism offers value to CERTs listed by validating their  position as publicly listed CERTs, and through the information it  offers about CERTs in Europe and international CERT initiatives (a  very comprehensive and publicly available list of all kinds of CERTs).  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism provides value through good practice to its target  audience.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism offers baseline recognition of a CERT's capabilities,  along with the promise of greater potential recognition as the CERT  develops, as well as a CERT starter kit through TF-CSIRT. The  information on the teams is accessible via web, while detailed  information including contacts and access to operational services  are reserved for the members.  4.1.6 Definitions and terminology  The organisations that actively support Tier 1 CERTs offer definitions of key CERT terms which differ  slightly. Their definitions are similar in key ways, such as that they all mention operational  capabilities like incident response service and assume that a CERT will provide these services to a  defined constituency. ENISA specifies that a CERT's ‘main business is to respond to computer  security incidents’.33 Meanwhile, RARE CERT Task Force defines a CSIRT/CERT as an organisation that  receives, reviews and responds to computer security incident reports and activity.  33  ENISA, A Step-by-Step Approach on How to Set up a CSIRT, at p. 7.  Page 19  These organisations also have similar core conceptualisations of what a CERT's constituency is: in  essence, that a CERT must have a defined ‘customer base’ that it serves. Beyond this similarity,  though, there are differences. ENISA takes a broad purview on this potential customer base, which is  in line with its focus on n/g CERTs, but focuses on choosing the right communication channels for  reaching constituents.34 TI's form for new registration candidates does not define constituency but  requires applicants to describe their constituency ‘based on a description of Internet Domains, IP  Address Information and/or other suitable characterization of the constituency’.35 Similarly, all  organisations give examples of CERT types, while ENISA’s Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe is the  most comprehensive in this respect.  Tier 1  Mechanism  Definitions and terminology  CERT/CSIRT  definition  Constituency definition CERT type categories and definitions  ENISA: A Step- by-Step  Approach on  How to Set Up  a CSIRT (2006)  CSIRT: ‘a team of  IT security  experts whose  main business is  to respond to  computer  security  incidents’  Constituency: ‘the  customer base of a  CSIRT’, definitions for  the constituencies of  various CERT categories  also included (see the  next column in this  table)  These sectors are listed (in alphabetical  order) with definitions included (pages  8–10):   Academic   Commercial   CIP/CIIP Sector   Governmental Sector   Internal   Military Sector   National   Small & Medium  Enterprises (SME)   Vendor  ENISA:  Baseline  Capabilities for  National /  Governmental  CERTs –  operational  aspects (2009)  CERT: ‘a team of  IT security  experts whose  main business is  to respond to  computer  security  incidents’36  Constituency: ‘an  established term for  the customer base (of a  CERT)’  The mechanism defines main CERT  categories of its focus:   national   de facto national   governmental   national/governmental  Besides, other CERT categories are  mentioned (academia, companies, or  military) with regard to various  constituencies without any further  definition.  ENISA:  Inventory of  CERT Activities  in Europe  CERT: ‘an  organisation that  studies computer  and network  A number of various  CERT constituencies are  listed without any  further definition. (see  N/g CERT teams: ‘all “flavours” of  national CERTs, governmental CERTs,  national points of contact and others in  the EU Member States.’  34  ENISA, A Step-by-Step Approach on How to Set up a CSIRT, at p. 7.  35  See Application form for Listed candidates, available at https://www.trusted-introducer.org/list_v23.txt  36  The term CSIRT is a more modern synonym and should reflect the fact that CERTs developed over time from  being mere reaction forces to become more universal providers of security services.

(see section 2.2.4)  RARE CERT  Task Force:  Guide to  Setting up a  CERT (1993)  CSIRT:  ‘a central  capability for  analysing events,  co-ordinating  technical  solutions,  ensuring that  necessary  information is  conveyed to  those who need  such information,  and training  others to deal  with computer  security  incidents’  Constituency:  ‘refers to the concept  of a CERT whose  constituency is a  network of affiliated  computing sites with a  valid computer security  policy’  Not specific about CERT categories but  a lot of attention is paid to vendor  CERTs (which is understandable due to  the age of this mechanism)  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Listed’ Status  Own definition is  not used but it  liaises with other  organisations like  FIRST (specifically  mentioned in the  registration  procedure) and  ENISA.  The same applies here  as regards  constituency, which is  ‘based on a description  of Internet Domains, IP  Address Information  and/or other suitable  characteristics’  The mechanism lists the following CERT  categories (relevant also for  constituencies):   ISP Customer Base   Service Customer Base   Vendor Customer Base   Commercial Organisation   Financial Sector   Government   Military   Non-Commercial  Organisation   Research & Education  Page 21  Network  There are brief specifications of some  of these CERT categories.  4.1.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  None of these organisations specify how they keep their mechanisms updated. ENISA has stated that  its work in this area ‘should be considered only as a first step towards the specification of  requirements, which is an ongoing process that has and will involve discussions with the relevant  stakeholders in the Member States’.37 TI's mechanism is about recognising a CERT's status and the  development of TI mechanism is described in details under service governance section of the TI  contact description38.  Tier 1 Mechanism Keeping the mechanism up to date  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date, although ENISA generally considers its good practices to be  works in progress.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date, although ENISA generally considers its good practices to be  works in progress.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism notes that ‘to be really useful in the future, this  document has to be updated: obsolete information will have to be  deleted; information about new teams and activities will have to be  validated and added’ (pp. 42–43). It therefore requests that  changes, mistakes, or additions be provided to ENISA. The CERT  inventory is updated twice a year on a regular basis in Q2 and Q4.  There is also a possibility for an ad-hoc update based on a team’s  request.  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status In the section 9 of the ToR 2012, it is stated that requirements for  this status are defined by the Review Board and also could be  changed by the TI Community.39  4.1.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  These organisations take different views on topics such as promoting their mechanisms and training  CERTs in Tier 1 of the Maturity Model. ENISA holds an annual ‘CERTs in Europe’ workshop where  37  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental- certs(p. 5)  38  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/contact.html  39  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/publications/ToR-2012.pdf  Page 22  experiences, good practices and ‘TLP red40 discussion’ are shared, and where ENISA updates CERTs  about its efforts.41 ENISA is also active on the training front, and considers training and exercising  CERTs to be one of its core missions.42 It offers training programmes and workshops for CERTs at  different developmental stages, including those being established or introduced to their  constituents. ENISA continuously supports the TRANSITS training programme.43  TF-CSIRT/TI is also proactive when it comes to promoting their mechanisms. The TI service provider  is tasked, by service specification and Steering Committee, to actively look out for potential listing  candidates. They monitor the FIRST memberships and follow up with suggestions from fellow teams.  When it comes to training, TF-CSIRT/TI is involved in the provision of TRANSIT I training courses  popular within the CERT community. On 30 July 2013 TF-CSIRT/TI (via TERENA) and FIRST signed a  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding the use and promotion of TRANSITS I security  training materials worldwide.44  Tier 1 Mechanism Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion. In  terms of training, it lists TRANSITS and CERT/CC courses as the two  main sources for dedicated training that CERTs should use.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion or with  regard to training. But it does refer to training in general terms  under the guidelines.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  Promotion is carried out by means of ENISA’s main activities as a  broker between different Network and Information Security  communities (events, presentations, etc.)  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism offers training courses for new and experienced  personnel through TRANSITS I, which are organised by TERENA and  regularly supported by ENISA. There are no specific provisions for  promoting the mechanism, although there are regular open  meetings (held three times a year) with the right to access for  Listed teams.  40  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol  41  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-I  42  Extensive online training and exercise material is available at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise.  43  See for example the 2013 ENISA Work Programme:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes- reports/work-programme-2013.  44  http://www.terena.org/news/fullstory.php?news_id=3465  Page 23  4.2 Tier 2 of the CERT Maturity Model  CERTs that fall in Tier 2 of the CERT Maturity Model have established themselves in terms of having  baseline operational capabilities and a cooperative relationship within the CERT community. The  team representative enjoys trust in the wider CERT community. Thus, these CERTs will look to  community CERT organisations for affirmation of their existing capabilities as well as good practices  for further developing their capabilities and deepening their relationships with their constituents  and communities.  The following mechanisms are recognised for Tier 2 CERTs and were considered for the analysis of  commonalities and differences of CERT mechanisms:   ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs (2010, 2012)   Internet Engineering Task Force: RFC-2350 (2003 updated)   TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accredited’ status   FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ status   APCERT: ‘Membership’ status   CERT/CC: Handbook for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) (2003)  4.2.1 Type of approach (organisation)  The six organisations with mechanisms geared towards Tier 2 CERTs have a variety of commonalities  and differences in their approaches. Membership organisations are more prevalent at this level; TF- CSIRT/TI, FIRST and APCERT are all member-based organisations. As discussed previously, ENISA is  not membership based, but exists for the benefit of all CERTs in EU Member States. Meanwhile, the  IETF is an open organisation that focuses on good practices.  FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI are membership-based organisations with relatively formalised processes in  terms of management structure and other internal processes. TF-CSIRT/TI, for example, holds  membership meetings three times per year, with its Review Board ‘overseeing and steering’ TI's  activities. Meanwhile, FIRST has an operational framework that lays out the organisational structure  and basic organisational policies, as well as bylaws that explain formalities such as meetings and the  election of directors. FIRST holds an annual general meeting in accordance with its operational  framework.45 APCERT is also a membership organisation that holds an annual meeting open to all of  its members of any class. At this meeting, APCERT's Steering Committee is elected, which is  responsible for APCERT's general operating policies, procedures, guidelines, and other matters  affecting APCERT as a whole.46  There is a noticeable difference in the approach of CERT community organisations that focus on  CERTs further along in the maturation process than for those just getting started. This tendency  towards member-based structures makes sense, as CERTs which will become members of these  organisations have reached a level of maturity that allows them to provide insight to other CERTs  and help the organisation better serve its members.  45  FIRST Operational Framework, available at http://www.first.org/about/policies/op-framework  46  AP-CERT Operational Framework, available at  http://www.apcert.org/documents/pdf/OPFW_26March2013.pdf  Page 24  Tier 2 Mechanism Type of approach (organisation) Voluntary/ subscribe/  compulsory form  ENISA: Baseline  Capabilities for  National /  Governmental CERTs  (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  This mechanism was defined in 2010 for  newly established n/g CERTs to help them  understand and focus on a basic set of  capabilities so as to facilitate efficient and  effective incident response and  collaboration. It was then updated in  2012 with a review of the baseline set of  capabilities of n/g CERTs in EU MS.  Voluntary (targeted EU policy  recommendations)47  IETF: RFC-2350  (2003 updated)  This mechanism was initially created in  1998 and updated in 2003 as an effort to  ‘express the general Internet  community's expectations’ of CERTs. As  such, it serves as a voluntary mechanism  based on good practices for CERTs.  Voluntary  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Accreditation’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  Subscribe  FIRST: ‘Full  Membership’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  Subscribe  APCERT:  ‘Membership’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  Subscribe  CERT/CC: Handbook  for Computer Security  Incident Response  Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism was created in 1993 to  ‘offer guidance to networking  organisations who wish to set up CERTs’  and thus takes a voluntary approach.  Voluntary/good practice  4.2.2 Requirements for CERTs  As noted, ENISA is not a membership organisation, so it does not issue requirements for CERTs  seeking to associate with it, even though it publishes good practices and recommendations for  CERTs. The IETF is an open organisation without requirements for entities wanting to associate with  it.  47  As stipulated in the Communication of the European Commission entitled ‘A Digital Agenda for Europe’  COM(2010) 245 final, EU Member States should have established a well-functioning network of CERTs at  national level covering all of Europe by 2012: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:HTML  Page 25  Unlike the approaches of ENISA, IETF and CERT/CC, the other three organisations analysed in this  section all have requirements for gaining membership.  FIRST does not require that a CERT have specific capabilities to become a member, but it suggests  that a CERT should meet a solid majority of a list of recommended criteria. Uniquely, FIRST requires  that applicants agree to host a site visit from an appointed FIRST team to ‘ensure that the candidate  CSIRT meets all needed requirements to be an active and beneficial member of FIRST’.48  TF-CSIRT/TI allows listed members to then apply for accreditation with it. To gain accredited status, a  CERT is obliged to meet certain requirements, with the RFC-2350 document serving as the basis for  the capabilities that an accredited CERT should have. The applicant CERT must formally apply (which  entails set procedures) and provide information such as a list of the services it provides, its staffing  resources, and policies regarding information handling.49  APCERT requires that operational member candidates meet a number of membership criteria,  ranging from performing CERT functions on a full-time basis to being at least partly government- funded. Candidates must also maintain the confidentiality of information shared with other  members, actively share information with other members, respond to inquiries in a timely manner,  and participate in APCERT activities and initiatives.50  Tier 2 Mechanism Requirements for CERTs  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  This mechanism does not directly impose requirements on CERTs  wishing to adopt its mechanism or otherwise use its good practices  contained in these documents. On the other hand, the  recommendations contained in the document are crucial for  attaining the goal of having a well-established network of n/g CERTs  in Europe by 2012. See footnote 47.  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism outlined in this publication is from an open  organisation – an organisation without requirements for entities  that want to associate with it or to follow the good practices  contained in RFC-2350.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  This mechanism requires CERTs seeking accredited status to meet  certain requirements, with the RFC-2350 document serving as the  basis for reviewing their capabilities. The applying CERT must fill  out an application package and provide information such as a list of  the services it provides, its staffing resources, and policies regarding  information handling  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ This mechanism does not include specific required capabilities for  membership, but provides a list for analysing a CERT's capability  and notes that a CERT should have most of these capabilities. The  mechanism also includes a site visit from an appointed team to  confirm the CERT's capabilities.  48  FIRST Site Visit Requirements and Assessment, available at http://www.first.org/membership/site-visit- V1.0.pdf  49  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  50  AP-CERT Operational Framework, available at  http://www.apcert.org/documents/pdf/OPFW_26March2013.pdf, at p. 3  Page 26  APCERT: ‘Membership’ This mechanism requires that CERTs seeking Operational Member  status meet a number of membership criteria. Applicants must also  maintain the confidentiality of information, actively share  information with other members, respond to inquiries in a timely  manner, and participate in activities and initiatives of the  mechanism.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it.  4.2.3 Validation process  ENISA does not have a formal mechanism for evaluating CERTs, although it monitored in 2012  whether n/g CERTs in EU Member States are following its baseline recommendations.51 Likewise, the  IETF and CERT/CC do not concern themselves with validating the capabilities of CERTs following their  mechanism.  FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI mechanisms both have well-established processes for validating the  capabilities of CERTs applying for their mainstream membership classes. TF-CSIRT/TI requires that an  applicant must prove its capabilities based on the RFC-2350 document to gain membership, and  notes that ‘a team has to provide a useful, but limited, amount of operational information’. The TF- CSIRT/TI accreditation process then focuses on the authenticity, actuality, and correctness of the  information provided, which is done either by personal discussion with a member of a team or  through a cryptographic connection. 52  FIRST requires applicants for full membership to be  nominated by two existing full members of FIRST and to then be approved by a two-thirds vote of its  Steering Committee, as well as be subjected to the site visit discussed above.53 APCERT's validation  process is less clear and it does not explicitly lay out how it enforces the requirements mentioned in  the previous section.  This means that CERTs accepted for membership by these organisations have a certain status within  the broader CERT community and have reached baseline level of capabilities before they are allowed  to become members and associate themselves with these CERT community organisations.  Tier 2 Mechanism Validation process  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  The objective of the updated version of the reports was to measure  the extent to which n/g CERTs in EU Member States have met the  baseline capabilities identified. See the ‘Deployment of baseline  capabilities of national/governmental CERTs – Status Report  2012’.54  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism outlined in this document does not involve  validating the CERT capabilities.  51  ENISA, Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report (2012)  52  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/Template-Invitation-for-Accreditation_v20.pdf  53  http://www.first.org/about/policies/op-framework, under FIRST Participation  54  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/status-report-2012  Page 27  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  This mechanism's validation process is based on an applicant  proving its capabilities based on the RFC-2350 document to gain  membership. The mechanism requires that a team demonstrate  the authenticity, actuality and correctness of information it  provides in support of its application (every four months an  accredited team needs to confirm its data or will be asked to do so).  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ This mechanism requires applicants for full membership to be  nominated by two existing full members and to then be approved  by a two-thirds vote of the Steering Committee, as well as meeting  the requirements of the site visit discussed above.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ The documentation from this process does not explicitly state how  the organisation enforces its membership requirements.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  No validation process is associated with use of the mechanism  outlined in this document.  4.2.4 CERTs’ focus: type and region  By geographic focus, ENISA and TF-CSIRT/TI focus on CERTs in Europe, as previously discussed, while  APCERT was established to benefit CERTs from Asian-Pacific countries. FIRST is an international  organisation that seeks and accepts members from around the world. There is little to suggest that  the geographic scopes of these organisations have a significant impact on their status in the CERT  community or the services that they provide.  Likewise, none of these organisations have limited their activities to particular industries, even if  they sometimes carry out vertical-specific analyses or training sessions.  Tier 2 Mechanism CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  n/g CERTs from EU Member States  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  all types of CERTs/global  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  all types of CERTs in Europe or with valid interests in EU  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ all types of CERTs/global  APCERT: ‘Membership’ all types of CERTs/Asia-Pacific region  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  all types of CERTs/global  .  Page 28  4.2.5 Benefits and added value of the mechanism  The benefits that CERTs gain from implementing the mechanisms in the Tier 2 level of the CERT  maturity model change as their maturity levels increase. In particular, gaining ‘Accredited’ status  with TF-CSIRT/TI or full membership with FIRST suggest that a CERT has reached a stage in its  development where it has capabilities typically associated with CERTs. This is a key value of these  organisations: when a CERT is granted a certain status with one of these organisations, then the  CERT in question has clearly met certain requirements; outside parties can count on TF-CSIRT/TI or  FIRST's expertise in such matters. CERTs that reach the accredited status with TF-CSIRT/TI will have  already been listed members, while those gaining full membership with FIRST will have been  subjected to a site visit, suggesting that these CERTs will be well-known entities to these  organisations by the time they gain such a membership status.  All of these CERT organisations can also recommend good practices to CERTs or other interested  parties as they improve their capabilities. Like ENISA, these organisations have issued mechanisms  that roughly mirror ENISA's baseline capabilities mechanism. These organisations divide their  mechanisms slightly differently:   ENISA: Mandate capabilities; Operational capabilities (technical); Operational capabilities  (organisational); Co-operational capabilities   TI: Organisation; Human Resources; Processes; and Tools   FIRST: Operational Requirements; Policies; Workplace/Environment; Incident Handling   RFC-2350: CERT Scope; Policies and Procedures; Cooperation; Services  There are also other elements to these mechanisms’ value. For example, TF-CSIRT/TI lists several  other value-added services that accredited teams can benefit from:   Access to members-only parts of the TF-CSIRT/TI website;   Access to certain mailing lists only available to accredited teams;   Access to value-added information only available to accredited teams;   Access to in-band and out-of-band alerting services; and   Access to TF-CSIRT/TI meetings restricted to accredited teams only.55   Voting privileges: if a vote is needed (elections, rule changes, community topics), only  accredited teams can take part in the vote.   Nomination privileges: only accredited teams can nominate candidates for the Steering  Committee.  FIRST also similarly provides what it terms ‘value added services’, including dedicated mailing lists  with access to good practice documents, technical colloquia, classes, an annual incident response  conference, as well as various presentations.  55  Invitation Package for TI ‘Accredited Status’, at p. 5.  Page 29  Tier 2 Mechanism Benefits and added value of the mechanism  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  Baseline capabilities for all n/g CERTs in Europe:  The mechanism offers value to CERTs by providing good practices  for developing baseline capabilities necessary for n/g CERTs. It also  provides further guidance to EU Member States in adhering to the  communications and recommendations (relating to CERTs and their  baseline capabilities) of the EU Commission and other EU  institutions.  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  Same format used:  The mechanism provides value by being a widely used and  accepted good practice guide for CERTs.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  Trust and recognition within the European CERT community:  The mechanism provides confirmation of CERTs' capabilities when  they are approved for accredited status, along with certain other  benefits such as information sharing between CERTs which have  reached this level.  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ Trust and recognition within the global CERT community:  The mechanism provides confirmation of CERTs' capabilities. In  addition, the mechanism provides what it terms ‘value added  services’, including access to good practice documents, technical  colloquia, classes, an annual incident response conference, as well  as various publications.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ Trust and recognition within the Asia-Pacific CERT community:  The mechanism provides confirmation of CERTs' status, as well as  certain value-added services such as an annual drill test56 for  members, efforts to increase information sharing among members,  and joint research and development efforts.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  Following the same practices globally:  This mechanism provides value through good practices to its target  audience.  4.2.6 Definitions and terminology  For this tier we go one step further and shift focus from definitions of basic terms like ‘CERT’ and  ‘constituency’ to categories of capabilities and incident classification and definition. ENISA and TF- CSIRT/TI have relatively similar definitions of ‘incident’ – definitions that focus on incidents’ impact  on computers and networks. Under their mechanisms, the definition is the baseline evaluation for  56  For  information on the 2013 drill test see:  http://www.hkpc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4291%3Ados&catid=149%3Anews- flash&Itemid=437&lang=en  Page 30  whether something qualifies as an incident.57 FIRST's definition of incident is more thorough but still  maintains the focus on computers and networks: ‘An event that has actual or potentially adverse  effects on computer or network operations resulting in fraud, waste, or abuse; compromise of  information; or loss or damage of property or information.’58 IETF and CERT/CC also specify various  types of incidents.  On the other hand, there are significant differences among definitions concerning the categories of  CERT capabilities. While ENISA provides its set of four baseline capabilities, the other mechanisms,  although mostly covering the same topics, have their capabilities/topics scattered in more categories  under different headings. The difference is most striking when compared with membership  mechanisms like those of FIRST and APCERT. ENISA also pays significant attention to mandate and  strategy issues, which do not feature that prominently in the case of other mechanisms. On the  other hand, these more often address added value of the CERTs like the benefits of the teams for  the wider CERT community (member application process at APCERT where a CERT has to  demonstrate benefits it brings to APCERT).  Tier 2 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Categories of capabilities  Incident – definition and classification  ENISA: Baseline  Capabilities for  National /  Governmental  CERTs (2010,  2012)  Four baseline capabilities are  defined for n/g CERTs:   mandate & strategy   service portfolio   operation   cooperation  The term ‘incident’ is not specifically  defined but the focus is clearly on  incidents affecting critical information  infrastructure.  IETF: RFC-2350  (2003 updated)  The following categories are listed:   Charter (mission statement,  constituency, sponsorship/  affiliation, authority)   Policies (incident types and  support levels, cooperation,  interaction and disclosure of  information, communication  and authentication)   Services (incident response,  proactive activities)  Computer Security Incident: ‘any adverse  event which compromises some aspect of  computer or network security.’  The following categories are mentioned:   Loss of confidentiality of information   Compromise of integrity of information   Denial of service   Misuse of service   Damage to the systems  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Accreditation’  Categories used when applying for  the ‘Accredited’ status:   constituency  The mechanism includes references to  other sources, especially RFC-2350.  Page 31  Tier 2 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Categories of capabilities  Incident – definition and classification   business hours   policies   membership of  professional team/  security organisation   services provided to the  constituency  FIRST: ‘Full  Membership’  The current application form  includes (inter alia) the following  categories:   constituency   services   business hours   additional (incl. networks  of expertise)  Incident: ‘an event that has actual or  potentially adverse effects on computer  or network operations resulting in fraud,  waste, or abuse; compromise of  information; or loss or damage of  property or information. Examples include  penetration of a computer system,  exploitation of technical vulnerabilities, or  introduction of computer viruses or other  forms of malicious software.’  APCERT:  ‘Membership’  The membership process  includes (inter alia) the following  categories:   constituency   host organisation   authority (to act as a  CERT)   technical and managerial  skill-set of the team   mission statement   trust   contribution to security  community  The mechanism does not have its own  definitions of incidents but uses the term  ‘Type of incidents and level of support’  introduced by RFC 2350.  CERT/CC:  Handbook for  Computer  Security Incident  Response Teams  (CSIRTs) (2003)  This mechanism applies the  following categories:   CSIRT framework  (constituency, place in  organisation, relationship  to other teams)   CSIRT services   Policies (implementation,  maintenance and  enforcement)   Team operations  Although this mechanism is very detailed  on various aspects of incident handling  service, the actual definition of an  incident is not included. It is, however,  present in other CERT/CC documents,  including its FAQ section on its website59:  ‘Any real or suspected adverse event in  relation to the security of computer  systems or computer networks’ or ‘The  act of violating an explicit or implied  security policy’.  59  http://www.cert.org/csirts/csirt_faq.html#2  Page 32  Tier 2 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Categories of capabilities  Incident – definition and classification  It also lists some categories of incidents:   attempts (either failed or successful)  to gain unauthorised access to a  system or its data   unwanted disruption or denial of  service   unauthorised use of a system for the  processing or storage of data   changes to system hardware,  firmware or software characteristics  without the owner’s knowledge,  instruction or consent  4.2.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  Membership organisations seem to have more explicitly stated routes for updating their  mechanisms than non-membership organisations. For example, FIRST's framework can be amended  with a two-thirds vote of members present at a General Meeting or Special or Additional Meeting,  provided a quorum is present.60 Meanwhile, APCERT's members can propose additions and changes  to policies and procedures by submitting the proposed changes in writing to the Steering  Committee, along with the reason for the proposed change. The Steering Committee then decides  whether to accept, reject or amend the proposal, and submits it as necessary to Operational  Members, which must approve it by at least a two-thirds vote of a quorum during a general meeting,  or by more than half of total members if done by email.61  Tier 2 Mechanism Keeping the mechanism up to date  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  This is a living document that was updated in 2012, while further  updates will follow taking account of the evolving cyber-security  landscape and the role of n/g CERTs in the EU Member States with  regard to the EU policy scope.62  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism does not explicitly provide for keeping it updated.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  The mechanism does not explicitly provide for keeping it updated.  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ The mechanism allows for amendment of its framework with a  60  http://www.first.org/about/policies/op-framework#c12, under Amendments  61  AP-CERT Operational Framework, available at  http://www.apcert.org/documents/pdf/OPFW_26March2013.pdf  62  See the recent EU Cyber Security Strategy and the proposal for a Directive on Network and Information  Security: http://www.eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/  Page 33  two-thirds vote of the members present at a General Meeting or  with a quorum at a Special or Additional Meeting.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ The mechanism allows its members to propose additions or  changes to policies and procedures by submitting the proposed  changes to the Steering Committee, which then decides whether to  accept, reject, or amend it.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date.  4.2.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  ENISA has gained credit especially among the n/g CERT community thanks to its extensive training  material63 and its dedicated operational events. ENISA CERT Exercises and training material were  introduced in 2008. Four years later, new training scenarios were added (bringing their total to 23)  containing essential and advanced materials for CERTs in the area of cyber-security. The material  includes handbooks for teachers, toolsets for students and also virtual images to support hands-on  training sessions. Since 2005, ENISA has also been organising annual CERT workshops for n/g CERTs  focusing on the actual needs of the teams including hands-on technical sessions.64  ENISA recently introduced its training courses for CERTs in the EU Member States. This is a new  initiative to promote and support CERT maturity in the MS by providing exercises and technical  hands-on training on different services, operations and cooperation in the daily work of the teams.65  FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI do not engage in significant promotion of their mechanisms, and nor does  APCERT. FIRST has a formal policy for engaging with the press. APCERT issues media releases relating  to its key activities.  By tradition the first TF-CSIRT/TI meeting each year is co-organised with FIRST to safe travel budget  for all participants and to raise value added. Similarly ENISA usually co-locates its annual CERT  workshop66 with the second TF-CSIRT/TI meeting. Additionally, FIRST offers two technical colloquia67  each year that last from half a day to 2 days and are often conducted in cooperation with a local  CERT member. FIRST also offers a regular annual conference/ general meeting68 to its members,  which are valuable for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 CERTs aiming to further develop their capabilities. As  mentioned previously, TF-CSIRT/TI offers a training programme under this Tier which is TRANSITS II  (advanced training).69 APCERT does not offer its own training programmes, but does provide a list of  meetings and training opportunities available in the Asia-Pacific region offered by its member CERTs  and other relevant organisations.  63  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  64  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/past-events  65  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  66  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/past-events  67  http://www.first.org/events/colloquia  68  http://www.first.org/events/agm  69  http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/transits-ii/  Page 34  Tier 2 Mechanism Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – Policy  recommendations (2010,  2012)  ENISA provides n/g CERTs with extensive training material and also  organises workshops and tailored training courses, often focused  on technical issues as requested by the teams.  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism does not make specific provisions for its promotion  or provisions related to training.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  There are regular meetings held three times a year and TF-CSIRT/TI  promotes training programmes like TRANSIT-II.  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ The mechanism offers two technical colloquia each year that last  from half a day to 2 days and are often conducted in cooperation  with a local CERT member, as well as a regular annual conference/  general meeting. Based on the agreement with TERENA (TF- CSIRT/TI), FIRST also offers TRANSIT courses.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ The mechanism does not offer its own training programmes, but  does provide a list of meetings and training opportunities available.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion or  provisions related to training.  4.3 Tier 3 of the CERT Maturity Model  CERTs that have reached Tier 3 of the CERT Maturity Model have established themselves and are  well balanced in their daily work and experience. They have a complete set of capabilities (all well  documented) in place and a stable position within their community, meaning that they no longer  depend on individuals from their team. Thus, for CERTs that have reached this level, CERT  mechanisms can be helpful in terms of refining their capabilities and establishing recognition of the  extent to which they have developed their capabilities. They can also provide feedback to CERTs and  the cyber-security communities to improve the work of CERTs based on their extensive and proven  knowledge, experience and recognition.  There are fewer mechanisms targeting CERTs that have reached this level, but several organisations  have standards and mechanisms that can be recognised as being appropriate for Tier 3 CERTs:  1. ENISA: n/g CERT standard capabilities (2014)70  2. ISO: ISO 27035 (2011)  3. TF-CSIRT/TI: Certified status  70  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing (beginning in 2009) with next input due in  2014.  Page 35  4.3.1 Type of approach (organisation)  Gaining ‘certified’ status with TF-CSIRT/TI is the next step beyond accreditation for member CERTs.  The International Standards Organisation (ISO) is a non-governmental organisation that is made up  of members from the national standards bodies of 163 countries.  The ISO-27035 document, like the other ISO standards that it publishes, was developed by a panel of  experts on a technical committee. Thus, it is a consensus-based document, even though ISO itself is  not a membership organisation for CERTs in the same way that TF-CSIRT/TI or FIRST are. Therefore,  as for Tier 1 and Tier 2 CERTs, the organisations with mechanisms for Tier 3 CERTs follow different  organisational approaches.  ENISA is also aiming to contribute with its mechanism to Tier 3 of the CERT Maturity Model while  building on its earlier work in defining and deploying baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs. This project  on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing, with next input due in 2014.  Tier 3 Mechanism Type of approach (organisation) Voluntary/ subscribe/  compulsory form  ENISA: n/g CERT  Standard Capabilities  (2014)  According to the new ENISA mandate (EU  Regulation 526/2013)71 ENISA will assist  CERTs in advancing their capabilities so  that they increasingly correspond to  those of the most developed CERTs. For  this purpose ENISA should promote the  establishment and operation of a peer  review system.  compulsory (once joined)  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism was developed by a  panel of experts of a committee and is  therefore a consensus-based standard,  not a membership-driven mechanism.  compulsory (once joined)  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Certification’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  compulsory (once joined)  4.3.2 Requirements for CERTs  TF-CSIRT/TI provides CERTs that have already earned accredited status with it the opportunity to  apply for certification, which is meant for teams with ‘internal and/or external reasons to have their  maturity level gauged in an independent way’. To apply for certified status, a CERT must be  accredited by TF-CSIRT/TI, be in good standing with the organisation for at least eight months, not  be under special review by the TF-CSIRT/TI Review Board, and must have attended at least one TI  Accredited Team meeting.72 The requirements for ISO compliance are straightforward.  71  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/regulatory-framework  72  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  Page 36  Tier 3 Mechanism Requirements for CERTs  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Not yet defined73  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The requirements result from the compulsory set of standards once  a CERT decides to follow them.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  Defined: The mechanism requires applicants for ‘Certification’  already be accredited by TI, be in good standing with the  organisation for at least eight months, not be under special review  by the TI Review Board, and must have attended at least one TI  Accredited Team meeting.74 Certification is valid for three years,  after which a re-certification process must be started and passed in  order to keep the ‘certified’ status.  4.3.3 Validation process  TF-CSIRT/TI uses the Security Incident Management Model (SIM3 Model)75 as a basis for evaluating a  member's application for certification. The SIM3 Model is similar to the ENISA baseline capabilities in  terms of how the model is organised, with key areas of focus being organisation, human resources,  processes, and tools. Each CERT capability is evaluated using a five-point scale, ranging from ‘0’,  which means it is not available, to ‘4’, which means that the capability is not only described (on level  ‘2’) and rubber-stamped (on level ‘3’) but also part of an audit process. According to TF-CSIRT/TI, the  certification process takes between three and twelve months in total.76  In case of ISO standards independent audits are used for the validation of the implemented  standard.77 ISO provides good practices for choosing an auditing company.  Tier 3 Mechanism Validation process  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Not yet defined.78  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) Independent audits are carried out.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  Minimum score needs to be attained for each criteria in the SIM3  model. The minimum scores are defined by the TF-CSIRT Steering  Committee.  73  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014  74  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  75  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/SIM3-mkXV-TI.pdf  76  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  77  For an example of independent auditing services for ISO 27035 see http://www.isec.ro/compliance/iso-iec- 27035-incident-management.  78  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  Page 37  4.3.4 CERTs’ focus: Type and region  The same geographic and sector-specific focuses of the CERT community organisations relevant for  Tier 3 CERTs apply as previously discussed in this document. ENISA and TF-CSIRT/TI are focused on  Europe, while ISO seeks to provide value to CERTs worldwide. ENISA’s mechanism specifically  focuses on n/g CERT sector-specific group in EU Member States.  Tier 3 Mechanism CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  n/g CERTs/EU Member States79  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) all types of CERTs/global  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  all types of CERTs/Europe  4.3.5 Benefits and added value of the mechanism  Under Tier 3 the main benefit for the teams should be: the recognition by wider CERT and cyber- security community of the team capabilities (by attaining a ‘quality mark’). The added value should  be facilitating cooperation with institutions regarding standard operational procedures, financing  and grants.  Reaching the level of certification with TF-CSIRT/TI serves as independent affirmation of a CERT's  capabilities, which it can use with its constituents, its funding bodies, and with other parties or  teams. Thus, the value of reaching the level of Certified with TF-CSIRT/TI revolves around a CERT's  ability to use TF-CSIRT/TI's judgment to demonstrate its capabilities with its most important partners  – namely its constituents and funding sources.  The International Standards Organisation offers a different type of value to CERTs. ISO goes beyond  providing good practices to offering internationally agreed-upon standards for CERTs to follow. This  is potentially quite valuable both in terms of helping a CERT build up and maintain its capabilities, as  well as in terms of supporting a CERT's arguments for why it needs funding or resources for  developing certain capabilities.  Tier 3 Mechanism Benefits and added value  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  This mechanism will provide a wide range of benefits80, including  access to good practices and networking with CERTs offering these  good practices. Another added value is formal recognition by EU  authorities and an independent (and expert) affirmation of the  team’s capabilities.  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism provides value by being an accepted good practice  guide for CERTs based on a specific standard.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  The mechanism serves as independent affirmation of a CERT's  capabilities, which it can use with its constituents, its funding  bodies, and with other parties or teams. The certification may be  79  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  80  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  Page 38  regarded as a kind of ‘extra branding’ that is useful for many  purposes in the team's future.81  4.3.6 Definitions and terminology  For Tier 3 mechanisms that are suitable for advanced CERTs it is useful to consider standard services  (core or ‘must have’ services), working regime and incident response time. While TF-CSIRT/TI  ‘Certified status’ is based on the above-mentioned SIM3 model, the other two mechanisms are  either being developed (ENISA’s baseline capabilities mechanism) or being reviewed (ISO 27035). But  they will probably not change much in their approaches. Therefore, a similar approach can be  expected: incident handling (and incident management in general) will be considered as a core  service that a CERT offers to its constituents, one that provides 24/7 reachability mode and fast  response timelines based on the severity of the incident.  Tier 3 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Standard services  (core/ must have  services)  Working regime (for  core/ must have  services)  Incident response  time  ENISA: n/g CERT  Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Incident handling  Alerts and warnings  Announcements  24/7  yet to be defined  ISO: ISO 27035  (2011)  Handling an incident that  ‘has a severe impact on the  organisation’s core services,  instigating “crisis” activities  through escalation to the  Crisis Team.’  24/7  ‘If an organisation  contracts with an  external party for  support, for  example a CERT,  then it should be  ensured  that all  requirements,  including response  times, are  included in the  contract with the  external party.’  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Certification’  This process requires the  description of services  provided and level of  support (speed of reaction  to incoming incident reports  from constituents and from  peer CERTs)  24/7  Minimum  requirement:  ‘Specifies the  speed of reaction  to incoming  incident reports  and reports from  81  At the time of writing this document only seven teams had successfully completed the accreditation process:  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/alpha_certification_Z.html (last accessed on 20 September 2013)  Page 39  constituents and  from peer CERTs.  For the latter a  human reaction  within two  working days is  the minimum  expected.’  4.3.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  ISO appears to follow an iterative process whereby the panel of experts responsible for a particular  set of standards updates those standards as necessary. ISO's work on CERTs is a relatively small part  of its overall activities, so the process for keeping its CERT mechanism updated is less explicit than  with other organisations that have a greater focus on CERTs.  The SIM3 model that is the basis for TF-CSIRT/TI's certification process has no explicit provision as to  how it can be updated, although updates to this model would be necessary for TF-CSIRT/TI if it were  to decide to make fundamental changes to its certification process. 82  Tier 3 Mechanism Keeping the mechanism up to date  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Not defined yet.83  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism probably follows an iterative process whereby a  panel of experts revisits their standards, although the process for  keeping this particular standard up to date is not explicitly stated.  There was an ongoing revision of the standard at the time of  writing of this document.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  The updates are the responsibility of the TF-CSIRT Steering  Committee. Big changes require a vote by the members (TF-CSIRT  Full Members).  4.3.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ISO is not heavily engaged in promoting its standards, although it does actively promote the  participation of new players in the process of creating relevant standards. ISO offers a variety of  training courses designed ‘for individuals performing various roles in International Standardization’  and ‘offered to all ISO members’. It notes that these training courses help members with regard to  specific aspects of the development of ISO standards as well as with distributing and implementing  the standards.84  82  SIM3: Security Incident Management Model (2010), available at https://www.trusted-introducer.org/SIM3- mkXV-TI.pdf  83  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  84  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/training-technical-assistance.htm  Page 40  TF-CSIRT/TI does not offer specific training courses to certified members. The SIM3 Model considers  staff training to be one of the fundamental aspects of the ‘Human’ Parameters of the model,  although it does not make specific recommendations with regard to training programmes.85 ENISA  has developed its advanced tailored training suitable also for teams in Tier 3 level.86  Tier 3 Mechanism Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  ENISA provides n/g CERTs with extensive training material and also  organises specific workshops, often focused on technical issues as  requested by the teams or dedicated to a particular area (e.g. CERT  and LEA cooperation on cybercrime).87  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism does not make specific provisions for its promotion  or about training, but it does promote the participation of new  actors in the creation or revision of standards.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  The TRANSITS-II courses are intended for more experienced  personnel working for established CERTs. They provide insights into  key areas in incident handling and response operations, training in  how to improve communications with constituents, as well as  practical exercises.88  85  SIM3: Security Incident Management Model (2010), available at https://www.trusted-introducer.org/SIM3- mkXV-TI.pdf  86  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii  87  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii  88  http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/transits-ii/  Page 41  5 Harmonisation Approach  The number of mechanisms that exist for use by CERTs suggests that there may be room for  harmonisation of certain aspects of these mechanisms. Targeted harmonisation could benefit both  the organisations that offer mechanisms and CERTs that use them. For CERTs, harmonisation of  these mechanisms can make it easier for them to associate with more CERT community  organisations that offer these mechanisms. From the perspective of these CERT community  organisations, harmonisation could enable cooperation with other similar organisations, and allow  them to more easily make use of each other's existing resources. All of these potential advantages  are about possible gained efficiencies, which is important given that these mechanisms should be  about helping CERTs reach higher stages of maturity and better serve their constituents.  That said, there will be parts of all of these mechanisms that either will be very unlikely to be  considered for harmonisation or would not benefit from efforts to harmonise. These organisations  and their mechanisms serve different purposes and have different objectives, meaning that  harmonisation will not be possible across all, or even most, areas. The objective of this section is to  identify some areas where ENISA believes that harmonisation efforts could potentially be beneficial,  and also to identify areas where harmonisation efforts are unlikely to be fruitful.  5.1 Interest in harmonisation  Most surveyed CERTs say that they see a need for CERTs to have standardised capabilities. The  CERTs are also of the opinion that harmonisation in some areas of CERT mechanisms discussed  below could potentially benefit them (and their constituents!) in terms of reaching the goal of  standardised CERT capabilities.  Number of answers = 12 n/g CERTs  Source: Survey conducted by ENISA in conjunction with this document  CERTs' interest in standardisation of capabilities suggests that CERT community organisations should  give thought to where harmonisation might be beneficial in their mechanisms. This will be the  foundation for efforts to harmonise specific capability areas going forward. These organisations  know that their mechanisms can potentially benefit from harmonisation: for example, FIRST already  75%  25%  Is there a need for standardised capabilities of CERTs?  Yes  No  Page 42  has a liaison relationship with ISO through which standardisation efforts are made.89 ENISA and  TERENA cooperate on TRANSITS courses, for which ENISA provides financial and content-related  support.  5.2 Suitable areas for harmonisation  Surveyed CERTs see the most potential in harmonisation for the areas of (1) accepting and validating  members and (2) terminology and definitions. This is an interesting result because these are very  different aspects of the considered mechanisms and raise unique challenges in possible efforts to  harmonise them.  (1) Requirements / Validation Process: The CERT community's interest in harmonisation when it  comes to mechanisms' requirements and validation processes is understandable because meeting  and then adhering to different requirements is resource- and time-intensive. Harmonisation of  requirements seems to be more straightforward: CERTs already use the same tools/equipment or  way of communication (e.g. PGP encryption, phone number for incident reporting, web-based  incident report form, participation in the community meetings, etc.).  From the perspective of CERTs, it would be better if they could meet a single validation process  regardless of the CERT organisation from which they are seeking validation. Harmonisation is likely  to be challenging to achieve in these areas, though: CERT organisations have different missions and  agendas, and they may be reluctant to give up the autonomy that comes with having their own  requirements and validation processes.  (2) Definitions / Terminology: Working to harmonise important terms and definitions across  mechanisms is likely to be a more realistic goal than validation processes or requirements. Many  terms and definitions used by CERT organisations are already similar, as discussed previously in this  document. Thus, beginning the process for harmonising concepts at the core of CERTs' capabilities  and responsibilities might be the right place to begin harmonisation efforts. Harmonising core terms  such as: CERT and constituency definitions in Tier 1, incident type and definition for Tier 2 and  incident response time for Tier 3 CERTs would seem to make considerable sense. This could be a way  to make these mechanisms fundamentally more compatible and make it easier for CERTs to belong  to or utilise more mechanisms and also for CERTs’ constituency and cooperation partners to  understand better and recognise teams’ capabilities.  89  http://www.first.org/global/standardisation  Page 43  Number of answers =12  Source: Survey conducted by ENISA in conjunction with this document  A number of other areas may be particularly conducive to capability harmonisation efforts:   CERT types and the sectors in which they operate: The harmonisation of definitions of  sectors on which vertical-specific CERTs typically focus may be beneficial, as this would offer  more clarity and transparency surrounding a CERT's activities and the constituents it serves.   Training: This is another area where harmonisation could be beneficial, as it could lead to  synergies, proliferation of training opportunities for CERTs (in terms of standardised  capabilities and services offered by CERTs), and more opportunities for CERTs to meet and  share good practices. Good progress has already taken place in this respect with several  CERT organisations (including ENISA and FIRST) supporting TERENA's TRANSITS training for  CERTs.  On the other hand, harmonisation will be more challenging or makes less sense for some other areas  of capability mechanisms:   Approach (type of organisation): This is fundamental to a mechanism and approaches differ  to such an extent that harmonisation will be challenging.   Benefits: The benefits that CERTs can gain from an organisation's capability mechanism are  unlikely to merge to an appreciable extent as benefits are fundamental to an organisation's  identity.   Promoting the mechanisms: Organisations will continue to pursue different strategies when  it comes to promoting their mechanisms.  The figure below provides a view of the areas in which these organisations are most likely to be  receptive to the potential of harmonisation. As discussed, areas such as definitions of core  6  4 4  3  Validation Process Requirements Terminology Definitions  Which areas of CERT capabilites need to be further defined and  harmonised?  Page 44  terminology will rank among the areas most likely to see harmonisation, whereas harmonisation will  be looked at more sceptically when it comes to areas that go to the core of what the organisation  does.

It is suggested that the primary harmonisation focus should be on definitions of basic  terms, which would support interlinks among the CERT organisations and be helpful for teams that  are members of several CERT organisations.  Actions to be taken by ENISA   Address the missing criteria in the maturity assessment for its n/g CERT standard capabilities  mechanism  ENISA’s n/g CERT standard capabilities mechanism will be adjusted based on the interaction with the  teams. The focus will be on updating the list of maturity assessment criteria by adding new items  and possibly deleting others if they are found no longer relevant.   In collaboration with EU Member States continue to support the established n/g CERTs  It is necessary that the CERTs further develop their capabilities so that they are in a position to rise  up the maturity scale. This is important for fulfilling the objectives of new EU Cyber Security  Strategy. ENISA will support the teams with new training materials.   Further monitor the deployment of baseline capabilities of n/g CERTs in EU Member States as  well as developments in other CERT organisations in this area  ENISA will continue its stocktaking efforts in the area of baseline capabilities. At the same time it will  monitor the developments in other CERT organisations as regards their CERT mechanisms.

It introduces these mechanisms according to the CERT maturity levels that they address based  on eight predefined criteria including requirements that CERTs must meet; CERTs’ focus: type or  region; and definitions and terminology used.  A three-tier CERT maturity model was specifically developed for the purpose of this project, with  the tiers being three respective stages of a CERT development: fundamental, baseline and advanced.  At each stage of this progression, mechanisms from CERT community organisations provide guidance  and support to CERTs with regard to the defined categories.  For all three tiers the document highlights important commonalities and differences among the  mechanisms. This enables the identification of potential areas for harmonisation of the CERT  mechanisms, though this document does not aspire to determine how, when or by whom the  harmonisation efforts should be carried out.  As partly confirmed by direct consultations with them while preparing this paper, CERTs are in need  of harmonisation for the following reasons:   Requirements and validation process: CERTs need to meet and adhere to different  requirements, which is resource- and time-intensive. This would be much more effective and  easier based on harmonisation across the CERT community.   Definitions and terminology: Many terms and definitions used by CERT organisations are  already similar. Harmonising core terms such as CERT (CSIRT), constituency, or incident  would make these mechanisms significantly more compatible and make it easier for CERTs  to subscribe to, or utilise, various mechanisms.   CERT types (sectors): It could be beneficial for different mechanisms to harmonise their  definitions of sectors that vertical-specific CERTs typically focus on, and to specify clearly  various constituency types, as doing so would offer more clarity and transparency  surrounding CERT activities.   Training: Harmonisation could lead to synergies, proliferation of training opportunities for  CERTs, and more opportunities for CERTs to meet and share good practices. Good progress  has already taken place in this respect with several CERT organisations including ENISA and  FIRST supporting TERENA’s TRANSITS training for CERTs, and ENISA producing material that  actively is rolled out to CERTs on request.

Term “scheme” is used as a synonym to the term  “mechanism” in this regard.  There exist several mechanisms that support CERTs and their common processes. They can describe  how to set up the CERT and its daily life; the services teams provide; or the way they cooperate.  These CERT mechanisms vary depending on the maturity level of the CERTs concerned.  In this document we first provide an overview of the organisations behind these mechanisms and  the sort of criteria used to describe the maturity level of a CERT (section 2). Then we present a three- tier model of CERTs’ maturity specifically developed for this project (section 3), with the respective  tiers Fundamental, Baseline and Advanced. The individual CERT mechanisms of various CERT  organisations are attached to these respective tiers. In section 4 we identify the commonalities and  differences among the mechanisms within the three maturity tiers. In section 5 we provide some  recommendations for areas considered suitable for harmonisation efforts.  It should be stressed here that the document does not aim to provide any kind of rating of the  mechanisms, but rather to show what is currently in use by CERTs and which areas of these  mechanisms could be improved (harmonised).  1.2 Methodology  Extensive desk research was conducted to prepare this document, using mostly publicly available  sources linked to CERT mechanisms, CERT organisations and CERT communities. The sources are  always referenced in the text. A concise survey was also launched to gather stakeholders’ views on  the need for harmonisation of CERT schemes. Sixteen teams, mostly national/ governmental CERTs,  provided replies to the survey. The survey focused on the capabilities schemes followed by CERTs,  the need to harmonise these them and identify new areas for harmonisation.  1  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/baseline-capabilities  2  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  Page 2  2 How do you assess a CERT's maturity?  A number of organisations,3 both in Europe and internationally, provide different mechanisms for  supporting and advancing CERT capabilities and therefore their maturity. These CERT community  organisations provide useful insights into the operations of CERTs and their cooperative efforts, as  well as the policies, procedures and tools used by different teams. As CERTs continue to develop  their capabilities and become more accepted by their constituents, they also cooperate more often  with other CERTs both in their home countries and internationally and look to gain recognition from  more partners. The maturation of CERTs and their use of different CERT mechanisms mean that  there is a greater need to explore whether harmonisation between them may be beneficial, and  which areas could potentially be harmonised.  This section of the report provides an overview of a number of mechanisms used frequently by  CERTs, which deal with and consider CERT capabilities. The mechanisms that have been introduced  vary in their objectives and means of achieving these objectives, and are thus used in different ways  by CERTs.  2.1 Which organisations support CERTs and promote their maturity?  CERTs can look to a number of organisations for suitable mechanisms and good practices. These  mechanisms range from being global in scope (e.g. FIRST) to regional (e.g. APCERT) or to more  service-specific oriented (e.g. ISO 27035). As discussed later in this report, these organisations  provide mechanisms and good practices for CERTs at various points in the CERT maturation process.  ENISA surveyed the European CERT community and asked them which mechanisms they follow.  Many of the respondents report following several different CERT capabilities mechanisms, with  Trusted Introducer (TI) and FIRST being named most often.  3  As used in this document, the term ‘organisation’ or ‘CERT-type organisation’‚ means any type of organisation,  association, gathering or institution whose aim is to provide a platform of cooperation among CERTs and/or provide  standards, guidance or good practices for their activities.  Page 3  Number of answers =16 (respondents had the option to choose more than one scheme)  Source: Survey conducted by ENISA to provide input into this document  2.1.1 ENISA  ENISA was established in 2004 to improve network and information security in the European Union  (EU). It was intended to be the EU's response to the emergence of cyber-security as a significant  issue impacting EU Member States and businesses. ENISA serves both EU institutions and Member  States, including public and private organisations.  In June 2013, the EU granted ENISA a further seven-year mandate with an expanded set of duties.4  In addition to enshrining ENISA's achievements in areas such as helping EU Member States set up  CERTs and provide cyber-security exercises, the new mandate:   Provides ENISA with instruments to support the fight against cybercrime based on  prevention and detection in cooperation with Europol's European Cybercrime Center;   Gives ENISA responsibility for supporting the development of EU cyber-security policy and  legislation;   Looks to ENISA to support research, development, and standardisation;   Charges ENISA with supporting the prevention, detection of, and response to cross-border  cyber-threats; and   Aligns ENISA more closely with the EU regulatory process for providing EU countries and  institutions with assistance and advice on cyber-security issues.  ENISA describes its role with regard to CERTs in Europe as a facilitator and information knowledge  broker rather than having an operational role. As the EU ‘expert body’ on CERTs, ENISA must remain  updated about key issues impacting CERTs, and establish and maintain contacts with important  global players in the CERT field, including those profiled in this report. ENISA also distributes good  4  Regulation (EU) No. 526/2013, available at http://www.enisa.europa.eu/media/press-releases/new- regulation-for-eu-cybersecurity-agency-enisa-with-new-duties  10  8  5  2 2 2  1  0  2  4  6  8  10  12  FIRST TI (Accredited)  RFC 2350 ENISA (Baseline  Capabilities)  TI (Certified) TI (Listed) ISO 27035  Which CERT mechanism do you follow?

One of ENISA's priorities is to help EU Member States establish national/ governmental (n/g) CERTs  and support these teams’ efforts to reach a baseline level of capabilities as they mature. In addition  to the baseline mechanism, ENISA further supports CERTs’ efforts to enhance their capabilities by  providing, for example, tailored training.  ENISA originally published baseline capabilities documents for CERTs in 2009. The technical aspects  of these reports were extended by policy recommendations to n/g CERTs in 20105 as to the four  baseline capabilities that they should have. The latest update of the baseline capabilities  recommendations was completed in 2012.6  ENISA also regularly publishes a CERT Inventory map and an Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe  document. Both are updated twice a year and largely correspond to the Trusted Introducer database  of listed teams.7  In 2013 ENISA introduced its training courses for CERTs in the EU Member States. This is a new  initiative to promote and support CERT maturity in the MS by having exercises and technical hands- on training on different services, operations and cooperation in daily work of the teams.8  2.1.2 TF-CSIRT Trusted Introducer  TF-CSIRT Trusted Introducer (TF-CSIRT/TI)9 is the new name for the integrated TF-CSIRT and Trusted  Introducer operations under the Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association  (TERENA10) structure. It is an example of a CERT membership organisation that focuses on a  particular region. The Task Force for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (TF-CSIRT) was  established in 2000 and has evolved into a much-used forum by various CERTs for discussion of  experiences and knowledge. The Trusted Introducer (TI) service was spun off from TF-CSIRT in 2001  and has become a widely known accreditation and listing service in the CERT community.11  TF-CSIRT was historically open to any interested CERT in Europe, but more recently has adopted the  membership structure used by TI as part of formal incorporation of TI with TF-CSIRT. TF-CSIRT  describes itself as ‘a task force that promotes collaboration and coordination between CSIRTs in  Europe and neighbouring regions, whilst liaising with relevant organisations at the global level in  other regions’.12  TI describes itself as ‘the trusted backbone of the Security and Incident Response team community in  Europe’, and serves as the ‘listing, accreditation and certification service’ of TF-CSIRT. Trusted  Introducer provides two main services: (1) it keeps a list of all known European CERTs and (2) offers  accreditation and certification services to CERTs. The idea behind TI's accreditation services – as well  as its listing and certification services – is that these services help build up trust in the CERT  community in Europe. Essentially, TI's stamp of approval allows other parties to assume with  5  ENISA, Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs (2009, 2010)  6  ENISA, Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report (2012); ENISA,  Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Updated Recommendations (2012)  7  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv/files/inventory-of-cert-activities-in-europe  8  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  9  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/  10  http://www.terena.org/  11  TERENA, Proposal for Restructuring TF-CSIRT and the Trust Introducer Service (December 2011)  12  See TERENA website at www.terena.org  Page 5  confidence that a CERT has reached a certain level of maturity and functionality, which is important  to building trust throughout the CERT community.13  TF-CSIRT/TI offers three different mechanisms to European CERT: registration (listing), accreditation,  and certification. Registration with TF-CSIRT/TI is a relatively simple process, while accreditation is  more complex and certification even more so. Certification requires that a CERT meet a number of  requirements laid out in the Security Incident Management Maturity Model published by TI.14  2.1.3 FIRST  The Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) was founded in 1990 as a worldwide  network of individual computer security incident response teams that cooperate voluntarily to  improve their abilities to deal with and prevent computer security problems. FIRST is a membership  organisation that is governed by an Operational Framework, and each member must designate a  primary and alternate representative to FIRST.  Participants in FIRST are part of a network of CERTs that work together voluntarily to deal with  computer security problems and their prevention.  FIRST distinguishes between two types of participants:   Full members represent organisations assisting defined constituencies in preventing and  handling computer security-related incidents.   Liaison members are individuals or representatives of organisations other than CERTs that  have a legitimate interest in and value to FIRST.15  2.1.4 The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open community of network designers, operators,  vendors and researchers focused on the evolution of Internet architecture. IETF is divided into  working groups based on topic area.16 IETF published the RFC-2350 document, which is a detailed  overview of the policies that it recommends a CERT pursues and the services that it is expected to  offer. Although published in 1998 and last updated in 2003, RFC-2350 still enjoys widespread use as  a reference document for CERT capabilities. RFC-2350 is an important document in the CERT  community because a large number of CERTs use it as a template for the self-assessment.17The TI  accredited and certified CERTs have adopted the RFC2350 as a basic requirement to fulfill.  2.1.5 CERT/CC  CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) is not a membership organisation in the same sense as FIRST or  TF-CSIRT/TI, but it is still an influential organisation in the CERT community. CERT/CC was created in  1988 in response to the Morris worm incident,18 and is hosted by Carnegie Mellon University within  the Software Engineering Institute. This organisation actually established the first CERT in the world.  13  See https://www.trusted-introducer.org/index.html  14  See https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/overview.html  15  See http://www.first.org/about  16  See http://www.ietf.org/about/  17  IETF, RFC-2350: Expectations for Computer Security Incident Response, available at  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2350.txt  18  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm  Page 6  Under its charter, CERT/CC works with the Internet community in detecting and resolving computer  security incidents by (1) providing a reliable, trusted, 24-hour, single point of contact for  emergencies; (2) facilitating communication among experts; (3) serving as a central point for  identifying and correcting computer system vulnerabilities; (4) maintaining close ties with research  activities; and (5) being proactive in raising awareness about computer security issues. It is also  involved in efforts to create standards in the CERT area, and has published open source tools for  activities that include vulnerability assessment, network traffic analysis, and facilitating digital  investigations.19  2.1.6 APCERT  The Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) is an example of a CERT  membership organisation that focuses on a particular region. According to APCERT, its purpose ‘is to  encourage and support coordination’ among CERT organisations in the Asia-Pacific region. By doing  this, it believes that it can ‘improve the region's awareness and competency’ with regard to  computer incident response.20  APCERT is open to all CERTs in the Asia-Pacific region that meet its qualification criteria. APCERT  members must also agree to support its objectives, respect information handling procedures, and, as  much as possible, provide assistance to other APCERT members.21  2.1.7 International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO)  The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) is a non-governmental organisation that is  made up of members from the national standards bodies of 163 countries. The ISO publishes  standards developed by panels of experts on technical committees.22 In 2011, ISO published a  consensus-based standards document with its own guidelines for security incident management for  large and medium-sized organisations. This publication, which is known as ISO 27035, purports to  provide ‘a structured and planned approach’ to issues such as (1) detecting, reporting, and assessing  information security incidents; (2) responding to and managing information security incidents; (3)  detecting, assessing, and managing information security vulnerabilities; and (4) continuously  improving information security and incident management as a result of managing information  security incidents and vulnerabilities. ISO 27035 also provides guidance for external organisations  providing information security incident management services.23  2.1.8 Other organisations  There are other organisations than the ones already discussed that have potentially suitable  mechanisms. For example, many corporations have internal CERT capabilities that allow them to  respond to incidents involving their products or services. These corporate-based mechanisms will  often target the corporation's employees, business partners and internal lines of business.24  A different example is the European Government CERT Group (EGC Group),25 an informal association  of more mature governmental CERTs in Europe. EGC Group members cooperate effectively on  matters of incident response while building upon mutual trust and understanding due to similarities  19  http://www.cert.org/meet_cert/  20  http://www.apcert.org/about/mission/index.html  21  See Instructions for joining AP-CERT, available at http://www.apcert.org/application/index.html  22  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm  23  See http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44379  24  See for example http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/emergency.x?i=56  25  http://www.egc-group.org/index.html  Page 7  in constituencies and problem sets. EGC Group has a technical focus. EGC teams are usually  members of FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI.  2.2  Maturity assessment criteria  The CERT community organisations discussed above provide a number of different mechanisms for  CERTs to use or to be part of. This section introduces the most important categories and topics that  pertain to these mechanisms and provides the foundation for identifying commonalities and  differences between them.  2.2.1 Type of approach (organisation model)  The approach adopted by a CERT community organisation is fundamental to its mechanism(s) and to  how it interacts with CERTs. An organisation's approach is an important determinant of the  relationships that it establishes with CERTs and the services that it provides. Organisations surveyed  for this report employ several different approaches to how they interact with CERTs:  Type of  organisation  Characteristics of the mechanism  Voluntary (good  practice and  recommendations)  The organisation is set up in a way that allows CERTs to participate in its  processes and events, but it does not have a formal membership process.  The organisation's focus is on providing good practices and  recommendations, rather than providing confirmation of a CERT's capabilities  or other services.  Subscribe  (Membership and  accreditation)  The organisation admits members through a formalised process. Its agenda  and activities are driven by its status as a membership organisation.  Membership in itself provides value through the receipt of member-only  services, as well as through processes such as accreditation.  Compulsory  (Standards)  The organisation has formal authority to require compliance with its  mechanism(s) and often exists for the purpose of disseminating standards.  Thus far, this approach has not been the norm for CERT community  organisations, but the approach may be used more often as efforts are made  to harmonise approaches and ensure that good practices are followed and  the same level of capabilities is achieved.  The approach that these organisations employ provides information about matters such as:   How an organisation interacts with CERTs, both members and non-members   What member or associated CERTs can expect from an organisation   What role an organisation envisions itself playing in the broader CERT community   How an organisation sees itself growing and evolving over time   Where an organisation can obtain operational and substantive input   How an organisation secures funding.  2.2.2 Requirements for CERTs  A given organisation’s mechanism may impose requirements on CERTs seeking to utilise the  mechanism or to associate with the organisation. Such requirements tend to reflect whether and to  what extent the organisation in question wants to limit its involvement and whether it wants its  Page 8  members to have similar capabilities and processes. Such organisations must also consider whether  or not stringent requirements would deter otherwise strong partner or member CERTs from seeking  involvement.  An organisation must also decide which specific requirements it will impose on CERTs in its  mechanisms. Various approaches are open to an organisation in terms of implementing such  requirements:   Creating its own unique list of requirements that it expects a partner or member to meet   Using an existing good practices guide for CERTs and requiring that a partner or member  meet either all of these practices or a certain percentage of them   Leaving the decision about cooperation with or involvement for a CERT to its existing  members, and allowing them to decide by vote on whether the CERT meets its standards. It  is up to the potential member (and possibly to its sponsors, which are already members of  the respective organisation) to demonstrate to other members that the applicant CERT  fulfils membership requirements.  2.2.3 Validation process  Organisations with membership requirements need a process by which to ensure these are met. For  example, once a CERT becomes a member, it becomes more challenging for the organisation to  backtrack and exert any control over the CERT.  An organisation can use different mechanisms to ensure that a CERT fulfils its requirements. There is  usually some sort of initial phase where a CERT provides the organisation with baseline information  about itself and its capabilities. This can then be checked against publicly available information  about the CERT, or potentially by asking existing CERT members of the organisation to evaluate  whether the applicant CERT meets the requirements.  The organisation has to decide whether it will put in place additional, more thorough means of  validating a CERT's capabilities. This could include requiring more proactive input from the applicant  CERT, including presenting its capabilities at a meeting of the organisation. Alternatively, on-site  visits to the CERT are another way to measure capabilities and resources, although this involves  more expense. There is also a distinction between processes where validation takes place at one  point in time (e.g. FIRST) or whether it is a continuing process (e.g. TI accredited/certified).  2.2.4 CERTs’ focus: type and region  The organisation also determines which types of parties it wants as members or users of its services.  There are advantages in having members with similar patterns or goals, both of which can be  influenced by factors such as geography or type of the constituency.  When it comes to the type of the CERT, there are a number of identified sectors that an organisation  could focus on. For a non-comprehensive list see the table below.  Page 9  CERT Types: Sector26  National / Governmental  Governmental  National  De facto national  Research and education  Governmental / Military  Service provider/ISP customer base  Non-commercial organisation  ICT vendor customer base  Commercial organisation  Financial sector  Energy sector  Industrial sector  Other...  This can either be done at an abstract level – e.g., academic or commercial CERTs – or through a  more concrete association with a corporation. This type of organisational limitation means that  CERTs seeking membership or association will tend to share common business models, concerns  about cyber-security, use of same technologies, and can be expected to have and use good practices  that apply across the specific constituency base. In terms of geography, CERT organisations can  either be open or be limited to specific geographic areas.  Limitations based on geography most often are set at a regional or country level, but could also be  set for a specific region or even a city within a country. Covering a specific geographic area enables a  CERT organisation to have member CERTs and constituents who share similar constituencies, have  the same legal code or agreed legal framework (e.g., EU Directives) or face common cultural and  linguistic challenges, and similar patterns of interactions with their governments. It may also  facilitate very important face-to-face meetings.  26  Updated ENISA list of CERTs available at: http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/background/inv/certs- by-country-interactive-map  Page 10  2.2.5 Benefits and added value of a mechanism  A mechanism has to offer value to its CERT members or the CERTs that utilise it. This value can take a  number of forms:  Benefit/Value What it means  Affirmation Value comes from organisation's/ mechanism’s ability to provide trusted,  independent, third-party confirmation of a CERT's capabilities.  Contractual  Requirements  Value comes from organisation's/ mechanism’s ability to provide  certification of a CERT's capabilities that it needs for contractual or  regulatory reasons.  Recognition Value comes from the desire by the CERT to be recognised for the status it  has achieved and the fact that the mechanism can provide this recognition  widely.  Good practices Value comes from good practices that these organisations/ mechanisms  can provide based on their strong platforms, visibility and recognition.  Services Value comes from specific services that the organisation provides.  Networking Value comes from the opportunity these organisations can offer their  members to network with other CERTs and players.  Growth opportunities  (Maturity)  Value comes from these organisations offering CERTs the chance to grow  their teams through training and other exercises, or by helping them  establish clear goals for developing their teams.  2.2.6 Definitions and terminology  The definitions and terminology that are used are important within the mechanisms. Precise  definitions are often needed to make clear issues that are at the heart of CERTs' missions. These  definitions lay the foundation for the capabilities that CERTs will provide and how they will  otherwise conduct their business.  It is also important that organisations provide an overview of the types of specific definitions and  terminology that CERTs are expected to follow. These need not always be defined as tightly as some  other foundational terms, but they will often be at the heart of what a CERT does, and thus it is  important that expectations be stated clearly for it in this regard (e.g. n/g CERT definitions and  terminology put forward by ENISA or TF-CSIRT/TI).  2.2.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  An organisation's mechanism needs to be updated once it is put in place, which in turn requires that  a number of decisions are taken. One such decision is whether updates will be considered on a  regular basis at a defined time, or on an ad-hoc basis. This will influence how an organisation  considers changes and the likelihood of such changes being adopted.  Another question is how mechanisms will be updated. This relates to topics such as how potential  changes will be brought up for consideration, which bodies or individuals will consider and make  decisions about changes, what the standards for adopting updates or changes are, and how  Page 11  information about updates or changes will be disseminated to members or other CERTs associated  with the organisation.  An organisation also has to decide how much input CERT teams will have in developing and updating  their capability mechanism. The advantage of giving CERTs input is that the capability mechanism is  then more likely to reflect the issues CERTs see as important, and will also increase the odds that  they will accept and follow the mechanism. On the other hand, opening up an organisation's  mechanism broadly to input from CERTs risks moving the organisation away from its core focus and  could lead to disagreement between members.  2.2.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  CERT community organisations promote and advertise their capability mechanisms to different  extents. For some of them, promoting their mechanism is fundamental to their existence (e.g.  FIRST): their capability has to resonate within the CERT community, or there is really no reason for a  CERT to try to become a member of an organisation or associate with it. On the other hand, creators  of other mechanisms discussed in this report are less concerned with promoting their mechanism,  and may be satisfied with just creating a mechanism and then letting CERTs decide whether they  want to use it or adopt it (e.g. ISO model, RFC2350). CERTs and other stakeholders can also be  important disseminators of information about a particular capabilities mechanism, although their  willingness to engage in promotion will probably depend on their connections to the mechanism and  the extent to which they use the mechanism.  Organisations can follow two primary approaches in promoting themselves and their mechanisms.  First, they can do it themselves. This requires that they devote the necessary resources and establish  the right connections in the media to distribute information about their capabilities. Second,  organisations can rely on their CERT members, stakeholders, and other bodies in the area of cyber- security to promote their mechanism. This can be more effective than self-promotion and costs less,  but it is also riskier. This requires that an organisation have the right lines of communication open  with key stakeholders and other parties and make the effort to track its publicity from these types of  third parties.  Training programmes and exercises are also a core element of what some organisations do, and  training is an area where clear demand exists from CERTs and other players in the CERT arena. Both  CERTs and their constituents will rely on training offered by organisations as well as conferences and  other educational programmes that CERT organisations offer.  Organisations thus have to make decisions about the types of training they will offer, who they will  offer this training to, and the extent to which their membership bases or constituencies will drive  the content of the training that they offer. Given often limited resources, this may present a  challenge to some organisations and CERT teams, but the importance of these member and  constituent services mean that they cannot be overlooked.  Page 12  3 CERT Maturity Model  A CERT's development occurs broadly as a three-stage progression in which it moves from being  established to achieving a complete set of capabilities and stability within its community. At each  stage of this progression, mechanisms from CERT community organisations can provide guidance  and support to CERTs with regard to the assessment categories discussed in section 2.2 of this  document.  For the purpose of this document we applied a three-tier maturity model, which is based on the  ongoing work of the FIRST Education Committee.27 Individual mechanisms of CERT organisations are  attached to the three tiers with basic pre-defined characteristics. The mechanisms of the three Tiers  are then further explored in section 4 using a set of eight criteria.  CERT MATURITY MODEL  Summary Characteristics Organisation / Mechanisms  Tier 1 Fundamental  (Essential,  indispensable)  CERT is being established  and trying to earn  recognition in the CERT  community (based on  individual trust building).  ENISA: A Step-by-Step Approach on How to  Set up a CSIRT (2006)  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for National /  Governmental CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  ENISA: Map of CERTs and Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005, constantly  updated)  RARE CERT Task Force28: Guide to Setting up  a CERT (1993)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ status  Tier 2 Baseline (Steady,  Sure-Footed)  CERT has baseline  capabilities (operations)  in place and its team  representative gained  trust among the CERT  community.

These  capabilities are all  documented.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  Page 14  4 CERT mechanisms under the spotlight  This section provides a more detailed overview of the mechanisms that organisations offer to CERTs  in each of the three tiers (as described above in the CERT Maturity Model). This overview in the form  of tables should not be considered as a ranking of mechanisms as they are very different in nature.  For example, some of them are membership-based, while others take the form of guidelines and/or  recommendations for interested CERTs to follow. ENISA has identified the following eight categories  for the analysis of the individual mechanisms.  Assessment Categories  (1) Type of approach (organisation)  (2) Requirements for CERTs  (3) Validation process  (4) CERTs’ focus: type and region  (5) Benefits and added value of the mechanism  (6) Definitions and terminology  (7) Keeping the mechanism up to date  (8) Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  4.1 Tier 1 of the CERT Maturity Model  CERTs that are currently in Tier 1 are in the process of being established and gaining initial  recognition in the CERT community. CERT community organisations’ mechanisms can thus provide  Tier 1 CERTs with valuable guidance in terms of getting set up, establishing fundamental operations,  and helping to earn initial recognition within the CERT community.  The following mechanisms identified for Tier 1 were considered also for the analysis of  commonalities and differences of CERT mechanisms:   ENISA: A Step-by-Step Approach on How to Set up a CSIRT (2006)   ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs – operational aspects (2009)   ENISA: Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe – CERT Inventory Map (2005)   RARE CERT Task Force: Guide to Setting up a CERT (1993)   TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ status  4.1.1 Type of approach (organisation)  The five mechanisms identified for Tier 1 rely on fundamentally different organisational approaches.  Most importantly, ENISA do not use membership approaches at this level, while TF-CSIRT/TI is a  membership-based organisation. In addition, ENISA seeks to provide capabilities mechanisms to  CERTs even without a formal membership structure. That said, ENISA was established by the  European Union (EU) to improve network and information security in the EU, and takes a proactive  stance in serving as a facilitator and information broker for CERTs in EU Member States. Meanwhile,  TF-CSIRT/TI's mechanism is membership-based even at the Tier 1 level, although the criteria that a  Page 15  CERT must meet to obtain the ‘Listed’ status with TF-CSIRT/TI are less exacting at the earliest stage  than they become as the CERT’s maturity level increases.29 All of these mechanisms are provided on  a non-profit and voluntary basis.  Tier 1 Mechanism Type of approach (organisation) Voluntary/ subscribe /  compulsory form  ENISA: A Step-by- Step Approach on  How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This is universal step-by step-guidance on  how to set up a CSIRT. The target groups are  governmental as well as other institutions  that decide to set up a CERT to protect their  own infrastructure or that of their  stakeholders.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  ENISA: Baseline  Capabilities for  National/  Governmental  CERTs – operational  aspects (2009)  This mechanism was defined in 2009 for  newly established n/g CERTs to help them  understand and focus on a basic set of  capabilities so as to facilitate efficient and  effective incident response and  collaboration.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  ENISA: Inventory of  CERT Activities in  Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism was developed by ENISA in  2005 and gives the newly established team  an opportunity to gain recognition among  teams in Europe and other stakeholders  ENISA with which closely cooperates.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  RARE CERT Task  Force: Guide to  Setting up a CERT  (1993)  This mechanism was created in 1993 by the  CERT Task Force to ‘offer guidance to  networking organisations who wish to set up  CERTs’ and thus takes a voluntary approach.  Voluntary (good practices and  recommendations)  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’  Status  TF-CSIRT/TI is a formal membership  organisation open to all recognised CERTs  situated in Europe, while CERTs seeking to  achieve ‘listed’ status with TF-CSIRT/TI must  meet baseline requirements.  Voluntary (after meeting pre- defined requirements/criteria  offers the ‘listed’ status)  4.1.2 Requirements for CERTs  Because ENISA is not a membership organisation, it generally does not place requirements on CERTs  seeking to utilise its mechanisms, although ENISA's Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe is based  closely on TI database updates. On the other hand, TF-CSIRT/TI offers three levels of membership  classes, with the first level – Listing – being most applicable to Tier 1 CERTs. TF-CSIRT/TI allows any  organisation that has implemented a security or incident response capability or which provides  incident management services to register with it for listing. TF-CSIRT/TI does not further define this  29  Information from ENISA, CERT/CC, and TI homepages or reports  Page 16  requirement, which suggests a relatively low bar for CERTs wanting to achieve listed status under its  mechanism.30  Tier 1 Mechanism Requirements for CERTs  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it. Even though ENISA’s focus is on CERTs in Europe, this  guidance has proved its usability far behind the European borders.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism lists CERT teams in Europe, and tries to ‘give a  profile of the situation concerning CERT teams and their activities in  Europe.’ ENISA's inventory listing is largely based on TI  membership.  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism requires that an applicant for seeking ‘listed’ status  have implemented a security or incident response capability or  provide incident management services.  4.1.3 Validation process  ENISA does not have formal mechanisms for evaluating CERTs' capabilities. In 2012 ENISA carried out  follow-up assessments of whether n/g CERTs in Member States are following its baseline  recommendations, based on a survey of these organisations and desk research. TF-CSIRT/TI has a  validation process in place for its initial stage of membership: it requires that an applicant for listing  have the support of at least two existing members and notes that ‘if there is no support (for the  candidate) – or if there are even objections – the candidate will not be accepted’.31  Tier 1 Mechanism Validation process  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  There is no validation process associated with use of this  mechanism.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  There is no validation process associated with use of this  mechanism.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  This inventory of CERTs is updated based on discussions with CERT  teams and the latest CERT team updates on Trusted Introducer's  30  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/registration.html  31  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/registration.html  Page 17  constantly updated)  website, although other sources such as FIRST and TF-CSIRT are also  considered.  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  There is no validation process associated with the use of this  mechanism.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism requires an applicant for listing to have the support  of at least two existing members (accredited teams only) and notes  that if the candidate has no support or if any objections to the  candidate are raised, the candidate will not be accepted.  4.1.4 CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA's mandate makes clear that its focus is on CERTs in EU Member States, especially n/g CERTs,  and its revised mandate has provided it with an even broader purview in the area of cyber-security  in Europe. While ENISA works intensively with CERTs in EU Member States as they are set up or as  they extend their capabilities, it also publishes significant amounts of information about these topics  that could be useful for CERTs in similar positions anywhere. TF-CSIRT/TI describes itself as ‘the  trusted backbone of the security and incident response team community in Europe’, making clear  that its activities are also focused on Europe. This includes organisations and teams that work on a  global level or have a stake in Europe.  Tier 1 Mechanism CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  all types of CERTs/Europe  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  n/g CERTs in EU Member States  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  all types of CERTs/Europe  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  all types of CERTs  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status all types of CERTs/Europe  4.1.5 Benefits and added value of the mechanism  Organisations with useful mechanisms for Tier 1 CERTs offer varied benefits and value to CERTs.  ENISA's work in helping CERTs get off the ground is in line with its broader goal of ‘assisting EU  Member States in implementing relevant EU legislation and working to improve the resilience of  Europe's critical infrastructure and networks’.32 Thus, the value that CERTs take from ENISA is  32  ENISA, Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report (2012) at p. 3.  Page 18  through good practices and other advice on how to establish themselves and improve their  capabilities. It also enables EU Member States to gain assurance of compliance with relevant  communications of the EU Commission and recommendations of other EU institutions.  At this stage of a CERT's development, RARE CERT Task Force provides value to CERTs largely  through its good practices related to establishing a CERT, including topics such as defining a  constituency and developing a mission statement. TF-CSIRT/TI's value is slightly more diverse: it  offers baseline recognition of a CERT's capabilities, along with the promise of potentially greater  recognition as the CERT develops.  Tier 1 Mechanism Added value of the mechanism  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism provides value through good practices to its target  audience. It is very useful when building a CERT from scratch as it  lists all the steps necessary in the process of setting up a CERT.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism provides value through good practices to its target  audience. It enables the n/g CERTs in the EU to take part in  modification of this mechanism based on their experience and  needs. ENISA offers various platforms for the engagement of n/g  CERTs including CERT workshop and stocktaking reports. Additional  added value of the mechanism is that Member States establishing  n/g CERTs gain assurance of compliance with respective  communications and recommendations of the EU Commission and  other EU institutions.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism offers value to CERTs listed by validating their  position as publicly listed CERTs, and through the information it  offers about CERTs in Europe and international CERT initiatives (a  very comprehensive and publicly available list of all kinds of CERTs).  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism provides value through good practice to its target  audience.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism offers baseline recognition of a CERT's capabilities,  along with the promise of greater potential recognition as the CERT  develops, as well as a CERT starter kit through TF-CSIRT. The  information on the teams is accessible via web, while detailed  information including contacts and access to operational services  are reserved for the members.  4.1.6 Definitions and terminology  The organisations that actively support Tier 1 CERTs offer definitions of key CERT terms which differ  slightly. Their definitions are similar in key ways, such as that they all mention operational  capabilities like incident response service and assume that a CERT will provide these services to a  defined constituency. ENISA specifies that a CERT's ‘main business is to respond to computer  security incidents’.33 Meanwhile, RARE CERT Task Force defines a CSIRT/CERT as an organisation that  receives, reviews and responds to computer security incident reports and activity.  33  ENISA, A Step-by-Step Approach on How to Set up a CSIRT, at p. 7.  Page 19  These organisations also have similar core conceptualisations of what a CERT's constituency is: in  essence, that a CERT must have a defined ‘customer base’ that it serves. Beyond this similarity,  though, there are differences. ENISA takes a broad purview on this potential customer base, which is  in line with its focus on n/g CERTs, but focuses on choosing the right communication channels for  reaching constituents.34 TI's form for new registration candidates does not define constituency but  requires applicants to describe their constituency ‘based on a description of Internet Domains, IP  Address Information and/or other suitable characterization of the constituency’.35 Similarly, all  organisations give examples of CERT types, while ENISA’s Inventory of CERT Activities in Europe is the  most comprehensive in this respect.  Tier 1  Mechanism  Definitions and terminology  CERT/CSIRT  definition  Constituency definition CERT type categories and definitions  ENISA: A Step- by-Step  Approach on  How to Set Up  a CSIRT (2006)  CSIRT: ‘a team of  IT security  experts whose  main business is  to respond to  computer  security  incidents’  Constituency: ‘the  customer base of a  CSIRT’, definitions for  the constituencies of  various CERT categories  also included (see the  next column in this  table)  These sectors are listed (in alphabetical  order) with definitions included (pages  8–10):   Academic   Commercial   CIP/CIIP Sector   Governmental Sector   Internal   Military Sector   National   Small & Medium  Enterprises (SME)   Vendor  ENISA:  Baseline  Capabilities for  National /  Governmental  CERTs –  operational  aspects (2009)  CERT: ‘a team of  IT security  experts whose  main business is  to respond to  computer  security  incidents’36  Constituency: ‘an  established term for  the customer base (of a  CERT)’  The mechanism defines main CERT  categories of its focus:   national   de facto national   governmental   national/governmental  Besides, other CERT categories are  mentioned (academia, companies, or  military) with regard to various  constituencies without any further  definition.

The same applies here  as regards  constituency, which is  ‘based on a description  of Internet Domains, IP  Address Information  and/or other suitable  characteristics’  The mechanism lists the following CERT  categories (relevant also for  constituencies):   ISP Customer Base   Service Customer Base   Vendor Customer Base   Commercial Organisation   Financial Sector   Government   Military   Non-Commercial  Organisation   Research & Education  Page 21  Network  There are brief specifications of some  of these CERT categories.  4.1.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  None of these organisations specify how they keep their mechanisms updated. ENISA has stated that  its work in this area ‘should be considered only as a first step towards the specification of  requirements, which is an ongoing process that has and will involve discussions with the relevant  stakeholders in the Member States’.37 TI's mechanism is about recognising a CERT's status and the  development of TI mechanism is described in details under service governance section of the TI  contact description38.  Tier 1 Mechanism Keeping the mechanism up to date  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date, although ENISA generally considers its good practices to be  works in progress.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date, although ENISA generally considers its good practices to be  works in progress.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  This mechanism notes that ‘to be really useful in the future, this  document has to be updated: obsolete information will have to be  deleted; information about new teams and activities will have to be  validated and added’ (pp. 42–43). It therefore requests that  changes, mistakes, or additions be provided to ENISA. The CERT  inventory is updated twice a year on a regular basis in Q2 and Q4.  There is also a possibility for an ad-hoc update based on a team’s  request.  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status In the section 9 of the ToR 2012, it is stated that requirements for  this status are defined by the Review Board and also could be  changed by the TI Community.39  4.1.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  These organisations take different views on topics such as promoting their mechanisms and training  CERTs in Tier 1 of the Maturity Model. ENISA holds an annual ‘CERTs in Europe’ workshop where  37  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/baseline-capabilities-for-national-governmental- certs(p. 5)  38  https://www.trusted-introducer.org/contact.html  39  http://www.terena.org/activities/tf-csirt/publications/ToR-2012.pdf  Page 22  experiences, good practices and ‘TLP red40 discussion’ are shared, and where ENISA updates CERTs  about its efforts.41 ENISA is also active on the training front, and considers training and exercising  CERTs to be one of its core missions.42 It offers training programmes and workshops for CERTs at  different developmental stages, including those being established or introduced to their  constituents. ENISA continuously supports the TRANSITS training programme.43  TF-CSIRT/TI is also proactive when it comes to promoting their mechanisms. The TI service provider  is tasked, by service specification and Steering Committee, to actively look out for potential listing  candidates. They monitor the FIRST memberships and follow up with suggestions from fellow teams.  When it comes to training, TF-CSIRT/TI is involved in the provision of TRANSIT I training courses  popular within the CERT community. On 30 July 2013 TF-CSIRT/TI (via TERENA) and FIRST signed a  Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding the use and promotion of TRANSITS I security  training materials worldwide.44  Tier 1 Mechanism Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ENISA: A Step-by-Step  Approach on How to Set Up a  CSIRT (2006)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion. In  terms of training, it lists TRANSITS and CERT/CC courses as the two  main sources for dedicated training that CERTs should use.  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – operational aspects  (2009)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion or with  regard to training. But it does refer to training in general terms  under the guidelines.  ENISA: Inventory of CERT  Activities in Europe (2005,  constantly updated)  Promotion is carried out by means of ENISA’s main activities as a  broker between different Network and Information Security  communities (events, presentations, etc.)  RARE CERT Task Force: Guide  to Setting up a CERT (1993)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Listed’ Status This mechanism offers training courses for new and experienced  personnel through TRANSITS I, which are organised by TERENA and  regularly supported by ENISA. There are no specific provisions for  promoting the mechanism, although there are regular open  meetings (held three times a year) with the right to access for  Listed teams.  40  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_Light_Protocol  41  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-I  42  Extensive online training and exercise material is available at  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise.  43  See for example the 2013 ENISA Work Programme:  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes- reports/work-programme-2013.  44  http://www.terena.org/news/fullstory.php?news_id=3465  Page 23  4.2 Tier 2 of the CERT Maturity Model  CERTs that fall in Tier 2 of the CERT Maturity Model have established themselves in terms of having  baseline operational capabilities and a cooperative relationship within the CERT community. The  team representative enjoys trust in the wider CERT community. Thus, these CERTs will look to  community CERT organisations for affirmation of their existing capabilities as well as good practices  for further developing their capabilities and deepening their relationships with their constituents  and communities.  The following mechanisms are recognised for Tier 2 CERTs and were considered for the analysis of  commonalities and differences of CERT mechanisms:   ENISA: Baseline Capabilities for National / Governmental CERTs (2010, 2012)   Internet Engineering Task Force: RFC-2350 (2003 updated)   TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accredited’ status   FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ status   APCERT: ‘Membership’ status   CERT/CC: Handbook for Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) (2003)  4.2.1 Type of approach (organisation)  The six organisations with mechanisms geared towards Tier 2 CERTs have a variety of commonalities  and differences in their approaches. Membership organisations are more prevalent at this level; TF- CSIRT/TI, FIRST and APCERT are all member-based organisations. As discussed previously, ENISA is  not membership based, but exists for the benefit of all CERTs in EU Member States. Meanwhile, the  IETF is an open organisation that focuses on good practices.  FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI are membership-based organisations with relatively formalised processes in  terms of management structure and other internal processes. TF-CSIRT/TI, for example, holds  membership meetings three times per year, with its Review Board ‘overseeing and steering’ TI's  activities. Meanwhile, FIRST has an operational framework that lays out the organisational structure  and basic organisational policies, as well as bylaws that explain formalities such as meetings and the  election of directors. FIRST holds an annual general meeting in accordance with its operational  framework.45 APCERT is also a membership organisation that holds an annual meeting open to all of  its members of any class. At this meeting, APCERT's Steering Committee is elected, which is  responsible for APCERT's general operating policies, procedures, guidelines, and other matters  affecting APCERT as a whole.46  There is a noticeable difference in the approach of CERT community organisations that focus on  CERTs further along in the maturation process than for those just getting started. This tendency  towards member-based structures makes sense, as CERTs which will become members of these  organisations have reached a level of maturity that allows them to provide insight to other CERTs  and help the organisation better serve its members.  45  FIRST Operational Framework, available at http://www.first.org/about/policies/op-framework  46  AP-CERT Operational Framework, available at  http://www.apcert.org/documents/pdf/OPFW_26March2013.pdf  Page 24  Tier 2 Mechanism Type of approach (organisation) Voluntary/ subscribe/  compulsory form  ENISA: Baseline  Capabilities for  National /  Governmental CERTs  (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  This mechanism was defined in 2010 for  newly established n/g CERTs to help them  understand and focus on a basic set of  capabilities so as to facilitate efficient and  effective incident response and  collaboration. It was then updated in  2012 with a review of the baseline set of  capabilities of n/g CERTs in EU MS.  Voluntary (targeted EU policy  recommendations)47  IETF: RFC-2350  (2003 updated)  This mechanism was initially created in  1998 and updated in 2003 as an effort to  ‘express the general Internet  community's expectations’ of CERTs. As  such, it serves as a voluntary mechanism  based on good practices for CERTs.  Voluntary  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Accreditation’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  Subscribe  FIRST: ‘Full  Membership’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  Subscribe  APCERT:  ‘Membership’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  Subscribe  CERT/CC: Handbook  for Computer Security  Incident Response  Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism was created in 1993 to  ‘offer guidance to networking  organisations who wish to set up CERTs’  and thus takes a voluntary approach.  Voluntary/good practice  4.2.2 Requirements for CERTs  As noted, ENISA is not a membership organisation, so it does not issue requirements for CERTs  seeking to associate with it, even though it publishes good practices and recommendations for  CERTs. The IETF is an open organisation without requirements for entities wanting to associate with  it.  47  As stipulated in the Communication of the European Commission entitled ‘A Digital Agenda for Europe’  COM(2010) 245 final, EU Member States should have established a well-functioning network of CERTs at  national level covering all of Europe by 2012: http://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:HTML  Page 25  Unlike the approaches of ENISA, IETF and CERT/CC, the other three organisations analysed in this  section all have requirements for gaining membership.  FIRST does not require that a CERT have specific capabilities to become a member, but it suggests  that a CERT should meet a solid majority of a list of recommended criteria. Uniquely, FIRST requires  that applicants agree to host a site visit from an appointed FIRST team to ‘ensure that the candidate  CSIRT meets all needed requirements to be an active and beneficial member of FIRST’.48  TF-CSIRT/TI allows listed members to then apply for accreditation with it. To gain accredited status, a  CERT is obliged to meet certain requirements, with the RFC-2350 document serving as the basis for  the capabilities that an accredited CERT should have. The applicant CERT must formally apply (which  entails set procedures) and provide information such as a list of the services it provides, its staffing  resources, and policies regarding information handling.49  APCERT requires that operational member candidates meet a number of membership criteria,  ranging from performing CERT functions on a full-time basis to being at least partly government- funded. Candidates must also maintain the confidentiality of information shared with other  members, actively share information with other members, respond to inquiries in a timely manner,  and participate in APCERT activities and initiatives.50  Tier 2 Mechanism Requirements for CERTs  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  This mechanism does not directly impose requirements on CERTs  wishing to adopt its mechanism or otherwise use its good practices  contained in these documents. On the other hand, the  recommendations contained in the document are crucial for  attaining the goal of having a well-established network of n/g CERTs  in Europe by 2012. See footnote 47.  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism outlined in this publication is from an open  organisation – an organisation without requirements for entities  that want to associate with it or to follow the good practices  contained in RFC-2350.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  This mechanism requires CERTs seeking accredited status to meet  certain requirements, with the RFC-2350 document serving as the  basis for reviewing their capabilities. The applying CERT must fill  out an application package and provide information such as a list of  the services it provides, its staffing resources, and policies regarding  information handling  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ This mechanism does not include specific required capabilities for  membership, but provides a list for analysing a CERT's capability  and notes that a CERT should have most of these capabilities. The  mechanism also includes a site visit from an appointed team to  confirm the CERT's capabilities.  48  FIRST Site Visit Requirements and Assessment, available at http://www.first.org/membership/site-visit- V1.0.pdf  49  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/accreditation.html  50  AP-CERT Operational Framework, available at  http://www.apcert.org/documents/pdf/OPFW_26March2013.pdf, at p. 3  Page 26  APCERT: ‘Membership’ This mechanism requires that CERTs seeking Operational Member  status meet a number of membership criteria. Applicants must also  maintain the confidentiality of information, actively share  information with other members, respond to inquiries in a timely  manner, and participate in activities and initiatives of the  mechanism.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism does not place requirements on CERTs intending to  use it.  4.2.3 Validation process  ENISA does not have a formal mechanism for evaluating CERTs, although it monitored in 2012  whether n/g CERTs in EU Member States are following its baseline recommendations.51 Likewise, the  IETF and CERT/CC do not concern themselves with validating the capabilities of CERTs following their  mechanism.  FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI mechanisms both have well-established processes for validating the  capabilities of CERTs applying for their mainstream membership classes. TF-CSIRT/TI requires that an  applicant must prove its capabilities based on the RFC-2350 document to gain membership, and  notes that ‘a team has to provide a useful, but limited, amount of operational information’. The TF- CSIRT/TI accreditation process then focuses on the authenticity, actuality, and correctness of the  information provided, which is done either by personal discussion with a member of a team or  through a cryptographic connection. 52  FIRST requires applicants for full membership to be  nominated by two existing full members of FIRST and to then be approved by a two-thirds vote of its  Steering Committee, as well as be subjected to the site visit discussed above.53 APCERT's validation  process is less clear and it does not explicitly lay out how it enforces the requirements mentioned in  the previous section.  This means that CERTs accepted for membership by these organisations have a certain status within  the broader CERT community and have reached baseline level of capabilities before they are allowed  to become members and associate themselves with these CERT community organisations.  Tier 2 Mechanism Validation process  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  The objective of the updated version of the reports was to measure  the extent to which n/g CERTs in EU Member States have met the  baseline capabilities identified. See the ‘Deployment of baseline  capabilities of national/governmental CERTs – Status Report  2012’.54  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism outlined in this document does not involve  validating the CERT capabilities.  51  ENISA, Deployment of Baseline Capabilities of National / Governmental CERTs: Status Report (2012)  52  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/Template-Invitation-for-Accreditation_v20.pdf  53  http://www.first.org/about/policies/op-framework, under FIRST Participation  54  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/files/status-report-2012  Page 27  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  This mechanism's validation process is based on an applicant  proving its capabilities based on the RFC-2350 document to gain  membership. The mechanism requires that a team demonstrate  the authenticity, actuality and correctness of information it  provides in support of its application (every four months an  accredited team needs to confirm its data or will be asked to do so).  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ This mechanism requires applicants for full membership to be  nominated by two existing full members and to then be approved  by a two-thirds vote of the Steering Committee, as well as meeting  the requirements of the site visit discussed above.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ The documentation from this process does not explicitly state how  the organisation enforces its membership requirements.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  No validation process is associated with use of the mechanism  outlined in this document.  4.2.4 CERTs’ focus: type and region  By geographic focus, ENISA and TF-CSIRT/TI focus on CERTs in Europe, as previously discussed, while  APCERT was established to benefit CERTs from Asian-Pacific countries. FIRST is an international  organisation that seeks and accepts members from around the world. There is little to suggest that  the geographic scopes of these organisations have a significant impact on their status in the CERT  community or the services that they provide.  Likewise, none of these organisations have limited their activities to particular industries, even if  they sometimes carry out vertical-specific analyses or training sessions.  Tier 2 Mechanism CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  n/g CERTs from EU Member States  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  all types of CERTs/global  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  all types of CERTs in Europe or with valid interests in EU  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ all types of CERTs/global  APCERT: ‘Membership’ all types of CERTs/Asia-Pacific region  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  all types of CERTs/global  .  Page 28  4.2.5 Benefits and added value of the mechanism  The benefits that CERTs gain from implementing the mechanisms in the Tier 2 level of the CERT  maturity model change as their maturity levels increase. In particular, gaining ‘Accredited’ status  with TF-CSIRT/TI or full membership with FIRST suggest that a CERT has reached a stage in its  development where it has capabilities typically associated with CERTs. This is a key value of these  organisations: when a CERT is granted a certain status with one of these organisations, then the  CERT in question has clearly met certain requirements; outside parties can count on TF-CSIRT/TI or  FIRST's expertise in such matters. CERTs that reach the accredited status with TF-CSIRT/TI will have  already been listed members, while those gaining full membership with FIRST will have been  subjected to a site visit, suggesting that these CERTs will be well-known entities to these  organisations by the time they gain such a membership status.  All of these CERT organisations can also recommend good practices to CERTs or other interested  parties as they improve their capabilities. Like ENISA, these organisations have issued mechanisms  that roughly mirror ENISA's baseline capabilities mechanism. These organisations divide their  mechanisms slightly differently:   ENISA: Mandate capabilities; Operational capabilities (technical); Operational capabilities  (organisational); Co-operational capabilities   TI: Organisation; Human Resources; Processes; and Tools   FIRST: Operational Requirements; Policies; Workplace/Environment; Incident Handling   RFC-2350: CERT Scope; Policies and Procedures; Cooperation; Services  There are also other elements to these mechanisms’ value. For example, TF-CSIRT/TI lists several  other value-added services that accredited teams can benefit from:   Access to members-only parts of the TF-CSIRT/TI website;   Access to certain mailing lists only available to accredited teams;   Access to value-added information only available to accredited teams;   Access to in-band and out-of-band alerting services; and   Access to TF-CSIRT/TI meetings restricted to accredited teams only.55   Voting privileges: if a vote is needed (elections, rule changes, community topics), only  accredited teams can take part in the vote.   Nomination privileges: only accredited teams can nominate candidates for the Steering  Committee.  FIRST also similarly provides what it terms ‘value added services’, including dedicated mailing lists  with access to good practice documents, technical colloquia, classes, an annual incident response  conference, as well as various presentations.  55  Invitation Package for TI ‘Accredited Status’, at p. 5.  Page 29  Tier 2 Mechanism Benefits and added value of the mechanism  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  Baseline capabilities for all n/g CERTs in Europe:  The mechanism offers value to CERTs by providing good practices  for developing baseline capabilities necessary for n/g CERTs. It also  provides further guidance to EU Member States in adhering to the  communications and recommendations (relating to CERTs and their  baseline capabilities) of the EU Commission and other EU  institutions.  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  Same format used:  The mechanism provides value by being a widely used and  accepted good practice guide for CERTs.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  Trust and recognition within the European CERT community:  The mechanism provides confirmation of CERTs' capabilities when  they are approved for accredited status, along with certain other  benefits such as information sharing between CERTs which have  reached this level.  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ Trust and recognition within the global CERT community:  The mechanism provides confirmation of CERTs' capabilities. In  addition, the mechanism provides what it terms ‘value added  services’, including access to good practice documents, technical  colloquia, classes, an annual incident response conference, as well  as various publications.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ Trust and recognition within the Asia-Pacific CERT community:  The mechanism provides confirmation of CERTs' status, as well as  certain value-added services such as an annual drill test56 for  members, efforts to increase information sharing among members,  and joint research and development efforts.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  Following the same practices globally:  This mechanism provides value through good practices to its target  audience.  4.2.6 Definitions and terminology  For this tier we go one step further and shift focus from definitions of basic terms like ‘CERT’ and  ‘constituency’ to categories of capabilities and incident classification and definition. ENISA and TF- CSIRT/TI have relatively similar definitions of ‘incident’ – definitions that focus on incidents’ impact  on computers and networks. Under their mechanisms, the definition is the baseline evaluation for  56  For  information on the 2013 drill test see:  http://www.hkpc.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4291%3Ados&catid=149%3Anews- flash&Itemid=437&lang=en  Page 30  whether something qualifies as an incident.57 FIRST's definition of incident is more thorough but still  maintains the focus on computers and networks: ‘An event that has actual or potentially adverse  effects on computer or network operations resulting in fraud, waste, or abuse; compromise of  information; or loss or damage of property or information.’58 IETF and CERT/CC also specify various  types of incidents.  On the other hand, there are significant differences among definitions concerning the categories of  CERT capabilities. While ENISA provides its set of four baseline capabilities, the other mechanisms,  although mostly covering the same topics, have their capabilities/topics scattered in more categories  under different headings. The difference is most striking when compared with membership  mechanisms like those of FIRST and APCERT. ENISA also pays significant attention to mandate and  strategy issues, which do not feature that prominently in the case of other mechanisms. On the  other hand, these more often address added value of the CERTs like the benefits of the teams for  the wider CERT community (member application process at APCERT where a CERT has to  demonstrate benefits it brings to APCERT).  Tier 2 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Categories of capabilities  Incident – definition and classification  ENISA: Baseline  Capabilities for  National /  Governmental  CERTs (2010,  2012)  Four baseline capabilities are  defined for n/g CERTs:   mandate & strategy   service portfolio   operation   cooperation  The term ‘incident’ is not specifically  defined but the focus is clearly on  incidents affecting critical information  infrastructure.  IETF: RFC-2350  (2003 updated)  The following categories are listed:   Charter (mission statement,  constituency, sponsorship/  affiliation, authority)   Policies (incident types and  support levels, cooperation,  interaction and disclosure of  information, communication  and authentication)   Services (incident response,  proactive activities)  Computer Security Incident: ‘any adverse  event which compromises some aspect of  computer or network security.’  The following categories are mentioned:   Loss of confidentiality of information   Compromise of integrity of information   Denial of service   Misuse of service   Damage to the systems  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Accreditation’  Categories used when applying for  the ‘Accredited’ status:   constituency  The mechanism includes references to  other sources, especially RFC-2350.  Page 31  Tier 2 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Categories of capabilities  Incident – definition and classification   business hours   policies   membership of  professional team/  security organisation   services provided to the  constituency  FIRST: ‘Full  Membership’  The current application form  includes (inter alia) the following  categories:   constituency   services   business hours   additional (incl. networks  of expertise)  Incident: ‘an event that has actual or  potentially adverse effects on computer  or network operations resulting in fraud,  waste, or abuse; compromise of  information; or loss or damage of  property or information. Examples include  penetration of a computer system,  exploitation of technical vulnerabilities, or  introduction of computer viruses or other  forms of malicious software.’  APCERT:  ‘Membership’  The membership process  includes (inter alia) the following  categories:   constituency   host organisation   authority (to act as a  CERT)   technical and managerial  skill-set of the team   mission statement   trust   contribution to security  community  The mechanism does not have its own  definitions of incidents but uses the term  ‘Type of incidents and level of support’  introduced by RFC 2350.  CERT/CC:  Handbook for  Computer  Security Incident  Response Teams  (CSIRTs) (2003)  This mechanism applies the  following categories:   CSIRT framework  (constituency, place in  organisation, relationship  to other teams)   CSIRT services   Policies (implementation,  maintenance and  enforcement)   Team operations  Although this mechanism is very detailed  on various aspects of incident handling  service, the actual definition of an  incident is not included. It is, however,  present in other CERT/CC documents,  including its FAQ section on its website59:  ‘Any real or suspected adverse event in  relation to the security of computer  systems or computer networks’ or ‘The  act of violating an explicit or implied  security policy’.  59  http://www.cert.org/csirts/csirt_faq.html#2  Page 32  Tier 2 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Categories of capabilities  Incident – definition and classification  It also lists some categories of incidents:   attempts (either failed or successful)  to gain unauthorised access to a  system or its data   unwanted disruption or denial of  service   unauthorised use of a system for the  processing or storage of data   changes to system hardware,  firmware or software characteristics  without the owner’s knowledge,  instruction or consent  4.2.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  Membership organisations seem to have more explicitly stated routes for updating their  mechanisms than non-membership organisations. For example, FIRST's framework can be amended  with a two-thirds vote of members present at a General Meeting or Special or Additional Meeting,  provided a quorum is present.60 Meanwhile, APCERT's members can propose additions and changes  to policies and procedures by submitting the proposed changes in writing to the Steering  Committee, along with the reason for the proposed change. The Steering Committee then decides  whether to accept, reject or amend the proposal, and submits it as necessary to Operational  Members, which must approve it by at least a two-thirds vote of a quorum during a general meeting,  or by more than half of total members if done by email.61  Tier 2 Mechanism Keeping the mechanism up to date  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs (2010, 2012) – policy  recommendations  This is a living document that was updated in 2012, while further  updates will follow taking account of the evolving cyber-security  landscape and the role of n/g CERTs in the EU Member States with  regard to the EU policy scope.62  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism does not explicitly provide for keeping it updated.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  The mechanism does not explicitly provide for keeping it updated.  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ The mechanism allows for amendment of its framework with a  60  http://www.first.org/about/policies/op-framework#c12, under Amendments  61  AP-CERT Operational Framework, available at  http://www.apcert.org/documents/pdf/OPFW_26March2013.pdf  62  See the recent EU Cyber Security Strategy and the proposal for a Directive on Network and Information  Security: http://www.eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/  Page 33  two-thirds vote of the members present at a General Meeting or  with a quorum at a Special or Additional Meeting.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ The mechanism allows its members to propose additions or  changes to policies and procedures by submitting the proposed  changes to the Steering Committee, which then decides whether to  accept, reject, or amend it.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism does not make specific provisions for keeping it up  to date.  4.2.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs' training  ENISA has gained credit especially among the n/g CERT community thanks to its extensive training  material63 and its dedicated operational events. ENISA CERT Exercises and training material were  introduced in 2008. Four years later, new training scenarios were added (bringing their total to 23)  containing essential and advanced materials for CERTs in the area of cyber-security. The material  includes handbooks for teachers, toolsets for students and also virtual images to support hands-on  training sessions. Since 2005, ENISA has also been organising annual CERT workshops for n/g CERTs  focusing on the actual needs of the teams including hands-on technical sessions.64  ENISA recently introduced its training courses for CERTs in the EU Member States. This is a new  initiative to promote and support CERT maturity in the MS by providing exercises and technical  hands-on training on different services, operations and cooperation in the daily work of the teams.65  FIRST and TF-CSIRT/TI do not engage in significant promotion of their mechanisms, and nor does  APCERT. FIRST has a formal policy for engaging with the press. APCERT issues media releases relating  to its key activities.  By tradition the first TF-CSIRT/TI meeting each year is co-organised with FIRST to safe travel budget  for all participants and to raise value added. Similarly ENISA usually co-locates its annual CERT  workshop66 with the second TF-CSIRT/TI meeting. Additionally, FIRST offers two technical colloquia67  each year that last from half a day to 2 days and are often conducted in cooperation with a local  CERT member. FIRST also offers a regular annual conference/ general meeting68 to its members,  which are valuable for both Tier 1 and Tier 2 CERTs aiming to further develop their capabilities. As  mentioned previously, TF-CSIRT/TI offers a training programme under this Tier which is TRANSITS II  (advanced training).69 APCERT does not offer its own training programmes, but does provide a list of  meetings and training opportunities available in the Asia-Pacific region offered by its member CERTs  and other relevant organisations.  63  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  64  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/past-events  65  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise  66  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/past-events  67  http://www.first.org/events/colloquia  68  http://www.first.org/events/agm  69  http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/transits-ii/  Page 34  Tier 2 Mechanism Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ENISA: Baseline Capabilities  for National / Governmental  CERTs – Policy  recommendations (2010,  2012)  ENISA provides n/g CERTs with extensive training material and also  organises workshops and tailored training courses, often focused  on technical issues as requested by the teams.  IETF: RFC-2350 (2003  updated)  The mechanism does not make specific provisions for its promotion  or provisions related to training.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Accreditation’  There are regular meetings held three times a year and TF-CSIRT/TI  promotes training programmes like TRANSIT-II.  FIRST: ‘Full Membership’ The mechanism offers two technical colloquia each year that last  from half a day to 2 days and are often conducted in cooperation  with a local CERT member, as well as a regular annual conference/  general meeting. Based on the agreement with TERENA (TF- CSIRT/TI), FIRST also offers TRANSIT courses.  APCERT: ‘Membership’ The mechanism does not offer its own training programmes, but  does provide a list of meetings and training opportunities available.  CERT/CC: Handbook for  Computer Security Incident  Response Teams (CSIRTs)  (2003)  This mechanism does not make provisions for its promotion or  provisions related to training.  4.3 Tier 3 of the CERT Maturity Model  CERTs that have reached Tier 3 of the CERT Maturity Model have established themselves and are  well balanced in their daily work and experience. They have a complete set of capabilities (all well  documented) in place and a stable position within their community, meaning that they no longer  depend on individuals from their team. Thus, for CERTs that have reached this level, CERT  mechanisms can be helpful in terms of refining their capabilities and establishing recognition of the  extent to which they have developed their capabilities. They can also provide feedback to CERTs and  the cyber-security communities to improve the work of CERTs based on their extensive and proven  knowledge, experience and recognition.  There are fewer mechanisms targeting CERTs that have reached this level, but several organisations  have standards and mechanisms that can be recognised as being appropriate for Tier 3 CERTs:  1. ENISA: n/g CERT standard capabilities (2014)70  2. ISO: ISO 27035 (2011)  3. TF-CSIRT/TI: Certified status  70  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing (beginning in 2009) with next input due in  2014.  Page 35  4.3.1 Type of approach (organisation)  Gaining ‘certified’ status with TF-CSIRT/TI is the next step beyond accreditation for member CERTs.  The International Standards Organisation (ISO) is a non-governmental organisation that is made up  of members from the national standards bodies of 163 countries.  The ISO-27035 document, like the other ISO standards that it publishes, was developed by a panel of  experts on a technical committee. Thus, it is a consensus-based document, even though ISO itself is  not a membership organisation for CERTs in the same way that TF-CSIRT/TI or FIRST are. Therefore,  as for Tier 1 and Tier 2 CERTs, the organisations with mechanisms for Tier 3 CERTs follow different  organisational approaches.  ENISA is also aiming to contribute with its mechanism to Tier 3 of the CERT Maturity Model while  building on its earlier work in defining and deploying baseline capabilities for n/g CERTs. This project  on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing, with next input due in 2014.  Tier 3 Mechanism Type of approach (organisation) Voluntary/ subscribe/  compulsory form  ENISA: n/g CERT  Standard Capabilities  (2014)  According to the new ENISA mandate (EU  Regulation 526/2013)71 ENISA will assist  CERTs in advancing their capabilities so  that they increasingly correspond to  those of the most developed CERTs. For  this purpose ENISA should promote the  establishment and operation of a peer  review system.  compulsory (once joined)  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism was developed by a  panel of experts of a committee and is  therefore a consensus-based standard,  not a membership-driven mechanism.  compulsory (once joined)  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Certification’  This mechanism is formal and  membership-based, with formalised  processes for accepting members and  internal processes.  compulsory (once joined)  4.3.2 Requirements for CERTs  TF-CSIRT/TI provides CERTs that have already earned accredited status with it the opportunity to  apply for certification, which is meant for teams with ‘internal and/or external reasons to have their  maturity level gauged in an independent way’. To apply for certified status, a CERT must be  accredited by TF-CSIRT/TI, be in good standing with the organisation for at least eight months, not  be under special review by the TF-CSIRT/TI Review Board, and must have attended at least one TI  Accredited Team meeting.72 The requirements for ISO compliance are straightforward.  71  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/about-enisa/regulatory-framework  72  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  Page 36  Tier 3 Mechanism Requirements for CERTs  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Not yet defined73  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The requirements result from the compulsory set of standards once  a CERT decides to follow them.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  Defined: The mechanism requires applicants for ‘Certification’  already be accredited by TI, be in good standing with the  organisation for at least eight months, not be under special review  by the TI Review Board, and must have attended at least one TI  Accredited Team meeting.74 Certification is valid for three years,  after which a re-certification process must be started and passed in  order to keep the ‘certified’ status.  4.3.3 Validation process  TF-CSIRT/TI uses the Security Incident Management Model (SIM3 Model)75 as a basis for evaluating a  member's application for certification. The SIM3 Model is similar to the ENISA baseline capabilities in  terms of how the model is organised, with key areas of focus being organisation, human resources,  processes, and tools. Each CERT capability is evaluated using a five-point scale, ranging from ‘0’,  which means it is not available, to ‘4’, which means that the capability is not only described (on level  ‘2’) and rubber-stamped (on level ‘3’) but also part of an audit process. According to TF-CSIRT/TI, the  certification process takes between three and twelve months in total.76  In case of ISO standards independent audits are used for the validation of the implemented  standard.77 ISO provides good practices for choosing an auditing company.  Tier 3 Mechanism Validation process  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Not yet defined.78  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) Independent audits are carried out.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  Minimum score needs to be attained for each criteria in the SIM3  model. The minimum scores are defined by the TF-CSIRT Steering  Committee.  73  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014  74  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  75  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/SIM3-mkXV-TI.pdf  76  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/certification.html  77  For an example of independent auditing services for ISO 27035 see http://www.isec.ro/compliance/iso-iec- 27035-incident-management.  78  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  Page 37  4.3.4 CERTs’ focus: Type and region  The same geographic and sector-specific focuses of the CERT community organisations relevant for  Tier 3 CERTs apply as previously discussed in this document. ENISA and TF-CSIRT/TI are focused on  Europe, while ISO seeks to provide value to CERTs worldwide. ENISA’s mechanism specifically  focuses on n/g CERT sector-specific group in EU Member States.  Tier 3 Mechanism CERTs’ focus: type and region  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  n/g CERTs/EU Member States79  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) all types of CERTs/global  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  all types of CERTs/Europe  4.3.5 Benefits and added value of the mechanism  Under Tier 3 the main benefit for the teams should be: the recognition by wider CERT and cyber- security community of the team capabilities (by attaining a ‘quality mark’). The added value should  be facilitating cooperation with institutions regarding standard operational procedures, financing  and grants.  Reaching the level of certification with TF-CSIRT/TI serves as independent affirmation of a CERT's  capabilities, which it can use with its constituents, its funding bodies, and with other parties or  teams. Thus, the value of reaching the level of Certified with TF-CSIRT/TI revolves around a CERT's  ability to use TF-CSIRT/TI's judgment to demonstrate its capabilities with its most important partners  – namely its constituents and funding sources.  The International Standards Organisation offers a different type of value to CERTs. ISO goes beyond  providing good practices to offering internationally agreed-upon standards for CERTs to follow. This  is potentially quite valuable both in terms of helping a CERT build up and maintain its capabilities, as  well as in terms of supporting a CERT's arguments for why it needs funding or resources for  developing certain capabilities.  Tier 3 Mechanism Benefits and added value  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  This mechanism will provide a wide range of benefits80, including  access to good practices and networking with CERTs offering these  good practices. Another added value is formal recognition by EU  authorities and an independent (and expert) affirmation of the  team’s capabilities.  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism provides value by being an accepted good practice  guide for CERTs based on a specific standard.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  The mechanism serves as independent affirmation of a CERT's  capabilities, which it can use with its constituents, its funding  bodies, and with other parties or teams. The certification may be  79  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  80  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  Page 38  regarded as a kind of ‘extra branding’ that is useful for many  purposes in the team's future.81  4.3.6 Definitions and terminology  For Tier 3 mechanisms that are suitable for advanced CERTs it is useful to consider standard services  (core or ‘must have’ services), working regime and incident response time. While TF-CSIRT/TI  ‘Certified status’ is based on the above-mentioned SIM3 model, the other two mechanisms are  either being developed (ENISA’s baseline capabilities mechanism) or being reviewed (ISO 27035). But  they will probably not change much in their approaches. Therefore, a similar approach can be  expected: incident handling (and incident management in general) will be considered as a core  service that a CERT offers to its constituents, one that provides 24/7 reachability mode and fast  response timelines based on the severity of the incident.  Tier 3 Mechanism Definitions and terminology  Standard services  (core/ must have  services)  Working regime (for  core/ must have  services)  Incident response  time  ENISA: n/g CERT  Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Incident handling  Alerts and warnings  Announcements  24/7  yet to be defined  ISO: ISO 27035  (2011)  Handling an incident that  ‘has a severe impact on the  organisation’s core services,  instigating “crisis” activities  through escalation to the  Crisis Team.’  24/7  ‘If an organisation  contracts with an  external party for  support, for  example a CERT,  then it should be  ensured  that all  requirements,  including response  times, are  included in the  contract with the  external party.’  TF-CSIRT/TI:  ‘Certification’  This process requires the  description of services  provided and level of  support (speed of reaction  to incoming incident reports  from constituents and from  peer CERTs)  24/7  Minimum  requirement:  ‘Specifies the  speed of reaction  to incoming  incident reports  and reports from  81  At the time of writing this document only seven teams had successfully completed the accreditation process:  http://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/alpha_certification_Z.html (last accessed on 20 September 2013)  Page 39  constituents and  from peer CERTs.  For the latter a  human reaction  within two  working days is  the minimum  expected.’  4.3.7 Keeping the mechanism up to date  ISO appears to follow an iterative process whereby the panel of experts responsible for a particular  set of standards updates those standards as necessary. ISO's work on CERTs is a relatively small part  of its overall activities, so the process for keeping its CERT mechanism updated is less explicit than  with other organisations that have a greater focus on CERTs.  The SIM3 model that is the basis for TF-CSIRT/TI's certification process has no explicit provision as to  how it can be updated, although updates to this model would be necessary for TF-CSIRT/TI if it were  to decide to make fundamental changes to its certification process. 82  Tier 3 Mechanism Keeping the mechanism up to date  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  Not defined yet.83  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism probably follows an iterative process whereby a  panel of experts revisits their standards, although the process for  keeping this particular standard up to date is not explicitly stated.  There was an ongoing revision of the standard at the time of  writing of this document.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  The updates are the responsibility of the TF-CSIRT Steering  Committee. Big changes require a vote by the members (TF-CSIRT  Full Members).  4.3.8 Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ISO is not heavily engaged in promoting its standards, although it does actively promote the  participation of new players in the process of creating relevant standards. ISO offers a variety of  training courses designed ‘for individuals performing various roles in International Standardization’  and ‘offered to all ISO members’. It notes that these training courses help members with regard to  specific aspects of the development of ISO standards as well as with distributing and implementing  the standards.84  82  SIM3: Security Incident Management Model (2010), available at https://www.trusted-introducer.org/SIM3- mkXV-TI.pdf  83  This project on n/g CERTs standardised capabilities is ongoing with next input due in 2014.  84  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/training-technical-assistance.htm  Page 40  TF-CSIRT/TI does not offer specific training courses to certified members. The SIM3 Model considers  staff training to be one of the fundamental aspects of the ‘Human’ Parameters of the model,  although it does not make specific recommendations with regard to training programmes.85 ENISA  has developed its advanced tailored training suitable also for teams in Tier 3 level.86  Tier 3 Mechanism Promoting the mechanism and CERTs’ training  ENISA: n/g CERT Standard  Capabilities (2014)  ENISA provides n/g CERTs with extensive training material and also  organises specific workshops, often focused on technical issues as  requested by the teams or dedicated to a particular area (e.g. CERT  and LEA cooperation on cybercrime).87  ISO: ISO 27035 (2011) The mechanism does not make specific provisions for its promotion  or about training, but it does promote the participation of new  actors in the creation or revision of standards.  TF-CSIRT/TI: ‘Certification’  The TRANSITS-II courses are intended for more experienced  personnel working for established CERTs. They provide insights into  key areas in incident handling and response operations, training in  how to improve communications with constituents, as well as  practical exercises.88  85  SIM3: Security Incident Management Model (2010), available at https://www.trusted-introducer.org/SIM3- mkXV-TI.pdf  86  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii  87  http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/events/8th-cert-workshop-part-ii  88  http://www.terena.org/activities/transits/transits-ii/  Page 41  5 Harmonisation Approach  The number of mechanisms that exist for use by CERTs suggests that there may be room for  harmonisation of certain aspects of these mechanisms. Targeted harmonisation could benefit both  the organisations that offer mechanisms and CERTs that use them. For CERTs, harmonisation of  these mechanisms can make it easier for them to associate with more CERT community  organisations that offer these mechanisms. From the perspective of these CERT community  organisations, harmonisation could enable cooperation with other similar organisations, and allow  them to more easily make use of each other's existing resources. All of these potential advantages  are about possible gained efficiencies, which is important given that these mechanisms should be  about helping CERTs reach higher stages of maturity and better serve their constituents.  That said, there will be parts of all of these mechanisms that either will be very unlikely to be  considered for harmonisation or would not benefit from efforts to harmonise. These organisations  and their mechanisms serve different purposes and have different objectives, meaning that  harmonisation will not be possible across all, or even most, areas. The objective of this section is to  identify some areas where ENISA believes that harmonisation efforts could potentially be beneficial,  and also to identify areas where harmonisation efforts are unlikely to be fruitful.  5.1 Interest in harmonisation  Most surveyed CERTs say that they see a need for CERTs to have standardised capabilities. The  CERTs are also of the opinion that harmonisation in some areas of CERT mechanisms discussed  below could potentially benefit them (and their constituents!) in terms of reaching the goal of  standardised CERT capabilities.  Number of answers = 12 n/g CERTs  Source: Survey conducted by ENISA in conjunction with this document  CERTs' interest in standardisation of capabilities suggests that CERT community organisations should  give thought to where harmonisation might be beneficial in their mechanisms. This will be the  foundation for efforts to harmonise specific capability areas going forward. These organisations  know that their mechanisms can potentially benefit from harmonisation: for example, FIRST already  75%  25%  Is there a need for standardised capabilities of CERTs?  Yes  No  Page 42  has a liaison relationship with ISO through which standardisation efforts are made.89 ENISA and  TERENA cooperate on TRANSITS courses, for which ENISA provides financial and content-related  support.  5.2 Suitable areas for harmonisation  Surveyed CERTs see the most potential in harmonisation for the areas of (1) accepting and validating  members and (2) terminology and definitions. This is an interesting result because these are very  different aspects of the considered mechanisms and raise unique challenges in possible efforts to  harmonise them.  (1) Requirements / Validation Process: The CERT community's interest in harmonisation when it  comes to mechanisms' requirements and validation processes is understandable because meeting  and then adhering to different requirements is resource- and time-intensive. Harmonisation of  requirements seems to be more straightforward: CERTs already use the same tools/equipment or  way of communication (e.g. PGP encryption, phone number for incident reporting, web-based  incident report form, participation in the community meetings, etc.).  From the perspective of CERTs, it would be better if they could meet a single validation process  regardless of the CERT organisation from which they are seeking validation. Harmonisation is likely  to be challenging to achieve in these areas, though: CERT organisations have different missions and  agendas, and they may be reluctant to give up the autonomy that comes with having their own  requirements and validation processes.  (2) Definitions / Terminology: Working to harmonise important terms and definitions across  mechanisms is likely to be a more realistic goal than validation processes or requirements. Many  terms and definitions used by CERT organisations are already similar, as discussed previously in this  document. Thus, beginning the process for harmonising concepts at the core of CERTs' capabilities  and responsibilities might be the right place to begin harmonisation efforts. Harmonising core terms  such as: CERT and constituency definitions in Tier 1, incident type and definition for Tier 2 and  incident response time for Tier 3 CERTs would seem to make considerable sense. This could be a way  to make these mechanisms fundamentally more compatible and make it easier for CERTs to belong  to or utilise more mechanisms and also for CERTs’ constituency and cooperation partners to  understand better and recognise teams’ capabilities.  89  http://www.first.org/global/standardisation  Page 43  Number of answers =12  Source: Survey conducted by ENISA in conjunction with this document  A number of other areas may be particularly conducive to capability harmonisation efforts:   CERT types and the sectors in which they operate: The harmonisation of definitions of  sectors on which vertical-specific CERTs typically focus may be beneficial, as this would offer  more clarity and transparency surrounding a CERT's activities and the constituents it serves.   Training: This is another area where harmonisation could be beneficial, as it could lead to  synergies, proliferation of training opportunities for CERTs (in terms of standardised  capabilities and services offered by CERTs), and more opportunities for CERTs to meet and  share good practices. Good progress has already taken place in this respect with several  CERT organisations (including ENISA and FIRST) supporting TERENA's TRANSITS training for  CERTs.  On the other hand, harmonisation will be more challenging or makes less sense for some other areas  of capability mechanisms:   Approach (type of organisation): This is fundamental to a mechanism and approaches differ  to such an extent that harmonisation will be challenging.   Benefits: The benefits that CERTs can gain from an organisation's capability mechanism are  unlikely to merge to an appreciable extent as benefits are fundamental to an organisation's  identity.   Promoting the mechanisms: Organisations will continue to pursue different strategies when  it comes to promoting their mechanisms.  The figure below provides a view of the areas in which these organisations are most likely to be  receptive to the potential of harmonisation. As discussed, areas such as definitions of core  6  4 4  3  Validation Process Requirements Terminology Definitions  Which areas of CERT capabilites need to be further defined and  harmonised?  Page 44  terminology will rank among the areas most likely to see harmonisation, whereas harmonisation will  be looked at more sceptically when it comes to areas that go to the core of what the organisation  does.  Areas in which harmonisation is most likely and most beneficial  Core definitions/terms: CERT, constituency, incident etc.  Validation process (for similar mechanisms, not all)  Promoting the mechanisms  Types of CERTs (sectors)  Training of CERTs  Type of approach (organization)  Requirements for CERTs (for similar mechanisms, not all)  Keeping the mechanisms updated  Targeted  CERTs by type/region  Benefits and added value of mechanisms  Harmonisation likely  Harmonisation possible  Harmonisation unlikely  Page 45  Next steps  Actions to be taken by organisations offering their CERT mechanism:   Address the suitable harmonisation areas  It is desirable to start discussions among CERT organisations on the usefulness of harmonisation of  certain areas of their CERT capability mechanisms, especially as regards the requirements for a CERT  to join a particular CERT organisation or its CERT capability mechanism.   Agree on a list of areas to be harmonised  The discussion among various CERT organisations should identify areas considered as suitable for  harmonisation. It is suggested that the primary harmonisation focus should be on definitions of basic  terms, which would support interlinks among the CERT organisations and be helpful for teams that  are members of several CERT organisations.  Actions to be taken by ENISA   Address the missing criteria in the maturity assessment for its n/g CERT standard capabilities  mechanism  ENISA’s n/g CERT standard capabilities mechanism will be adjusted based on the interaction with the  teams. The focus will be on updating the list of maturity assessment criteria by adding new items  and possibly deleting others if they are found no longer relevant.   In collaboration with EU Member States continue to support the established n/g CERTs  It is necessary that the CERTs further develop their capabilities so that they are in a position to rise  up the maturity scale. This is important for fulfilling the objectives of new EU Cyber Security  Strategy. ENISA will support the teams with new training materials.   Further monitor the deployment of baseline capabilities of n/g CERTs in EU Member States as  well as developments in other CERT organisations in this area  ENISA will continue its stocktaking efforts in the area of baseline capabilities. At the same time it will  monitor the developments in other CERT organisations as regards their CERT mechanisms.

A SCHEME FOR CLOUD SERVICES  Foreword for Reviewers  This present version of the European Union Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS) is a  draft version, to be used as basis for an External Review.  The objective of this review is to validate the principles and general organization of the proposed scheme, and to  gather feedback on the proposed wording of the sections and annexes.  A foreword like this one is included at the beginning of Chapters and Annexes for which a specific comment is  required. In particular, the foreword will mention the level of maturity of the section or annex, and in some cases  issues that remain under discussion.  The terminology is not final only defines essential words, and it is complemented by the terminology defined in  Annex I: (Terminology).  1.1 INTRODUCTION  Following the request from the European Commission in accordance with Article 48.2 of the Cybersecurity Act1  (hereinafter referred to as EUCSA as indicated in the glossary), ENISA has set up an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG)  to support the preparation of a candidate EU cybersecurity certification scheme on cloud services.  Based on the outcomes from this AHWG, launched on March 5th, 2020 and composed of twenty (20) selected  members representing industry (e.g., cloud service providers, cloud service customers, conformity assessment  bodies), as well as around twelve (12) participants from accreditation bodies and EU Member States, regular  exchanges with the ECCG and after an internal review, ENISA has consolidated the following candidate scheme.  The candidate EUCS scheme (European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services), looks into the  certification of the cybersecurity of cloud services. The scheme draws from many different sources, the first one being  the report of the CSP-CERT Working Group, which was delivered in 2019 and provided a basic framework on which  the candidate scheme has been developed.  EUCS supports the three assurance levels in the EUCSA: ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ and ‘high’. The security requirements on  cloud services and on their assessment increase with levels in several dimensions: scope, rigour and depth. The  requirements at level ‘high’ are demanding and close to the state-of-the-art, whereas the requirements at level ‘basic’  define a minimum acceptable baseline for cloud cybersecurity. That baseline is nevertheless comprehensive, as it  covers all major aspects of cloud security. Cloud service providers of any size can use it to demonstrate that they have  set up a framework for guaranteeing some security of their customers. The ‘substantial’ level, in between, will serve to  protect business, and may be the level of choice for many applicants and their users.  The candidate scheme targets a specific category of ICT services, so it is naturally based on the ISO/IEC 17065  standard in terms of applicable requirements to CABs performing certification. There are two main standards suitable  1 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency  for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  (Cybersecurity Act).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  5  for the assessment of the cybersecurity of cloud services, respectively based on the ISO27000 series of standards and  on the International Auditing Standards. The scheme defines an assessment approach that is compatible with both  approaches, allowing cloud service providers to easily integrate the scheme into their current certification and  assurance strategy.  The candidate scheme also defines a simplified assessment methodology for the EUCSA assurance level ‘basic’. The  methodology is based on a self-assessment performed by the cloud service provider, whose results are then audited  by a conformity assessment body. The candidate scheme does not however allow cloud service providers to issue EU  statements of conformity.  The security requirements defined in the scheme draw significantly from the German C5 scheme, but they also draw  some inspiration from the French SecNumCloud scheme, from the proposals in the CSP-CERT report, and from  principles in other schemes used in Europe.  Finally, the EUCS scheme is not a standalone scheme; it is part of the European cybersecurity certification framework.  Although it is very different from the first scheme in the framework, EUCC, which focuses on ICT products, there are  commonalities, for instance around the organization of compliance monitoring and peer assessments. The EUCS  scheme leverages some principles that were first defined in the EUCC scheme, and follows the same general  presentation, with 22 chapters that provide answers to the requirements stated in Article 54.1 of the EUCSA, followed  by annexes that define in greater details the content of the scheme.  Guidance will also be key to support the adoption of the scheme by providing harmonised interpretation or refinement  of requirements established into the candidate EUCS scheme, and the text indicates explicitly where guidance will be  most required.  1.2 GLOSSARY  The first sections outline the most important terminology drawn from existing standards, including ISO/IEC 17788,  ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 17000.  1.2.1 From ISO/IEC 17788  We will reuse the following terminology from ISO/IEC 17788:  Term Abbreviations Definition  Application capabilities type  Cloud capabilities type in which the cloud service customer can use the cloud  service provider's applications  Cloud capabilities type  Classification of the functionality provided by a cloud service to the cloud  service customer, based on resources used.  Cloud computing  Paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable  physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on- demand.  Cloud service  One or more capabilities offered via cloud computing invoked using a defined  interface.  Cloud service customer CSC Party which is in a business relationship for the purpose of using cloud services.  Cloud service customer  data  Class of data objects under the control, by legal or other reasons, of the cloud  service customer that were input to the cloud service, or resulted from  exercising the capabilities of the cloud service by or on behalf of the cloud  service customer via the published interface of the cloud service.  NOTE 1 – An example of legal controls is copyright.  NOTE 2 – It may be that the cloud service contains or operates on data that is not  cloud service customer data; this might be data made available by the cloud  service providers, or obtained from another source, or it might be publicly available  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  6  Term Abbreviations Definition  data. However, any output data produced by the actions of the cloud service  customer using the capabilities of the cloud service on this data is likely to be  cloud service customer data, following the general principles of copyright, unless  there are specific provisions in the cloud service agreement to the contrary.  Cloud service derived data  Class of data objects under cloud service provider control that are derived as a  result of interaction with the cloud service by the cloud service customer.  NOTE – Cloud service derived data includes log data containing records of who  used the service, at what times, which functions, types of data involved and so on.  It can also include information about the numbers of authorized users and their  identities. It can also include any configuration or customization data, where the  cloud service has such configuration and customization capabilities.  Cloud service provider CSP Party which makes cloud services available  Cloud service provider data  Class of data objects, specific to the operation of the cloud service, under the  control of the cloud service provider  NOTE – Cloud service provider data includes but is not limited to resource  configuration and utilization information, cloud service specific virtual machine,  storage and network resource allocations, overall data centre configuration and  utilization, physical and virtual resource failure rates, operational costs and so on.  Cloud service user User Natural person, or entity acting on their behalf, associated with a cloud service  customer that uses cloud services.  NOTE: Examples of such entities include devices and applications.  Infrastructure capabilities  type  Cloud capabilities type in which the cloud service customer can provision and  use processing, storage or networking resources  multi-tenancy  Allocation of physical or virtual resources such that multiple tenants and their  computations and data are isolated from and inaccessible to one another.  on-demand self-service  Feature where a cloud service customer can provision computing capabilities,  as needed, automatically or with minimal interaction with the cloud service  provider.  Platform capabilities type  Cloud capabilities type in which the cloud service customer can deploy,  manage and run customer-created or customer-acquired applications using one or  more programming languages and one or more execution environments supported  by the cloud service provider.  tenant  One or more cloud service users sharing access to a set of physical and virtual  resources.  We will in general not use the terminology from 17788 that is not included in the table above. More specifically, the  following terminology should be avoided in the definition of the scheme:  Term Rationale  XXaaS These “as a Service” correspond to the cloud service categories, which are too specific.  Cloud capabilities types should be used instead in the scheme. In particular, IaaS, PaaS  and SaaS should not be used.  Cloud service category Cloud service categories are too specific and should not be used in the scheme, except  when used in their specific meaning.  Cloud service partner We have not identified a specific need for using the notion of cloud service partner, so it is  recommended not to use it in the document.

SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE  Foreword for Reviewers  Chapters 2 to 23 follow the same structure. Each one of them provides content related to one of the points raised  in Article 54(1). There are 22 such points, numbered (a) to (v), so there are 22 chapters.  Every chapter contains the following sections:   An excerpt from Article 54 defining the topic to be addressed in the chapter.   A proposed text, which is the proposed content for the scheme. This content defines scheme rules and  requirements, and makes extensive use of “shall” to express a requirement, and “may” to express an  option.   A rationale, starting when available by relevant excerpts from the EU Cybersecurity Act, and providing  additional information, reasons for making the choices in the proposed text, and any other additional  information deemed necessary.  When reviewing these chapters, the proposed text is the essential part for the review, but comments are also  welcome on the rationale, in particular to indicate a potential lack of justification of a given point.  As a rule of thumb, the chapters that do not include a dedicated foreword are typically chapters that are (1)  derived from earlier work, typically principles decided early in the spring, or (2) adapted from the EUCC scheme,  with some initial review by a few AHWG members. In other cases, the foreword will provide additional information.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  9  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  i. (a) the subject matter and scope of the certification scheme, including the type or categories of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes covered;  ii. The rest of Article 54 also provides useful information:  iii. 2.  The specified requirements of the European cybersecurity certification scheme shall be consistent with any  applicable legal requirements, in particular requirements emanating from harmonised Union law.  iv. 3.  Where a specific Union legal act so provides, a certificate or an EU statement of conformity issued under a  European cybersecurity certification scheme may be used to demonstrate the presumption of conformity with  requirements of that legal act.  v. 4.  In the absence of harmonised Union law, Member State law may also provide that a European cybersecurity  certification scheme may be used for establishing the presumption of conformity with legal requirements.  🙧  🙥  The European cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services, hereinafter referred to as the EUCS scheme, shall  allow for the cybersecurity certification of cloud services according to the criteria and methods defined in Chapter 8  below (Evaluation Methods and Criteria).  The EUCS scheme may cover any type of ICT service, provided that:   The ICT service implements one or more capabilities offered via cloud computing invoked using a defined  interface [ISO17788].   The ICT service aims at reaching the assurance level corresponding to one of the three levels ‘basic’, ‘substantial’  and ‘high’ of the EUCSA as defined in the EUCS scheme  ICT services matching these criteria will from now be referred to as “cloud services”. The EUCS scheme may apply to  all cloud services, following some principles:   The EUCS scheme distinguishes between different categories of cloud services by relying on the cloud  capabilities types (infrastructure, platform, application);   The EUCS scheme aims at establishing the conformity of cloud services to a set of requirements corresponding to  one of the assurance levels defined in the EUCS scheme;   The EUCS scheme aims at making geographical and legal information about the cloud services available and  understandable to all users of the scheme to allow to use them as needed.   The EUCS scheme acknowledges that the responsibility for the security of a cloud service is split between the  Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the Cloud Service Customer (CSC), and aims at verifying that this split of  responsibility is explicitly and publicly documented by the CSP.   The EUCS scheme aims at providing sufficient information for making informed security decisions on cloud  services to prospects and customers with adequate cybersecurity knowledge, allowing them to fully understand  and implement the documentation that defines their responsibility.  Finally, in the evaluation of a cloud service, the EUCS scheme shall support and encourage the reuse of conclusions  and evidence from already audited or certified ICT products, ICT processes, and ICT services, in particular those cloud  services that have been certified with the EUCS scheme:   The scheme includes an assessment of the dependencies, in which the assurance information available from  subservice organizations is considered and compared to the requirements of the scheme, in particular regarding  the required level of assurance (see Annex B:, Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services).   When a certified composite cloud service relies on a base cloud service certified with the EUCS scheme, the  EUCS scheme shall aim at verifying that the recommendations defined in the base cloud service are adequately  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  10  applied by the composite cloud service, and included into the recommendations defined for that composite cloud  service (see Section 24.4, Composition).  The EUCS scheme also covers additional elements as foreseen by Article 54 of the CSA, under the conditions defined  by Chapter 24, Additional Topics:   The definition of Security Profiles;   The handling of force majeure cases;   Rules for the protection of information related to cybersecurity certification;  RATIONALE  Additional information  In the request to prepare the scheme, the Commission asks ENISA to “… prepare a candidate European  cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services.” In addition, the request is justified by the need to “stimulate  cloud uptake in Europe” as “cloud computing is an underlying technology for any development in technological  fields.”  🙧  🙥  The core definitions come from ISO/IEC17888. The definition of cloud computing and cloud service as provided in  ISO/IEC17888 suit well the objectives of the EUCS scheme, which aims at being a horizontal scheme for a wide range  of cloud services. The definition of a cloud service is very generic, as long as it is based on cloud computing, which is  defined in ISO/IEC17888 with all the classical properties (scalability, elasticity, shareable resources, self-service and  on-demand).  The notion of capability and capability type is central and also defined in ISO/IEC 17788:  3.2.4 cloud capabilities type: Classification of the functionality provided by a cloud service (3.2.8) to the cloud  service customer (3.2.11), based on resources used.  NOTE – The cloud capabilities types are application capabilities type (3.2.1), infrastructure capabilities type (3.2.25)  and platform capabilities type (3.2.31).  3.2.1 application capabilities type: Cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer (3.2.11)  can use the cloud service provider's (3.2.15) applications.  3.2.25 infrastructure capabilities type: Cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer  (3.2.11) can provision and use processing, storage or networking resources.  3.2.31 platform capabilities type: Cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer (3.2.11) can  deploy, manage and run customer-created or customer-acquired applications using one or more programming  languages and one or more execution environments supported by the cloud service provider (3.2.15).  Capabilities provide a more precise framework than the classical categories (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XXaaS, etc.), allowing  a cloud service to precisely define the capabilities that it provides to its customers (e.g., a SaaS service may simply  provide application capabilities on top of an already certified infrastructure and platform, or it may provide  infrastructure, platform and application capabilities if the CSP uses a cloud computing system built from the ground up.  There are other ways to categorize cloud services, such as the deployment models. ISO/IEC 17788 defines four  deployment models, depending on the control and sharing of physical or virtual resources: community cloud, private  cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud.  For the purpose of the EUCS scheme, we did not identify any specific need to focus on deployment models in addition  to cloud capabilities types to categorize cloud services. Nevertheless, although deployment models are not mentioned  in the scheme, it does not mean that deployment models can be fully ignored in the evaluation of a cloud service, as  the evidence to be provided may differ for some controls or requirements.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  11  About scoping, the most important characteristic of the EUCS scheme is that it is intended to be a horizontal scheme,  applying the same criteria to all cloud services, with three levels of assurance. These criteria apply to the design and  implementation of the cloud service, including its security features and the essential processes used throughout its  lifecycle, in particular for development, deployment and operation.  The EUCS scheme includes a security profile mechanism that allows industries or verticals to define dedicated  requirements, but individual cloud service providers are not allowed to remove from or add to the security requirements  defined in the EUCS scheme.  In addition, the EUCS scheme does not aim at verifying the compliance of a cloud service to any regulation beyond the  EUCSA, and in particular it does not aim at verifying compliance with GDPR2. Such compliance will have to be verified  using a dedicated certification scheme, and results obtained in the EUCS scheme may be reused in such schemes.  Finally, the EUCS scheme is a technical tool designed to provide information to customers and allow them to make  informed decisions. As such, the EUCS scheme does not enforce any restrictions on geographical location of data or  processing, or on applicable laws; however, it requires the CSP to be transparent about this information, and to make it  publicly available and understandable as part of the information provided with the certificate.  The EUCS scheme recognizes that cloud services are based on complex systems, and that many CSPs will use  subservices provided by subservices organizations. Beyond typical security controls on the control and monitoring of  suppliers and service providers, the assessment methods therefore include at all levels an assessment of the  assurance documentation provided by subservice providers with regards to the requirements of the EUCS scheme.  The EUCS scheme also defines requirements for composition. When a cloud service uses a subservice that has been  previously certified in the EUCS scheme, it should be easy to reuse the results from that certification. The  requirements related to composition defined in the EUCS scheme apply to both the base cloud service and to the  dependent cloud service.  Another important aspect of certification is related to the split of responsibility between the CSP and the CSC  (Customer). The fulfilment of the requirements by the CSP’s cloud services is evaluated under the assumption that the  CSC follows the recommendations provided by the CSP in the cloud service’s documentation.  In terms of certification, when a cloud service A relies on another certified cloud service B, it needs to follow the  security recommendations provided by cloud service B, or when necessary, to “forward” the recommendations to its  own end users.  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  12  3. PURPOSE OF THE SCHEME  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  vi. Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements  (b) a clear description of the purpose of the scheme and of how the selected standards, evaluation methods  and assurance levels correspond to the needs of the intended users of the scheme;  🙧  🙥  The EUCS scheme aims at improving the Internal Market conditions, and at enhancing the level of security of a wide  range of cloud services, of the cloud capabilities they implement, including application, infrastructure, and platform  capabilities.  The EUCS scheme also covers a wide range of security requirements, by offering all three (3) security assurance  levels defined in the EUCSA (‘basic’, ‘substantial’ and ‘high’).  Users of the scheme may be:   cloud service providers (CSPs) who wish to assess the security of their cloud services through third-party  certification;   cloud service customers (CSCs) who wish to benefit from the evidence provided with certified cloud services to  make informed decisions related to the security of these cloud services;   regulatory authorities who wish to include security and assurance requirements on cloud services within their  regulations and directives.  These users may use the EUCS scheme:   to assess how a cloud service, as described by the CSP, meets the requirements of a predefined set of security  control objectives and a related set of measures, when used according to security recommendations provided by  the CSP;   to provide CSCs the information required to make informed choices about the procurement and operation of cloud  services, and to allow CSCs to use certified cloud services in their own development activities, and to meet their  own security compliance requirements;   to allow regulatory authorities to refer to the scheme in European and national regulations, including criteria based  on information defined in the scheme, and to check compliance by verifying the information provided in the  certificates stored in the site managed by ENISA.  The EUCS scheme defines rules and mechanisms that may be combined to allow users to reach these objectives:   three (3) assurance levels (see Chapter 5, Assurance Levels) corresponding to levels ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ and  ‘high’ defined in the EUCSA, which can cover cloud services corresponding to a wide range of risk profiles;   a set of security objectives and requirements (see Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria), defining objectives  to be met by CSPs for all certified cloud services, further decomposed into requirements mapped to the assurance  levels referred to above;   an assessment meta-approach (see Annex B:, Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services) defining how  to use various assessment methods to determine that a cloud service fulfils the requirements assigned to a given  assurance level;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  13   two assessment methods (see Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria, Annex C:, Assessment for levels  Substantial and High and Annex D:, Assessment for level Basic) defining how to determine that a cloud service  fulfils a given set of requirements;   a set of document templates to be used during the evaluation and review activities ( Annex F:, Scheme Document  Content requirements) to ensure that the documents released by the CAB and its subcontractors follow the same  organization and flow;   a detailed list of the documents to be made publicly available as part of the certificate package, that may allow  scheme users to locate the information they are looking for to make informed decisions;   a set of rules about the lifecycle of certificates after their issuance, including maintenance and renewal  requirements, management of vulnerabilities and complaints, and market surveillance activities, that may allow  scheme users to remain informed of the evolution of the security of a given cloud service.  In addition to these technical features, all stakeholders interested in the cybersecurity certification of cloud services will  benefit from the following characteristics from the EUCS scheme:   a scheme harmonized at the European level;   strong quality guarantees through the use of third-party assessment by accredited bodies, supervision by national  authorities, and for the High level, authorization by the national authorities and peer assessment between  conformity assessment bodies;   the flexibility offered by three different assurance levels covering the entire range of assurance introduced in the  EUCSA, with the possibility for a certified cloud service to upgrade to a higher level in future evaluation cycles;   strong transparency guarantees, with security information made publicly available through a centralized web site;   assurance maintained over time, with regular reassessments, operating effectiveness guarantees at the levels  Substantial and High;   a maintenance framework for the EUCS scheme itself, endorsed by European institutions and Member states,  providing strong guarantees on continued operation of the scheme;   integration in the European cybersecurity certification framework, which will facilitate the reuse of EUCS-certified  cloud services in vertical schemes.  The mechanisms defined above provide the means allowing the scheme’s intended users to meet their objectives, by  providing the conditions required for performing evaluations, issuing and managing certificates, and maintaining the  framework and scheme over time.  RATIONALE  Additional input  vii. Recital 74 (excerpt). The purpose of European cybersecurity certification schemes should be to ensure that ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes certified under such schemes comply with specified requirements that  aim to protect the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or  of the related functions of or services offered by, or accessible via those products, services and processes  throughout their life cycle.  Recital 92 (excerpt). European cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of conformity should help end users  to make informed choices. Therefore, ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that have been certified or  for which an EU statement of conformity has been issued should be accompanied by structured information that  is adapted to the expected technical level of the intended end user.  🙧  🙥  The scheme’s intended users cover all relevant stakeholders in the life cycle of the certificate (production and  consumption) and, due to the nature of the scheme, all relevant stakeholders in the life-cycle of the cloud service.  Table 1 and Table 2, below, describe the intended users as stakeholders of the certificate, their role and their use case  related to the scheme.

CAB Review and  Certification  The Review and Certification role for CABs includes all the activities related to the  issuance and management of certificates, including in particular the review of the  evaluation and of its results.  NCCA As a CAB For level ‘high’, the NCCA is involved and may perform the tasks of a CAB. This would  include at least the Review and Certification role, and it may also include the  Evaluation role.  NCCA Compliance  monitoring  NCCAs have a Compliance Monitoring role, to ensure that certified cloud services  remain compliant to the requirements of the scheme.  NAB CAB Accreditation NABs are not directly involved in the production of certificates, but their role in the  accreditation of CABs is essential in the proper operation of the scheme  ENISA Publicity ENISA is in charge of publicizing the certificates issued in the context of the scheme,  as well as the events associated with these certificates.  Table 2: Stakeholders consuming certificates  Stakeholder Role Use case  Cloud Service  Customer  Procurement The Procurement role covers the activities related to the selection of a cloud service,  and in particular the definition of the criteria and the assessment of the candidates,  leading to the selection.  Cloud Service  Customer  Customer  Development  The Customer Development role covers the activities related to the development of  new products or services on the basis of the certified cloud service, possibly including  other cloud services. Developers will in particular rely on the recommendations  provided with the certified cloud service.  Cloud Service  Customer  Customer  Operations  The Customer Operations role covers the activities related to the operation of the  certified cloud service by the CSC within its own organization, possibly through  another cloud service. The tasks involved depend on the cloud capabilities type, and  may include configuration, deployment, and maintenance tasks, following the  guidance provided with the certified cloud service.  Cloud Service  Customer  Customer  compliance  The Customer Compliance role covers the activities related to the verification of  compliance of the CSC’s own products or services, possibly includes other cloud  services. In that context, the main aspects are the use of the evaluation performed on  the cloud service and the reuse of evidence or conclusions generated during the cloud  service evaluation.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  15  Stakeholder Role Use case  Cloud Service User User The Cloud Service User is not expected here to be a primary user of the scheme, but  they should be targeted as secondary users through Cloud Service Customers. Users  are nevertheless directly targeted by some of the documentation provided by the CSP  and evaluated in the context of the scheme, and their profile should be considered  when developing and auditing user documentation.  Regulatory  authority  Regulation The Regulation role includes the development of rules and regulations to be applied at  a local, regional, national or European level. Regulators may use the scheme as a  basis for including high-level requirements (mandatory certification) or more detailed  requirements, for instance building on transparency requirements.  Regulatory  authority  Enforcement The Enforcement role includes all activities related to the enforcement of regulations  that mention the scheme. Enforcers will in particular need to verify that cloud service  providers comply with the parts of the regulation that depend on the scheme.  Out of the stakeholders using the scheme, we can distinguish between primary users, including CSPs, CSCs and  Regulatory Authorities, and secondary users, including CABs, NCCAs and Cloud Service Users. Among the secondary  users, CABs and NCCAs are mentioned because they control the issuance of the certificates and NABs and ENISA  are mentioned because they are directly involved in the operation of the scheme.  Cloud Service Users (the actual persons or machines using the certified cloud services) are not considered as primary  users for two distinct reasons:   Employees of a CSC are considered secondary users. The CSC as primary users select the cloud service and will  provide its internal users with the recommendations provided by the CSP to securely use their services.   Final customers are not considered as direct users of the scheme, because one of the prerequisites for being a  user of the scheme is the ability to understand the information made available to CSCs, which requires some  knowledge in cybersecurity that cannot be assumed from a final customer.  The intended users whose needs the scheme shall satisfy are the CSPs and the CSCs, as well as the Regulatory  Authorities. Satisfying these needs is indeed the purpose of the scheme, with one distinct objective for each category  of users:   For CSPs. The scheme shall assess how a cloud service, as described by the CSP, meets the requirements of a  predefined set of security control objectives and a related set of measures, when used according to security  recommendations provided by the CSP.   For CSCs. The scheme shall provide CSCs the information required to make informed choices about the  procurement and operation of cloud services, and shall allow CSCs to use certified cloud services in their own  development activities, and to meet their own security compliance requirements.   For Regulatory Authorities. The scheme shall allow Regulatory Authorities to refer to the scheme in European and  national regulations, including criteria based on information defined in the scheme, and it shall allow them to  enforce regulations by verifying the information provided in the certificates stored in the site managed by ENISA  For CSPs, the scheme offers:   a single certification scheme recognized across the entire European Union;   three assurance levels corresponding to different needs from the CSPs and different use cases;   two assessment methodologies tailored to the assurance levels, designed to simplify their integration with other  established methodologies such as [ISO17021] or [ISAE3402];   a set of objectives and requirements inspired from existing schemes and mapped to the assurance levels;   the possibility to use composition to simplify the certification of cloud services that rely on other already certified  cloud services; and   a certificate that can be used to demonstrate that their cloud service fulfils the requirements of the scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  16  For CSCs, the scheme offers:   a single certification scheme recognized the entire European Union;   three assurance levels corresponding to different needs from the CSCs and different use cases;   requirements mandating transparency about the split responsibility between the CSP and the CSC regarding  security;   requirements mandating transparency about the location of the processing and storage of data, and about the  applicable laws; and   the possibility to use composition to certify their own cloud service when needed.  For Regulatory Authorities, the scheme offers:   a single certification scheme recognized the entire European Union;   three assurance levels corresponding to different needs from the CSCs and different use cases; and   requirements mandating transparency about the location of the processing and storage of data, and about the  applicable laws.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  17  4. USE OF STANDARDS  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  viii. Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following element  c) references to the international, European or national standards applied in the evaluation or, where such  standards are not available or appropriate, to technical specifications that meet the requirements set out in  Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 or, if such specifications are not available, to technical specifications  or other cybersecurity requirements defined in the European cybersecurity certification scheme;  🙧  🙥  The scheme relies on a number of standards and technical specifications:   International standards ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17000, and to a lesser extent ISO/IEC 9000 and ISO/IEC  27000, are being used as references for the terminology used through the scheme, with input from all the  schemes listed below when required.   The security controls used in the scheme, together with the associated security requirements, are defined in an  Annex of the present scheme (see Annex A:. Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), and they  are based on international standards ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, ISO/IEC 27017, and on documents  previously issued by Member States to define the security controls in their respective National Schemes [C5,  SecNumCloud].   The definition of the assurance levels reuses some concepts defined in the ISO/IEC 15408-3 standard.   The conformity assessment methodology defined in the scheme is based on the ISO/IEC 17065 international  standard.  The scheme also leverages several security assessment methods and standards:   International standards ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006.   International auditing standards ISAE3402 and ISAE3000.   One method defined in an Annex to the present scheme (see Annex D:, Assessment for level Basic).  The security controls and other annexes also reference a number of standards:   The ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111 standards are referenced about vulnerability handling   The ISO/IEC27005 standard is referenced about risk management  RATIONALE  ix. Additional input  This is reinforced in the request for the candidate scheme, which indicates that “the candidate scheme (…)  should take into account existing and relevant schemes and standards.”  The text mentions regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, it defines the following requirements (this is an outline, further  details are available in the regulation itself:  1. Market acceptance, as demonstrated by the existence of compliant implementations from different vendors  2. No conflict with current or foreseen European standard  3. Developed by a non-profit making organization which fulfils some criteria  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  18  a) Openness of the specification development process  b) Consensus-based decision-making process  c) Transparency of the development process  4. Requirements on the specification itself  a) Sustained maintenance for a long period  b) Publicly available for implementation and use on reasonable terms  c) IP rights essential to the specification are available on a (F)RAND basis  d) Relevant and effective, responding to market needs and regulatory requirements  e) Neutral and stable  f) Sufficient quality and level of details, with standardized interfaces available as needed  These requirements are classical, and they are based on the WTO rules, so they are in practice met by many of  the technical specifications developed by all kinds of industry groups.  Regarding the elements included in the scheme itself, the following guidance has been provided to the SOGIS  ad hoc working group:   The elements that are mandatory for the implementation of the scheme must be included as  appendices to the scheme, and they will be included in the regulation.   The elements that are optional in the implementation of the scheme may be included in other  documents, provided by ENISA on the certification framework portal.  🙧  🙥  The standards that are referenced are very classical in the IT security field.  However, in some cases, it has not been possible to rely solely on European and international standards.  For the security controls, the ISO/IEC 27000 series provides a very good basis, but it did not provide the level of details  deemed suitable for the present scheme. The structure of the controls is strongly inspired from these standards, but  the content has been enriched, in particular by introducing more detailed requirements that have been mapped to  assurance levels. These requirements have been designed by drawing inspiration from current practices in Europe,  and in particular from the documents issued by Member States who operated National Schemes for cloud services.  For the assessment methods, the scheme recognizes the two most widely used assessment method families (based  on the ISO/IEC 17000 family and on the ISAE3000 family), but there has been a need to add a specific and simplified  assessment method for the ‘basic’ level, which is defined in the scheme itself.  Both documents have been written in a way that could allow them to be considered as a basis for the establishment of  new standards.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  19  5. ASSURANCE LEVELS  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (d) where applicable, one or more assurance levels;  🙧  🙥  The scheme defines three assurance levels, with assurance level Basic corresponding to the ‘basic’ assurance level of  the EUCSA, assurance level Substantial corresponding to the ‘substantial’ assurance level of the EUCSA, and  assurance level High corresponding to the ‘high’ assurance level of the EUCSA.  As specified in the EUCSA’s Article 52(5), assurance level Basic is “intended to minimise the known basic risks of  incidents and cyberattacks” and can be further defined as follows:   Assurance level Basic should provide limited assurance that the cloud service is built and operated with  procedures and mechanisms to meet the corresponding security requirements at a level intended to minimize the  known basic risks of incidents and cyberattacks.   Assurance level Basic should be suitable for cloud services that are designed to meet typical security  requirements on services for non-critical data and systems.   The typical attacker profile for assurance level Basic should be a single person with limited skills repeating a  known attack with limited resources, not including the ability to perform social engineering attacks.   The evaluation scope for assurance level Basic shall be defined by the description of the cloud service and by the  security objectives and requirements pertaining to assurance level Basic, as defined in Annex A: (Security  Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), including processes and the software (understood as result of a  development process) underlying the service.   The evaluation depth for assurance level Basic shall consist solely of inspection activities, based on a check for  completeness and coherence of the provided documentation on processes and design intended to confirm the  fulfilment of technical and organizational measures, including requirements for fully automated testing of basic  known vulnerabilities and automated compliance checks by the CSP.  A report following defined procedures shall be generated by the CAB.  Self-gathered evidence shall be regularly submitted to the CAB to justify the continued development and operation  of the service.   The evaluation depth for assurance level Basic shall be driven by a predefined audit plan.  As specified in the EUCSA’s Article 52(6), assurance level Substantial is “intended to minimise the known  cybersecurity risks, and the risk of incidents and cyberattacks carried out by actors with limited skills and resources”  and can be further defined as follows:   Assurance level Substantial should provide reasonable assurance through evaluation by a CAB that the cloud  service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to minimise known cybersecurity risks, and the risk  of incidents and cyberattacks carried out by actors with limited skills and resources. The CAB shall determine that  the cloud service provider has assessed those risks and implemented suitable controls that, if operating  effectively, minimize those risks and meet the corresponding security requirements throughout a specified period.   Assurance level Substantial should be suitable for cloud services that are designed to meet typical security  requirements on services for business-critical data and systems.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  20   The typical attacker profile for assurance level Substantial should be a small team of persons with hacking abilities  and access to a wide range of known hacking techniques, including social engineering, but with limited resources,  in particular to launch wide attacks or to discover previously unknown vulnerabilities.   The evaluation scope for assurance level Substantial shall be defined by the description of the cloud service and  by the security objectives and requirements pertaining to assurance level Substantial, as defined in Annex A:  (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), including processes and the software (understood as  result of a development process) underlying the service. The effective operation of the relevant security controls  shall also be demonstrated throughout a specified period.   The evaluation scope for assurance level Substantial shall include, in addition to the requirements for assurance  level Basic, on-site audit including interviews and inspecting samples, plus a verification that the implementation  follows the specified processes and design, including the validation of the functional tests performed on that  implementation.  The security controls for assurance level Substantial shall include a limited pen testing using known attacks.  As specified in the EUCSA’s Article 52(7), assurance level High is “intended to minimise the risk of state-of-the-art  cyberattacks carried out by actors with significant skills and resources” and can be further defined as follows:   Assurance level High should provide reasonable assurance through evaluation by a CAB that the cloud service is  built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to minimise the risk of state-of- the-art cyberattacks carried  out by actors with significant skills and resources. The CAB shall determine that the cloud service provider has  assessed those risks and implemented suitable controls that operated effectively to minimize those risks and meet  the corresponding security requirements throughout a specified period.   Dedicated requirements are defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services) to  ensure that controls shall be automatically monitored for continuous operation in accordance with their design, and  that the controls shall be regularly reviewed and pen tested to validate their actual ability to prevent or detect  security breaches.   Assurance level High should be suitable for cloud services that are designed to meet specific (exceeding level  ‘substantial’) security requirements for mission-critical data and systems.   The typical attacker profile for assurance level High should be a team of highly skilled persons with access to  significant resources to design and perform attacks, get insider access, discover or buy access to previously  unknown vulnerabilities.   The evaluation scope for assurance level High shall be defined by the description of the cloud service and by the  security objectives and requirements pertaining to assurance level High, as defined in Annex A: (Security  Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), including processes and the software (understood as result of a  development process) underlying the service. The effective operation of the relevant security controls shall also be  demonstrated throughout a specified period.   The evaluation depth for assurance level High shall be based on the depth for assurance level Substantial, to  which requirements on depth of inspection or testing shall be added to verify that the controls implemented by the  CSP actually meet their objective.  In particular, these requirements concern the automated monitoring of controls and the review and penetration  testing of security controls. Such activities shall be planned over multiple years, and they shall be performed by  personnel with appropriate competences, in particular when penetration testing or in-depth technical reviews are  required.   The evaluation depth for assurance level High shall be driven by a full justification of the coverage for all  mappings, including for processes.  It may also include higher expectations for some processes and their implementation, as defined in the security  controls pertaining to assurance level High.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  21  RATIONALE  Additional input  Article 52 provides details about the assurance levels, and in particular:  1.  A European cybersecurity certification scheme may specify one or more of the following assurance levels for  ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes: ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ or ‘high’. The assurance level shall be  commensurate with the level of the risk associated with the intended use of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT  process, in terms of the probability and impact of an incident.  3.  The security requirements corresponding to each assurance level shall be provided in the relevant European  cybersecurity certification scheme, including the corresponding security functionalities and the corresponding  rigour and depth of the evaluation that the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process is to undergo.  5.  A European cybersecurity certificate or EU statement of conformity that refers to assurance level ‘basic’ shall  provide assurance that the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes for which that certificate or that EU  statement of conformity is issued meet the corresponding security requirements, including security  functionalities, and that they have been evaluated at a level intended to minimise the known basic risks of  incidents and cyberattacks. The evaluation activities to be undertaken shall include at least a review of technical  documentation. Where such a review is not appropriate, substitute evaluation activities with equivalent effect  shall be undertaken.  6.  A European cybersecurity certificate that refers to assurance level ‘substantial’ shall provide assurance that  the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes for which that certificate is issued meet the corresponding  security requirements, including security functionalities, and that they have been evaluated at a level intended to  minimise the known cybersecurity risks, and the risk of incidents and cyberattacks carried out by actors with  limited skills and resources. The evaluation activities to be undertaken shall include at least the following: a  review to demonstrate the absence of publicly known vulnerabilities and testing to demonstrate that the ICT  products, ICT services or ICT processes correctly implement the necessary security functionalities. Where any  such evaluation activities are not appropriate, substitute evaluation activities with equivalent effect shall be  undertaken.  7.  A European cybersecurity certificate that refers to assurance level ‘high’ shall provide assurance that the ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes for which that certificate is issued meet the corresponding security  requirements, including security functionalities, and that they have been evaluated at a level intended to  minimise the risk of state-of-the-art cyberattacks carried out by actors with significant skills and resources. The  evaluation activities to be undertaken shall include at least the following: a review to demonstrate the absence of  publicly known vulnerabilities; testing to demonstrate that the ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes  correctly implement the necessary security functionalities at the state of the art; and an assessment of their  resistance to skilled attackers, using penetration testing. Where any such evaluation activities are not  appropriate, substitute activities with equivalent effect shall be undertaken.  Recitals also provide additional information about assurance levels  (65) The assurance level of a European certification scheme is a basis for confidence that an ICT product,  ICT service or ICT process meets the security requirements of a specific European cybersecurity certification  scheme. In order to ensure the consistency of the European cybersecurity certification framework, a European  cybersecurity certification scheme should be able to specify assurance levels for European cybersecurity  certificates and EU statements of conformity issued under that scheme. Each European cybersecurity certificate  might refer to one of the assurance levels: ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ or ‘high’, while the EU statement of conformity  might only refer to the assurance level ‘basic’. The assurance levels would provide the corresponding rigour and  depth of the evaluation of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process and would be characterised by reference  to technical specifications, standards and procedures related thereto, including technical controls, the purpose of  which is to mitigate or prevent incidents. Each assurance level should be consistent among the different  sectorial domains where certification is applied.  (66) A European cybersecurity certification scheme might specify several evaluation levels depending on the  rigour and depth of the evaluation methodology used. Evaluation levels should correspond to one of the  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  22  assurance levels and should be associated with an appropriate combination of assurance components. For all  assurance levels, the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process should contain a number of secure functions, as  specified by the scheme, which may include: a secure out-of-the-box configuration, a signed code, secure  update and exploit mitigations and full stack or heap memory protections. Those functions should have been  developed, and be maintained, using security-focused development approaches and associated tools to ensure  that effective software and hardware mechanisms are reliably incorporated.  (67) For assurance level ‘basic’, the evaluation should be guided at least by the following assurance  components: the evaluation should at least include a review of the technical documentation of the ICT product,  ICT service or ICT process by the conformity assessment body. Where the certification includes ICT processes,  the process used to design, develop and maintain an ICT product or ICT service should also be subject to the  technical review. Where a European cybersecurity certification scheme provides for a conformity self-  assessment, it should be sufficient that the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes has carried out a self-assessment of the compliance of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  with the certification scheme.  (68) For assurance level ‘substantial’, the evaluation, in addition to the requirements for assurance level  ‘basic’, should be guided at least by the verification of the compliance of the security functionalities of the ICT  product, ICT service or ICT process with its technical documentation.  (69) For assurance level ‘high’, the evaluation, in addition to the requirements for assurance level  ‘substantial’, should be guided at least by an efficiency testing which assesses the resistance of the security  functionalities of ICT product, ICT service or ICT process against elaborate cyberattacks performed by persons  who have significant skills and resources.  🙧  🙥  High-level presentation  All Assurance level defined in the EUCS scheme satisfy all requirements that are applicable to all EUCSA assurance  levels:   Every assurance level is commensurate with the level of risk associated to the intended use of the cloud service,  as demonstrated in the definition of suitable services and typical attacker profiles (Article 52(1)).   Every assurance level defines security requirements and functionalities, as well as the rigour and depth required in  the evaluation (Article 52(3)).   Every assurance level requires that evaluation activities include a review of technical documentation (Article 52(5),  Recital 67).   Every assurance level requires a review of the cloud service’s main processes, including the development process  used for the development of the cloud service (Recital 67).  Those are the only requirements defined for assurance level ‘basic’ in the EUCSA, which are all satisfied by assurance  level Basic.  In addition, assurance level Substantial satisfies the requirements pertaining to the EUCSA’s assurance level  ‘substantial’:   Assurance level Substantial security controls include a vulnerability assessment activity that perform a review of  publicly known vulnerabilities (Article 52(6)).   Assurance level Substantial security controls include a review of the functional tests of the cloud service’s security  functionalities as well as some independent testing requirements (Article 52(6)),   The assessment methodology for assurance level Substantial mandates the review of a mapping between the  documentation of security functionalities and their implementation to ensure compliance (Recital 68).  Finally, assurance level High satisfies the requirements pertaining to the EUCSA’s assurance level ‘high’:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  23   Assurance level High security controls include a vulnerability assessment activity that perform a review of publicly  known vulnerabilities (Article 52(7)).   Assurance level High security controls include a review of the functional tests of the cloud service’s security  functionalities, as well as automated monitoring requirements, (Article 52(7)),   Assurance level High security controls require the use of state-of-the-art security functionalities (Article 52(7)).   The assessment methodology for assurance level High mandates the review of a full mapping between the  documentation of security functionalities and their implementation to ensure compliance (Recital 68).   The assessment methodology for assurance level High mandates both design efficiency and operating efficiency  to be assessed during the evaluation (Recital 69). This assessment includes penetration testing to assess the  resistance of security functionalities of the cloud services (Article 52(7), Recital 69).  Note that, throughout this document, references to the assurance levels defined in the EUCSA use lowercase and  quotes (‘basic’, ‘substantial’, ‘high’), whereas the assurance levels defined in EUCS are capitalized (Basic, Substantial,  High). The names assigned to assurance levels in EUCS may be later modified.  DETAILED PRESENTATION  This presentation is the full output of the thematic group on assurance levels, which provides a full background  PARAMETERS  Intention  The intention provides a general description of the Assurance Level, most likely matching quite closely the definition  from the EU CSA.  Suitability  Suitability is about potential restrictions of the types and categories that may be covered.  Attacker profile  The attacker profile cannot be very specific, because of the great variety of attackers, and it always defines a wide  category of attackers. Typical expected results are as follows:   The least sophisticated attackers in the range should be stopped, regardless of their motivation.   The most sophisticated attackers in the range should be deterred to attack that particular service. This means that,  if they have a specific reason to attack that particular service, they may succeed with difficulties, but if they are  looking for generic revenue, the difficulty should encourage them to move to the next target.  Note that this applies as well to the ‘high’ level. Security certification cannot provide guarantees against a motivated  nation-state determined to attack a specific site but may discourage them if they are “harvesting” information.  Scope of the Evaluation  In ISO/IEC 15408-3, scope is defined as “the effort is greater because a larger portion of the IT product is included”.  This is about gradually adding elements to be evaluated. The scope of the evaluation should comprise the service  provided by the CSP and clearly identify all underlying and supporting services and processes.  Depth  In ISO/IEC 15408-3, depth is defined as “the effort is greater because it is deployed to a finer level of design and  implementation detail”. This is about considering more and more details and asking more precise questions. The  general principle is to follow an incremental approach, i.e., that all requirements of a lower level are similarly included  in the depth of the higher level.  Rigour  In ISO/IEC 15408-3, a more rigorous assessment is defined as “the effort is greater because it is applied in a more  structured, formal manner”. This is about requiring more structure in the service (for instance, a security model based  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  24  on a specific formalism/method) or adding more structure to the assessment (for instance, requiring a specific method  to collect evidence or provide results).  APPLICATION TO ASSURANCE LEVELS  Level Basic Substantial High  Intention Provide limited assurance  through a review by an  independent third party that the  cloud service is built and  operated with procedures and  mechanisms to meet the  corresponding security  requirements at a level intended  to minimize the known basic  risks of incidents and  cyberattacks.  Provide reasonable assurance  through evaluation by an  independent third party that the  cloud service is built and  operated with procedures and  mechanisms to minimise known  cybersecurity risks, and the risk  of incidents and cyberattacks  carried out by actors with limited  skills and resources. The CSP  has assessed those risks and  implemented suitable controls  that, if operating effectively,  minimize those risks and meet  the corresponding security  requirements throughout a  specified period.  Provide reasonable assurance  through evaluation by an  independent auditor that the cloud  service is built and operated with  procedures and mechanisms to  minimise the risk of state-of- the- art cyberattacks carried out by  actors with significant skills and  resources. The CSP has assessed  those risks and implemented  suitable controls that operated  effectively to minimize those risks  and meet the corresponding  security requirements throughout a  specified period. Security controls  are monitored for continuous  operation in accordance with their  design; they are reviewed and pen  tested to validate their actual ability  to prevent or detect security  breaches.  Intention  rationale  Scope, depth and rigour of the  assurance level is limited to  procedures and mechanisms for  those security requirements that  shall minimize basis risks only.  Scope, depth and rigour of this  assurance level requires the  cloud service provider to apply a  risk-based approach for the  suitable design and  implementation of controls that  meet the corresponding security  requirements. The systematic  risk assessment approach and  the operating effectiveness  (consistent application) of  controls throughout a specified  period is evaluated by an  independent auditor, including  for the initial conformity  assessment.  Scope, depth and rigour of this  assurance level extend the  previous level for Substantial by  additional procedures to be  performed for automated controls.  Automated monitoring is applied  by the CSP to identify exceptions  in the application of controls (e.g.  changes to the configuration) and  initiate corrective actions. Reviews  and pen tests are performed by the  independent auditor or a third party  engaged by the CSP with the  objective to identify vulnerabilities  that allow to circumvent, override  or breach controls.  Suitability The Basic level is suitable for  cloud services that are  designed to meet typical  security requirements on  services for non-critical data  and systems.  The Substantial level is suitable  for cloud services that are  designed to meet typical security  requirements on services for  business-critical data and  systems.  The High level is suitable for cloud  services that are designed to meet  specific (exceeding level  ‘substantial’) security requirements  for mission critical data and  systems.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  25  Level Basic Substantial High  Suitability  rationale  The ‘Basic level provides limited  assurance that baseline  procedures and mechanisms  are in place to address security  risks and threats in potentially  low impact information systems  (e.g.: Web site hosting public  information). It is typically not  suited for Platform or  Infrastructure capabilities, used  by a large number of services.  built on top and that require an  elevated level of security. The  Basic level demonstrates a  willingness to address security,  including the application of  security guidance from  subservice providers.  The Substantial level provides  reasonable assurance that a set  of more stringent (than in level  Basic) security controls is  designed and operated to  address security risks and  threats in potentially moderate  impact information systems to  protect business critical  information (e.g.: Confidential  business data, email, CRM –  customer relation management  systems, personal information).  It is suitable for all capabilities  types. . The Substantial level  demonstrates a robust and  mature holistic security  management to provide secure  services.  The High level provides  reasonable assurance that a set of  even more stringent security  controls is designed and operated  to address security risks and  threats in potentially high impact  information systems to protect  mission critical information (e.g.  highly confidential business data,  patents).  The costly and rigorous evaluation  process reflects the intention to  minimize the risks in using the  cloud service.  Attacker profile Single person with limited skills  repeating a known attack with  limited resources, not including  the ability to perform social  engineering attacks.  Small team of persons with  hacking abilities and access to a  wide range of known hacking  techniques, including social  engineering, but with limited  resources, in particular to launch  wide attacks or to discover  previously unknown  vulnerabilities.  Team of highly skilled persons with  access to significant resources to  design and perform attacks, get  insider attacks, discover or buy  access to previously unknown  vulnerabilities.  Attacker profile  rationale  Today, Basic is about removing  low-lying fruits and ensuring  that cloud services, including  simple ones, are designed with  security in mind. The objective  is to remove the possibility to  fall victim to trivial attacks.  When such certification  becomes mainstream, the  requirements should be revised  upwards.  This is the “standard” attacker,  corresponding to most real-life  attacks used to disclose  information, steal resources,  deny service, or tamper with a  service.  Their main characteristics come  from the definition of the level:  “known attacks” and “limited  resources”. Note that this  definition is quite ambitious and  allows the use of attacks that  leverage several vulnerabilities.  This is the sophisticated attacker,  against which detection and  mitigation is more efficient than  resistance. At this level, it may be  difficult to define precisely a way to  analyse that the objective has  been met, in particular because  there is an expectation to minimize  risks through various mitigation  methods.  Scope As defined by the service  description and the controls  pertaining to the Basic level,  including processes and the  software (understood as result  of a development process)  underlying the service.  .  As defined by the service  description and the controls  pertaining to the Substantial  level, including processes and  the software (understood as  result of a development process)  underlying the service.  Operating effectiveness of the  controls shall be demonstrated.  As defined by the service  description and the controls  pertaining to the High level,  including processes and the  software (understood as result of a  development process) underlying  the service.  Operating effectiveness of the  controls shall be demonstrated.  (including automated monitoring if  required by the control definition).  Scope rationale This may need to be rephrased,  depending on the relationship  between “controls” and  “requirements”.  Here, the idea would be to  include all controls in their  general form, but without the  more detailed requirements that  may be added for higher levels.  We refer to the same controls  from the Basic assurance level,  but with the stronger refinements  or enhancements (e.g.,  (mandated techniques,  thresholds, etc.).  Requirements must include a  limited pen testing using known  attacks.  We refer to the same controls from  the Substantial assurance level,  but with the higher refinements or  enhancements.  Enhancements often included  additional constraints, references  to state-of-the-art requirements,  and automated monitoring of some  controls.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  26  Level Basic Substantial High  Depth Inspection solely, based on a  check for completeness and  coherence of the provided  documentation on processes  and design intended to confirm  the fulfilment of technical and  organizational measures, and  interactions between the auditor  and the CSP at the beginning  and at the conclusion of the  inspection.  A report following defined  procedures is generated by the  inspection body.  Once a year, a documentation  update is provided for third- party review of the continued  development and operation of  the service.  Additional to the requirements of  Basic: On-site audit including  interviews and inspecting  samples, plus a verification that  the implementation follows the  specified policies and  procedures, and an additional  focus on development activities,  for instance on the functional  tests performed.  On the initial assessment and  once a year, the operating  effectiveness of the security  controls, i.e. their operation as  designed, needs to be  demonstrated over the previous  period.  Additional to the requirements of  Substantial: Specific requirements  on the monitoring and testing of  the controls, i.e. their operation as  intended to protect from attacks or  detect them, needs to be  demonstrated.  Different measures may be used,  such as technical reviews, and  penetration testing shall be  performed by qualified personnel,  following a multi-year plan that  needs to be validated in the audit.  Depth rationale The inspection focuses on  completeness, coherence and  plausibility of the  documentation. It needs to be  an efficient process that mostly  focuses on the existence of  processes, and of a secure by  design approach, to  demonstrate the proper design  and existence of security  measures to protect the cloud  service.  The full audit aims at providing  reasonable assurance that the  security controls are properly  designed and operate  effectively, I,e, as designed, over  a period of time.  The audit aims at providing the  same reasonable assurance as for  the Substantial level.  The main addition in depth come  from additional requirements for  level High, such as automated  monitoring and penetration testing,  which are intended to demonstrate  that the controls remain effective  under strenuous conditions.  Rigour The assessment is performed  by the CSP and driven by a  standardised checklist.  An accredited third-party then  audits the assessment report  and its supporting  documentation.  The assessment is performed by  an accredited third-party, and it  is driven by a risk analysis  performed by the CSP, which is  in the audit scope.  The assessment is performed as  for the Substantial level, but the  CAB needs to be authorized by the  NCCA to it has the required  competencies to audit the specific  requirements of the High level.  More rigour is expected in the  definition and application of  policies, usually as defined in  requirements specific to the  controls (e.g. the need to  demonstrate the coverage of  functional tests used in  development).  Rigour rationale The assessment follows all  items in a checklist suited to the  targeted cloud service, and its  results are reviewed by an  accredited third-party.  A full audit is performed by an  independent third-party, and the  checklist approach is replaced  by a more rigorous risk-based  approach, allowing the auditor to  identify controls that require  specific attention.  The rigour remains mostly the  same as for level Substantial, as it  corresponds to typical audit  conditions.  Nevertheless, specific  requirements explicitly increase the  level of rigour on some controls by  requiring additional deliverables  from the CSP.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  27  6. SELF-ASSESSMENT  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (e) an indication of whether conformity self-assessment is permitted under the scheme;  🙧  🙥  EU statements of conformity shall not be issued by CSPs in the EUCS scheme.  RATIONALE  Additional input  In addition, Article 53, provides further information on conformity self-assessment, and in particular:  1.  A European cybersecurity certification scheme may allow for the conformity self-assessment under the sole  responsibility of the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. Conformity self-  assessment shall be permitted only in relation to ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that present a  low risk corresponding to assurance level ‘basic’.  2.  The manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes may issue an EU statement of  conformity stating that the fulfilment of the requirements set out in the scheme has been demonstrated. By  issuing such a statement, the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes shall  assume responsibility for the compliance of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process with the requirements  set out in that scheme.  Recitals also provide additional information:  (78)  European cybersecurity certification schemes could provide for a conformity assessment to be carried out  under the sole responsibility of the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes  (‘conformity self-assessment’). In such cases, it should be sufficient that the manufacturer or provider of ICT  products, ICT services or ICT processes itself carry out all of the checks to ensure that the ICT products, ICT  services or ICT processes conform with the European cybersecurity certification scheme. Conformity self-  assessment should be considered to be appropriate for low complexity ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes that present a low risk to the public, such as simple design and production mechanisms. Moreover,  conformity self-assessment should be permitted for ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes only where  they correspond to assurance level ‘basic’.  (79)  European cybersecurity certification schemes could allow for both conformity self-assessments and  certifications of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. In such a case, the scheme should provide for  clear and understandable means for consumers or other users to differentiate between ICT products, ICT  services or ICT processes with regard to which the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or  ICT processes is responsible for the assessment, and ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes that are  certified by a third party.  🙧  🙥  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  28  The issuance of EU statements of conformity by cloud service providers could only have been allowed for all cloud  services that present a low risk (Article 53(1)), i.e., to a subset of the cloud services that could be certified at level  Basic.  The ad hoc Working Group consistently expressed that self-assessment was not suitable for cloud services, even at  level Basic and even on a strictly defined subset of services. In addition, there are many elements in the scheme,  including the definition of the security objectives and requirements, that are entirely new. Rather than allowing CSPs to  interpret these security requirements, it is preferable to only allow accredited CABs to use the scheme, making it easier  to bring the various elements of the scheme to a higher level of maturity in a consistent way, and to control their usage  in the meantime through guidance and guidelines for CABs.  Although divergent opinions have been expressed, in particular in the surveys performed over the summer, we have  decided to not allow the issuance of EU statements of conformity in the initial version of this scheme, as there are  enough challenges to be met in that first version.  This decision may be reconsidered in future releases of the scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  29  7. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS  APPLICABLE TO A CAB  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (f) where applicable, specific or additional requirements to which conformity assessment bodies are subject  in order to guarantee their technical competence to evaluate the cybersecurity requirements;  🙧  🙥  All CABs performing assessments in the context of the EUCS scheme will need to be accredited for [ISO17065],  complemented by the requirements defined for the EUCS scheme (see Annex E:, Competence requirements for  CABs). The requirements will define several profiles corresponding to the various roles in the conformity assessments,  in order to allow CABs that only perform a subset of the of the conformity assessment activities, in particular those that  only perform evaluation activities.  The technical competence requirements associated to accreditation are sufficient to perform conformity assessments  at levels Basic and Substantial. However, advanced competences are required in order to perform a conformity  assessment at level High. As a consequence, conformity assessment bodies shall be authorised by the national  cybersecurity certification authority to carry out in the context of an evaluation at level High conformity assessment  tasks related to highly technical topics including:   Penetration testing, including the design and performance of penetration tests and the analysis of penetration  testing activities performed by a CSP or its contractors.   Analysis of development activities, and in particular the review of the design and implementation of security  measures by the CSP.  Further details are provided in Annex E: (Competence requirements for CABs).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  30  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 60 covers Conformity assessment bodies:  1.  The conformity assessment bodies shall be accredited by national accreditation bodies appointed pursuant  to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Such accreditation shall be issued only where the conformity assessment body  meets the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation.  3.  Where European cybersecurity certification schemes set out specific or additional requirements pursuant to  point (f) of Article 54(1), only conformity assessment bodies that meet those requirements shall be authorised by  the national cybersecurity certification authority to carry out tasks under such schemes.  Article 58, about National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities, also covers that topic:  7.  National cybersecurity certification authorities shall:  (c) without prejudice to Article 60(3), actively assist and support the national accreditation bodies in the  monitoring and supervision of the activities of conformity assessment bodies, for the purposes of this Regulation;  (e) where applicable, authorise conformity assessment bodies in accordance with Article 60(3) and restrict,  suspend or withdraw existing authorisation where conformity assessment bodies infringe the requirements of  this Regulation;  The Annex to the Cybersecurity Act (Requirements to be met by Conformity Assessment Bodies) provides  detailed information on the conditions to be met by all CABs. However, it does not include any reference to point  (f) of Article 54 (1), so we don’t reproduce it here.  🙧  🙥  The competence required for CABs are rather generic, since most of the controls are related to the processes used by  the CSP. Nevertheless, some controls require competences, in particular at the highest levels of assurance.  Pen testing and analysis of development activities are provided as examples, since those activities do require specific  competencies, but the “including” formulation does not preclude the addition of further activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  31  8. EVALUATION METHODS AND  CRITERIA  Foreword for Reviewers  The present chapter is not fully ready for review, the evaluation methods and criteria are still being defined. The  structure is set, though, and we are mostly missing the mapping between the measures in the scheme and the  security objectives of Article 51.  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (g) the specific evaluation criteria and methods to be used, including types of evaluation, in order to  demonstrate that the security objectives referred to in Article 51 are achieved;  🙧  🙥  The EUCS scheme uses a set of evaluation criteria that is defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements  for Cloud Services).  The EUCS assessment methodology, based on the [ISO17065] standard, is defined in Annex B: (Meta-approach for  the assessment of cloud services). This methodology defines two assessment approaches that may be used by CABs:   an assessment approach that may be used for assurance levels Substantial and High, defined in Annex C:,  (Assessment for levels Substantial and High), which draws inspiration from both the [ISO17021] standard and  from the ISAE family of standards [IAASB Handbook];   an evidence-based assessment approach, defined in Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic), that may be used  solely for assurance level Basic.  In order to achieve a high level of interoperability between the assessment methods, the EUCS assessment  methodology also defines strict guidelines and requirements on the assessment process and on its deliverables, which  shall be followed independently of the assessment method used in a specific evaluation.  Article 51 objectives are covered by the security objectives requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and  requirements for Cloud Services). Table 3 below provides a high-level vision based of the coverage of Article 51  requirements by security categories from Annex A:.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  32  Table 3: Coverage or Article 51 by requirement categories  Security objectives from Article 51 Categories from Annex A:  (a) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data  against accidental or unauthorised storage, processing,  access or disclosure during the entire life cycle of the ICT  product, ICT service or ICT process;  This is covered in many categories of the scheme, including in  particular the CKM category (covering cryptography) and the  CS category (covering the security of communications)  (b) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data  against accidental or unauthorised destruction, loss or  alteration or lack of availability during the entire life cycle of  the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process;  This is covered in many categories of the scheme, including in  particular the CKM category (covering cryptography) and the  CS category (covering the security of communications)  (c) that authorised persons, programs or machines are able  only to access the data, services or functions to which their  access rights refer;  This is mostly covered by the IAM category (covering identity  management, authentication, and access control)  (d) to identify and document known dependencies and  vulnerabilities;  This is mostly covered by the PM category (defining  relationships with suppliers) and the OPS category (defining  vulnerability handling)  (e) to record which data, services or functions have been  accessed, used or otherwise processed, at what times and  by whom;  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (defining logging)  (f) to make it possible to check which data, services or  functions have been accessed, used or otherwise  processed, at what times and by whom;  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (defining logging)  (g) to verify that ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes do not contain known vulnerabilities;  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (defining general  pen testing measures) and by the DEV category (defining  vulnerability testing in the development context)  (h) to restore the availability and access to data, services  and functions in a timely manner in the event of a physical or  technical incident;  This is mostly covered by the BCM category (defining business  continuity) and the PS category (defining physical security  measures)  (i) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are  secure by default and by design;  This is mostly covered in the DEV category (defining  methodology), with complements in many other categories  (j) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are  provided with up-to-date software and hardware that do not  contain publicly known vulnerabilities, and are provided with  mechanisms for secure updates.  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (vulnerability  handling), in the CCM category (for change management) and  in the DEV category (for development methodologies)  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 51. Security objectives of European cybersecurity certification schemes  A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall be designed to achieve, as applicable, at least the following  security objectives:  (a) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data against accidental or unauthorised storage,  processing, access or disclosure during the entire life cycle of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process;  (b) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data against accidental or unauthorised  destruction, loss or alteration or lack of availability during the entire life cycle of the ICT product, ICT service or  ICT process;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  33  (c) that authorised persons, programs or machines are able only to access the data, services or functions to  which their access rights refer;  (d) to identify and document known dependencies and vulnerabilities;  (e) to record which data, services or functions have been accessed, used or otherwise processed, at what  times and by whom;  (f) to make it possible to check which data, services or functions have been accessed, used or otherwise  processed, at what times and by whom;  (g) to verify that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes do not contain known vulnerabilities;  (h) to restore the availability and access to data, services and functions in a timely manner in the event of a  physical or technical incident;  (i) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are secure by default and by design;  (j) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are provided with up-to-date software and hardware  that do not contain publicly known vulnerabilities, and are provided with mechanisms for secure updates.  Recital (74) provide a rational for Article 51:  (74) The purpose of European cybersecurity certification schemes should be to ensure that ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes certified under such schemes comply with specified requirements that aim to protect  the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or of the related  functions of or services offered by, or accessible via those products, services and processes throughout their life  cycle. It is not possible to set out in detail the cybersecurity requirements relating to all ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes in this Regulation. ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes and the  cybersecurity needs related to those products, services and processes are so diverse that it is very difficult to  develop general cybersecurity requirements that are valid in all circumstances. It is therefore necessary to adopt  a broad and general notion of cybersecurity for the purpose of certification, which should be complemented by a  set of specific cybersecurity objectives that are to be taken into account when designing European cybersecurity  certification schemes. The arrangements by which such objectives are to be achieved in specific ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes should then be further specified in detail at the level of the individual  certification scheme adopted by the Commission, for example by reference to standards or technical  specifications if no appropriate standards are available.  🙧  🙥  The requirements defined in the EUCS scheme have been drawn from a number of existing standards and conformity  assessment schemes, and they cover all categories defined in information security standards such as [ISO27001]. In  particular, the structure of the requirements is inspired from the [C5] criteria and from the [SecNumCloud] scheme.  Regarding assessment methods, a key objective from the scheme has been to minimize the disruption of existing  practices regarding certification and assurance for CSPs. The choice was made to use a hybrid methodology, based  on both the [ISO17021] methodology that is used for [ISO27001] certifications and on the [ISAE3402] methodology  used by many companies to get assurance reports on the security of their information systems.  As a result, the proposed methodology presents numerous advantages:   It proposes several assurance levels with increasing requirements that correspond to the levels defined in  [EUCSA];   It allows combined assessments with both [ISO17021] and [ISAE3402] assessments, allowing CSPs to contain  the investment on compliance.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  34  9. NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR  CERTIFICATION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (h) where applicable, the information which is necessary for certification and which is to be supplied or  otherwise be made available to the conformity assessment bodies by an applicant;  🙧  🙥  When a CSP wishes to get a cloud service certified in the EUCS scheme, or to maintain the certification of an already  certified cloud service, the CSP shall submit an application document, following the template defined in Annex F:  (Scheme Document Content requirements), completed with all required information, which depends in part on the  reason that triggered the conformity assessment.  During the evaluation, the CSP shall submit all the information needed to demonstrate that the implementation of their  cloud service meets the security requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud  Services) for the targeted assurance level, including but not limited to:   policies and procedures defined at the organization level and that apply to the design and operation of the cloud  services under evaluation;   policies and procedures that are specific to the design and operation of the cloud services under evaluation;   documentation related to the cloud services under evaluation, including design documentation, and if required,  test documentation, implementation details;   if required, records that can be used as evidence that the abovementioned policies and procedures are being  followed;   if subservice organizations are used, records and documents that can provide assurance that the subservice  organizations satisfy the requirements of the scheme that they are responsible for;   where explicitly stated, specific documents and records required by the CAB to assess the fulfilment of  requirements pertaining to specific security controls.  The information to be provided also depends on the assurance level required for the certification, as defined in  Chapter 5 (Assurance Levels). The information shall be provided following the assessment processes defined in  Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and  High) and Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic).  In the context of the conformity assessment, the CSP shall grant the CAB:   access to all information, such as records and documentation, including service level agreements, of which  management is aware that is relevant to the cloud service;   access to additional information that the CAB may request from management for the purpose of the evaluation;   unrestricted access to personnel within the Service Organization from whom the CAB determines it may be  necessary to obtain evidence relevant to the evaluation;  All records and documentation supporting the conformity assessment shall be appropriately archived by the CSP  and/or the CAB, as defined in Chapter 15 (Record Retention) and Chapter 18 (Availability of Information).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  35  As part of a new certification, it shall be possible to reuse evaluation results from another ICT certification or  assessment. The applicant may therefore make available to the CAB previous evaluation results to be re-used as  evidence. The CAB shall reuse such results for its tasks only when the provided evidence conforms to the  requirements for such evidence, the evidence has been evaluated following a methodology recognized by the scheme,  and the authenticity of the evidence can be confirmed.  In addition, the CSP shall submit to the CAB the link to the supplementary cybersecurity information required by  Article 55 of the EUCSA, in accordance to the rules defined in Chapter 23 (Supplementary Information).  Security requirements are defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services) related to the  availability and content of this supplementary information, to be fulfilled by certified cloud services at all assurance  levels  Additional information may be required when the conformity assessment is performed as a consequence of the  vulnerability management process defined in Chapter 14 (New Vulnerabilities), or of the nonconformity management  process defined in Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance), to ensure that the vulnerability or nonconformity has been properly  handled.  An important part of the information provided by the CSP is the description of its cloud service, which shall follow the  principles below:   The description shall provide the information that is likely to be relevant from a CAB’s perspective to understand  the cloud service and associated controls to meet the applicable EUCS requirements as defined in Annex A:  (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services). Other aspects of the cloud service do not need to be  covered in the provided information.   If the CSP uses subservice organizations in the provision of the cloud service, the description shall indicate that  complementary subservice organization controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are  necessary, along with the CSP’s own controls, to meet certain of the EUCS requirements. The information shall  include a presentation of applicable EUCS requirements, with the CSP’s controls, the types of complementary  subservice organization controls assumed in the design of the CSP’s controls, and pointers to assurance  documentation where evidence can be found that the subservice organization satisfies these complementary  subservice organization controls with an level assurance suitable for the targeted level of assurance. The  assurance documentation referred to in that presentation shall be included in the information provided to the CAB.   The description shall indicate that Complementary Customer Controls that are suitably designed and are operating  effectively are necessary, along with the CSP’s controls, to meet some of the applicable EUCS requirements. The  description shall present the applicable EUCS requirements, the CSP’s controls and the Complementary  Customer Controls assumed in the design of the CSP’s controls.  General rules regarding the protection of the information provided by an applicant shall comply with the requirements  established under Chapter 24 (Additional Topics).  RATIONALE  The information to be provided by the CSP is mostly guided by the requirements defined in the security controls in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services). The present chapter only defines the main  principles, which grants the CAB both necessary and limited access to:   all pertinent documents, including policies and procedures, as well as records, logs, and other documents that can  attest that the procedures and policies are being applied appropriately;   interactions with employees, including individual interviews and group meetings, to gather information on the  application of procedures, or to provide explanations pertaining to the definition and implementation of security  controls;   interactions with the CSP systems, in particular to verify that technical security controls are properly implemented,  which may either be performed directly by an auditor, or performed by a CSP employee in front of an auditor.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  36  There may be some restrictions in the availability of the information, in particular related to the confidential nature of  the information, so some information may only be available to the CAB for a limited time, and only on the premises of  the CSP. Such limitations should be considered in the contractual agreement between the CAB and the CSP, to  ensure that they are acceptable to the CAB and that possible additional costs are covered by the CSP.  In addition to the information related to the requirements, the CSP needs to provide other information to the CAB for  evaluation:   the supplementary cybersecurity information required by Article 55 of the EUCSA;   any relevant information pertaining to a vulnerability or nonconformity that has triggered the conformity  assessment.  This provision has been added in the case where the CAB would need specific information related to an issue or to the  supplementary cybersecurity information that has not been explicitly planned in the security controls’ requirements.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  37  10. MARKS AND LABELS  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (i) where the scheme provides for marks or labels, the conditions under which such marks or labels may be  used;  🙧  🙥  The European Cybersecurity Certification Framework may provide for a label and associated mark.  When available, such a label shall be specifically implemented for this scheme, in order to allow its application on each  certificate, certified cloud service and related documentation. The labels used on the cloud service and related  documentation shall contain exactly the same information as the label included on the certificate, and follow all the  guidelines provided with the label and associated mark defined for the European Cybersecurity Certification  Framework.  A label and associated mark shall only be used when the certificate is awarded and until its expiration, and in  association with the certified cloud service: the non-respect of this condition shall be considered as an irregularity, as  defined by Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring).  Without prejudice to the rules for monitoring compliance as described under Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring),  depending on the circumstances, the nature and impact of the non-respect, wrong use, misuse, abuse of the mark and  or label may have other legal implications in the field of IP right protection, possible criminal allegations (e.g. fraud,  deceit), market surveillance regulations related to consumer protection (e.g. misleading and or unlawful comparative  advertising of cloud services). These legal implications are outside the scope of this EUCS scheme.  RATIONALE  A label and associated mark, established for the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework and specifically  implemented for this scheme, will allow to:   highlight that the cloud service has been certified in the European Union and to provide immediate information  regarding the certificate by referring to the framework (ECCF), the evaluation scheme and the assurance level;   make the certification easily recognizable as both the label and the associated mark may be used in the cloud  service’s web site and printed on technical documents and on leaflets used for marketing purposes;   provide a direct link (in the form of a QR code) to the ENISA website (as per Article 50) - where all the information  regarding the certificate are disclosed, including the current status of the certificate.  Figure 1: Demo label for the EUCS scheme  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  38  The “demo label”, shows the basic information that the label associated with the scheme may contain:   logo of the ECCF (to be registered, regulated and protected by the entity in charge of the enforcement of the  labelling framework);   logo of the EUCS (to be registered, regulated and protected by the entity in charge of the enforcement of the  labelling framework);   QR code pointing to the web portal of ENISA - as per the Article 50 of the CSA – and to the page where the  effective status of the certificate of the cloud service and the information regarding its lifecycle can be retrieved;   CSA assurance level (with the introduction of a specific colour identifying each level);   specific EUCS assurance level;   the sentence “Certified in the European Union”, together with the flag of the EU.  The introduction of the QR code will imply, as defined by Chapter 20 (Disclosure Policy), a procedure for the release of  the QR code.  The demo label only contains summary information. In particular, it does not contain any reference to a date or to an  issuing CAB. The use of the label therefore needs to be be strictly controlled to ensure that:   The label is only used in direct relationship with a certified cloud service;   The label is only used when the corresponding certificate is valid (i.e. after issuance, before withdrawal or  expiration);   The assurance levels and logos mentioned on the label are the appropriate ones for the particular cloud service;  and   The label is only used with the QR-code obtained through the procedure defined in Chapter 20, which points to  ENISA’s Web site.  Compliance monitoring is in charge of ensuring that CSPs comply to these requirements.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  39  11. COMPLIANCE MONITORING  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (j) rules for monitoring compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the requirements  of the European cybersecurity certificates or the EU statements of conformity, including mechanisms to  demonstrate continued compliance with the specified cybersecurity requirements;  🙧  🙥  Without prejudice to NCCA activities defined under Articles 58.7 and 58.8 of the EUCSA, monitoring compliance of  cloud services that have been issued European cybersecurity certificates shall demonstrate their continued compliance  with the specified cybersecurity requirements.  In particular, this monitoring shall allow where possible to avoid and where needed to detect the following general  cases of non-compliance:   a non-compliance in the application by a CSP of the rules and obligations related to a certificate issued on their  cloud services;   a non-compliance in the conditions under which the certification takes place and that are not related to the  individual cloud service;   a nonconformity of a certified cloud service with the EUCS security requirements, which includes and is not limited  to:  o a change in the cloud service itself leading to a change of the cloud service’s security posture;  o a significant security incident that has affected the certified cloud service or has resulted in a data breach or  loss of sensitive information;  o a change in the threat environment after the issuance of the certificate, which has an adverse impact on the  security of the certified cloud service;  o a vulnerability identified and related to the certified cloud service, that has an adverse impact on the security  of the certified cloud service.  The general monitoring of the certified cloud services shall be based on sampling, using generic criteria such as cloud  service capabilities, assurance level, CSP, CAB and any relevant information brought to the knowledge of the NCCA  (e.g., complaints, security events). The NCCAs on their respective territories and in cooperation with other relevant  market surveillance authorities, shall sample annually a minimum of 5% of the cloud services which have been the  subject of a successful conformity assessment in the context of the EUCS scheme in the previous year and at least  one cloud service per annum.  The NCCA shall involve in the monitoring the CAB that has issued the certificate, and if necessary, its subcontractors.  The monitoring shall consist in the re-assessment of the cloud service, together – when necessary – with an audit to  confirm or disprove the above-mentioned relevant information brought to the knowledge of the NCCA. The re-  assessments and audits procedures are defined in Annex G: (Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance).  Where a cloud service is selected the CSP shall be informed of the selection reasons.  Re-assessments and audits shall be financially supported by the CSP.  In addition to this general monitoring, the activities described hereinafter shall be undertaken.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  40  The following deviations and irregularities shall be considered as potential non-compliance elements in the application  by a CSP of the rules and obligations related to a certificate issued on their cloud service:   any deviation from the requirements applicable to the information supplied or made available to a CAB, and that  might be discovered after the emission of a certificate, such as:  o a version of the information delivered that does not correspond to the version of the cloud service when it was  certified;  o self-established evidence that was not in-line with the reality of the cloud service;   any deviation from the requirements regarding the certificate content and the supplementary information as  required by Chapter 9 (Necessary information for certification), Chapter 17 (Certificate Format), Chapter  18  (Availability of Information), and Chapter 23 (Supplementary Information), including and not limited to:  o deviation from referencing the proper cloud service identifiers;  o misalignment of the description of the cloud service scope3;  o deviation from constraints of the certificate including those of Chapter 12 (Certificate Management)4;  o deviations from the conditions of use of the scheme's marks and labels as defined in Chapter 10 (Marks and  Labels);  o undue modifications or alterations of the certificate document as defined in Chapter 17 (Certificate Format);  o omission to declare alteration of supplementary information as defined by Chapter  18 (Availability of  Information);   any deviation from the requirements on the certificate holder’s obligations towards maintaining the certificate  validity, such as:  o failure to apply mandatory maintenance activities;  o failure to implement and enforce mandatory processes as requested by the Terms and Conditions of a  certificate and of the label;  o deviations from the certified cloud service scope, including obligations from Article 56.8 of the EUCSA,  including: undeclared modifications of the cloud service, its development and operating processes, the list of  its dependencies5, or the list of utilized tools6.  Such non-compliance in the application by a CSP of the requirements related to a certificate issued on their cloud  service shall be monitored by:  1. requiring any applicant to a certificate to commit to the CAB to a number of obligations, including but not limited to:  o to transmit information to the CAB deemed reliable and that would not risk falsifying their judgment;  o not to declare a cloud service as certified while the evaluation is still undergoing;  o to declare a cloud service as certified only for the scope specified in the certificate;  o to stop immediately the use of any advertisement mentioning the certification in the event of suspension or  withdrawal of the certification;  o to make sure that the cloud service operated with references to the issued certificate is the one which was the  object of certification7;  o to commit to scrupulously respecting the rules of use of the label established for the scheme; and  o to notify the CAB about significant changes in the certified cloud service, including but limited to changes of  subservice organizations, changes in the supplementary information or in any documentation element that is  provided with the certificate.  2. using the following available dispositive to track the non-respect of the previous obligations:  o the activities of market surveillance established under Article 58.7.(a) of the CSA, with a report to the CAB  who issued the certificate;  o the quality measures in place within the CAB, and the possibility to establish and handle complaints;  3. an assessment of the gravity of the irregularity by the CAB;  3 e.g., failure to describe some of the underlying capabilities that the service relies on.  4 e.g., advertising a certified cloud service after the product certificate has expired.  5 e.g., the introduction of new libraries or tools that may adversely impact security  6 e.g., a change in the tools in the development chain  7 At any time, the operated service must be the result of applying the processes described during  the certification process to the service as it was  certified.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  41  4. using the possibility of the dialog between the CAB and the CSP to try and solve minor issues, and of the  provisions of Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance) where necessary.  The NCCA shall be informed of the results of these activities.  In addition to the activities of market surveillance, the NCCA may establish rules for a periodic dialog between the  issuers of certificates and the certificates owners, as to formally check and report the respect of previously stated  obligations.  ENISA may provide for harmonisation into the EUCS scheme guidance on the commitments that may be part of an  application request, with an indication of the associated gravity.  The following deviations shall be considered as potential issues related to non-compliance in the conditions under  which the certification takes place and that are not related to the individual cloud service:   failure to meet obligations regarding handling complaints towards maintaining the certificate validity, including:  o obligations for auditing the scheme compliance of the CAB, its subcontractors and the certificate holders  related to certificate use as implicitly required by Article 58.8.(b) of the EUCSA;  o obligations for supervising and enforcing CAB’s and certificate holder’s scheme compliance as implicitly  required by Art. 58.7.(a) of the EUCSA;  o obligations for complaint handling as implicitly required by Art. 58.7.(f);   deviations from evaluation requirements:  o unjustified deviations from the evaluation methodology and applicable supporting documents described under  Chapter 8 (Evaluation Methods and Criteria);  o deviations from expected evaluation competence, as described under Chapter 7 (Specific requirements  applicable to a CAB).  Such non-compliance in the conditions under which the certification takes place and that are not related to an  individual cloud service shall:  1. be avoided where possible through:  o the audits permitted through Article 58.8.(b) and (c) of the EUCSA;  o the permanent monitoring of the CAB by their Accreditation bodies and of the CAB’s subcontractors by the  CAB and their Accreditation bodies, as requested by Chapters 7 (Specific requirements applicable to a  CAB).and 22 (Peer Assessment);  2. be detected through:  o the quality process of the CAB, including the report to the NCCA of the identified issue, and the requirement  associated to their accreditation to handle complaints.  The following shall be considered as potential issues of non-conformity of a certified cloud service with its security  requirements:   a change in the cloud service itself leading to a change of the cloud service’s security posture;   a significant security incident that has affected the certified cloud service or has resulted in a data breach or loss  of sensitive information;   a change in the threat environment which has an adverse impact on the security of the certified cloud service;   a vulnerability identified and related to the certified cloud service, that has an adverse impact on the security of the  certified cloud service.  Such non-conformity of a certified cloud service with its security requirements shall be monitored under the following  responsibilities:  1. CSPs shall:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  42  o inform the CAB of major changes in the certified cloud service or in its Information Security Management  System that may have an impact on the statements included in the related certificate;  o monitor any vulnerability that would be relevant to their cloud service, either published by or received from  end users and security researchers as defined in Article 55.1.(c), or discovered by the CSP, and submit an  impact analysis where necessary to their CAB;  o monitor the known dependencies and vulnerabilities identified by any other source that may apply to the  certified cloud service, and submit an impact analysis where necessary to their CAB;  o inform the CAB of any security incident that they notify to regulatory authorities;  o work in cooperation with the CAB and where necessary with the NCCA to support their monitoring activities;  o such activities may be assessed within the certification process of the cloud service, through the controls  defined in the Incident Management category;  2. CABs shall;  o monitor any vulnerability from any source that would be relevant to their scope of evaluation and certification;  o monitor the handling of incidents reported by CSPs; and  o report to their NCCA any detected vulnerability affecting the conformity of a certified cloud service to the  requirements related to the certification.  Where deemed necessary by the CAB or at the discretion of the NCCA, a series of evaluation tasks may be requested  to be performed with the support8 of the CSP as to confirm the impact of a non-conformity.  These activities related to monitoring compliance shall be part of the annual summary report of a NCCA.  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 58, on NCCAs, includes:  7. National cybersecurity certification authorities shall:  (a) supervise and enforce rules included in European cybersecurity certification schemes pursuant to point  (j) of Article 54(1) for the monitoring of the compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the  requirements of the European cybersecurity certificates that have been issued in their respective territories, in  cooperation with other relevant market surveillance authorities;  Article 59, on Peer reviews, includes:  3. Peer review shall assess:  (b) the procedures for supervising and enforcing the rules for monitoring the compliance of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes with European cybersecurity certificates pursuant to point (a) of Article 58(7);  🙧  🙥  The requirements have been established considering:   potential irregularities (as of Article 56.8 of the EUCSA): An irregularity affecting a cloud service’s conformity  arises from the description of the service as stated in the certificate, or in the implementation of the controls  described during the conformity assessment. Though such irregularities are addressed as a cloud service’s non-  compliance post-certification, they may arise any time;   potential gaps into the technical competencies of a CAB;   potential vulnerabilities and modifications of a cloud service or of its environment.  8 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  43  Associated non-compliance issues have been identified and counter-measures for the prevention and detection thereof  established.  This process benefits of the provisions of the EUCSA:   market surveillance installed by Article 58.7.(a);   obligation on auditing the scheme compliance of CABs and certificate holders mandated by Article 58.8.(b);   the right to contest certificates (Article 63.1), and the need to the responsible bodies or authorities to handle  complaints regarding the validity of a certificate (Article 63.2), and therefore service compliance as required by  Article 54.1.(j);   the power of a NCCA – through the power of Article 58.8.(b) – to launch an audit of the certificate holder and  issuer for any purpose related to their compliance to the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework.  As for the CSP’s task to monitor the known dependencies and vulnerabilities: The Terms and Conditions of the  certificate require that a CSP monitors the threat landscape and notifies the CAB about any vulnerability in their  certified cloud service. A CAB or one of their accredited subcontractors may propose CSPs such a service.  As for the CSP’s requirement to report to their CABs security incidents that they report to other regulatory authorities:  the objective is to ensure that the CAB gets notified of significant incidents without adding a significant burden for  CSPs during a crisis. So, no new criteria are here added.  Where necessary, the conditions to support new evaluation activities have been indicated, as they might have a  financial impact.  Finally, the implementation of compliance monitoring by NCCAs may be the subject of peer review between NCCAs,  as defined in Article 59; however, the peer review process is  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  44  12. CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (k) where applicable, the conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing the European  cybersecurity certificates, as well as the conditions for extending or reducing the scope of certification;  Article 56 on Cybersecurity Certification also covers this issue:  9.  A European cybersecurity certificate shall be issued for the period provided for in the European  cybersecurity certification scheme and may be renewed, provided that the relevant requirements continue to be  met.  🙧  🙥  Figure 2: Processes related to the issuance and maintenance of a certificate  The reference standard for these activities is ISO/IEC 17065 and in particular, its Clause 7.10, where ‘changes  affecting a certificate’ are discussed.  Conditions for issuing a certificate  A CAB shall only issue a certificate when:   the applicant has committed to all obligations that need to be fulfilled under this scheme to obtain the certificate;   the evaluation of the cloud service is successful and in line with the evaluation requirements set in this scheme in  Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and  High, and Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic) for the requested assurance level; and  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  45   the review of the evaluation results is successful and in line with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17065 and with the  requirements set in this scheme in Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services) for the  required assurance level.  The review shall be performed independently of the evaluation, and it shall cover all reports provided during the  evaluation to ensure that the conclusions are consistent with the evidence adduced and that the accepted evaluation  criteria and evaluation methods have been correctly applied.  The certificate shall be related to the version of the supplementary cybersecurity information produced by the vendor  as specified in Article 55 of the CSA.  The CAB shall establish a period of validity for the certificate that shall not exceed the maximum period defined in  Chapter 19 (Certificate validity).  Conditions for maintaining a certificate  During the validity period of the certificate, periodic reassessments are required to ensure that the CSP continues to  fulfil the requirements set in this scheme. Such periodic reassessments shall not be separated by more than one year.  This period may be reduced by the CAB if there are specific attention points that require an earlier reassessment.  Maintenance activities shall be initiated upon the following conditions:   when the cloud service has been selected through the sampling rule installed for the general monitoring of  certified cloud service, as defined by Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring) and Annex G: (Certification Lifecycle  and continued assurance);   following a confirmed nonconformity with security requirements, under the conditions defined in Chapter 13 (Non-  Compliance);   following an identified non-compliance with the accreditation requirements of the CAB, the CSA provisions, or the  scheme requirements, that affects the certification.  Maintenance activities may be initiated on the request of the owner of the certificate upon one of the following  conditions:   a periodic reassessment is due to be performed;   a renewal assessment is required to extend the validity period of the certificate;   a change of the certified cloud service requires an update of the content of the certificate of the information  published in compliance to Article 55(1);   a significant change occurs in the certified cloud service or in the design and implementation of the security  measures that fulfil the requirements of this scheme.  Depending on the nature of the previous conditions, and in accordance with the requirements established in  Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring), Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance) and Chapter 14 (New Vulnerabilities), the  maintenance activities shall be triggered at the discretion of the CSP, the CAB, or the NCCA. The National  Accreditation Body may also trigger maintenance activities where a complaint has been issued.  When the maintenance activities are initiated by the CSP, the request to the CAB shall be accompanied with an Impact  Analysis report (IAR), in accordance with Annex G:, Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance.  In all other cases when the maintenance activities are initiated by any other party (CAB, NCCA, and any stakeholder  acting as a sponsor of the associated maintenance activities), the request shall be supported by a maintenance  rationale containing a description of the potential or actual non-conformity or the identified non-compliance stated and  its potential impact on the certificate.  Based on the IAR or the maintenance rationale and on the requirements defined in this scheme for re-assessment or  renewal, the CAB shall validate whether some evaluation tasks are deemed necessary before its review and decision,  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  46  and validate accordingly the scope of and the workload associated to these tasks. The CAB shall also validate the  result of the necessary evaluation tasks once completed.  Typical conformity assessment activities are defined in Annex G:, Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance:   Periodic conformity assessment, including a partial re-assessment of the cloud service, to be performed at regular  intervals, during the validity period of the certificate, as defined in Chapter 19, Certificate validity.   Renewal conformity assessment, including a full re-assessment of the cloud service, to be performed before the  expiration date of the certificate.   Restoration conformity assessment, following a request from a CSP to consider changes in the certified cloud  services, or following a request from a CAB or from the NCCA related to a nonconformity (Chapter 13, Non-  Compliance) or to a new vulnerability (Chapter 14, New Vulnerabilities).  The CSP shall support9 the CAB for the conformity assessment activities deemed necessary, unless otherwise  specified in Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance).  Upon review and decision of the CAB, the maintenance activities shall result in one the following decisions:   continuing the certificate, corresponding to keeping the existing certificate alive, without change;   updating the certificate to reflect some changes in the certified cloud service, including an extension of its scope;   renewing the certificate with a new validity period and optionally some updates, corresponding to re-issuing the  same certificate with a new validity period;   withdrawing the certificate, and issuing a certificate with either a reduced assurance level, or a reduced scope of  the certificate to still meet the current assurance level, potentially with a new validity period;   suspending the certificate pending remedial action by the CSP;   withdrawing the certificate.  Decisions shall be accompanied with a Maintenance Report issued by the CAB, in accordance with Annex G:  (Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance), and uniquely linked to the certificate; it shall motivate the decision  and, where applicable, indicate any necessary change to the initial certificate.  In the case no maintenance has been requested for a certificate that has reached its expiration date, in the case no  maintenance has been requested when a periodic assessment is due, or more generally in the case a maintenance  shall be initiated and no action was taken by any of the responsible parties in due time the certificate shall be  suspended and the CSP notified of the non-compliance. If the CSP does not perform the maintenance in due time (as  defined in Chapter 13, Non-Compliance), then the certificate shall be withdrawn.  All withdrawn certificates shall be subject to archiving. Archiving shall consist of still providing access to the certificate  and associated information, with the clear indication of its withdrawal, for instance that its expiration date has passed.  The following table shall be considered by the CAB to support the appropriate decision on most frequent possible  cases.  Table 4: Nominal decisions associated with the maintenance of certificates  Cases Nominal decisions  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils  the requirements without significant changes in the service  Continue the certificate until the next periodic assessment  or until its expiration date  9 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  47  Cases Nominal decisions  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils  the requirements and the changes impact the security of users  without any reduction in the scope of certification or assurance  level  Update the certificate with the new information and  continue the certificate until the next periodic assessment  or until its expiration date  A renewal conformity assessment has been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils  the requirements, possibly with changes that impact the security  of users without any reduction in the scope of certification or  assurance level  Renew the certificate with a new expiration date and if  required with the new information  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service only fulfils  the requirements after reducing the scope of certification or  reducing the assurance level  Withdraw the certificate and issue a new certificate with the  reduced scope or assurance level, possibly with a different  expiration date  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, have determined that the cloud service does not fulfil  the requirements anymore, and action from the CSP is possible  to maintain the certificate at the same assurance level and scope,  though not immediately,  or improper use of the certificate is not solved by suitable  retractions and appropriate corrective actions by the CSP.  Suspend the certificate pending remedial action from the  CSP  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service does not  fulfil the requirements anymore  Withdraw the certificate  The periodic assessment has not been performed in due time Suspend the certificate pending remedial action from the  CSP  Remediation action has not been performed in due time after  suspension  Withdraw the certificate  A certificate shall only remain in the ‘suspended’ status for a maximum duration of 3 months that may only be extended  with the explicit and motivated approval of the NCCA. In case no action is taken by the vendor in due time the status of  certificate shall be changed into ‘withdrawn’ by the CAB.  Any change of the status of a certificate shall be disclosed without undue delay according to the requirements of  Chapter 20 (Disclosure Policy).  RATIONALE  Requirements have been established considering the requirements associated with ISO/IEC 17065, and ISO/IEC  17067, Conformity assessment - Fundamentals of product certification and guidelines for product certification  schemes.  The full life cycle of a certificate, starting from its issuance with a defined validity period till its due or potential  expiration (by validity period or preliminary to this due to a selection under the sampling rules for the general  monitoring of certificates, a potential or actual non-conformity with security requirements, or an identified non-  compliance with the accreditation requirements of the CAB, the EUCSA provisions, or the scheme requirements) has  been considered.  One fundamental condition for issuing a certificate for the cloud service is successful evaluation, based on the present  scheme. Other conditions stem from relevant provisions of the EUCSA, such as necessary authorizations for CAB  based on Article 60.3 of the EUCSA which are external to the certification in its technical meaning, and may, if not  fulfilled after certification, be considered as non-conformance cases.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  48  All other certification activities are related to the phase after the certificate is issued, where ‘a change affecting  certification’ occurs as mentioned in ISO/IEC 17065. These activities are described as ‘maintenance’. In that case, the  CAB is obliged to act in response to a given trigger.  Wording from ISO/IEC 17065 describing all relevant activities related to the certificate which has been issued applies  (see Clause 7.10).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  49  13. NON-COMPLIANCE  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (l) rules concerning the consequences for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that have been  certified or for which an EU statement of conformity has been issued, but which do not comply with the  requirements of the scheme;.  🙧  🙥  Chapter 11, Rules for monitoring compliance, defines several categories of non-compliance instances that may be  uncovered through monitoring activities. When such non-compliance instances are uncovered, the consequences for  the various stakeholders, including the CSP, the CAB and its subcontractors, and the NCCA, are as follows.  For confirmed deviations or irregularities associated to non-compliance by a CSP to the requirements related to a  certificate issued on their cloud service, the following consequences shall occur in the general case:   the CAB who has issued the certificate shall request the CSP for assertions and amendments to restore  compliance, to be provided within the time frame of 14 days for certificates at the assurance level ‘high’, or 30  days for certificates at the assurance levels ‘basic’ or ‘substantial’;   continued non-compliance past the allowed time frame shall trigger a suspension of the certificate for the cloud  service, a suspension of all certification activities by the CAB on behalf of the CSP for other services, with  information about the suspension by the CAB to the NCCA.  In the particular case of a confirmed deviation from the requirements of the certificate holder’s obligations towards  maintaining the certificate validity, or towards informing the appropriate authorities or bodies of any subsequently  detected vulnerabilities, as requested by Article 56.8 of the CSA, the following consequences shall occur:   an immediate suspension of the certificate, with information about the suspension by the CAB to the NCCA.  For a cloud service certified at assurance level High, in the case of a confirmed deviation from the requirements of the  certificate holder’s obligation of informing the appropriate authorities or bodies of any subsequently detected major  nonconformity to the requirements of the scheme through continuous monitoring, the following consequences shall  occur   an immediate suspension of the certificate, with information about the suspension by the CAB to the NCCA.  The notification of the owner of a certificate of the suspension of the certificate shall mark the beginning of a  suspension period of 14 days for certificates at the assurance level High, or 30 days for certificates at the assurance  levels Basic or Substantial. During this period:   the impact of the non-compliance on the certified cloud service shall be estimated with the necessary support10 of  the CSP;  10 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  50   when the non-compliance is verified to impact a certificate, this shall be treated as a non-conformity of the certified  cloud service, the CAB who has issued the certificate shall request the CSP for assertions and amendments to  restore compliance;   the CSP shall accept or refuse the handling of the verified nonconformity and the associated maintenance  activities, as defined in Chapter 12 (Conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing certificates);   when the handling is refused, the certificate shall be withdrawn;   when the handling is accepted, the CSP shall proceed to the necessary changes to the cloud service   when the defined period is not sufficient for the above described task, the issuer of the certificate, upon receiving a  duly justified request, may extend the grace period, no more than three times the above described duration;   when necessary (e.g. lack of availability of the CAB), the CAB may decide to further extend the suspension period  up to a maximum of 90 days;   if at the end of the suspension period, the handling of the verified non-conformity and the associate maintenance  activities have not been completed, then the certificate shall be withdrawn.  ENISA shall be informed for publication on its website, and provided with all the information to be published:   at the suspension of the certificate;   at any extension of the suspension period;   at the end of the suspension of the certificate;   at the withdrawal of the certificate.  In the case of a suspension or of the extension of a suspension, the information provided to be published to ENISA  shall include at least the end date of the suspension period, the reason for the suspension, and recommendations for  the users of the certificates.  The NCCA shall be informed at any extension of a suspension period.  For a confirmed non-compliance in the conditions under which the certification takes place and that are not related to  the individual cloud service, the concerned CAB shall proceed, under the control of the NCCA, to the following:   the identification, with the support of relevant teams and subcontractors, of potentially impacted certified cloud  services;   where deemed necessary by the CAB, or at the discretion of the NCCA, the request for a series of conformity  assessment activities to be performed on one or more cloud services by either the CAB or subcontractor who  performed the audit or any other CAN or subcontractor that would be in a better technical position to perform  these activities, leading to updated assurance reports;   the review by the CAB of the updated assurance reports, and where necessary, the re-issuance of certificates in  accordance with the requirements of Chapter 12 (Conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing  certificates), or the notification to the CSPs of the impacts of the non-compliance on their certificates.  These activities shall occur within the maximum period of 14 days for certificates at assurance level High or 30 days for  certificates at assurance levels Basic and Substantial, which may only be extended after approval by the NCCA.  When a CAB or the NCCA mandates new evaluation activities to be performed, these activities and the related review  and issuance activities shall be supported11 by the CAB that proved to be non-compliant12.  Where impacts are confirmed to affect a certificate, they shall be treated as a nonconformity of the certified cloud  service, following the above-defined rules.  11 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  12 Or by a subcontractor of the CAB if that subcontractor proved to be non-compliant in breach of its contractual obligations.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  51  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Recitals provide additional information:  (65) National cybersecurity certification authorities should in particular monitor and enforce the obligations of  manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes established in its respective territory  in relation to the EU statement of conformity, should assist the national accreditation bodies in the monitoring  and supervision of the activities of conformity assessment bodies by providing them with expertise and relevant  information, should authorise conformity assessment bodies to carry out their tasks where such bodies meet  additional requirements set out in a European cybersecurity certification scheme, and should monitor relevant  developments in the field of cybersecurity certification. National cybersecurity certification authorities should also  handle complaints lodged by natural or legal persons in relation to European cybersecurity certificates issued by  those authorities or in relation to European cybersecurity certificates issued by conformity assessment bodies,  where such certificates indicate assurance level ‘high’, should investigate, to the extent appropriate, the subject  matter of the complaint and should inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation  within a reasonable period. Moreover, national cybersecurity certification authorities should cooperate with other  national cybersecurity certification authorities or other public authorities, including by the sharing of information  on the possible non-compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the requirements of this  Regulation or with specific European cybersecurity certification schemes. The Commission should facilitate that  sharing of information by making available a general electronic information support system, for example the  Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance (ICSMS) and the Rapid Alert System for  dangerous non-food products (RAPEX), already used by market surveillance authorities pursuant to Regulation  (EC) No 765/2008.  🙧  🙥  This is a rather simple set of rules:   The main ruleset is about non-conformity in the cloud service (and its operation). The way in which it is discovered  is not mentioned here, most likely through monitoring or complaints.  o In that ruleset, the CSP has an opportunity to fix the issue without any visible consequence (no suspension,  no withdrawal).  o If they fail to do this timely, then a suspension occurs.  o There is one exception, when a CSP fails in its continued assurance and maintenance duties; then, the  suspension occurs directly. This is intended to highlight the responsibility of the CSP to continue working on  security after the issuance of the certificate; also, it highlights the fact that, at that stage, the CAB only gets  involved (with an opportunity to perform evaluation activities) if the CSP reports issues as planned.   The second ruleset is about what happens when a suspension occurs (directly or after failure to act swiftly when a  non-conformity is discovered.  o Another delay starts running, this time with notification of the NCCA, and with publicity through ENISA’s Web  site (including automated notification of customers who have registered for updates on the certificate with  ENISA).  o If need be, the delay can be extended, when duly justified. The NCCA is notified of extensions, and my signal  at some point that “enough is enough”.  o When the delay expires, withdrawal occurs; withdrawal may also occur if the CSP refuses to implement  corrective actions.   The third ruleset is about what happens when a CAB fails to do their work properly.  o All certificates issued by that CAB have to be reviewed. That review may involve some work.  o If that review shows that certificates are impacted, then some evaluation work may need to be redone, as well  as the corresponding review work, and if needed, the modification of the certificate.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  52  o CSPs are notified when their certificates are impacted, but they are no held directly responsible of the work  that needs to be redone. However, if a non-conformity is identified in their cloud service during that review,  then this non-conformity needs to be handled following the first ruleset (and the second if needed).  In all cases, the entity responsible for the non-conformity is responsible for supporting the additional work, including,  but not limited to, additional costs.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  53  14. NEW VULNERABILITIES  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (m) rules concerning how previously undetected cybersecurity vulnerabilities in ICT products, ICT services  and ICT processes are to be reported and dealt with;  🙧  🙥  Vulnerability handling  CSPs shall use the general steps of ISO/IEC 30111 for vulnerability handling: preparation, receipt, verification,  remediation development, release, post release, with the following specific application rules for the EUCS scheme.  These rules are defined in the present chapter, as well as in the definition of the security controls related to incident  management, in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  PREPARATION  CSPs shall develop methods for receiving vulnerability information and make them public in accordance with Article  55.1.c) of the CSA.  RECEIPT  In the following cases where:   the CSP of the certified cloud service receives vulnerability information according to Article 55.1.(c) of the EUCSA;   there is a new publicly disclosed vulnerability on the referenced online repositories according to Article 55.1.(d) of  the EUCSA;   the CSP finds out a related vulnerability to its certified cloud service in any other way,  The CSP shall start handling the vulnerability according to its defined policies and procedures. If the vulnerability  analysis determines that the risk for the cloud service related to the vulnerability is major13, then the CSP shall report  without delay to the CAB that issued the certificate a description of the vulnerability, together with a description of its  impact.  The time between the CSP learns about the vulnerability and the notification of the CAB shall not exceed five (5)  working days. Failure to notify the CAB of a vulnerability with major impact or to do so within five (5) working days shall  be considered as a non-compliance to the rules of the scheme, as defined in Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance).  At the time the CSP notifies the CAB, the analysis of the vulnerability may not be finalized. In such a case, the CSP  shall provide to the CAB a delay for the delivery of the full analysis, which shall not exceed ninety (90) days after the  CSP became aware of the vulnerability.  The information may contain details about the possible exploit(s) of the vulnerability: in that case, it shall carry the  appropriate TLP classification as to ensure the relevant protection, in accordance with the standard rules defined in  13 According to the CSP’s own vulnerability assessment scale, which shall be defined as part of its vulnerability handling policy, as required in  Annex  Annex A:, Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services, and shall consider the potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation of  the vulnerability in the context of the cloud service.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  54  https://www.first.org/tlp/, or with alternative classification and mechanisms previously agreed between the CSP and the  CAB.  VERIFICATION AND REMEDIATION DEVELOPMENT  In addition to the security controls defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), the  CSP’s processes shall include the following steps:   In its analysis of the vulnerability with major impact, the CSP shall propose (1) whether or not the certificate should  be suspended until a remediation is released, and (2) whether or not a restoration conformity assessment should  be performed on the cloud service after remediation. The CAB shall agree on the proposed actions or make  alternative proposals within five (5) working days. When both parties deem necessary or are unable to agree on  such decisions, they may inform the NCCA and ask for its advice.   If a maintenance conformity assessment has been deemed necessary, it shall be performed before lifting a  potential suspension of the certificate.  RELEASE AND POST-RELEASE  There are no specific rules related to these phases, beyond the requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives  and requirements for Cloud Services).  Vulnerability disclosure  CSPs may use the following standard as for the general rules related to vulnerability disclosure:   ISO/IEC 29147 Information technology – Security techniques – Vulnerability disclosure.  During the vulnerability analysis, the cloud service may apply an embargo period, meaning that the possible  vulnerability is not further disclosed. This period shall not last longer than three (3) months. The NCCA may, however,  consider extending this period when a justified request is received, in particular when it is confirmed that time must be  given to downstream vendors integrating the cloud service for analysing the impact of the vulnerability (both from a  technical and certification point of view).  In addition to the general disclosure rules above, once a strategy to correct the issue has been defined by the CSP  with the approval of the CAB, information related to the confirmed vulnerability shall be disclosed to the NCCA, in  accordance with Article 56.8) of the CSA.  The information shall not contain details about the possible exploit of the vulnerability. It shall contain the necessary  elements for the NCCA to understand the impact of the vulnerability, the changes to be brought to the cloud service,  and where applicable, information by the CAB on the broader applicability of the vulnerability to other certified cloud  services.  The NCCA shall in accordance with Article 58 7 h) share this information with the other NCCAs, which may also decide  to further analyse the problem or, after informing the CSP about the information exchange, ask the related CABs to  analyse whether further certified cloud services are affected. This information exchange shall be done in confidentiality,  including application of encryption and need-to-know principle.  When a correction has been brought to the certified cloud service, the CSP shall establish the necessary CVE with the  support of the NCCA and related national CSIRT, and proceed to its publication on the relevant list, in accordance with  the requirements of Article 55 of the CSA. ENISA shall be informed of the changes of status of the related certificates.  NCCAs may develop their capacity to act as “coordinators” as defined in ISO/IEC 29147, and alternatively, designate  their national CSIRT to play this role. In that case, the CSIRT shall have access to the necessary details related to the  vulnerabilities and to the certificated cloud services.  https://www.first.org/tlp/  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  55  RATIONALE  The current description has been strongly inspired from the EUCC, with a few significant simplifications. In particular,  there is no mention of an attack potential in the analysis of a vulnerability.  This requirement has been replaced by a decision about the suspension and the need to perform another conformity  assessment (which is only expected when an incident is linked to a dysfunction in the application of processes).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  56  15. RECORD RETENTION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (n) where applicable, rules concerning the retention of records by conformity assessment bodies;  🙧  🙥  Each CAB shall maintain a records system in accordance with the requirements of the accreditation standard ISO/IEC  17065 (or to the applicable accreditation standard for its internal or external evaluation facilities, e.g. ISO/IEC17021-3).  The records system shall include all records and other documents produced in connection with each conformity  assessment, as well as documents and evidence provided by the CSP about the implementation of security controls;  the record system shall also include a list of all the documents and evidence made available temporarily by the CSP  during the conformity assessment. It shall be sufficiently complete to enable the course of each certification to be  traced.  All records shall be securely and accessibly stored for a period of at least seven (7) years after the expiration or  withdrawal of the certificate.  In case a later expiration date of the certificate is attributed in accordance with the conditions of Chapter 12 (Certificate  Management), it shall be taken into account for the new calculation of the retention period of the records, with the  same rule as previously stated. New or revised information related to the activities described under Chapter 12  (Certificate Management) shall be added to the previous records for the certificate.  RATIONALE  The proposal consists is to require records to be kept for seven (7) years after the expiration of the certificate, or until  legal actions related to the certificate are completed.  If the certificate is renewed, then the records are kept for seven (7) years after the new date, with a full history of the  certificate, including records related to all conformity assessments.  Also, there is a split responsibility between the CAB and the CSP regarding the documents and evidence that the CSP  made available in a restricted manner to the CAB: It is the CSP’s responsibility to keep these records, while the CAB  only maintains a list of the documents.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  57  16. RELATED SCHEMES  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (o) the identification of national or international cybersecurity certification schemes covering the same type  or categories of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, security requirements, evaluation criteria and  methods, and assurance levels;  🙧  🙥  Within the EU, the following national cybersecurity certification schemes cover the same type or categories of services:   The SecNumCloud scheme in France, operated by ANSSI:  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/prestataires-  de-service-dinformatique-en-nuage-secnumcloud/   The C5 methodology in Germany, defined by BSI:  https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Kriterienkatalog/Kriterienkatalog_node.  html   The Zeker-Online scheme in the Netherlands, operated by the Zeker-Online foundation:  https://www.zeker-online.nl  These schemes only provide a partial coverage of the requirements provided in the present scheme, and they also  include some requirements that have not been included in the present scheme14. In particular, each scheme defines  only a single assurance level.  Nevertheless, it shall be considered that:   a certificate issued under these schemes may where necessary15 be transformed into a certificate under the  EUCS scheme if all required activities are conducted;   a CAB may accept to use the results of evaluation activities performed under these schemes for a certification  under the EUCS scheme;   a certificate issued under these schemes may be used for certifications under the EUCS scheme whereby the  CSP uses the certificate as assurance documentation for subservice organizations until its period of validity, if  evaluation work confirms that the subservice meets all requirements of the EUCS scheme.  ENISA may establish associated guidance as to support the conditions related to these possibilities. This guidance  shall be established in cooperation with the ECCG.  Based on the recommendations established by this Chapter, the European Commission and EU Member States may  consider to establish a date of one (1) year after the implementing act has been adopted pursuant to Article 49(7) for  existing schemes to cease producing effect.  14 In most cases, the requirements that have not been included are related to aspects beyond security, to aspects that are not relevant in a cybersecurity  certification scheme, for instance related to procurement, or to aspects that are covered differently in the EUCS scheme.  15 To satisfy market or regulatory requirements.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/prestataires-de-service-dinformatique-en-nuage-secnumcloud/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/prestataires-de-service-dinformatique-en-nuage-secnumcloud/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Kriterienkatalog/Kriterienkatalog_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Kriterienkatalog/Kriterienkatalog_node.html https://www.zeker-online.nl/  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  58  Some of these schemes may continue to run conformity assessment activities covering the same type or category of  ICT services, security requirements, evaluation criteria and methods and go beyond the scope of the EUCS scheme in  terms of assurance levels or requirements.  Further to these National schemes, no international schemes have been identified that cover the same services,  security requirements, evaluation criteria and methods.  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 57 provides additional information regarding National cybersecurity schemes and certificates:  1.  Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, national cybersecurity certification schemes, and the related  procedures for the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that are covered by a European cybersecurity  certification scheme shall cease to produce effects from the date established in the implementing act adopted  pursuant to Article 49(7). National cybersecurity certification schemes and the related procedures for the ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes that are not covered by a European cybersecurity certification  scheme shall continue to exist.  2.  Member States shall not introduce new national cybersecurity certification schemes for ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes already covered by a European cybersecurity certification scheme that is in force.  🙧  🙥  We acknowledge in this chapter that there were pre-existing schemes in Europe; these schemes were very different in  nature, in some cases not even issuing any kind of declaration (like Germany’s C5). Nevertheless, the companies who  went through a conformity assessment using one of these schemes have been gathering evidence, which led to an  analysis by a CAB, and some of this information may be relevant for EUCS conformity assessments.  Out of the three reuse hypotheses included, the first one (transformation of a certificate) is the least likely to be used,  because the differences are quite significant. The reuse of evidence and of evaluation results, though, could lead to  significant optimizations of the evaluation process. Finally, the use of previously issued documentation (certificates,  reports) as a basis for composition may allow smaller vendors, who rely on someone else’s infrastructure to get started  earlier with their certification.  Regarding the details of such reuse, we are following the path set by the EUCC scheme by allowing these details to be  provided later, in a guidance issued by ENISA and elaborated with the Member States through the ECCG.  We have also proposed to delay the issuance of certificates through the scheme for one year, giving the community  enough time to develop the required guidance. This is covered in greater details in Chapter 25 (Further  Recommendations).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  59  17. CERTIFICATE FORMAT  Foreword for Reviewers  This chapter is still work in progress.  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (p) the content and the format of the European cybersecurity certificates and the EU statements of  conformity to be issued;  🙧  🙥  RATIONALE  A proposal for the Certification Report format is included in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements). A  proposed format for the certificate itself will be added later.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  60  18. AVAILABILITY OF  INFORMATION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (q) the period of the availability of the EU statement of conformity, technical documentation, and all other  relevant information to be made available by the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes;  🙧  🙥  Each CSP shall maintain a publication system for the information to be made available to the public, in accordance  with the procedures described in Chapter 23 (Supplementary Information) for the Supplementary cybersecurity  information.  All information shall be available for a period of at least seven (7) years after the expiration or withdrawal of the  certificate.  In case a later expiration date of the certificate is attributed in accordance with the activities described under  Chapter 12 (Certificate Management), it shall be taken into account for the calculation of the availability period of the  information, with the same rule as previously stated.  Available information shall be updated with the new or revised information related to the activities performed under  Chapter 12 (Certificate Management).  Records of information made available to the CAB for the conformity assessment process shall be stored securely, and  made available on its request to the CAB or the NCCA (according to Article 58.8(a) of the EUCSA) up to five years  after expiration of the certification, in line with the duration established under Chapter 15 (Record Retention). These  records shall include all documentation and evidence made available to the CAB during the conformity assessment,  including those that were only made available in a restricted manner, for a limited time or only on the CSP’s premises.  Over the period of validity of a certificate, some of the information associated to the cloud service may be deprecated  and replaced by new information, and the need to maintain available information on the cloud service only relates to  the valid and up-to-date information. The deprecated information shall still be archived for the duration of the related  certificate when the information was deprecated plus seven (7) years.  RATIONALE  The period of retention for CSPs shall not be shorter than the retention of records by the CAB that is of seven (7) years  after the end of validity period of the certificate. This applies in particular to the information made available in a  restricted manner to the CAB, which is retained under the sole responsibility of the CSP, whereas the CAB only  maintains a list of the records made available).  It is to be noted that CSPs may however have to extend this period, in order to comply with other regulations that state  a different period of availability of documentation, up to ten (10) years.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  61  19. CERTIFICATE VALIDITY  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (r) maximum period of validity of European cybersecurity certificates issued under the scheme;  🙧  🙥  The maximum period of validity of the certificates shall be three (3) years. In order to maintain the validity of the  certificate for its full period of validity, the CSP shall follow the processes defined in in Chapter 12 (Certificate  Management), and the certified cloud service shall be subject to a periodic conformity assessment or to a renewal  conformity assessment at most one (1) year after the previous initial, periodic, or renewal conformity assessment.  Under certain conditions, and following the processes defined in Chapter 12 (Certificate Management), a CAB may  continue a certificate with an extended validity period beyond the initial three (3) years.  RATIONALE  According to the large variety of cloud services that can be certified under this scheme, to their and evolution (often  with frequent updates), to the various levels of assurance that can be achieved and the associated effort to generate  assurance that the scheme’s requirements are fulfilled, an average maximum of three (3) years was selected for the  general case.  Since this is a maximum, it remains possible to issue a certificate for a shorter period of time, in particular if the CAB  believes that issuing a certificate for three (3) years would lead to potential risks.  The chapter also defines the 1-year limit between periodic assessments. This limit applies to all levels, but the nature  of the activities to be performed depends on the level.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  62  20. DISCLOSURE POLICY  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (s) disclosure policy for European cybersecurity certificates issued, amended or withdrawn under the  scheme;  🙧  🙥  The certificates shall be disclosed by ENISA, with the related certification report and any relevant information as  requested by other chapters of this document, in a dedicated website on European cybersecurity certification schemes,  in accordance with Article 50.1 of the CSA.  The certificates shall be disclosed with their applicable status, as decided through the application of the requirements  established by Chapter 12 (Certificate Management) and Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance).  The certificates may also be disclosed by the NCCAs and the issuing CABs on their websites. Any change to the  status of a certificate shall be reported to the NCCA and to ENISA.  Amendments and withdrawals of certificates resulting from maintenance activities shall as well be published, in a way  that users of certificates can identify which versions of a certified cloud service are certified (where applicable) and  which relevant information shall apply (such as guidance).  ENISA shall establish in cooperation with the ECCG the conditions and/or guidance for the delivery and for the  publication in due time of certificates and their updates, and associated relevant information, and shall make them  publicly available on its website dedicated to cybersecurity certification.  Such information on the website on European cybersecurity certification schemes shall be available in English  language. It shall be available at least for the entire period of validity of the certificate.  The certificates may be complemented with additional information, such as a QR-code providing a direct link to the  corresponding certificate and related information, as to offer a better user experience and to publicise the certificates.  ENISA may therefore establish a procedure for the generation of a QR-code: such procedure may imply that CABs,  ahead of the release of a certificate, request from ENISA the generation of the QR-code to be applied on the certificate  and provided to the CSPs for their commercial and technical documents.  CSPs may use certificates published on ENISA’s website for commercial purposes, but they shall not modify the  certificate, and in particular, they shall always include a link to the original certificate on ENISA’s website to allow  customers to check the current status of the certificate. Only cloud services with a valid certificate shall be promoted as  certified cloud services by their relevant CSP, or users of these services.  If a certificate is suspended, the information published on ENISA’s website shall include the date of the end of the  suspension period, a reason for the suspension, as well as recommendations for the users of the certificate.  Once a certificate has expired or has been withdrawn, ENISA shall move it to a dedicated archive part of the website,  where it shall remain available for at least (5) years. CSPs shall not refer to such expired or withdrawn certificates in  their commercial information, and any access to the expired or withdrawn certificate through its initial URL or QR-code  shall lead to the prominent display of the current status of the certificate.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  63  RATIONALE  ENISA will publish the certificates with appropriate relevant information attached. To manage accurate and up to date  dataflows, ENISA will establish conditions and/or guidance for the delivery and publication of information.  In accordance with Chapter 17 (Certificate Format), both certificates and associated certification reports, as well as  relevant information for the secure configuration and usage of the certified cloud service (guidance) shall be made  available to the users (and potential users) of certificates. Amendments to certificate will also need to contain the same  type of information as the issuance of certificates, including guidance, and users shall be given an easy access to the  status of the certificates when using ENISA dedicated Website.  As to offer an easy access to the Supplementary cybersecurity information defined by Article 55, a validated link to that  information will be made available into the certificate.  ENISA shall be informed without undue delay of the evolution of the certificates, be it an amendment or a withdrawal,  in line with the requirements of relevant Chapters of this scheme and Recital 93 of the CSA.  As to offer the necessary flexibility and enforcing character of the conditions for presentation of the information to  ENISA, and for its publication, ENISA will establish generic conditions and/or guidance.  The generic conditions and/or guidance should make sure information is accurate and up to date as the information  provided by ENISA could act as a single point of reference. It should define what information is to be transmitted to  ENISA and within what reasonable timeframe. According to principles of transparency and openness, the outlines of  these conditions/guidance should be made public on the ENISA Website.  As to promote valid certificates, certificates that have expired will be archived and made available on a different  webpage than the valid ones.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  64  21. MUTUAL RECOGNITION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (t) conditions for the mutual recognition of certification schemes with third countries;  🙧  🙥  The mutual recognition of certification schemes with third countries shall be supported by the establishment of a  Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) between the participants.  This MRA may include the following information:   participants to the MRA;   purpose and spirit of the Agreement;   membership;   scope;   exceptions;   definitions;   conditions for recognition of certificates;   peer assessments;   publications;   sharing of Information;   acceptance of new participants and compliant authorities or bodies;   administration of this Agreement;   disagreements;   costs of this Agreement;   revision;   duration;   voluntary termination of participation;   commencement and continuation;   effect of this Agreement.  Conditions for recognition of certificates by participants to such an Agreement shall include at a minimum the following  conditions:   the participants shall commit themselves to recognise applicable conformant certificates by any accepted  Participant;   acceptance of participants shall confirm that the evaluation and certification processes have been carried out in a  duly professional manner:  o on the basis of commonly accepted ICT security evaluation criteria;  o using commonly accepted ICT security evaluation methods;  o in the context of an evaluation and certification scheme managed by a compliant certification body in the  accepted participant's country;  o the conformant certificates and certification reports issued satisfy the objectives of this Agreement;   certificates which meet all these conditions shall be termed as conformant certificates for the purposes of this  Agreement;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  65   ICT security evaluation criteria are to be those laid down in Chapter 8 (Evaluation Methods and Criteria) of this  document;   minimum requirements for Certification Reports are laid down in Annex 13 to this document;   the scheme of the participants or to which the participants adhere shall be organised with a proper National  Authority and conformity assessment bodies (CABs), in accordance with the following requirements:  o the National Authority supervises the certification activities, notifies and authorises where applicable CABs,  and reports any vulnerability of certified cloud services to the NCCAs of the EU participants;  o the CAB has been accredited in its respective country by a recognised Accreditation Body in accordance with  ISO/IEC 17065 and has been authorised where necessary by the National Authority;  o the CAB is accepted as compliant by the Participants through a peer assessment mechanism installed for the  MRA;  o the CAB has been where necessary subject to an assessment by the National Authority in order to confirm its  competence to perform evaluations, in accordance with Chapter 7 (Specific requirements applicable to a  CAB) of this document;   in order to assist the consistent application of the criteria and methods between evaluation and certification  schemes, the participants plan to work towards a uniform interpretation of the currently applicable criteria and  methods and commit to accept the supporting documents that results from this work. In pursuit of this goal, the  participants also plan to conduct regular exchanges of information on interpretations and discussions necessary to  resolve differences of interpretation;   in further aid to the goal of consistent, credible and competent application of the criteria and methods, the  certification bodies shall undertake the responsibility for the monitoring of all evaluations in progress within the  MRA at an appropriate level, and carrying out other procedures to ensure that all CABs:  o perform evaluations impartially;  o apply the criteria and methods correctly and consistently;  o have and maintain the required technical competencies;  o adequately protect the confidentiality of sensitive or protected information.  The MRA may include a limitation of the assurance level of the certificates subject to recognition.  CAB(s) of the participants of such an Agreement that issue(s) certificates at the equivalent assurance level ‘high’ of the  CSA shall be subject to peer assessments in line with the procedure set up in this scheme (Annex H:, Peer  assessment).  The procedure may be adapted and simplified for the CABs that issue certificates at the equivalent assurance levels  ‘basic’ or ‘substantial’ of the CSA as to benefit from the international Accreditation system, and shall at least consist of  the following activities by the peer assessment team regarding review of the:   documentation associated to 2 certification projects of the ‘substantial’ assurance level;   procedures associated to the security of information.  RATIONALE  Additional input from the EUCSA  The context for mutual recognition is provided in the EUCA recitals:  (104) In order to further facilitate trade, and recognising that ICT supply chains are global, mutual recognition  agreements concerning European cybersecurity certificates may be concluded by the Union in accordance with  Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Commission, taking into  account the advice from ENISA and the European Cybersecurity Certification Group, may recommend the  opening of relevant negotiations. Each European cybersecurity certification scheme should provide specific  conditions for such mutual recognition agreements with third countries.  🙧  🙥  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  66  The text is here strongly inspired from the EUCC scheme, around which some MRAs already exist. In the context of  the EUCS scheme, a number of parameters, including the evaluation criteria and methods, are specific to the scheme;  mutual recognition is therefore likely to be possible only with third countries that will operate a scheme locally that use  the criteria and methods defined in the EUCS scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  67  22. PEER ASSESSMENT  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (u) where applicable, rules concerning any peer assessment mechanism established by the scheme for the  authorities or bodies issuing European cybersecurity certificates for assurance level ‘high’ pursuant to Article  56(6). Such mechanism shall be without prejudice to the peer review provided for in Article 59;  🙧  🙥  The EUCS scheme requires that each authority16 or body issuing certificates at the assurance level High undergo a  peer assessment at periodic intervals.  While every authority or body issuing certificates for assurance level ‘high’ pursuant to Article 56.6 of the EUCSA,  including their subcontractors, shall operate under its own responsibility, a peer assessment shall be established for  those issuing EUCS certificates at level High to:   assess that they work in a harmonised way and produce the same quality of certificates;   allow the reuse of certificates for composite service certification, as offered by Chapter 3 (Purpose of the scheme),  including the reuse of a certified cloud service’s evaluation results when used as base component in a composite  service;   identify any potential strength that result out of their daily work and that may benefit to others;   identify any potential weakness that result out of their daily work and that shall to be considered for improvement  by the peer assessed CAB;   find a harmonised way to handle nonconformities and vulnerabilities and exchange best practices regarding the  handling of complaints.  Note: The peer assessment is not intended to interfere with or make judgement to the activities performed by the  NCCA, as this is the subject of the peer review process as required by Article 59 of EUCSA. Nor shall it interfere with  or make judgement to the activities performed by the National Accreditation Body (NAB).  In order to allow timely feedback with respect to questions of the national aspects of the scheme that are handled by  the NCCA, a representative of the NCCA of the assessed CAB shall participate to the peer assessment.  The peer assessment of each CAB issuing certificates of assurance level ‘high’ shall take place on a regular basis,  with a periodic interval that shall not exceed five (5) years.  The ECCG17  shall establish and maintain a planning of peer assessments ensuring that this periodicity is respected,  and take into consideration the level of priority that may be given to the peer assessment of a CAB issuing certificates  at the assurance level ‘high’ in case of alleged non-compliance of this CAB, and in case of CBs with recent activity  engaged in certifications for the first time or after a long lasting break (more than two years).  16 From the perspective of peer assessment, an authority that is issuing certificates as the assurance level high should be considered as a CAB, and  participate in the same way to peer assessment.  17 The ECCG may establish a dedicated subgroup to handle peer assessments, based on the organisation to be installed for the maintenance of the  EUCS scheme (see Chapter 25, Further Recommendations).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  68  In the case of Article 56.6.(a) of the EUCSA, both the CAB issuing the certificates and the NCCA proceeding to the  prior approval for each individual certificate shall be subject to the peer assessment. This shall include the procedure  established by of the NCCA for prior approval for each individual certificate.  In the case of Article 56.6.(b) of the CSA, both the CAB issuing the certificates and the NCCA shall be subject to the  peer assessment. This shall include the general delegation requirements defined by the NCCA.  Peer assessments shall follow the procedure established in Annex H: (Peer assessment). Unless duly justified, peer  assessments shall be performed on site for the peer assessed CAB and, where applicable, for a selected set of its  subcontractors.  The peer assessment team may decide to reuse results of previous peer assessments of the assessed authority or  body covering part of the scope, under the following conditions:   such results shall be not older than five (5) years;   where previous peer assessments of the peer assessed CAB were performed under a different scheme, these  shall be provided with the description of the peer assessment procedures in place for that different scheme;   the peer assessment report shall clearly indicate which parts were reused without further assessment, and which  parts were reused with additional assessment;  The peer assessment team shall report their findings to the ECCG in a peer assessment report, with an indication of  the severity of any shortcomings. The peer assessment report shall include where necessary guidelines or  recommendations on actions or measures to be taken by the peer assessed CAB, as well as the measures proposed  by the peer assessed CAB to handle the findings.  When establishing measures to handle the findings, the peer assessed CAB may ask for the support of the peer  assessment team. These measures shall be transmitted to the ECCG, indicating how they intend to correct the  findings, within the peer assessment report. Where necessary, the ECCG may inform the relevant:   NCCA of the peer assessed CAB for its consideration of the potential impact of the remaining findings on the  certificates issued by the peer assessed CAB, or any authorisation or notification related to the peer assessed  CAB and associated subcontractors;   National Accreditation Body (NAB) of the peer assessed CAB for its consideration of the potential impact of the  remaining findings on the accreditation of the peer assessed CAB and associated subcontractors;  and may ask for their conclusions.  The peer assessed CAB and related NCCA shall have the opportunity to address with the ECCG any shortcomings  and recommendations identified in the report, before the results of the peer assessment are published by ENISA. Also,  the NAB shall have the opportunity to address any shortcomings and recommendations in case any have been brought  up to the NAB before the results are published.  ENISA may participate in the peer assessments.  CABs shall inform applicants to certification at the assurance level High of the EUCS scheme that their certification  projects may be subject to the peer assessment installed by this scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  69  RATIONALE  Additional input from the EUCSA  Additional information about peer assessment is provided in the EUCA recitals:  (100) Without prejudice to the general peer review system to be put in place across all national cybersecurity  certification authorities within the European cybersecurity certification framework, certain European  cybersecurity certification schemes may include a peer-assessment mechanism for the bodies that issue  European cybersecurity certificates for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with an assurance level  ‘high’ under such schemes. The ECCG should support the implementation of such peer-assessment  mechanisms. The peer assessments should assess in particular whether the bodies concerned carry out their  tasks in a harmonised way, and may include appeal mechanisms. The results of the peer assessments should  be made publicly available. The bodies concerned may adopt appropriate measures to adapt their practices and  expertise accordingly.  🙧  🙥  In addition to the peer review between NCCAs, introduced in Article 59 of the EUCSA, which is outside of the scope of  this scheme, a peer assessment may be defined for each scheme, with scheme specific objectives defined here for the  EUCC scheme in the first part of this Chapter, and requirements.  This approach guarantees the high quality of evaluation activities as required for a ‘high’ level of security assurance  and the harmonisation of the evaluation methods between different CAB, therefore allowing more objective results and  to proceed to composite cloud service certifications within different CABs.  It is essential that a planning is established for such activities, including reassessments, and necessary priorities  associated to newcomers to certification, or those facing issues with certification.  The procedure in Annex H: (Peer assessment) takes into consideration the possibility to reuse results from other peer  assessment mechanisms.  The results of the peer assessment will be made publicly available on the ENISA website dedicated to cybersecurity  certification, as recommended by Recital 100 of the CSA.  It is considered of importance that where applicable, the assessed body or authority presents the effective measures to  adapt their practices and expertise accordingly to the ECCG, in order to reinsure other participants to the scheme of  the quality of the certificate it issues.  In cases where the quality of the certificates is considered by the ECCG not in line with the requirements of this  scheme, the ECCG may inform and consult the NCCA and the National Accreditation Body of the assessed body or  authority for their conclusions on the impacts on its authorisation and accreditation.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  70  23. SUPPLEMENTARY  INFORMATION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements  (v) format and procedures to be followed by manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes in supplying and updating the supplementary cybersecurity information in accordance with Article 55.  🙧  🙥  All Supplementary cybersecurity information defined in Article 55 of the EUCSA shall be provided during conformity  assessment by CSPs to the CAB in the course of the conformity assessment.  In particular, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 17 (Certificate Format), a link to the website and relevant  pages where that information is made available shall be provided to be integrated into the certificate. Once all other  requirements for certification have been fulfilled, the issuing body shall request the CSP to provide the URL (link) so  that this can be processed before the certificate can be uploaded to the ENISA Website for certification.  CSPs shall make Supplementary cybersecurity information in accordance with Article 55 of the EUCSA publicly  available on their websites.  The information shall be available in electronic form and in English language and shall remain available at least until  the expiration or withdrawal of the corresponding European cybersecurity certificate. It shall be updated in accordance  with the requirements of Chapter 12 (Certificate Management).  In addition, “guidance and recommendations18 to assist end users with the secure configuration, installation,  deployment, operation and maintenance of the cloud services”, as defined by Article 55.1.(a), shall be updated as  required to reflect the evolution of the cloud service, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 12 (Certificate  Management).  18 Within the shared responsibility model, these recommendations only cover the part for which the CSC is responsible. Recommendations for activities  under the responsibility of the CSP do not need to be made publicly available.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  71  RATIONALE  Additional input from the EUCSA  Article 55 defines the Supplementary cybersecurity information for certified ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes:  1.  The manufacturer or provider of certified ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes or of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes for which an EU statement of conformity has been issued shall make publicly  available the following supplementary cybersecurity information:  (a) guidance and recommendations to assist end users with the secure configuration, installation,  deployment, operation and maintenance of the ICT products or ICT services;  (b) the period during which security support will be offered to end users, in particular as regards the  availability of cybersecurity related updates;  (c) contact information of the manufacturer or provider and accepted methods for receiving vulnerability  information from end users and security researchers;  (d) a reference to online repositories listing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to the ICT product, ICT  service or ICT process and to any relevant cybersecurity advisories.  2.  The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be available in electronic form and shall remain available  and be updated as necessary at least until the expiry of the corresponding European cybersecurity certificate or  EU statement of conformity.  🙧  🙥  In addition to the public availability of the information, as requested by Article 55, the need for having access to all or  part of it during certification may be requested, such as to test that the information complies with the requirements of  the scheme. The CSP should have the URL up and running before the certificate is issued or updated, and provisioned  with the information provided for the conformity assessment. This specific need to review part of Supplementary  cybersecurity information during the conformity assessment phase shall however only occur where the relevant  Chapters of this scheme establish a requirement to do so.  For an easy and harmonised access of users of certificates to the webpages where the information will be accessible  on the Websites of CSPs, the associated link will have to be provided in the certificate.  The conditions to deliver the Supplementary cybersecurity information should be part of a more detailed disclosure  policy that ENISA will establish in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 20 (Disclosure Policy).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  72  24. ADDITIONAL TOPICS  Foreword for Reviewers  This chapter introduces a few topics that are not addressed in Article 54, but may still be relevant for the present  scheme. The topics do not all have the same level of maturity:  The two first ones (Security Profiles and Force Majeure) are high-level proposals that need to be further detailed  and instantiated in the scheme, whereas the two last ones (Security of Information and Composition) are more  mature, and are ready to be integrated in the scheme.  24.1 SECURITY PROFILES  PROPOSAL  Cloud services are likely to be used in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that will themselves be subject to  certification in the context of another conformity assessment scheme, and in particular of another European  cybersecurity certification scheme. Some of these conformity assessment schemes may have specific requirements,  for instance related to an industry vertical.  In order to simplify the use of certificates issued in the EUCS scheme in other schemes, it is therefore important to  support the definition of such specific vertical requirements, and to allow cloud services to take these requirements into  consideration in their certification.  Such specific requirements shall be defined in a Security Profile, following some principles:   A security profile shall not remove or weaken any requirement defined in the EUCS scheme.   A security profile shall not modify the assessment methodology or the assessment methods defined in the EUCS  scheme.   A security profile shall follow the processes defined in the scheme, and shall produce the same deliverables.   A security profile shall specify the EUCS assurance level that it targets.   A security profile may define new security controls, or may add new requirements to an existing security control,  as long as these requirements do not weaken existing EUCS requirements.   A security profile may mandate a higher frequency of periodic assessments.   A security profile may define a dedicated section in the document templates defined in the EUCS scheme.  In order to be recognized in the context of EUCS, Security Profiles shall be published on ENISA’s Website, after  approval from the ECCG.  A CSP may choose to claim conformity to the requirements of one or several security profiles in addition to the core  requirements of the scheme. If this claim is confirmed by the conformity assessment, then the CSP may list the  security profile(s) in the certificate documentation.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  73  24.2 FORCE MAJEURE  PROPOSAL  In case of force majeure, a NCCA may take temporary measures to ensure the continuity of certification, by extending  the timelines related to the periodic and renewal assessments, by relaxing requirements on the execution of conformity  assessment activities, and if necessary, by extending the validity of certificates.  The NCCA shall inform ENISA about the extension and provide transparency on reasons and the duration of  extension, and ENISA shall make the information available on their website.  The NCCA shall inform the ECCG about the temporary measures, and if several NCCAs are affected by the same  force majeure event, they shall coordinate to ensure that they apply equivalent temporary measures.  24.3 SECURITY OF INFORMATION  PROBLEM STATEMENT  Annex to the EUCSA,  item 16: The conformity assessment body and its staff, its committees, its subsidiaries, its  subcontractors, and any associated body or the staff of external bodies of a conformity assessment body shall  maintain confidentiality and observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their  conformity assessment tasks under this Regulation or pursuant to any provision of national law giving effect to this  Regulation, except where disclosure is required by Union or Member State law to which such persons are subject, and  except in relation to the competent authorities of the Member States in which its activities are carried out. Intellectual  property rights shall be protected. The conformity assessment body shall have documented procedures in place in  respect of the requirements of this point.  RECOMMENDATION  Unless otherwise provided for in this scheme and without prejudice to existing national provisions and practices in the  Member States on confidentiality, all parties19 involved in the application of this Scheme shall maintain confidentiality  and observe professional secrecy with regard to all information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks in order to  protect the following:  a) personal data, in accordance with GDPR20;  b) commercially sensitive and confidential information and trade secrets of a natural or legal person, including  intellectual property rights, during the certification lifecycle of the cloud service and up to the end of the  indicated retention time for all certification information, unless disclosure is necessary in the public interest, or  subject to court orders;  c) exchange of information necessary for the effective implementation of this scheme, in particular for the  purpose of peer reviews, peer assessments or audits, effective collaboration between the involved authorities  and bodies, the handling of publicly unknown and subsequently detected vulnerabilities in the process of, or  after certification, and the handling of complaints.  Without prejudice to previous paragraph, information exchanged on a confidential basis between competent authorities  and between competent authorities and the Commission shall not be disclosed to the public without the prior  agreement of the originating authority.  All information received from the CABs or their subcontractors or the CSPs shall only be used for the purpose of the  certification and deemed confidential by the NCCAs – unless a different agreement is reached between the parties or  unless an information flow is required by a specific regulation of the scheme.  19 Including at least the CAB, the NCCA, and their staff, their committees, their subsidiaries, their subcontractors, and any associated body or the staff of  external bodies of the CAB or the NCCA.  20 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  74  All parties involved in the application of this Scheme shall implement security measures in order to ensure the  confidentiality of the information provided during the certification process. ENISA may provide guidance on how to  insure the security of information based on the workflows associated with the activities described in the EUCS scheme.  RATIONALE  Security of information is key in cybersecurity related activities. All cybersecurity certification related activities fall into  the latter.  Information provided by the applicant to the CAB for certification might be sensitive, especially as, the higher the  evaluation level, the deeper the evaluator shall go into the analysis of the cloud service and related life-cycle, based on  information details that may comprise commercially confidential information and trade secrets, including intellectual  property rights.  Information developed by cybersecurity certification activities, such as Assurance Reports, which are associated to  vulnerabilities assessment, handling and release, will also contain information sensitive parts that, when poorly  protected, may obviously endanger the users of associated cloud services, even when these cloud services are  certified.  Therefore, the obligations of the different actors of the scheme to insure the security of information shall be established  and take into consideration the requirements for CSPs and developers to comply with Article 55 of the EUCSA, and the  necessary respect of Freedom of Information policies and legal frameworks, Access to Information Acts, and/or any  other similar national, European and international policies and regulations by any individuals or entities.  24.4 COMPOSITION  PROBLEM STATEMENT  The composition of certificates is not mentioned explicitly in the EUCSA, but it is a common way of building complex  certified products or services by leveraging previously certified products and services. In the context of the EUCS  scheme, the objective is twofold:   Allow certified cloud services to be certified along a supply chain.   Reduce the costs of certifying a cloud service that relies on previously certified products and services by allowing  the reuse of evidence and of audit results.  The use of composition leads to specific issues related to the evaluation of composed cloud services, and also to the  maintenance of the certification for composed cloud services, relatively to the maintenance of the certification of their  components.  RECOMMENDATION  Cloud services are layered systems, in which infrastructure and platform capabilities from a service are often used as a  basis for other services. There may also be some dependencies between an application capability and another  service. These services used by a CSP in the provision of its own cloud service are referred to as sub-services,  supplied by sub-service providers or organizations. The general rules for the consideration of such sub-service  providers in the assessment of a cloud service is covered extensively in Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment  of cloud services). In addition, CSPs need to fulfil specific requirements related to their service providers and suppliers  that are defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  Composition is a particular case, in which the sub-service (then called a base service) is itself a cloud service that has  been certified in the EUCS scheme. In such a case the cloud service (or dependent service) relying on the base  service can expect the assessment of the requirements related to the base service to be greatly simplified, because  they use the same security framework, and because the rules of the scheme (and in particular those related to the  CABs) are trusted.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  75  In order to be eligible for composition, the base cloud service shall satisfy some specific requirements, defined in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), which will allow the assessment of dependent  cloud services to be further simplified. These specific requirements consist in defining precisely, in terms of specific  EUCS security objectives and requirements, how security responsibilities are split between the base service and the  dependent service:   The base cloud service shall provide a description of their contribution to the EUCS requirement fulfilment of their  dependent services, properly justified through references to their own controls; and   The base service shall provide a list of actionable requirements on Complementary Customer Controls (CCCs,  based on the EUCS objectives and requirements) that define the requirements to be fulfilled by the dependent  cloud service in order for the base service to fulfil the requirements for EUCS certification at the chosen assurance  level.  These two conditions are defined as requirements for base services in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements  for Cloud Services). Therefore, they are in the scope of the conformity assessment for the base service.  This information can then be used by the CSP of the dependent service in several ways:   During the design phase, the CSP can use the information about the base service to drive design decisions for its  dependent service;   When building documentation for its certification, the description of the base service’s contribution and of its CCCs  can be used directly by the CSP of the dependent service, who will simply need to document is its implementation  of the CCCs; and   The CAB only needs to verify that this information has not been modified and if necessary that a subset has been  properly selected, and will focus on verifying that the CCCs are fulfilled by the dependent service.  In addition, there are a few simple rules that must be followed:   In order to apply composition, the base service shall be certified at a level equal or greater than the level targeted  by the dependent service;   In order to apply composition fully, the base service shall claim compliance to the security profiles that the  dependent service claims compliance to. If the dependent service claims compliance to a security profile that is  not claimed by the base service, then this security profile is excluded from the composition, and a classical  process shall be used if necessary to demonstrate that the base service satisfies as a subservice the expectations  of the dependent service relative to that security profile;   The dependent service shall add to the requirements to be fulfilled the requirements from the base service’s  CCCs.   In its description of its contribution of the base service to the fulfilment of the scheme’s requirements, the  dependent service shall indicate when the description is the one provided by the base service in its  documentation.  Finally, note that:   A dependent service may use composition with more than one base services;   Although composition cannot only be applied to base services that have been certified through the EUCS scheme,  ENISA will issue with the support of ECCG some guidance about a similar approach for base services that have  been assessed through existing National schemes listed in Chapter 16 (Related Schemes), in order to facilitate  the transition from National schemes to the EUCS scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  76  25. FURTHER  RECOMMENDATIONS  Foreword for Reviewers  The recommendations in this chapter are not intended to be included in the scheme. They are related to the  lifecycle of the scheme, specifically measures to be considered between the formal adoption of the scheme and  the emission of the first certificates, and measures related to the maintenance of the scheme.  They nevertheless represent important topics that will need to be addressed in order for the scheme to be  successful. The scheme adoption topic, in particular, will be of paramount importance for this new scheme, and  requires our full attention.  25.1 SCHEME ADOPTION  25.1.1 Problem statement  25.1.1.1 EUCSA Reference  Article 57 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, national cybersecurity certification schemes, and the  related procedures for the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that are covered by a European  cybersecurity certification scheme shall cease to produce effects from the date established in the implementing act  adopted pursuant to Article 49(7). National cybersecurity certification schemes and the related procedures for the ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes that are not covered by a European cybersecurity certification scheme shall  continue to exist.  25.1.1.2 Additional information  The transition period is here considered as the period between the date of adoption of the implementing act adopted  pursuant to Article 49(7), and the date established into this implementing act when national schemes shall cease to  produce effect.  25.1.2 Recommendation  The EUCS scheme is the first scheme for cloud services at an international level, It will replace at least partly a few  existing national schemes, but it is mostly a new scheme that needs to be set up gradually across the European Union.  Prerequisites for scheme adoption  In order for relevant bodies in a Member State to start issuing certificates at the Basic and Substantial levels, the  following should happen:   existing and new CABs get accredited to ISO/IEC 17065, and their internal and external evaluation facilities get  accredited to relevant standards;   the NCCA notifies accredited CABs to the EC;   CSPs need to get acquainted with the various components of the scheme and update their processes to conform  to its requirements;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  77   CABs need to work with the NCCA to set up monitoring activities; and   the NCCA sets up the market surveillance process.  In order for the relevant bodies in a Member State to start issuing certificates at level High, the following should also  happen:   the NCCA establishes how High certificates will be issued and take the relevant action (get its CAB-NCCA  accredited, and/or designate a CAB for general delegation, and/or organize a prior approval process of  certificates); and   existing and new CABs, including their internal or external evaluation facilities get authorized by the NCCA before  notification to the EC;  In addition, before relevant bodies in any Member State can start issuing certificates, the following should happen at  European level:   a maintenance organization is put in place for the EUCS scheme, to further develop the scheme and to support  any interpretation and harmonisation question related to the adoption of the new scheme.  The AHWG recommends an adoption period of one (1) year between the adoption of the scheme and the issuance of  the first certificate as being technically acceptable.  Scheme adoption and transition period  ENISA may establish associated rules for adopting the scheme as to support the conditions for the scheme to operate.  These rules shall be established in cooperation with the ECCG.  For Member States who operate a national scheme for which a transition to the EUCS scheme is required, the  transition also needs to be organized to ensure that, after a period of time, only EUCS certificates can be issued, The  transition period should allow for:   termination of current certification projects under the existing schemes, or their easy conversion into EUCS  projects;   smooth transfer of certificates that require maintenance in the long run, therefore under for the EUCS scheme, or  reuse for composite evaluations and certifications under the EUCS scheme.  The guiding principles for the transitions are as follows:   Certificates can be issued by the National scheme at most until the end of the transition period.   Certificates issued by the National scheme remain valid until the end of their validity period, which cannot be  extended.   The transition to the European scheme is accelerated by defining rules about the reuse of evidence and  evaluation results previously used toward the issuance of a National certificate  These rules will be complemented with relevant guidance at the beginning of the transition period, in particular  regarding the potential reuse of certificates, evaluation results, and evidence from the national schemes. Such  certificates, evaluation results and evidence issued on a given cloud service may be used during the conformity  assessment of the same cloud service, or during the conformity assessment of another cloud service for which that  cloud service is a subservice.  The AHWG recommends a transition period of one (1) year after the issuance of the first certificates as being  technically acceptable.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  78  25.2 SCHEME MAINTENANCE  25.2.1 Problem statement  25.2.1.1 EUCSA Reference  Article 62.4 – The ECCG shall have the following tasks:  e) to adopt opinions addressed to the Commission relating to the maintenance and review of existing European  cybersecurity certifications schemes.  25.2.2 Recommendation  The AHWG recommends the following for the maintenance of the EUCS scheme.  The ECCG should mandate groups of experts involving NCCAs, CABs and associated auditors, CSPs and CSCs to:   improve the security controls and associated requirements;   improve the assessment methodology and associated documents;   provide guidance to CABs and CSPs about the prerequisites and operation of the scheme.  The expert groups should focus on methodology harmonization of evaluation activities, analysis of new technologies  and vulnerability classes, and propose new or revised supporting documents.  As an alternative, some of the annexes to the scheme, and in particular Annex A: (Security Objectives and  requirements for Cloud Services), may be considered for submission to a European Standards Developing  Organization (SDO) as a basis for a future European standard, to be referenced in future versions of the EUCS  scheme.  The ECCG should define adequate terms of reference for these expert groups. ENISA should publish the list of  mandated expert groups and their associated mandates.

However, during and around the  fall plenary meeting, a number of issues were brought to our attention regarding these controls under  development, including concerns about complexity as well as consistency and clarity issues.  Due to the limited time remaining, the decision was taken to reorganize the security controls and to use the  structure and when applicable, the wording of the BSI’s C5:2020 criteria, which have the advantage of having  been used in practice for quite some time. The criteria have been reorganized into requirements, which have then  been assigned to assurance levels. Then, additional sources have been considered, in particular the  SecNumCloud scheme, but also relevant standards such as ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27017  There are a few known caveats in this content, including:   The focus has been on the definition of requirements, so the formulation of the objectives is not as  consistent as that of requirements.   Guidance is not included, except for elements from C5’s criteria and SecNumCloud’s requirements that  have been moved to guidance.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  82  PRINCIPLES  This Annex is an essential component of the scheme, as it defines the technical objectives and requirements that  CSPs need to fulfil in order to get a cloud service certified.  Abstraction level  Because this annex is intended to also be an annex to the implementing act for the scheme, it is important to keep a  rather high level of abstraction. The objective is here to define whenever possible the requirements in a technology-  neutral fashion, and also to avoid mentioning specific technical details which could become outdated very fast.  The requirements defined in this annex shall therefore be complemented by guidance, to be published by ENISA with  the support of the ECCG. The requirements in the guidance shall provide the scheme users with a reference way to  fulfil the requirements defined in the scheme, typically by providing additional details that describe the required  “currently accepted techniques” or “state-of-the-art”.  Most requirements in this annex are written using “shall”, whereas the guidance and a limited number of requirements  in this annex are written with “should”. The term “should” is used to indicate recognized means of fulfilling the  requirements of the EUCS scheme.  Organization  The requirements are grouped in 19 categories, and each category is divided in a number of themes. Each theme is  structured as follows:   An objective that the requirements aim at achieving.   Requirements to be met by the controls implemented in support of the certified cloud services, with each  requirement associated to an assurance level.   In some cases, an indication of guidance to be made available, typically when part of a requirement inherited from  an existing set of criteria or requirements has been moved to guidance, or when a key concept is expected to be  detailed in guidance.  There are many cross-references between requirements and themes. For instance, the ISP-02 theme, which defines  how policies and procedures are to be defined, is referenced many times.  Assurance levels  The requirements defined in the present Annex are labelled Basic, Substantial or High:   Requirements labelled Basic apply to all assurance levels.   Requirements labelled Substantial apply to levels Substantial and High, and they will in most cases be considered  as guidance for level Basic (i.e., the reference method to achieve the Basic requirements, which are often less  detailed).   Requirements labelled High only apply to level High.  Typically, the requirements corresponding to an objective are organized as follows:   Basic requirements define a baseline, often with limited details or constraints   Substantial requirements add to that baseline further details and constraints. Sometimes, there are a few specific  Substantial requirements.   High requirements add further constraints. Some are also related to continuous monitoring, or to additional testing  and review requirements, contributing to an increase in the depth of the audit.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  83  Continuous monitoring  The requirements related to continuous monitoring typically mention “automated monitoring” or “automatically monitor”  in their text. The intended meaning of “monitor automatically” is:  1. Gather data to analyse some aspects of the activity being monitored at discrete intervals at a sufficient  frequency;  2. Compare the gathered data to a reference or otherwise determine conformity to specified requirements in the  EUCS scheme;  3. Report deviations to subject matter experts who can analyse the deviations in a timely manner;  4. If the deviation indicates a nonconformity, then initiate a process for fixing the nonconformity; and  5. If the nonconformity is major, notify the CAB of the issue, analysis, and planned resolution.  These requirements stop short on requiring any notion of continuous auditing, because technologies have not reached  an adequate level of maturity. Nevertheless, the introduction of continuous auditing, at least for level High, remains a  mid- or long-term objective, and the introduction of automated monitoring requirement in at least some areas is a first  step in that direction, which can be met with the technology available today.  Further guidance will be provided about acceptable mechanisms and processes.

This organization is not necessarily permanent and may  be reconsidered.  The current proposal is built on the following hypotheses:   All CSPs are subject to the same requirements in order to get their cloud services certified, regardless of the  way in which their cloud services are implemented (e.g., a SaaS provider implementing a full stack vs. a SaaS  provider using a subservice provider’s infrastructure for the delivery of its own service).   The auditor is in charge of assessing the level of compliance and assurance for subservice providers based  solely on the information available, including assurance reports of various origins and evidence provided by  the CSP in their risk assessment of their subservice providers.  As we added more details, such as requirements for documents, these aspects have been the subject of  discussions until the last days before the release of this draft candidate scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  160  B.1 INTRODUCTION  B.1.1 Definitions  Audit  In EUCS, the definition of an audit is taken from [ISO17000]:   A systematic, independent, documented process for obtaining records, statements of fact or other relevant  information and assessing them objectively to determine the extent to which specified requirements are fulfilled.  ISAE/ISA proposes another definition for the term:   A systematic process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding management assertions about  conformity with the predefined framework to ascertain the degree of correspondence between those assertions  and established criteria and [additional to ISO] communicating the results to interested users.  For the purpose of this annex, we will consider that the definitions are sufficiently close to be considered equivalent.  Reasonable assurance  A reasonable assurance engagement21 is defined in [ISAE3000] as:  An assurance engagement in which the practitioner22 reduces engagement risk to an acceptably low level in the  circumstances of the engagement as the basis for the practitioner’s conclusion. The practitioner’s conclusion is  expressed in a form that conveys the practitioner’s opinion on the outcome of the measurement or evaluation of the  underlying subject matter against criteria.  Reasonable assurance aims at reducing to an acceptably low level the risk of reaching an inappropriate conclusion  when the information provided on the subject matter (here, the description of the cloud service and the CSP’s  management claim) is materially misstated. Such risk is never reduced to nil and therefore, there can never be  absolute assurance.  The conclusion in a reasonable assurance engagement is framed in a positive sense: \"Based on the procedures  performed, in our opinion, the cloud service XYZ satisfies the requirements of the EUCS at level LLL.\"  Limited Assurance  A limited assurance engagement is defined in [ISAE3000] as:  An assurance engagement in which the practitioner reduces engagement risk to a level that is acceptable in the  circumstances of the engagement but where that risk is greater than for a reasonable assurance engagement as  the basis for expressing a conclusion in a form that conveys whether, based on the procedures performed and  evidence obtained, a matter(s) has come to the practitioner’s attention to cause the practitioner to believe the  subject matter information is materially misstated. The nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in a  limited assurance engagement is limited compared with that necessary in a reasonable assurance engagement but  is planned to obtain a level of assurance that is, in the practitioner’s professional judgment, meaningful. To be  meaningful, the level of assurance obtained by the practitioner is likely to enhance the intended users’ confidence  about the subject matter information to a degree that is clearly more than inconsequential.  For a limited assurance engagement the auditor collects less evidence than for a reasonable assurance engagement  but sufficient for a negative form of expression of the auditor’s conclusion. The practitioner achieves this ordinarily by  performing different or fewer tests than those required for reasonable assurance or using smaller sample sizes for the  tests performed.  21 An audit performed in the context of the EUCS scheme is a kind of assurance engagement.  22 Auditor  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  161  In contrast with a reasonable assurance conclusion, the conclusion in a limited assurance engagement is accordingly  framed in a negative sense: \"Based on the procedures performed, nothing came to our attention to indicate that the  cloud service XYZ does not satisfy the requirements of the EUCS at level Basic.\"  Determination activities  In the conformity assessment of a cloud service, the following determination activities are essential.  Inquiry  Inquiry consists of seeking relevant information or representations of knowledgeable persons. Inquiries range from  formal written inquiries to interviews and informal oral inquiries.  Observation  Observation consists of looking at a process or procedure being performed by others, for example, the observation of  the performance of control activities. Observation provides evidence about the performance of a process or procedure,  but is limited to the point in time at which the observation takes place, and by the fact that the act of being observed  may affect how the process or procedure is performed. Observation is an appropriate way to obtain evidence if there is  no documentation of the operation of a control, like segregation of duties. Observation is also useful for physical  controls.  Inspection  Inspection is defined in [ISO17000] as the “examination of an object of conformity assessment and determination of its  conformity with detailed requirements or, on the basis of professional judgement, with general requirements”.  In the context of EUCS, inspection involves examining records or documents, whether internal or external, in paper  form, electronic form, or on other media, or a physical examination of evidence. Inspection of records and documents  provides evidence of varying degrees of reliability, depending on their nature and source and, in the case of internal  records and documents, on the implementation of the controls over their production. Inspection is often used to  determine whether manual controls are being performed. Evidence could include written explanations, check marks, or  other indications of follow-up recorded on documentation.  Re-performance of monitoring activities or manual controls  Obtaining documents used in the monitoring activity or manual control activity and independently re-performing of the  procedures. Comparing any exception items identified with those identified by the responsible control owner.  Re-performance of programmed processing  Input test data, manually calculated expected results, and compared actual results of processing to expectations.  B.1.2 Mapping requirements to controls  It is common practice in examinations that follow established assurance standards and criteria catalogues, that CSPs  map their internal controls (the technical and organisational measures in place to prevent risks or to detect and correct  undesired events) to the requirements/criteria of the standard. The information is typically presented in a statement of  applicability (e.g. for ISO 27001 in form a table that outlines which of the controls in ISO 27001 Annex A are applicable  and references to further documentation about the applicable controls) or a description about the service-related  system of internal control (e.g. attestations based on AICPA SOC 2). Mappings are typically presented per  requirement/criterion of the assurance standards with multiple internal controls assigned to each requirement/criterion  to demonstrate compliance.  In the EUCS scheme, the criteria are outlined in form of Security Objectives and related Security Requirements in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services). They represent the mandatory baseline per  assurance level for which the CSP must demonstrate compliance.  CSPs can map their internal controls per applicable Security Control Objective and related Security Requirements. Re-  using existing descriptions can limit additional efforts for the CSP and contribute to the fast adoption of the EUCSA. It  also allows the CSP to demonstrate compliance with multiple assurance standards and criteria catalogues during a  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  162  single examination (“test once, rely often”). However, this requires the mapping to be complete, accurate and valid.  Further, the nature, timing and extent of evaluation procedures applied by the CAB must provide the required level of  evidence.  B.1.3 Subservice providers  The cloud services offered to a CSC will in most cases rely on several subservices, which may be provided internally  at the CSP, externally by a different CSP, or externally by a provider that does not provide cloud services (e.g., a  hosting provider).  In order to complete the conformity assessment of a Cloud service by a CSP that uses subservice providers, it is  relevant to identify the subservice providers and apply the relevant procedures outlined below.  ASSESSMENT METHODS  The assessment needs to consider all subservices listed in the description of the service, internally or externally  provided. Internal subservices are necessarily in the scope of the assessment, but external subservices can be  handled using two different methods:  1. Include the sub-service provider in the scope (inclusive method);  2. Exclude the sub-service provider from the scope (carve out method).  Both methods are dealing with the services provided by a subservice organization, whereby the CSP’s description of  its service presents the nature of the services provided by a subservice organization. In both cases, internal and  external subservices are treated similarly and considered as provided by subservice organizations.  Inclusive method  With the inclusive Method the subservice provider’s controls to meet the applicable Security Objectives and the related  Security Requirements are included in the CSP’s description of its system. The subservice providers are part of the  scope of the CSP’s conformity assessment.  Carve-out method  With the carve-out method the subservice organization’s relevant control objectives and related controls are excluded  (carved-out) from the CSP’s description of its system. The subservice organizations are not part of the scope of the  CSP’s conformity assessment. Instead, the CSP’s description presents those controls that are designed and  implemented to monitor the operating, and if applicable the functional, effectiveness of the controls at the subservice  organisation. The monitoring activities shall meet the Security Objectives and the related Security Requirements for  “Procurement Management (Supply Chain Management)” outlined in the scheme.  SUBSERVICES IN EUCS  In the context of the EUCS scheme, subservices assessed using the inclusive method shall simply be considered as  part of the scope of the CSP’s conformity assessment. The CSP shall be responsible for ensuring that all required  evidence is available about the subservice organization, about the services it provides, and about these services are  integrated in its own systems in the provision of the cloud service to be assessed.  Subservices assessed using the carve-out methods shall be considered at all stages of the conformity assessment,  and in particular during the dependency analysis (see B.8). During that phase, the auditor shall review the assurance  documentation available for the subservice.  In the rest of this annex and in the following annexes, when subservices are mentioned, the intended meaning is  “subservices assessed using the carve-out method”, unless specified otherwise.  B.1.4 Complementary controls  Information security of a cloud service can only be assured, when the involved parties are aware of and follow their  individual responsibilities. For the designs of its internal controls the CSP assumes that user entities (CSCs) and  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  163  subservice organizations operate complementary controls that work in combination with the CSP’s internal controls to  achieve certain objectives.  In the EUCS scheme, the CSP shall present the Complementary Customer Controls (CCCs) and the Complementary  Subservice Organization Controls (CSOCs) assumed in the design of its internal controls as part of the description of  the cloud service.  If the CSP uses a subservice organization, the CSP shall obtain relevant information about the CCCs that the  subservice organization assumed in the design of their internal controls. Relevant information can be obtained from the  subservice organization, e.g. in form of descriptions of the cloud service in accordance with this scheme or other  assurance reports that require this information as well (e.g. ISAE 3402, AICPA SOC 2 or BSI C5). For these CCCs the  CSP has to ensure that appropriate internal controls are in place. During a conformity assessment, the CAB has to  evaluate whether the controls related to the CCCs are suitably designed, implemented and operating effectively.  B.1.5 Presentation  The assessment of cloud services for all levels of the EUCS is based on a meta-approach, which is described here.  This meta-approach for assessing and determining conformity describes the overall flow and requirements of the  conformity assessment of cloud services in the context of the EUCS scheme.  The meta-approach is the same for all levels, except for the audit itself:   For the assurance levels Substantial and High, the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) shall use an audit  approach based on either ISO standards or ISAE standards, both complemented with the requirements as defined  in this meta approach, leading to providing reasonable assurance, as defined in B.1.1. This approach is described  in Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and High).   For the Basic level, as mentioned in the EU Cybersecurity Act, the CAB shall use a simpler audit approach leading  to limited assurance, as defined in B.1.1. This approach is described in Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic).  The structure of this meta-approach starts with defining a clear objective, followed by the development and execution  of an audit plan, and ending with the analysis of the gathered evidence and the delivery of an assurance report.  Figure 3: The structure of the Meta-Approach  The term “audit” is used for all conformity assessment activities performed by the audit team and audit team leader  (together called “the auditor”) of the CAB, including the analysis of obtained evidence in an assurance report.  To be able to conclude whether all requirements of the EUCS are met, considering the carve-outs and the use of sub  service organization, a separate analysis and evaluation needs to take place. This dependency analysis, during which  the audit team and audit team leader, or another team designated by the CAB (nevertheless called “the auditor” for  simplification), analyses the assurance documentation available for the CSP’s subservice providers, and provides the  results in the evaluation report.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  164  The audit report and the evaluation report together may form the basis for awarding a certificate, after review by a  team of the CAB independent from the auditor, and together with the delivery of a certification report.  Following [ISO17065], the CAB who issues a certificate is required to perform internally the review and decision  activities. However, other activities may be subcontracted, and in particular the audit. Throughout this documentation,  the auditor may therefore be part of the CAB or of a subcontractor to the CAB.  B.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT  B.2.1 Introduction  The overall objective of the conformity assessment is to determine whether or not and to what extent a cloud service  delivered by a CSP is in conformity with the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements defined in  the EUCS.  To enable the CAB to perform the conformity assessment the CSP shall prepare and submit an Application Document,  including the description of its service that outlines the underlying and supporting processes and the accompanying  CSP’s statement about the conformity of their cloud service with the requirements of the EUCS. The CSP shall use the  template as included in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements) to the EUCS.  The object of the conformity assessment performed by the CAB shall be the cloud service for which a description is  provided, and the objective of the conformity assessment is to assess how this cloud service is built and operated with  meeting the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined in the EUCS. This objective  shall be stated in a statement endorsed by the CSP’s top management, in a form that complies with the requirements  defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements).  B.2.2 Basic level  The objective is to provide limited assurance through the execution of an audit (evaluation) by an independent auditor  that the cloud service is designed to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined in the EUCS that are applicable to assurance level Basic.  The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing audit procedures as defined in Sections D.3  and D.4 about:   the information presented in the description as provided together with or embedded in the application;   the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements; and   the existence and implementation of these controls as of a specified date during the initial conformity assessment.  B.2.3 Substantial Level  The objective is to provide reasonable assurance through the execution of an audit (evaluation) by an independent  auditor that the cloud service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined in the EUCS for the assurance level Substantial.  The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing audit procedures as defined in Sections C.3  and C.4 about:   the information presented in the description as provided together with or embedded in the application (C.3.1);   the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements  (C.4.1);   the existence and implementation of these controls as of a specified date during the initial conformity assessment  (C.4.2); and   the operating effectiveness (consistent application) of these controls throughout a specified period in subsequent  conformity assessments (C.4.3).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  165  B.2.4 High Level  The objective is to provide reasonable assurance through the execution of an audit (evaluation) by an independent  auditor that the cloud service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS for the assurance level High.  The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing audit procedures  As defined in Sections C.3  and C.4 about:   the information presented in the description as provided together with or embedded in the application (C.3.1);   the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements  (C.4.1);   the existence and the implementation of these controls as of a specified date during the initial conformity  assessment (C.4.2); and   the operating effectiveness (consistent application) of these controls throughout a specified period in subsequent  conformity assessments (C.4.3); and  B.3 ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT  Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement the CAB shall determine whether the  application request is appropriate by performing a review of the application.  The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application to assess the applicability of the criteria as  set in the EUCS, including the decision whether the chosen assurance level is appropriate in the circumstances.  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.2 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.2.  B.4 DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN  The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in an effective manner, including setting the scope,  timing and direction of the assessment, and determining the nature, timing and extent of planned audit procedures that  are required to be carried out in order to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This activity shall result in  an audit plan, and including aspects that are specific to each assurance level.  In all cases, and for all levels, if the CAB has subcontracted the audit, the CAB may at this point require a review of the  audit plan, which shall then be included in the contractual agreement between the CAB and its subcontractor.  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.3 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.3.  B.5 EXECUTION  B.5.1 Introduction  In the phase the auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence regarding:   the suitability of the design of controls, including controls over the processes out-sourced to subservice  organizations (such as hosting, infrastructure, platform, etc.) to meet the Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS;   the actual existence and implementation of controls to be in accordance with their design as of a point in time  (specified date); and   for the Substantial and High assurance levels, the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls throughout  a period over time (specified period);  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  166  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.4 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.4. The auditor shall document the procedures executed, the evidence  gained and conclusions reached using the appropriate document (depending on the assurance level).  Figure 4: The structure of the Meta-approach  B.6 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  Once the auditor has gathered all required evidence, the auditor shall evaluate its sufficiency and appropriateness.  This part of the process is specific to every assurance level, with the exception of nonconformity handling, which is  common to all three assurance levels and is described below.  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.5 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.5.  B.6.1 Nonconformity handling  If the audit procedures reveal nonconformities (or deviations) in the design, operation or, if required, functionality of the  controls, the auditor has to determine whether the applicable Security Requirements of the EUCS were still met. The  auditor should consider the following procedures for the determination:   Notification of the CSP if the nonconformity has been identified by the auditor;   Inquiry regarding their assessment of the cause of the identified nonconformity;   Assessment of the CSP’s handling of the identified nonconformity;   Assessment whether comparable nonconformities have been identified by the CSP’s monitoring processes and  what measures have been taken as a result; and   Qualification of the deviation as minor or major;  These procedures are linked to each other, because the requirements for the handling of an identified nonconformity  depend on the qualification of the nonconformity as minor or major. A major nonconformity is defined in [ISO17021] as  a “nonconformity that affects the capability of the management system to achieve the intended results”, with a note  stating that nonconformities could be qualified as major in the following circumstances:   there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that products or services will meet specified  requirements;   a number of minor nonconformities associated with the same requirement or issue could demonstrate a systemic  failure and thus constitute a major nonconformity.  In their analysis of nonconformities, CABs should consider both the requirement that is not being fulfilled and the  objective to which it refers, to gain an understanding of the impact of the nonconformity to the achievement of the  objective.  For a minor nonconformity, the auditor needs to determine that:   The CSP has determined the cause of the nonconformity;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  167   The CSP has defined a list of compensating controls that are in place to address the risks arising from the  deviation a list of corrective actions to be performed in order to address the nonconformity and a timeline to  implement the corrective actions;   The compensating controls already in place and the corrective actions proposed by the CSP are sufficient to  determine that the security requirement is met with the expected level of assurance.  The analysis of compensating controls may include the assessment of alternative organisational and technical  measures of the CSP to meet the Security Requirement of the EUCS, which have not been considered in the design of  this Security Requirement (e.g. use of new technical measures that provide at least an equal level of security but that  are not prescribed in the Security Requirements of the EUCS). Compensating controls are also considered a  temporary measure, and nonconformities, even minor, are expected to be corrected in the following conformity  assessments. The auditor may therefore define a list of conformity assessment activities to be performed in  subsequent conformity assessments.  For a major nonconformity, the auditor needs to determine that:   The CSP has determined the cause of the nonconformity;   The CSP has defined and implemented a list of corrective actions to address the nonconformity.   The corrective actions implemented by the CSP have adequately addressed the nonconformity.  Compensating actions are not allowed for major nonconformities, for which corrective actions shall be defined and  implemented in order to obtain or maintain a certificate. Nevertheless, if the corrective actions implemented are  sufficient to modify the qualification of the nonconformity as a minor nonconformity, then the remaining nonconformity  can be handled as a minor nonconformity, possibly with compensating controls.  The definition of minor and major nonconformities as well as the requirements related to their handling will be refined in  guidance provided by ENISA with the support of the ECCG.  Regardless of the qualification of the nonconformities as minor or major, the following information about the CSP’s  measures to handle such nonconformities and optimise its internal controls shall be disclosed in the assurance report:   If the nonconformity was detected by the CSP itself, when and in the course of which measures the nonconformity  was detected.   If the nonconformity was already stated in an assurance report of a previous audit, an indication should be given  of when and by what means the nonconformity was detected, together with a separate indication that the detection  occurred in a previous audit period.   The measures to be taken to remedy the nonconformity in the future and when these measures are likely to be  completed or effectively implemented.  B.7 ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT  After evaluating the result of the audit procedures the auditor shall form a conclusion and issue an assurance report  that satisfies the requirements defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements) for the targeted  assurance level. Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.6 and additional information  specific to levels Substantial and High are provided in section C.6  The conclusion shall include the audit team’s recommendation as to whether the cloud service satisfies the  requirements of the EUCS scheme, pending the results of the dependency analysis. The conclusion shall be based on  the evidence obtained and the audit activities performed.  This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP. The CSP may contest the content of the assurance report  and in particular the audit team’s recommendation. If the dispute remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint  with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  168  B.8 PERFORMING THE DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS  B.8.1 Objectives  The objective of the dependency analysis is to validate that the assurance documentation (assurance reports,  certificates) available for the subservices operated by internal or external subservice organisations used by the CSP in  the operation of its cloud service are adequate.  For every subservice organisation, the basis for this dependency analysis is the risk assessment of the provider that  has been performed by the CSP. As required by EUCS (see Annex A:, Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud  Services), the assurance report shall contain a rationale explaining how the CSP uses the subservice to satisfy the  scheme requirements, and for each subservice a pointer to an assurance component for the subservice.  The dependency analysis consists in analysing these assurance components to determine whether or not the  subservice meet the expectations from the CSP at the targeted assurance level.  B.8.2 Assessing the availability of assurance documentation  The first step is to list the assurance documentation available for every subservice provider, and to assess the overall  relevance of each assurance component for the dependency review.  The following elements are essential.  About the assurance component itself:   Type of assurance component, with all required details (e.g., ISO27001 certificate, Type 1 or Type 2 for an ISAE  report);   Period covered or period of validity, possibly complemented with bridge letters or similar statements;   Applicable framework (existing standard or private framework);   Inclusion of a mapping to EUCS in the assurance component;  About the auditor’s professional competence and independence:   Name of the CAB or audit organization, name of the audit lead.   Evidence of the CAB/audit organization’s and the auditor’s competence (accreditation, personal certification, etc.).   Evidence of the CAB/audit organization’s and the auditor’s independence (accreditation, etc.).  By analysing this information, the auditor shall determine whether the assurance documentation available for a given  subservice provider is adequate to provide assurance corresponding to the targeted EUCS assurance level.  ENISA, with the support of the ECCG, will issue guidance about the acceptability of different types of assurance  components for the different EUCS assurance levels, including potential gaps and attention points.  B.8.3 Assessing assurance related to individual requirements  The second step consists in verifying that the assurance documentation available for the subservice provider is  adequate to determine that the subservice provider meets the expectations of the CSP relative to individual EUCS  requirements.  This assessment is performed for every subservice provider, and then for every EUCS requirement for which the CSP  has declared to rely partially or fully on the assurance provided by the subservice provider, by formulating an  assumption on the subservice’s control.  The auditor shall for each such assumption determine whether or not the assurance provided in the available  assurance documentation is adequate. There are several ways to reach a conclusion that the assurance is adequate:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  169   The required information is available with the expected assurance level in the assurance documentation.   The information available in the assurance documentation does not cover the full scope of the requirement, but  additional controls implemented by the subservice provider or compensating controls implemented by the CSP  allow the auditor to determine that the information is adequate.   The information available in the assurance documentation does not offer the expected level of assurance, but the  controls implemented by the CSP to assess and monitor the subservice provider allow the auditor to determine  that the information is adequate.  Finally, if the assurance documentation mentions nonconformities on the controls used to meet an assumption, the  corrective measures proposed and implemented by the subservice provider and reviewed by its auditor shall be  adequate to guarantee that the assumption is indeed met.  ENISA, with the support of the ECCG, will issue guidance about the adequacy of different types of assurance  components for the different EUCS assurance levels, including acceptable additional and compensating controls that  may be implemented by the subservice providers and by the CSP.  B.8.4 EUCS-certified subservices  When a subservice has been certified in the EUCS scheme, the processes defined above may be simplified:   The auditor’s competence and independence does not need to be assessed;   The report can be considered as being fully compliant with the rules of the EUCS scheme for the assurance level  of the report;   No mapping to the EUCS scheme’s requirements is needed.  Finally, if the cloud service and its subservice satisfy the requirements for composition, the assessment may be  simplified further since the information provided by the subservice organization has already been assessed.  B.9 ISSUING THE EVALUATION REPORT  After evaluating the adequacy of the assurance provided to support assumptions about subservice providers, the  auditor shall form a conclusion, combine it with the conclusion from the assurance report, and issue an evaluation  report.  The conclusion shall include the audit’s team recommendation as to whether the assurance documentation is  adequate or not to support the certification of the CSP using these subservice providers. The conclusion shall be  based on the audit activities and express whether, in all material respects,  (i) the audit documentation provided for every subservice provider is adequate to provide assurance corresponding to  the targeted EUCS assurance level,  (ii) for every assumption formulating by the CSP regarding a contribution of a subservice provider to the conformity to  an EUCS requirement, the audit documentation provided for that subservice provider is adequate to determine that  the assumption formulated by the CSP is correct, with the targeted EUCS assurance level, and  (iii) for every nonconformity identified in assurance documentation regarding a control used to determine that an  assumption formulated by the CSP is correct, appropriate corrective actions have been proposed, implemented  and validated by an auditor.  The auditor shall then combine this conclusion of the dependency analysis with the conclusion from the assurance  report, for a conclusion regarding the fulfilment of relevant EUCS requirements by the cloud service, and make a  recommendation regarding the possible certification of the cloud service under the conditions outlined in the CSP’s  application.  The auditor shall issue the evaluation report that satisfies the requirements defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document  Content requirements).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  170  This dependency report shall be first addressed to the CSP. The CSP may contest the content of the assurance report  and in particular the audit team’s recommendation. If the dispute remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint  with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.  The auditor then delivers the evaluation report, comprising at least the assurance report and the present evaluation  report, and if applicable, additional assurance or evaluation reports of sub service providers, to the Conformity  Assessment Body (CAB) accredited to issue EUCS certificates, which will then proceed to a review and certification  decision.  B.10 REVIEW OF THE EVALUATION  Once an assurance report and an evaluation report (and, if required, supporting reports) have been delivered by the  auditor, the CAB shall perform a review of all information and results related to the evaluation, based on these reports:   The review shall not be subcontracted;   The review shall be carried out by one or more persons who have not been involved in the audit phase, whom will  be called collectively the reviewer;   The recommendations for a certification decision based on the review shall be documented, unless the review and  the certification decision are completed concurrently by the same person;   The persons carrying out the review shall not normally overturn a negative recommendation of the audit team. If  such a situation does arise, the CAB shall document and justify the basis for the decision to overturn the  recommendation.  The review shall include at least the following activities:   A review of the sufficiency of the information provided in the assurance report and supporting documentation with  respect to the EUCS requirements and the certification scope;   A review of the nonconformities identified in the assurance report and related corrective actions   A review of the issues identified in the evaluation report’s dependency analysis; and   A recommendation for the certification decision, based on a documented opinion on whether or not the  requirements of the EUCS have been satisfied by the CSP and by the auditor.  B.10.1 Review of the sufficiency of the assurance report  The CAB shall review the assurance report and supporting documentation concerning the following aspects:  General  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   Does the report contain the required parts?   Does the provided documentation include the required support documentation?   Is the conformity assessment performed in due time?  Security controls and requirements  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   If there is a mapping from a set of controls provided by the CSP to the security controls and requirements defined  in EUCS, is this mapping adequate?   For every control or requirement analysed during the audit, have the appropriate activities been performed and  documented?  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  171  Nonconformities  The CAB shall review the assurance report and supporting documentation concerning the handling of nonconformities  detected during the audit.  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer.   For every major nonconformity identified during the audit, is adequate information provided in the assurance  report?   For every minor nonconformity identified during the audit, is adequate information provided in the assurance  report?   For every nonconformity identified during the audit, does the reviewer accept the analysis provided by the auditor?  B.10.2 Review of the evaluation report  Dependency analysis  The CAB shall review the dependency analysis and supporting documentation concerning the adequacy of the  assurance documentation available about subservice providers.  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   For every subservice provider mentioned in the assurance report, is there adequate assurance documentation  available?   For every assumption in the assurance report about a subservice provider, is the documentation available  adequate to determine that assumption correct?  Recommendation for the certification decision  The CAB shall review the recommendation for the certification decision provided in the evaluation report and how it  combined the conclusions of the audit report with those of the dependency analysis.  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   Is the certification decision proposed in the assurance report adequate according to the provided documentation?   In the case of a maintenance conformity assessment, does the proposed certification decision include all the  information required to maintain the certificate, with proper justification?   If the cloud service depends on subservice providers, is the assurance documentation adequate or not to support  the certification of the CSP using these subservice providers?  B.10.3 Review reporting  The results of the review shall be documented in a report, which shall include all the answers to the question above,  together with a justification.  If the conformity assessment results in the issuance or maintenance of a certificate, this review report shall be included  in the publicly available certification or maintenance report.  B.11 CERTIFICATION DECISION  The CAB shall assign at least one person to make the certification decision based on all information related to the  evaluation, its review, and any other relevant information. The certification decision shall be carried out by a person or  group of persons that has not been involved in the audit activities (but may have been involved in the review process).  The certification decision shall not be subcontracted.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  172  The CAB shall notify the CSP of a decision not to grant certification, to withdraw a certificate, or to suspend a  certificate, and shall identify the reasons for the decision. The CSP may contest the CAB’s decision. If the dispute  remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.  B.12 CERTIFICATION  If the certification decision is negative, i.e. if the cloud service has been determined not to meet the EUCS scheme’s  requirements, the consequences are as follows:   In the case of an initial conformity assessment, no further action is required, i.e. no certificate shall be issued;   In the case of a maintenance conformity assessment, the certificate shall be suspended by appending the  maintenance report as rationale for the suspension, and then the process for handling nonconformities shall be  followed.  If the certification decision is positive, i.e. if the cloud service has been determined not to meet the EUCS scheme’s  requirements, the consequences are as follows, depending of the nature of the assessment.   In the case of an initial assessment, the CAB shall issue a new certificate, including the full certification report, and  set the expiration date three (3) years after the date of issuance, unless the CAB has explicitly indicated a shorter  validity period for the certificate;   In the case of a periodic assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the maintenance  report, and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed;   In the case of a renewal assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the maintenance  report, by setting the expiration date of the certificate three (3) years after the date of this update, and if needed by  updating elements in the certificate that have changed;   In the case of a restoration assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the  maintenance report, and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed, and shall return the  certificate’s status to “certified”;   In the case of a restoration assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the  maintenance report, and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed;  The reports mentioned in the paragraph above are specified in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  173  ANNEX C: ASSESSMENT FOR  LEVELS SUBSTANTIAL AND HIGH  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable conformity assessment methods for levels  'substantial' and 'high'.  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria  Foreword for Reviewers  This annex has been recently separated from the main meta-approach, in order to support the integration of the  conformity assessment method for level Basic with the meta-approach, so there may be  a few remaining  inconsistencies in the text.  The current proposal is built on the following hypotheses:   All CSPs are subject to the same requirements in order to get their cloud services certified, regardless of the  way in which their cloud services are implemented (e.g., a SaaS provider implementing a full stack vs. a SaaS  provider relying on a subservice provider’s infrastructure).   The auditor is in charge of assessing the level of compliance and assurance for subservice providers based  on the information available, including assurance reports of various origins and evidence provided by the CSP  in their risk assessment of their subservice providers.  Some important templates, described in annexes, are missing, as we first need to determine to which extent they  are to be considered as requirements or as guidance.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  174  C.1 INTRODUCTION  The content of this Annex complements the Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services) for  conformity assessments where the CSP claims compliance to the Substantial and High assurance levels.  This Annex follows the content of the Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), and refines the  definition of the steps related to the audit by providing additional detail.  C.2 ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT  Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement the CAB shall determine whether the  application request is appropriate by performing a review of the application.  The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application to assess the applicability of the criteria as  set in the EUCS scheme, and to ensure that:   the application request contains all the mandatory information;   the information about the CSP and the service is sufficient for conducting of the assessment and the certification  process, and it fulfils the requirements defined in the EUCS scheme;   the CSP has acknowledged and understands its responsibilities as set out in Annex F: (Scheme Document  Content requirements)   any known difference in understanding between the CAB and the CSP is resolved, including agreement regarding  standards or other normative documents;   the scope of certification is clearly defined;   the resources, capabilities and competences are available to perform the conformity assessment activities,  including knowledge of the relevant industry, an understanding of information technology and systems and  experience in evaluating risks as they relate to the suitable design of controls, and experience in the design and  execution of tests of controls and the evaluation of the results.  The CAB may also express its opinion on the suitability of the assurance level selected by the CSP.  In the case of a recertification, the CAB shall also ensure that:   the reason for the recertification is clearly described; and   where applicable, the CSP has provided an impact assessment of the changes implemented since the last  assessment.  Once all the review criteria are fulfilled and the CAB and CSP have reached an agreement about the conditions of the  engagement, the auditor shall conduct the following major audit activities:  1. Developing the audit plan (section C.3);  2. Execution of assessment procedures (section C.4);  3. Analysis of results (section C.5);  4. Issue of an assurance report (section C.6) and of an evaluation report (section B.9).  Once the auditor has delivered the assurance report, the CAB shall perform the following activities:  5. Review of the evaluation (section B.10);  6. Certification decision (section B.11); and  7. Certification (section B.12).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  175  C.3 DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN  C.3.1 Introduction  The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in an effective manner, including setting the scope,  timing and direction of the assessment, and determining the nature, timing and extent of planned audit procedures that  are required to be carried out in order to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This activity shall result in  an audit plan as described in ISO 19011 and 17021, and including the aspects presented in section C.3.2 and C.3.3  below.  For each activity mentioned below: the auditor shall document the procedures executed, the information and  documentation used, the evidence gained, and the conclusion reached, as described in section C.3.3..  C.3.2 Initial activities  In this phase the auditor shall:   Obtain an Understanding of the CSP’s cloud service offered and the controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements, by reading provided documentation and inquiries of people  involved.  o The auditor shall obtain and read the CSP’s description of its system, identify the boundaries of that system,  and how it interfaces with other systems (e.g. cloud services provided by subservice organizations) and shall  evaluate whether those aspects of the description are fairly presented.   Assess, if applicable, the mapping between the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined  by the EUCS and the CSP’s control framework:  o To conclude whether the applicable Security Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS are  covered by the CSP’s internal controls;  o To identify any remaining risks (as a result of gaps in the mapping) and the possible impact of them;   Determine to what extent and for which elements of the CSP’s internal controls sub service organisations are  being used and how the CSP controls and monitors the services provided by these sub service organisations;  o To determine which assessment approach is appropriate: using the inclusive or carve-out method, or a  suitable alternative.  o To identify which sub service organisations do have an acceptable assurance report which can be (re)used.   Assess how the CSP dealt with complementary controls towards customers of the CSP (user entities) and towards  sub service organisations, as well complementary controls of sub service organisations towards the CSP.   Consider materiality, i.e. the relative importance and effect of possible omissions or deviations with respect to the  fair presentation of the description, the suitability of the design of controls and the operating effectiveness of  controls, primarily based on qualitative factors, for example: whether the description includes the significant  aspects of the cloud systems in accordance with the requirements as defined by the EUCS; whether the  description omits or distorts relevant information;  o Determine to what extent, if any, to use the work of an internal audit function from the CSP and/or to use  specific experts;  o The use of an internal audit function is highly dependent of a number of criteria  o The use of a specific expert is dependent of the nature of the audit procedure and the complexity of the item  to be examined.   Determine audit procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design,  implementation and the operating effectiveness of the CSP’s internal controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS. These procedures are described in the  detailed audit plan (C.3.3).   Determine the roles and responsibilities of the audit team members, as well as guides and observers or  interpreters;   Determine the logistics and communications arrangements, including specific arrangements for the locations to be  audited (e.g. datacentre visits);   Determine matters related to confidentiality and information security of records obtained during the audit;   Determine any follow-up actions from a previous audit or other source(s) e.g. lessons learned, project reviews.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  176  In the case of a recertification, the auditor shall also:   Analyse the impact assessment to determine the subset of audit activities that need to be performed in order to  cover the changes in the Cloud service since the last assessment; and   Analyse the reason for the recertification to determine the subset of audit activities that need to be performed in  order to satisfy the specific requirements for that trigger (see Annex G:, Certification Lifecycle and continued  assurance).  C.3.3 Detailed audit plan  Sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design, existence, and operating effectiveness of the CSP’s  controls shall be gathered using one or more of the following activities: inquiry, observation, inspection, and re-  performance of the control and re-performance of programmed processing, as defined in B.1.1.  Detailed reference audit procedures per Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the  EUCS shall be developed, using general guidelines on how to perform some of the audit activities. These references  audit procedures shall be the basis for the establishment of the audit plan, but they may need to be adapted to the  specific circumstances of the assessment, as explained below.  The CSP's actual approach to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the  EUCS will be different per CSP. Although they will all have certain elements in common, the actual design,  implementation and operation of the controls to meet the security requirements, will be different per organization.  As the actual design, implementation and operation of these controls will be different per organizations, the risks that  prevent the CSP from meeting the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS will  be different as well. The risks depend e.g. on   services provided by the CSP;   components of the systems used to provide the services;   environment in which the systems operate.  To deal with this situation, the auditor must be able to tailor the audit procedures for the specific circumstances. By  doing so, the following aspects are typically to be considered:   Whether there have been changes to the systems used to operate the service or the organization (e.g. changes in  processes, IT systems);   The competence of the personnel who perform the measures or monitor its performance and whether there have  been changes in key personnel;   History of errors in the operation of the measures (known from previous examinations);   The relevance and reliability of the evidence to be obtained;   The nature of the measures (including their level of automation) and the frequency with which it operates;   The degree to which the measures rely on the effectiveness of other measures.  The audit procedures need to be adapted to a specific security requirement and desired level of certification. Security  requirements have been constructed in a way that all security requirements for level basic are applicable to levels  substantial and high, while security requirements for level substantial also apply to level high. Therefore, it is necessary  to access all security requirements on the specific level, including those from lower levels. Security requirements that  were initially written for level Basic, are also applicable to levels Substantial and High, but they would be assessed in  different ways according the certification level.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  177  Figure 5: the Audit procedure  Based on the analysis above the auditor shall determine for each control and security measure under audit:   the nature (what kind of audit procedure),   the extent (how many or how often to execute the procedure), and   the timing (at what point in time or over what period)  of the evidence gathering audit procedures.  NATURE  The nature of an audit procedures relates to the kind of an audit procedures and describes the way how to obtain the  evidence required.  Selecting the nature depends on the specific characteristics of the specific control or security measure under audit.  The rigour and depth increase from substantial to high assurance level. The different natures of activities are described  in section B.1.1.  EXTENT  The extent of an audit procedure relates to the number of observations to be performed, the rigour and dept of  inquiries, how many inspections are needed, and the number of re-performances of a specific audit procedure.  Determining the extent depends on the specific characteristics of the control or security measure and the assurance  level required. The extent in case of the assurance level high is much higher than for assurance level substantial. In  many cases, especially for testing operating effectiveness, a sampling approach is appropriate.  Sampling  The size of the samples to select in order to test the operating effectiveness of controls primarily depends on the  nature and frequency of the control. The following sample sizes should provide reasonable assurance that the tested  controls operated effectively during the specified period and that the associated control objectives were achieved  during that specified period. Where the population of occurrences falls between the levels identified in the table below,  the number of items to test shall be interpolated, exercising professional judgment in determining the appropriate  sample size.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  178  Table 5: Determining sample size  Frequency of the control Assumed population of control  occurrences  Sample Size  (per specified period)  More than daily Over 250 25 - 60  Daily 250 20 - 40  Weekly 52 5 - 15  Monthly 12 2 - 5  Quarterly 4 2  Annually 1 1  Timing  The timing of an audit procedure relates to the point in time of a period to be covered of an audit procedure.  For obtaining evidence about design and implementation/existence the audit procedures are built around a certain  point in time: the reporting date.  For obtaining evidence about operating effectiveness the audit procedure need to cover a period before the reporting  date (typically 12 months, or 3-6 months for an initial audit), which is fixed in the scheme and in Annex G: (Certification  Lifecycle and continued assurance), depending on the assessment type.  Documentation  The detailed plan shall be documented following the requirements defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content  requirements) for the “Audit Plan and Execution”.  For each control or security measure under audit the template shall be used covering the following topics:   the control or security measure under audit;   for the suitability of the design, the existence and implementation, and operating effectiveness:  o nature of the audit procedure;  o timing of the audit procedure;  o extent of the audit procedure;   the documents used, the names and function of the inquired people, other information;   the evidence obtained;   the conclusion reached.  These procedures will vary between engagements and depends, among other things, on the requested assurance  level (Substantial or High) and the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material non-conformity  of the matter being investigated. All the three elements increase in scope, depth and rigour as the level of assurance  increases.  C.3.4 Audit plan review  The auditor may request the reviewer (see B.10) to provide an opinion on the audit plan, to ensure that they agree on  the structure and content of the plan before its execution. The CSP may explicitly request this review to be performed  before starting the execution of the audit plan.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  179  C.4 EXECUTION  C.4.1 Suitability of the Design of Controls  A control is suitably designed, when actions or events that comprise a risk (e.g. for information security) are prevented,  or detected and corrected. Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls requires the auditor to  determine whether   The risks that threaten the achievement of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined by the EUCS have been identified by the CSP;   The controls would, if operating effectively, provide reasonable assurance that those risks would not prevent the  Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS from being met.  To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall:   obtain an understanding of the CSP’s process for identifying and evaluating the risks that threaten the  achievement of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements and assessing the  completeness and accuracy of the CSP’s identification of those risks,   evaluate the linkage of the controls with those risks, which is typically a consideration of frequency or timing of the  occurrence or performance of the control (e.g. monthly, weekly, per triggering action or event such as a service  request);   evaluate the party responsible for conducting the control (e.g. competence and authority of the person, group or  system);   understand the specific activity being performed by the party to determine especially how the control is triggered,  how it is executed, which tools or systems are used to support the execution and which records are kept  evidencing the execution; and   validate the source of information (for example a log file, archive, ticketing system, etc.) to which the control is  applied to determine whether this source is reliable and ensures for completeness and accuracy of information  processing.  Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls typically requires the auditor to perform inquiries  with the CSP’s subject matter experts and the examination of supporting documentation that describe how the control  should operate, e.g. written policies, procedures or process flowcharts.  C.4.2 Existence and Implementation of controls and security measures  In order to prevent, or detect and correct actions that comprise a risk, the controls have to be placed in operation as  designed.  After the auditor has concluded that a control is suitably designed, is has to be concluded per control whether the  control actually exists and is implemented as designed.  To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall obtain evidence that the controls and security measures have been  implemented by examining exemplary actions or events that triggered the occurrence or performance of the controls  (e.g. tickets) and to inspect the environment in which it operates (e.g. suitable configuration of the tools or systems  used to execute the control in accordance with the design).  C.4.3 Operating effectiveness  Controls considered to be suitable in design, shall be tested for operating effectiveness over a certain period of time  (specified period). The auditor shall design the tests in a manner to cover a representative number of actions and  events that triggered the occurrence or performance of the controls throughout the specified period.  For initial certification the period shall be at least 3 months for level Substantial and 6 months for level High; for  subsequent certification the period is 12 months or the time since the operating effectiveness was last tested in a  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  180  previous conformity assessment. In all cases, the period to consider shall be the period that precedes immediately the  conformity assessment.  In determining the nature, timing and extent of the tests the following the auditor shall consider:   the nature and frequency of the controls being tested,   the types of available evidential matter,   the nature of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements to be met;   the assessed level of control risk,   the expected efficiency and effectiveness of the tests, and   the results of tests of the control environment.  A control is operating effectively, if   it was consistently applied as designed throughout the specified period, and   in case of manual controls, they were applied by individuals who have the appropriate competence and authority  (e.g. changes being only approved by personnel who are responsible for the service being provided).  To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall perform procedures such as inspection, observation, or re-  performance in combination with inquiry to obtain evidence about the following:   how the control was applied;   the consistency with which the control was applied; and   by whom or by what means the control was applied.  An inquiry alone is NOT sufficient to determine whether a control operated effectively. This also applies to controls, if  applicable, over the out-sourced processes to sub-service providers.  At level High, in addition to the testing for operating effectiveness, the CAB and the CSP shall define procedures for  the automated monitoring of key security controls, including at least:   A description of automated monitoring mechanisms implemented by the CSP;   A description of the procedures implemented by the CSP to handle the deviations and nonconformities identified  through automated monitoring;   A description of the procedures used to notify the CAB, at least when any major nonconformity is identified  through automated evidence gathering.  Specific controls and requirements are defined in  Annex A:, Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services  that define the general requirements for these procedures, and also define the minimum et of automated evidence  gathering mechanisms to be implemented by the CSP.  C.5 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  C.5.1 Evaluation of evidence obtained  The auditor shall evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness of the evidence obtained from the executed audit  procedures to conclude about the suitability of the design, existence and implementation, and operating effectiveness.  The evidence obtained shall be appropriate and sufficient to enable the auditor to take informed decisions.  In addition, when using information produced (or provided) by the CSP, the auditor shall evaluate whether this  information is reliable enough for executing the planned audit procedures by obtaining evidence about the accuracy  and completeness of such information and evaluating whether the information was appropriately precise, detailed,  consistent and current.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  181  Sufficiency is the measure of the quantity of evidence. The quantity of evidence needed is affected by the risks of that  the description is not fairly presented and that the controls were not suitably designed or operating and, if required,  functioning effectively, and also by the quality of such evidence (the higher the quality, the less may be required).  Obtaining more evidence, however, may not compensate for its poor quality.  Appropriateness is the measure of the quality of evidence; that is, its relevance and its reliability in providing support  for the auditor’s opinion. The reliability of evidence is influenced by its source and by its nature, and is dependent on  the individual circumstances under which it is obtained.  All relevant evidence shall be considered, regardless of whether it appears to corroborate or to contradict the analysis  of the description or the controls against the applicable security requirements of the EUCS.  If the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to conclude on a given requirement, then the audit  shall be considered inconclusive. This should be considered as a nonconformity, and handled as defined in B.6.1.  C.5.2 Analysis of controls to meet the applicable Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements of the EUCS  The analysis of the suitability of the design, existence and implementation, and operating effectiveness of the CSP’s  internal controls, is based on the requirements outlined in section C.4 above.  For analysing whether the CSP’s internal controls meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security  Requirements of the EUCS, the auditor has to consider whether the controls fully cover all aspects of the Security  Requirements. Several controls may be required in combination per Security Requirement to fully meet each security  requirement.  If the CSP already performs audits in accordance with other standards (e.g. ISO 27001 or SOC 2), it is possible that  the controls presented in the description may be optimally aligned with the criteria of these standards, but that their  descriptions do not fully meet all aspects of the Security Requirement of the EUCS to which they are mapped to.  The auditor’s test procedures and the results thereof shall be documented in the report according to the examples in  the table below  Security Control  Objectives  <Service-Org>’s  Description of Controls  Tests Performed Test Results  Objective: description  ID – Security  requirement  ID – Title of Control  [Control Description]  Test performed by the  auditor  Test result by the  auditor  In describing the tests of controls in the assurance report, the auditor shall clearly state per control tested, whether the  items tested represent all or a selection of the items in the population. The auditor shall further indicate the nature of  the tests in sufficient detail to enable the CAB’s review team as the report recipient to review whether the auditor has  obtained sufficient and appropriate objective in accordance with the requirements as outlined in section C.4.  If nonconformities (or deviations) have been identified, the auditor shall record them against a specific control,  including a description of the objective evidence on which the nonconformity is based, the extent of testing performed  that led to identification of the nonconformities (including the sample size where sampling has been used), and the  number and nature of the nonconformities noted. The auditor shall report nonconformities even if, on the basis of tests  performed, he has concluded that the related Security Requirement of the EUCS were met, and even if the CSP has  implemented corrective actions to address the nonconformities and the auditor has determined that the corrective  actions effectively address the nonconformities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  182  C.6 ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT  After evaluating the result of the audit procedures the auditor shall form a conclusion and issue an assurance report.  The conclusion shall include the audit team’s recommendation as to whether the cloud service should be certified or  not. The conclusion shall be based on the evidence obtained and the audit activities performed, and express whether,  in all material respects,  (1) For Substantial Level:  (i) the CSP’s description fairly presents its cloud service, including the controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS, and is free from material misstatements as of a  specified date (in case of an initial conformity assessment) or throughout a specified period (in case of a  subsequent conformity assessment);  (ii) the controls stated in the CSP’s description were suitably designed, existed and were implemented to provide  reasonable assurance that the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS  were met as of a specified date (in case of an initial conformity assessment) or throughout a specified period (in  case of a subsequent conformity assessment); and  (iii) the controls stated in the CSP’s description operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the  Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS were met throughout a specified  period; or.  (2) For High Level:  (iv) (i) and (ii) above noted for Substantial Level; and  (v) the controls stated in the CSP’s description operated and functioned effectively to provide reasonable  assurance that the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS were met  throughout a specified period.  The auditor shall issue the assurance report using the template in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content  requirements).  This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  183  ANNEX D: ASSESSMENT FOR  LEVEL BASIC  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable conformity assessment method for level Basic.  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria  Foreword for Reviewers  This annex has been integrated recently.  Some important templates, described in annexes, are missing, as we first need to determine to which extent they  are to be considered as requirements or as guidance. Also, for level Basic, some documents are based on  checklists, which will be built with numerous references to the scheme’s security requirements, as defined in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  184  D.1 INTRODUCTION  At the Basic assurance level, the conformity assessment is greatly simplified, and it relies solely on evidence provided  by the CSP, if needed upon explicit request from the CAB. For consistency reasons, we will use the same terminology  (audit, auditor, audit team) as for the other assurance levels, also the evaluation performed is not a full-fledged audit of  the cloud service to be certified.  For the assurance level Basic the reviewer shall use the approach defined in the present Annex.  This approach is facilitating a controlled environment for providing limited assurance while keeping the associated cost  for certification affordable for smaller CSP’s, through limited evaluation of the control framework of the CSP by an  independent reviewer that the cloud service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet the  corresponding Security Objectives and related Security Requirements defined in the EUCS.  The EU Cybersecurity Act requires for the assurance level Basic that the evaluation must minimise the known basic  risks of incidents and cyberattacks, and that a review of technical documentation is required at a minimum.  While the CSP shall be required to conduct the necessary initial verification of compliance with the objectives and  controls of this scheme, at the basic level there will be a review of the documentation created or compiled by the CSP  as a part of its internal verifications.  D.2 ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT  Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement the CAB shall determine whether the  application request is appropriate by performing a review of the application.  The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application to assess the applicability of the criteria as  set in the EUCS, including the decision whether the chosen assurance level is appropriate in the circumstances, and to  ensure that:   the application request contains all the mandatory information;   the information about the CSP and the service is sufficient for conducting of the assessment and the certification  process;   the CSP has acknowledged and understands its responsibilities as set out in TBD   any known difference in understanding between the CAB and the CSP is resolved, including agreement regarding  standards or other normative documents;   the scope of certification is clearly defined;   the means are available to perform all evaluation activities;   the resources, capabilities and competences are available to perform the engagement, including knowledge of the  relevant industry, an understanding of information technology and systems and experience in evaluating risks as  they relate to the suitable design of controls, and experience in the design and execution of tests of controls and  the evaluation of the results.  In addition, the auditor shall obtain a legally binding declaration of the CSP that it acknowledges and understands its  responsibility and complies at least, with the following:   the CSP is responsible for the preparation of the description of its system (“Description”), and accompanying  CSP’s assertion (“Management Statement”);   if the certification applies to ongoing service provision, the certified service continues to fulfil the security  requirements;   the CSP agrees to on-site reviews in case they would be necessary to clarify assertions or to resolve complaints  disputes;   the CSP makes claims regarding certification consistent with the scope of certification;   the CSP does not use its service certification in such a manner as to bring the certification body into disrepute and  does not make any statement regarding its service certification that the certification body may consider misleading  or unauthorized;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  185   upon suspension, withdrawal, or termination of certification, the CSP discontinues its use of all advertising matter  that contains any reference thereto and takes any other required measure, and inform their customers;   in referring to its service certification in communication media such as documents, brochures or advertising, the  CSP complies with the requirements of the certification body;   the CSP complies with any requirements that may be prescribed in the certification scheme relating to the use of  marks of conformity, and on information related to the service;   the CSP keeps a record of all complaints made known to it relating to compliance with security requirements and  makes these records available to the certification body when requested, and  o takes appropriate action with respect to such complaints and any deficiencies found in service that affect  compliance with the security requirements;  o documents the actions taken;   the CSP informs the certification body, without delay, of changes that may affect its ability to conform with the  certification requirements.   the CSP agrees to fees payable to the CAB for the execution of the conformity assessment communicated  beforehand  In the case of a recertification, the CAB shall also ensure that:   the trigger for the recertification is clearly described; and   where applicable, the CSP has provided an impact assessment of the changes implemented since the last  assessment.  Once all the review criteria are fulfilled and the CAB and CSP have reached an agreement about the conditions of the  engagement, the auditor shall conduct the following major audit activities:  1. Developing the audit plan (section D.3);  2. Execution of assessment procedures (section D.4);  3. Analysis of results (section D.5);  4. Issue of an assurance report (section D.6) and of an evaluation report (section B.9).  Once the auditor has delivered the assurance report, the CAB shall perform the following activities:  5. Review of the evaluation (section B.10);  6. Certification decision (section B.11); and  7. Certification (section B.12).  D.3 DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN  D.3.1 Introduction  The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in an effective manner, including setting the scope,  timing and direction of the audit to be carried out in order to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This  can be achieved by using a predefined audit plan.  For each activity mentioned below: the auditor shall document the high-level audit plan following the requirements  defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements), including the procedures executed, the information  and documentation used, the evidence gained, and the conclusion reached.  There shall be at least one meeting between the CAB and the CSP during the development of the audit plan, to  provide clarifications about the cloud service and related controls and about the next phases of the audit.  D.3.2 Initial activities  In this phase the assessor shall:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  186   Obtain an Understanding of the CSP’s cloud service offered and the controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements, by reading provided documentation and inquiries of people  involved.  o The auditor shall obtain and read the CSP’s description of its system, identify the boundaries of that system,  and how it interfaces with other systems (e.g. cloud services provided by subservice organizations) and shall  evaluate whether those aspects of the description are fairly presented.   Review the CSP’s mapping between the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the  EUCS and the CSP’s control framework:  o To conclude whether the applicable Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the  EUCS are covered by the CSP’s internal controls;  o To identify any remaining risks (as a result of gaps in the mapping) and the possible impact of them;   Determine to what extent and for which processes the CSP uses sub service providers and how the CSP controls  and monitors the services provided by these sub service providers;  o To determine which assessment approach is appropriate: using the inclusive or carve-out method.  o To identify which sub service providers do have an acceptable assurance report which can be (re)used.   Review how the CSP dealt with complementary controls towards customers of the CSP (user entities) and  towards sub service providers, as well complementary controls of sub service providers towards the CSP:  o Does the CSP has CCC for its costumer defined?  o Does the CSP fulfils the CCC of the subservice provider for the services consumed?   Consider the relative importance and effect of possible omissions or deviations with respect to the fair  presentation of the description,  o whether the description includes the significant aspects of the cloud systems;  o whether the description omits or distorts relevant information;   Determine self-assessment and audit procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the  design and implementation of the CSP’s internal controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS by using a review plan.  D.3.3 The audit plan  Sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design and implementation of the CSP’s internal controls can  be obtained through, inspection of the provided documentary evidence and if necessary, by inquiry to be able to  evaluate the provided documentary evidence in order to determine whether  1. the evidence addresses the security requirements of the scheme in a sufficiently comprehensive manner;  2. the evidence is sufficiently clear and unambiguous in how the requirements are met and how controls have been  implemented by the CSP;  3. the evidence is prima facie plausible (i.e. it appears in the professional opinion of the reviewer that there are no  elements in the evidence that are manifestly inaccurate, incomplete or false) and verifiable (can in principle be  verified by an on-site audit).  This can be achieved by using a standardized self-assessment and audit plan (To be developed), The CAB shall then  provide the self-assessment plan to the CSP, together with indications on its specific application to the targeted cloud  service.  D.4 EXECUTION  In the phase the auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence by evaluation the provided  documentary evidence by the CSP regarding:   the suitability of the design of controls, including controls over the out-sourced processes (such as hosting,  infrastructure, platform, etc.) to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined by the EUCS;   the actual existence and implementation of controls to be in accordance with their design as of a point in time  (specified date).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  187  The execution phase starts when the CSP provides the results of their self-assessment, together with all required  supporting documentation. The auditor shall document the procedures executed, the evidence gained and conclusions  reached using a standardized document (To be developed)  A control is suitably designed when actions or events that comprise a risk (e.g. for information security) are prevented  or detected and corrected. Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls requires the auditor to  determine whether   The risks that threaten the achievement of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined by the EUCS have been identified by management;   The controls are, if operating effectively, able to prevent or detect Security Control Objectives and related Security  Requirements of the EUCS from not being met.  In order to prevent, or detect and correct actions that comprise a risk, the controls have to be placed in operation as  designed. After the auditor has concluded that a control is suitably designed, is has to be concluded per control  whether the control actually exists and is implemented as designed by examining the provided documentary evidence.  To be able to conclude on this the reviewer shall obtain evidence related to exemplary actions or events that triggered  the occurrence or performance of the controls (e.g. tickets) and to inspect the environment in which it operates (e.g.  suitable configuration of the tools or systems used to execute the control in accordance with the design).  D.5 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  In forming the conclusions on the evidence obtained the auditor shall  1. Evaluate whether the described technical and organizational controls refer to or describe the applicable  requirements of the Certification framework;  2. Consider whether the provided documents adequately disclose the significant information security policies and the  selected and implemented technical and organizational measures;  3. Consider whether the information security policies and technical and organizational measures are deemed  suitable to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS considering the  nature of the service;  4. The information provided appears relevant, reliable, comprehensive and comparable.  On this basis the auditor shall assess if it can be concluded that nothing has come to its attention that causes the  reviewer to believe that the technical and organizational manners warranted by the CSP are not meeting in all material  aspects the requirements of the Basic level in accordance with the Certification framework and that the evidence  presented is at least sufficient for the reviewer to obtain a limited level of assurance.  The auditor shall document the results of the review in the report according to the examples in the (mapping) table  below.

EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  190  ANNEX F: SCHEME DOCUMENT  CONTENT REQUIREMENTS  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable requirements on the minimum content to be  included in the scheme documents  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter  Foreword for Reviewers  The content of this Annex specifies requirements regarding the content of documents to be used in the scheme.  Some of these requirements have been defined very late in the development of the draft candidate scheme, and  they have not gone through a full review by the members ad hoc working group.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  191  F.1 INTRODUCTION  The objective of this Annex is to define guidelines for the redaction of documents. Rather than providing full templates,  the Annex lists requirements for writing the documents, which typically takes three forms:   Requirements on content that shall be present, without constraints on the format;   Requirements on text that shall be included as is, for a few important statements; and   Requirements on the format and content of tables, to ease comparability of results.  These requirements will be refined by specific guidance for every assessment type (ISO-based, ISAE-based, or  EBCA).  F.1.1 Conventions used in this annex  Every section below starts with an introduction, followed by the requirements on the document, presented in a  sequential manner that defines the structure of the document.  Within each section, this annex uses with the following convention:   Requirements are typeset in plain text.   Guidance is typeset in italics.   Mandatory text is typeset in bold.   Items in a document are referenced by an identifier, which is defined within brackets in <SMALL CAPS>  The rules for using these requirements are as follows:   Specified sections shall be present, in the order defined, but other sections may be added before, between and  after the specified sections;   Within a section, mandatory text shall be present and the section’s requirements shall be fulfilled, but additional  content may be added;  F.1.2 List of the documents  Requirements and guidance are provided in this annex for the following documents:   For the application phase  i) The Application Document, to be filled out by the CSP to initiate a conformity assessment   For the audit preparation phase  i) The Initial Activities Planning document, to be prepared by the CSP at the beginning of the conformity  assessment  ii) The Detailed Audit Plan and Execution, to be prepared by the CSP before the audit and updated with the  results all along the audit.   For the reporting phase  i) The Assurance Report, to be prepared by the CAB to report on the audit of the cloud service from the CSP.  ii) The Evaluation Report, to be prepared by the CAB to report on the assurance provided by the CSP’s  subservice providers and to conclude on the audit by providing a certification recommendation.  iii) The Review Report, to be prepared by the CAB after the internal review of the Assurance and Evaluation  Reports.   For the certification phase  i) The Certification Report, to be prepared by the CAB when the certificate is issued   For the maintenance phase  i) The Impact Analysis Report, to be prepared by the CAB when a request about a potential nonconformity or  vulnerability does not lead to a conformity assessment.  ii) The Maintenance Report, to be prepared by the CAB after a maintenance conformity assessment, with a  focus on the updates to the cloud service and on the reason that triggered the conformity assessment  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  192  These documents do not all have the same usage and availability:   The Application Document, Assurance Report and Evaluation Report are shared between the CSP and the CAB.   In addition, the CSP shall make the Assurance Report available to its customers upon request.   The Initial Activities Planning, Detailed Audit Plan and Execution, and the Review Report are internal documents  for the CAB.   The Certification Report is a public document, to be published together with the certificate.  All documents may be made available by the CAB to the NCCA and NAB for review or assessment.  Finally, the Assurance Report is only available in a version suitable for the Substantial and High assurance levels. A  version suitable for the Basic assurance level will be provided in a later phase. Requirements for the Review Report,  for the Impact Analysis Report and for the Maintenance Report are not available in the current version.

EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  217  F.7 MAINTENANCE REPORTS  F.7.1 Impact analysis report  In some cases, the monitoring activities will lead to requests regarding potential nonconformities or vulnerabilities that  will not lead to a conformity assessment. This report would outline the answer from the SP and the analysis from the  CAB.  F.7.2 Maintenance report  The need for a maintenance report is still under discussion. A maintenance report would be a version of the  certification report tailored for maintenance assessments. In particular, it would focus on the changes since the last  report, to make the crucial information more easily accessible to scheme users.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  218  ANNEX G: CERTIFICATION  LIFECYCLE AND CONTINUED  ASSURANCE  PURPOSE This annex describes additional content related to the chapters on certification  lifecycle and continued assurance  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 11, Compliance Monitoring  Chapter 12, Certificate Management  Chapter 13, Non-Compliance  Chapter 14, New Vulnerabilities  Foreword for Reviewers  This Annex is work in progress; its content is not final, and it is only intended to provide an overview of the planned  processes for the different types of conformity assessment needed.  It has not yet reviewed by the TG3 and TG5 thematic group.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  219  G.1 ASSESSMENT DURING MAINTENANCE  The initial conformity assessment of a cloud service shall cover all parts of the assessment methods defined in  Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and  High), Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic) for all EUCS requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and  requirements for Cloud Services).  However, during maintenance some conformity assessments may be simplified, provided that they follow the minimum  requirements defined below.  G.1.1 Periodic assessment  In a periodic assessment, the conformity assessment shall include at least the following activities.  Analysis of the change in the cloud service  These activities are required at all assurance levels.  The CAB shall at least:   Obtain an understanding of the changes operated since the last assessment in the cloud service and the CSP’s  controls to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements;   Determine a list of affected controls, based on the CSP’s Impact Assessment and if needed on additional  inquiries;   Assess the suitability of the design of the modified controls.   Assess the existence and implementation of the modified controls.  Partial reassessment of controls  These activities are only required at assurance levels Substantial and High.  The CAB shall at least:   Select a subset of controls, including at least the controls for which nonconformities have been detected in the  previous assessment and controls defined in a dedicated guidance to be provided on a regular basis by ENISA  with the support of the ECCG.   Assess the suitability of the design of the modified controls.  Effectiveness assessment  These activities are only required at assurance levels Substantial and High.  The CAB shall at least:   Assess the operating effectiveness of all controls over the period since the previous assessment of operating  effectiveness.  If some controls have been affected by the changes in the cloud service since the last assessment and if they have  been operating for less than 3 months (6 months for level High), the CAB shall assess to which extent of the changes  affect their ability to assess the operating effectiveness of the controls.  G.1.2 Renewal assessment  Alike an initial assessment, a renewal assessment of a cloud service shall cover all parts of the assessment methods  defined in Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels  Substantial and High), Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic) for all EUCS requirements defined in Annex A: (Security  Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  220  However, in the context of a renewal assessment, some controls may not have changed since the last assessment. In  such cases, the CAB may consider the previous assessment they have made of the suitability of the design in their  analysis, provided that they put their focus on the changes in the risk environment and the potential impact of these  changes on the controls.  G.1.3 Restoration assessment  In the restoration assessment, the objective is to perform a highly focused conformity assessment on the measures  taken by the CSP to fulfil some EUCS requirements for which major nonconformities have been detected.  In a restoration assessment, the conformity assessment shall include at least the following activities.  Analysis of the change in the cloud service  These activities are required at all assurance levels.  The CAB shall at least:   Obtain an understanding of the changes operated since the last assessment in the cloud service and the CSP’s  controls to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements;   Determine a list of affected controls, based on the CSP’s Impact Assessment and if needed on additional  inquiries;   Assess the suitability of the design of the modified controls;   Assess the existence and implementation of the modified controls;   Determine whether the changes on the controls are sufficient to fulfil all the EUCS requirements for which major  nonconformities have been detected  Effectiveness assessment  These activities are only required at assurance levels Substantial and High.  The CAB shall at least:   Assess the operating effectiveness of modified controls over the period since the previous assessment of  operating effectiveness.  Since the controls have been affected by the changes in the cloud service since their last assessment and if they have  been operating for less than 3 months (6 months for level High), the CAB shall assess to which extent of the changes  affect their ability to assess the operating effectiveness of the controls.  G.1.4 Ad hoc assessment  An ad hoc assessment can be triggered by a CSP at any time, typically after performing significant changes to their  cloud service or their security controls, which require a specific assessment.  The mandatory activities for an ad hoc assessment are therefore the same as for a periodic assessment.  G.2 RE-ASSESSMENT AND AUDITS FOR COMPLIANCE MONITORING  Specific procedures may be triggered by the NCCA in the context of compliance monitoring, which are described  below.  G.2.1 Re-assessment  NCCAs are required in the context of the compliance monitoring process to perform a number of re-assessments every  year, depending on the number of certificates issued or maintained during the previous year.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  221  In the first step of the re-assessment, the NCCA shall perform again the review phase performed by the CAB before  taking the decision to issue or maintain the certificate, based on the documentation that was available at the time to the  reviewer.  If needed for their review, the NCCA may contact the CSP in order to be granted access to the documents for which  they have only provided restricted access to the CAB during the audit.  Following this review, the NCCA may request additional information about any of the activities performed during any  stage of the conformity assessment. For each activity, the NCCA may:   request additional information and explanations from the CAB;   have the CAB perform the activity again, possibly while monitored by a NCCA representative;   have a NCCA representative perform the activity again.  Any NCCA representative being granted access to information from the CSP or performing any conformity assessment  shall be submitted to the same requirements as CAB employees performing similar activities.  The CSP shall support re-assessment activities as they supported the original conformity assessment activities.  G.2.2 Compliance audits  The NCCA may request a compliance audit if they have some reasons to doubt that a CSP complies to all their  obligations with respect to the scheme, for instance after receiving a complaint.  The NCCA shall address a compliance audit request to the CAB, indicating the potential non-compliance that is  suspected. Then, the process should be as follows:   The CAB shall transmit the request to the CSP, after adding any information that they deem suitable based on  their knowledge of the certified cloud service;   The CSP shall then analyse the request and provide a motivated answer to the CAB, describing in particular any  non-compliance or nonconformity they may have detected in their analysis, accompanied by supporting  documentation if required;   The CAB shall then analyse the answer from the CSP, and transmit the CSP’s answer with their analysis back to  the NCCA.  If the CSP does not confirm the CSP’s analysis, then the NCCA shall take the final decision after consulting both  parties.  If non-compliance or nonconformities have been detected, then the appropriate process(es) shall be triggered.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  222  ANNEX H: PEER ASSESSMENT  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable procedure for peer assessments  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 22, Peer Assessment  Foreword for Reviewers  This Annex has been integrated recently, and it has not yet reviewed by the TG5 thematic group.  This Annex is an adaptation of the Annex 12 of the EUCC scheme. Because the topic is quite generic and covers  the general organization of peer assessment rather than detailed technical requirements, the content has been  only slightly modified.  Because the content has been adapted from EUCC, there may be leftover references to products, Common  Criteria, ITSEFs, and other terms that normally don’t belong to EUCS. Please flag such issues, and take note that  there is no willingness to use these terms here.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  223  H.1 SCOPE  This annex describes the applicable procedure for peer assessments. The procedure consists of four phases:  preparation, site visit, reporting, and adoption of a report.  The procedure only defines the process to be followed. In order to be as comprehensive and objective as possible,  checklists shall be further developed in cooperation with the ECCG to assist the peer assessment team. These  checklists will contain a common understanding of state of the art23 and operating practices.  H.2 OVERVIEW  The primary assessment team shall consist of two EUCS experts (Leader and co-Leader) selected from two CABs  issuing certificates at the assurance level High of the EUCS.  This primary assessment team may be extended with additional EUCS experts from other or the same CABs, and in  the case of a delegation of the issuance of certificates or of prior approval of certificates, an expert from the concerned  NCCA may be associated to the selected CAB expert into the team.  Figure 6: Assessment team organisation  Each EUCS expert in the assessment team shall have a minimum of two years of experience as a certifier at a CAB  issuing EUCS certificates at assurance level High. In addition, at least one EUCS expert in the assessment team shall  have previously participated to the assessment of competences of CABs issuing certificates at level High, as listed in  Chapter 7 (Specific requirements applicable to a CAB).  23 As discussed in cooperation with the ECCG and/or relevant subgroups.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  224  The peer assessment team may be assisted by subject matter experts. Those experts may be certifiers themselves,  but that is not essential.  It is also highly recommended that the peer assessment team members have participated in previous peer  assessments under the EUCS scheme, either as observers or team members.  The peer assessment may be observed by observers proposed by other NCCAs.  The peer assessed CAB may present to the ECCG any concern it has about the choice of the peer assessment team  members and observers, for example in case of a conflict of interest  The peer assessment activities will be carried out in four phases.  The preparation phase will involve the review of the CAB documentation by the members of the peer assessment team  in order to become familiar with the CAB’s policies and procedures.  The site visit phase will consist of a two-week visit by the peer assessment team to the CAB in order to assess the  CAB’s technical competence, and where applicable of auditors performing evaluation activities. The exact duration of  site visit will depend on the possible reuse of existing peer assessment evidence and results, and on the number of  auditors subcontracted by the CAB.  The peer assessment will include a reporting phase: the assessment team will document their findings in a peer  assessment report delivered to the ECCG.  The peer assessment will conclude with the adoption of an opinion by the ECCG of the outcome of the peer  assessment.  H.3 SCHEDULING PEER ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES  In accordance with the planning established by the ECCG, and taking into consideration the possible priorities  indicated in Chapter 22, Peer Assessment, the ECCG shall notify the CAB of the peer assessment, and will task a peer  assessment team to perform the peer assessment.  The peer assessed CAB shall submit the required number of candidate services for which the CAB has performed a  conformity assessment, for review by the peer assessment team. In general the candidate services shall cover all  technical aspects of the audit.  The required number of candidate services is:   At least two (2) services; and   At least one (1) service for every auditor accredited as subcontractor for the CAB at assurance level High, if  applicable.  The requested information and the list of candidate products (and auditors) shall be provided by the peer assessed  CAB to the peer assessment team within one month after the notification by the ECCG.  The assessment team will arrange the dates for the peer assessed CAB and where applicable auditor(s) site visit(s).  H.4 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PEER ASSESSED CB  The peer assessed CAB shall provide the following documentation:   a full description of its scope, organization and operation, including:  o the title, address and principal point of contact;  o its role according to Article 56;  o the accreditation decision for the CAB;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  225  o the procedures for certification;  o where applicable, the procedures for the prior approval for each individual certificate or the requirements from  a general delegation;  o the rules applying within the peer assessed CB and its internal or external auditors to the protection of  protected other sensitive information;  o the titles and addresses of the auditors participating in the activities and their status (commercial or  governmental);  o the procedures by which the peer assessed CAB ensures that auditors apply the evaluation criteria and  methods correctly and consistently and protect the confidentiality of sensitive information involved;   the latest list of the certificates issues by the peer assessed CAB for the last five years;   two or more certificates and Certification Reports issued which are selected by the peer assessment team;   where reuse of the results of a previous peer assessment is proposed, associated results, under the conditions of  Chapter 22, Peer Assessment;   the list of all auditors that perform evaluations for that domain and a description of the evidence used when  assessing the competences of these auditors.  In addition, all relevant information about the quality management system that has been implemented by the CAB in  order to obtain accreditation by its NAB shall be provided. It should be noted that this information is provided for  informative purposes and that the content of this information is not the focus of the peer assessment. Any deviations  from processes described in these documents that are found shall however be reported.  All written documentation and communications for the peer assessment activities must be provided in English at least  4 weeks before the audit date.  During the site visit, English will be spoken, unless the CAB and the peer assessment team unanimously agree upon  another language.  One part of the peer assessment activities during the site visit will involve a review of at least one evaluation that has  been completed or is close to being completed within the CAB.  Although the conformity assessments for chosen services submitted for consideration need not be entirely complete,  there must be records showing that significant evaluation analysis and certification activities have been performed, and  that the majority of the evaluation report has been delivered to and reviewed by the certification team.  In addition to the selected services, the CAB may also provide the peer assessment team with information on (up to)  another two conformity assessments which were completed in the 12 months prior to the start of the peer assessment  activities. If the peer assessment team has sufficient time and resources, they will review these conformity  assessments during their site visit and, if they are found to be compliant with the EUCS scheme requirements, will take  them into consideration within the peer assessment report.  The CAB is responsible for preparing, documenting and providing general information on the candidate services. This  information will be provided to the peer assessment team for their review and selection and shall include:   a brief overview of the product,   the status of the conformity assessment (if not completed, then indicate what parts have been completed and what  remains to be done),   the target assurance level,   any Security Profile compliance claims.  The peer assessment team will select at least one candidate evaluation(s) to be assessed during the site visit(s) of the  CAB and where applicable of the auditor(s).  The CAB will identify a Point of Contact who will be the individual responsible for facilitating the peer assessment  activities and for interacting with the assessment team leader.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  226  The CAB Point of Contact is responsible for:   Coordinating the site visit(s) dates and location(s) with the peer assessment team,   Delivering the CAB materials to the peer assessment team during the Preparation Phase at least 4 weeks before  the audit date,   Coordinating any required auditor(s) visits with the peer assessment team,   Arranging all necessary approvals to allow the peer assessment team to perform the CB and auditor(s) site visits  and to have access to all information required to complete the peer assessment activities,   Coordinating the peer assessment agenda for the CAB, including scheduling certifiers for peer assessment team  interviews and briefings, ensuring the availability of materials to be reviewed during the site visit, etc.,   Providing the peer assessment team with the ability to have copies and printouts made for use during the site visit;   Providing secure storage, if required, for the peer assessment team’s documents (e.g. lunchtime, overnight);   Being generally available to answer questions and resolve issues that may arise during the site visit,   Coordinating the review of the peer assessment report by CAB representatives,   Providing feedback to the peer assessment team leader on the peer assessment draft report.  The CAB must have private room(s) available that is (are) large enough to accommodate the peer assessment team  and CAB personnel during the site visit(s). Such room(s) will serve as the meeting room throughout the site visit.  Accessibility to records and CAB personnel will be needed throughout the site visit in the meeting room.  H.5 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PEER ASSESSMENT TEAM LEADER  One member of the peer assessment team will be designated the team leader. The team leader is responsible for the  following tasks:   Coordinating the receipt of materials from the CAB,   Coordinating the decision regarding the selection of the candidate services (and auditors) and notification to the  peer assessed CAB,   Drafting the site visit(s) agenda and coordinating it with the CB,   Coordinating and completing the peer assessment draft report at the end of the site visit,   Delivering the peer assessment final report to the ECCG, and   If necessary, monitoring the CAB’s resolution of outstanding issues resulting from the peer assessment.  H.6 PREPARATION PHASE  The peer assessment team should begin preparation approximately four weeks before the site visit. The peer  assessed CAB shall provide the peer assessment team with access to all written policies and operating procedure  documents four weeks before the site visit. Electronic and/or hardcopy documentation have to be provided, depending  on the preference of the peer assessment team members and nature of documentation needed. The peer assessment  team should focus their review of the documentation on gaining an understanding of the CAB’s standard operating  procedures.  The peer assessment team leader will coordinate the review of materials during the preparation phase. If there is a  large amount of material to be reviewed, the team may divide it so that members review different portions of the  documentation. The team leader will also draft and finalize the site visit(s) agenda, with input from the team members,  at the conclusion of the preparation phase. The site visit(s) agenda must be forwarded to the peer assessed CAB no  later than one week before the site visit(s). It is recommended that the peer assessment team leader should maintain  close contact with the CAB Point of Contact during the preparation phase to keep the CAB informed of areas that will  require further investigation during the site visit.  Previous peer assessment results with associated results may be proposed by the CAB for consideration by the peer  assessment team.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  227  H.7 SITE VISIT PHASE  H.7.1 Determine that the constitution and procedures of the CB comply with the general  requirements of the EUCC scheme  A checklist shall be used to determine if the processes that the CAB uses to provide its conformity assessment  services are sufficient to ensure effective oversight of evaluations and to ensure that successful certifications comply  with the requirements of the EUCS scheme.  The CAB shall provide any relevant information associated to its accreditation to support this determination.  Where the peer assessment team decides to check some procedures of the CAB, this should occur before the  assessment process commences. Nevertheless, the peer assessment team should check that the CAB is applying its  procedures. This can be done at the site visit (see below) for the particular conformity assessments being assessed.  H.7.2 Perform the peer assessment  The peer assessment team should allocate two (2) full weeks for the site visit(s). If the peer assessment is completed  in a shorter period of time, the team will not need to stay the full two weeks.  The peer assessment team shall have access to all evaluation and certification documentation that was used by the  CAB during its conformity assessment process and especially when reviewing the evaluation documentation, and shall  be permitted to observe all activities carried out during such review. If an evaluation team/certifier meeting occurs  during the site visit, the peer assessment team should observe the meeting.  The peer assessment team should not completely review the work of the auditor, which may be covered by its own  accreditation. However, the peer assessment team should assess whether the deliverables available to the CAB are of  sufficient quality to allow the CAB to determine that the evaluation was conducted in accordance with the appropriate  methodology.  The peer assessment team will make a determination of an auditor’s technical competence by:   a visit of the auditor’s site,   interviews with audit team members on technical items related to the assessment of EUCS requirements.  Findings corresponds either to   nonconformities that are linked to a requirement from the applicable checklist or to common understanding of state  of the art and operative practices that are not met (or not fulfilled). The latter will be discussed with the ECCG and  could, where appropriate, be incorporated as a new item into the lists for use by future peer assessments.   or observations that correspond to improvement proposals made by the peer assessment team, not directly linked  to requirements from the checklist.  A non-conformity could be either critical or non-critical. A critical non-conformity challenges the reliability of the results  established by the assessed CAB. The peer assessment team shall analyse and describe the impact of each critical  non-conformity.  At the end of the site visit, the peer assessment team should present the list of findings (at least the draft list of non-  conformities associated to their criticality level) to the peer assessed CAB, so that the assessed CAB can establish a  proposed action plan to cover the findings. The peer assessment team should provide the final list of nonconformities  (associated to their criticality level) not later than 4 weeks after the site visit to the peer assessed CAB.  If non-conformities have been identified, the CAB may request the support of the peer assessment team for  establishing an action plan associated to a timescale to implement the relevant measures.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  228  H.8 REPORTING  The peer assessment team shall produce a report that summarizes and explains their findings.  The report should be agreed internally within the peer assessment team. If the peer assessment team cannot agree  internally, then majority and minority opinions shall be included in the report.  The CAB’s disagreement on findings can be incorporated to the report, no later than one month after the report has  been established.  The report shall also present the position of the peer assessment team on the relevance of proposed action plan to  cover the findings, if this plan was submitted to the team prior to the delivery of the report to the ECCG. If evidence that  cover critical non conformity is provided before issuance of the report, the team can reconsider the criticality of the  non-conformity and shall document this change in the report.  The assessment team might include into its report relevant outcomes and findings from other peer assessments  reused.  Findings from the peer assessment team included in the report shall be clearly identified, with a unique and  unambiguous identifier.  The final report shall be produced within three months after the site visit and will be reviewed by the peer assessed  CAB prior to distribution to the ECCG.  For preparation of the final report the following steps will be followed:  1. the peer assessment team will prepare a draft report, including all findings, unresolved minor and major non-  conformities detected during the peer assessment in the preparation phase and the site visit phase, and deliver it  for comments to the assessed CAB (one month);  2. the assessed CAB will comment the draft report, highlighting any points of disagreement and proposing changes  to the report (one month);  3. the peer assessment team will consider the comments received by the CB and produce a final report with possible  revisions (one month).  All three documents at points 1-3 will be delivered to the ECCG by the peer assessment team to give evidence of the  final reporting phase of the peer assessment.  If any deviations of relevance for the NAB have been found, the NAB shall be informed.  The report shall provide one of three possible verdicts:  Pass: The CAB has met all requirements and no measure is required.  Pass with controlled (minor) nonconformities: The CAB has not met all requirements, but has provided a relevant  actions plan and an acceptable timescale for correcting the nonconformities identified by the peer assessment team.  There is no remaining critical nonconformity identified in the report.  Fail: The CAB has not met the requirements and has not provided a relevant action plan and an acceptable timescale  for correcting the nonconformities identified by the peer assessment team  The peer assessment team leader (or a suitable representative with full knowledge of the assessment) shall present  the report to the ECCG, including any disagreement within the team of with the peer assessed CAB. He/she shall  present the findings of the team and its appreciation of how the measures proposed by the CAB will solve the issues.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  229  Where relevant, appropriate additions will be made to the assessment checklist to assist future peer assessment  teams.  H.9 ADOPTION OF PEER ASSESSMENT REPORT  The following procedure is provided to guarantee adequate involvement of the assessed CB to demonstrate prompt  resolution of non-conformities. The procedure also helps limiting the time for the adoption of the peer assessment.  1. The ECCG will request the ECCG subgroup dedicated to maintenance of the EUCS scheme to prepare an opinion  to be adopted by the ECCG on the conducted peer assessment.  2. The ECCG subgroup will meet to discuss the result of the peer assessment (based on documents 1-3) and invite for  the meeting the peer assessment team and the assessed CAB. Following the meeting, one of the following proposals  of opinion will be issued by the ECCG subgroup:   the final report from the assessment team is proposed to be adopted as it is;   an amended final report from the assessment team is proposed to be adopted.  In the case of non-conformities, the opinion to be adopted by the ECCG will include a recommendation to the  assessed CAB to resolve such non-conformities with an indication of the duration allocated to this resolution. This  duration should be limited to 2 months in the general case and should not exceed 6 months.  3. the ECCG subgroup will deliver to the ECCG:   the minutes of the meeting;   the proposed opinion to be adopted by the ECCG.  The ECCG subgroup shall ensure that any feedback on non-conformities or recommendations received by the CAB  that underwent the peer assessment or the NAB will be forwarded along to the ECCG.  4. The ECCG will provide its opinion on the draft opinion. In the case of favourable opinion, the assessed CAB will:   either pass the peer assessment (if the draft opinion indicated a positive verdict of the peer assessment). The  positive verdict will be published on ENISA website directly with the accompanying peer assessment findings.   or be recommended to take the necessary actions to resolve the non-conformities in the allocated duration. The  recommendation will not be published on the ENISA website.  The ECCG may also request the ECCG subgroup to re-examine the peer assessment (starting at point 2. again), only  one time.  5. When corrective actions are requested by the ECCG to the CAB, following the implementation of the corrective  actions, the assessed CAB will issue a report to the ECCG subgroup within 2 months  6. The ECCG subgroup will hold a meeting within 2 months with the assessed CAB and the assessment team to  discuss the status of resolution of the non-conformities. The lack of a report from the assessed CAB will not prevent  the ECCG subgroup to have the meeting.  7. The ECCG subgroup will prepare an opinion to be adopted by the ECCG containing either a pass (successful  correction of non-conformities) or a fail (residual non conformities already in place) and will deliver the proposed  opinion and the minutes of the meeting to the ECCG.  8. The ECCG will establish its opinion based on the draft opinion and adopt the final result (including residual  recommendation, or no recommendation for the CAB). The ECCG will adopt the proposed opinion or adopt its own  opinion, without recurring to further iterations with the ECCG subgroup. The opinion adopted by the ECCG will be  published with all relevant documents on the ENISA website.

A SCHEME FOR CLOUD SERVICES  Foreword for Reviewers  This present version of the European Union Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services (EUCS) is a  draft version, to be used as basis for an External Review.  The objective of this review is to validate the principles and general organization of the proposed scheme, and to  gather feedback on the proposed wording of the sections and annexes.  A foreword like this one is included at the beginning of Chapters and Annexes for which a specific comment is  required. In particular, the foreword will mention the level of maturity of the section or annex, and in some cases  issues that remain under discussion.  The terminology is not final only defines essential words, and it is complemented by the terminology defined in  Annex I: (Terminology).  1.1 INTRODUCTION  Following the request from the European Commission in accordance with Article 48.2 of the Cybersecurity Act1  (hereinafter referred to as EUCSA as indicated in the glossary), ENISA has set up an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG)  to support the preparation of a candidate EU cybersecurity certification scheme on cloud services.  Based on the outcomes from this AHWG, launched on March 5th, 2020 and composed of twenty (20) selected  members representing industry (e.g., cloud service providers, cloud service customers, conformity assessment  bodies), as well as around twelve (12) participants from accreditation bodies and EU Member States, regular  exchanges with the ECCG and after an internal review, ENISA has consolidated the following candidate scheme.  The candidate EUCS scheme (European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services), looks into the  certification of the cybersecurity of cloud services. The scheme draws from many different sources, the first one being  the report of the CSP-CERT Working Group, which was delivered in 2019 and provided a basic framework on which  the candidate scheme has been developed.  EUCS supports the three assurance levels in the EUCSA: ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ and ‘high’. The security requirements on  cloud services and on their assessment increase with levels in several dimensions: scope, rigour and depth. The  requirements at level ‘high’ are demanding and close to the state-of-the-art, whereas the requirements at level ‘basic’  define a minimum acceptable baseline for cloud cybersecurity. That baseline is nevertheless comprehensive, as it  covers all major aspects of cloud security. Cloud service providers of any size can use it to demonstrate that they have  set up a framework for guaranteeing some security of their customers. The ‘substantial’ level, in between, will serve to  protect business, and may be the level of choice for many applicants and their users.  The candidate scheme targets a specific category of ICT services, so it is naturally based on the ISO/IEC 17065  standard in terms of applicable requirements to CABs performing certification. There are two main standards suitable  1 REGULATION (EU) 2019/881 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency  for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  (Cybersecurity Act).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  5  for the assessment of the cybersecurity of cloud services, respectively based on the ISO27000 series of standards and  on the International Auditing Standards. The scheme defines an assessment approach that is compatible with both  approaches, allowing cloud service providers to easily integrate the scheme into their current certification and  assurance strategy.  The candidate scheme also defines a simplified assessment methodology for the EUCSA assurance level ‘basic’. The  methodology is based on a self-assessment performed by the cloud service provider, whose results are then audited  by a conformity assessment body. The candidate scheme does not however allow cloud service providers to issue EU  statements of conformity.  The security requirements defined in the scheme draw significantly from the German C5 scheme, but they also draw  some inspiration from the French SecNumCloud scheme, from the proposals in the CSP-CERT report, and from  principles in other schemes used in Europe.  Finally, the EUCS scheme is not a standalone scheme; it is part of the European cybersecurity certification framework.  Although it is very different from the first scheme in the framework, EUCC, which focuses on ICT products, there are  commonalities, for instance around the organization of compliance monitoring and peer assessments. The EUCS  scheme leverages some principles that were first defined in the EUCC scheme, and follows the same general  presentation, with 22 chapters that provide answers to the requirements stated in Article 54.1 of the EUCSA, followed  by annexes that define in greater details the content of the scheme.  Guidance will also be key to support the adoption of the scheme by providing harmonised interpretation or refinement  of requirements established into the candidate EUCS scheme, and the text indicates explicitly where guidance will be  most required.  1.2 GLOSSARY  The first sections outline the most important terminology drawn from existing standards, including ISO/IEC 17788,  ISO/IEC 27000 and ISO/IEC 17000.  1.2.1 From ISO/IEC 17788  We will reuse the following terminology from ISO/IEC 17788:  Term Abbreviations Definition  Application capabilities type  Cloud capabilities type in which the cloud service customer can use the cloud  service provider's applications  Cloud capabilities type  Classification of the functionality provided by a cloud service to the cloud  service customer, based on resources used.  Cloud computing  Paradigm for enabling network access to a scalable and elastic pool of shareable  physical or virtual resources with self-service provisioning and administration on- demand.  Cloud service  One or more capabilities offered via cloud computing invoked using a defined  interface.  Cloud service customer CSC Party which is in a business relationship for the purpose of using cloud services.  Cloud service customer  data  Class of data objects under the control, by legal or other reasons, of the cloud  service customer that were input to the cloud service, or resulted from  exercising the capabilities of the cloud service by or on behalf of the cloud  service customer via the published interface of the cloud service.  NOTE 1 – An example of legal controls is copyright.  NOTE 2 – It may be that the cloud service contains or operates on data that is not  cloud service customer data; this might be data made available by the cloud  service providers, or obtained from another source, or it might be publicly available  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  6  Term Abbreviations Definition  data. However, any output data produced by the actions of the cloud service  customer using the capabilities of the cloud service on this data is likely to be  cloud service customer data, following the general principles of copyright, unless  there are specific provisions in the cloud service agreement to the contrary.  Cloud service derived data  Class of data objects under cloud service provider control that are derived as a  result of interaction with the cloud service by the cloud service customer.  NOTE – Cloud service derived data includes log data containing records of who  used the service, at what times, which functions, types of data involved and so on.  It can also include information about the numbers of authorized users and their  identities. It can also include any configuration or customization data, where the  cloud service has such configuration and customization capabilities.

Cloud capabilities types should be used instead in the scheme. In particular, IaaS, PaaS  and SaaS should not be used.  Cloud service category Cloud service categories are too specific and should not be used in the scheme, except  when used in their specific meaning.  Cloud service partner We have not identified a specific need for using the notion of cloud service partner, so it is  recommended not to use it in the document.

SUBJECT MATTER AND SCOPE  Foreword for Reviewers  Chapters 2 to 23 follow the same structure. Each one of them provides content related to one of the points raised  in Article 54(1). There are 22 such points, numbered (a) to (v), so there are 22 chapters.  Every chapter contains the following sections:   An excerpt from Article 54 defining the topic to be addressed in the chapter.   A proposed text, which is the proposed content for the scheme. This content defines scheme rules and  requirements, and makes extensive use of “shall” to express a requirement, and “may” to express an  option.   A rationale, starting when available by relevant excerpts from the EU Cybersecurity Act, and providing  additional information, reasons for making the choices in the proposed text, and any other additional  information deemed necessary.  When reviewing these chapters, the proposed text is the essential part for the review, but comments are also  welcome on the rationale, in particular to indicate a potential lack of justification of a given point.  As a rule of thumb, the chapters that do not include a dedicated foreword are typically chapters that are (1)  derived from earlier work, typically principles decided early in the spring, or (2) adapted from the EUCC scheme,  with some initial review by a few AHWG members. In other cases, the foreword will provide additional information.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  9  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  i. (a) the subject matter and scope of the certification scheme, including the type or categories of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes covered;  ii. The rest of Article 54 also provides useful information:  iii. 2.  The specified requirements of the European cybersecurity certification scheme shall be consistent with any  applicable legal requirements, in particular requirements emanating from harmonised Union law.  iv. 3.  Where a specific Union legal act so provides, a certificate or an EU statement of conformity issued under a  European cybersecurity certification scheme may be used to demonstrate the presumption of conformity with  requirements of that legal act.  v. 4.  In the absence of harmonised Union law, Member State law may also provide that a European cybersecurity  certification scheme may be used for establishing the presumption of conformity with legal requirements.  🙧  🙥  The European cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services, hereinafter referred to as the EUCS scheme, shall  allow for the cybersecurity certification of cloud services according to the criteria and methods defined in Chapter 8  below (Evaluation Methods and Criteria).  The EUCS scheme may cover any type of ICT service, provided that:   The ICT service implements one or more capabilities offered via cloud computing invoked using a defined  interface [ISO17788].   The ICT service aims at reaching the assurance level corresponding to one of the three levels ‘basic’, ‘substantial’  and ‘high’ of the EUCSA as defined in the EUCS scheme  ICT services matching these criteria will from now be referred to as “cloud services”. The EUCS scheme may apply to  all cloud services, following some principles:   The EUCS scheme distinguishes between different categories of cloud services by relying on the cloud  capabilities types (infrastructure, platform, application);   The EUCS scheme aims at establishing the conformity of cloud services to a set of requirements corresponding to  one of the assurance levels defined in the EUCS scheme;   The EUCS scheme aims at making geographical and legal information about the cloud services available and  understandable to all users of the scheme to allow to use them as needed.   The EUCS scheme acknowledges that the responsibility for the security of a cloud service is split between the  Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and the Cloud Service Customer (CSC), and aims at verifying that this split of  responsibility is explicitly and publicly documented by the CSP.   The EUCS scheme aims at providing sufficient information for making informed security decisions on cloud  services to prospects and customers with adequate cybersecurity knowledge, allowing them to fully understand  and implement the documentation that defines their responsibility.  Finally, in the evaluation of a cloud service, the EUCS scheme shall support and encourage the reuse of conclusions  and evidence from already audited or certified ICT products, ICT processes, and ICT services, in particular those cloud  services that have been certified with the EUCS scheme:   The scheme includes an assessment of the dependencies, in which the assurance information available from  subservice organizations is considered and compared to the requirements of the scheme, in particular regarding  the required level of assurance (see Annex B:, Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services).   When a certified composite cloud service relies on a base cloud service certified with the EUCS scheme, the  EUCS scheme shall aim at verifying that the recommendations defined in the base cloud service are adequately  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  10  applied by the composite cloud service, and included into the recommendations defined for that composite cloud  service (see Section 24.4, Composition).  The EUCS scheme also covers additional elements as foreseen by Article 54 of the CSA, under the conditions defined  by Chapter 24, Additional Topics:   The definition of Security Profiles;   The handling of force majeure cases;   Rules for the protection of information related to cybersecurity certification;  RATIONALE  Additional information  In the request to prepare the scheme, the Commission asks ENISA to “… prepare a candidate European  cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services.” In addition, the request is justified by the need to “stimulate  cloud uptake in Europe” as “cloud computing is an underlying technology for any development in technological  fields.”  🙧  🙥  The core definitions come from ISO/IEC17888. The definition of cloud computing and cloud service as provided in  ISO/IEC17888 suit well the objectives of the EUCS scheme, which aims at being a horizontal scheme for a wide range  of cloud services. The definition of a cloud service is very generic, as long as it is based on cloud computing, which is  defined in ISO/IEC17888 with all the classical properties (scalability, elasticity, shareable resources, self-service and  on-demand).  The notion of capability and capability type is central and also defined in ISO/IEC 17788:  3.2.4 cloud capabilities type: Classification of the functionality provided by a cloud service (3.2.8) to the cloud  service customer (3.2.11), based on resources used.  NOTE – The cloud capabilities types are application capabilities type (3.2.1), infrastructure capabilities type (3.2.25)  and platform capabilities type (3.2.31).  3.2.1 application capabilities type: Cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer (3.2.11)  can use the cloud service provider's (3.2.15) applications.  3.2.25 infrastructure capabilities type: Cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer  (3.2.11) can provision and use processing, storage or networking resources.  3.2.31 platform capabilities type: Cloud capabilities type (3.2.4) in which the cloud service customer (3.2.11) can  deploy, manage and run customer-created or customer-acquired applications using one or more programming  languages and one or more execution environments supported by the cloud service provider (3.2.15).  Capabilities provide a more precise framework than the classical categories (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, XXaaS, etc.), allowing  a cloud service to precisely define the capabilities that it provides to its customers (e.g., a SaaS service may simply  provide application capabilities on top of an already certified infrastructure and platform, or it may provide  infrastructure, platform and application capabilities if the CSP uses a cloud computing system built from the ground up.  There are other ways to categorize cloud services, such as the deployment models. ISO/IEC 17788 defines four  deployment models, depending on the control and sharing of physical or virtual resources: community cloud, private  cloud, public cloud, and hybrid cloud.  For the purpose of the EUCS scheme, we did not identify any specific need to focus on deployment models in addition  to cloud capabilities types to categorize cloud services. Nevertheless, although deployment models are not mentioned  in the scheme, it does not mean that deployment models can be fully ignored in the evaluation of a cloud service, as  the evidence to be provided may differ for some controls or requirements.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  11  About scoping, the most important characteristic of the EUCS scheme is that it is intended to be a horizontal scheme,  applying the same criteria to all cloud services, with three levels of assurance. These criteria apply to the design and  implementation of the cloud service, including its security features and the essential processes used throughout its  lifecycle, in particular for development, deployment and operation.  The EUCS scheme includes a security profile mechanism that allows industries or verticals to define dedicated  requirements, but individual cloud service providers are not allowed to remove from or add to the security requirements  defined in the EUCS scheme.  In addition, the EUCS scheme does not aim at verifying the compliance of a cloud service to any regulation beyond the  EUCSA, and in particular it does not aim at verifying compliance with GDPR2. Such compliance will have to be verified  using a dedicated certification scheme, and results obtained in the EUCS scheme may be reused in such schemes.  Finally, the EUCS scheme is a technical tool designed to provide information to customers and allow them to make  informed decisions. As such, the EUCS scheme does not enforce any restrictions on geographical location of data or  processing, or on applicable laws; however, it requires the CSP to be transparent about this information, and to make it  publicly available and understandable as part of the information provided with the certificate.  The EUCS scheme recognizes that cloud services are based on complex systems, and that many CSPs will use  subservices provided by subservices organizations. Beyond typical security controls on the control and monitoring of  suppliers and service providers, the assessment methods therefore include at all levels an assessment of the  assurance documentation provided by subservice providers with regards to the requirements of the EUCS scheme.  The EUCS scheme also defines requirements for composition. When a cloud service uses a subservice that has been  previously certified in the EUCS scheme, it should be easy to reuse the results from that certification. The  requirements related to composition defined in the EUCS scheme apply to both the base cloud service and to the  dependent cloud service.  Another important aspect of certification is related to the split of responsibility between the CSP and the CSC  (Customer). The fulfilment of the requirements by the CSP’s cloud services is evaluated under the assumption that the  CSC follows the recommendations provided by the CSP in the cloud service’s documentation.  In terms of certification, when a cloud service A relies on another certified cloud service B, it needs to follow the  security recommendations provided by cloud service B, or when necessary, to “forward” the recommendations to its  own end users.  2 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  12  3. PURPOSE OF THE SCHEME  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  vi. Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements  (b) a clear description of the purpose of the scheme and of how the selected standards, evaluation methods  and assurance levels correspond to the needs of the intended users of the scheme;  🙧  🙥  The EUCS scheme aims at improving the Internal Market conditions, and at enhancing the level of security of a wide  range of cloud services, of the cloud capabilities they implement, including application, infrastructure, and platform  capabilities.  The EUCS scheme also covers a wide range of security requirements, by offering all three (3) security assurance  levels defined in the EUCSA (‘basic’, ‘substantial’ and ‘high’).  Users of the scheme may be:   cloud service providers (CSPs) who wish to assess the security of their cloud services through third-party  certification;   cloud service customers (CSCs) who wish to benefit from the evidence provided with certified cloud services to  make informed decisions related to the security of these cloud services;   regulatory authorities who wish to include security and assurance requirements on cloud services within their  regulations and directives.  These users may use the EUCS scheme:   to assess how a cloud service, as described by the CSP, meets the requirements of a predefined set of security  control objectives and a related set of measures, when used according to security recommendations provided by  the CSP;   to provide CSCs the information required to make informed choices about the procurement and operation of cloud  services, and to allow CSCs to use certified cloud services in their own development activities, and to meet their  own security compliance requirements;   to allow regulatory authorities to refer to the scheme in European and national regulations, including criteria based  on information defined in the scheme, and to check compliance by verifying the information provided in the  certificates stored in the site managed by ENISA.  The EUCS scheme defines rules and mechanisms that may be combined to allow users to reach these objectives:   three (3) assurance levels (see Chapter 5, Assurance Levels) corresponding to levels ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ and  ‘high’ defined in the EUCSA, which can cover cloud services corresponding to a wide range of risk profiles;   a set of security objectives and requirements (see Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria), defining objectives  to be met by CSPs for all certified cloud services, further decomposed into requirements mapped to the assurance  levels referred to above;   an assessment meta-approach (see Annex B:, Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services) defining how  to use various assessment methods to determine that a cloud service fulfils the requirements assigned to a given  assurance level;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  13   two assessment methods (see Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria, Annex C:, Assessment for levels  Substantial and High and Annex D:, Assessment for level Basic) defining how to determine that a cloud service  fulfils a given set of requirements;   a set of document templates to be used during the evaluation and review activities ( Annex F:, Scheme Document  Content requirements) to ensure that the documents released by the CAB and its subcontractors follow the same  organization and flow;   a detailed list of the documents to be made publicly available as part of the certificate package, that may allow  scheme users to locate the information they are looking for to make informed decisions;   a set of rules about the lifecycle of certificates after their issuance, including maintenance and renewal  requirements, management of vulnerabilities and complaints, and market surveillance activities, that may allow  scheme users to remain informed of the evolution of the security of a given cloud service.  In addition to these technical features, all stakeholders interested in the cybersecurity certification of cloud services will  benefit from the following characteristics from the EUCS scheme:   a scheme harmonized at the European level;   strong quality guarantees through the use of third-party assessment by accredited bodies, supervision by national  authorities, and for the High level, authorization by the national authorities and peer assessment between  conformity assessment bodies;   the flexibility offered by three different assurance levels covering the entire range of assurance introduced in the  EUCSA, with the possibility for a certified cloud service to upgrade to a higher level in future evaluation cycles;   strong transparency guarantees, with security information made publicly available through a centralized web site;   assurance maintained over time, with regular reassessments, operating effectiveness guarantees at the levels  Substantial and High;   a maintenance framework for the EUCS scheme itself, endorsed by European institutions and Member states,  providing strong guarantees on continued operation of the scheme;   integration in the European cybersecurity certification framework, which will facilitate the reuse of EUCS-certified  cloud services in vertical schemes.  The mechanisms defined above provide the means allowing the scheme’s intended users to meet their objectives, by  providing the conditions required for performing evaluations, issuing and managing certificates, and maintaining the  framework and scheme over time.  RATIONALE  Additional input  vii. Recital 74 (excerpt). The purpose of European cybersecurity certification schemes should be to ensure that ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes certified under such schemes comply with specified requirements that  aim to protect the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or  of the related functions of or services offered by, or accessible via those products, services and processes  throughout their life cycle.  Recital 92 (excerpt). European cybersecurity certificates and EU statements of conformity should help end users  to make informed choices. Therefore, ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that have been certified or  for which an EU statement of conformity has been issued should be accompanied by structured information that  is adapted to the expected technical level of the intended end user.  🙧  🙥  The scheme’s intended users cover all relevant stakeholders in the life cycle of the certificate (production and  consumption) and, due to the nature of the scheme, all relevant stakeholders in the life-cycle of the cloud service.  Table 1 and Table 2, below, describe the intended users as stakeholders of the certificate, their role and their use case  related to the scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  14  Table 1: Stakeholders involved in the production of certificates  Stakeholder Role Use case  Cloud Service  Provider  Development The Development role covers the activities related to the development of the cloud  service, including architecture design, hardware and software development, and  service design. It also includes processes, in particular the development process.  Cloud Service  Provider  Operations The Operations role covers the activities related to the operation of the cloud service,  including procurement, provisioning, update, and other processes. Some processes  may be shared with Development, like DevOps (when Development and Operations  personnel may be combined in the implementation of shared processes).  Cloud Service  Provider  Compliance  The Compliance role covers the activities related to the verification of compliance to  standards and regulations, including documentation, self-assessment, interfaces with  CABs, and management of EU statements of conformity.  CAB Evaluation The Evaluation role for CABs includes all the activities related to the assessment of  cloud services and related processes.  CAB Review and  Certification  The Review and Certification role for CABs includes all the activities related to the  issuance and management of certificates, including in particular the review of the  evaluation and of its results.  NCCA As a CAB For level ‘high’, the NCCA is involved and may perform the tasks of a CAB. This would  include at least the Review and Certification role, and it may also include the  Evaluation role.  NCCA Compliance  monitoring  NCCAs have a Compliance Monitoring role, to ensure that certified cloud services  remain compliant to the requirements of the scheme.  NAB CAB Accreditation NABs are not directly involved in the production of certificates, but their role in the  accreditation of CABs is essential in the proper operation of the scheme  ENISA Publicity ENISA is in charge of publicizing the certificates issued in the context of the scheme,  as well as the events associated with these certificates.  Table 2: Stakeholders consuming certificates  Stakeholder Role Use case  Cloud Service  Customer  Procurement The Procurement role covers the activities related to the selection of a cloud service,  and in particular the definition of the criteria and the assessment of the candidates,  leading to the selection.  Cloud Service  Customer  Customer  Development  The Customer Development role covers the activities related to the development of  new products or services on the basis of the certified cloud service, possibly including  other cloud services. Developers will in particular rely on the recommendations  provided with the certified cloud service.  Cloud Service  Customer  Customer  Operations  The Customer Operations role covers the activities related to the operation of the  certified cloud service by the CSC within its own organization, possibly through  another cloud service. The tasks involved depend on the cloud capabilities type, and  may include configuration, deployment, and maintenance tasks, following the  guidance provided with the certified cloud service.  Cloud Service  Customer  Customer  compliance  The Customer Compliance role covers the activities related to the verification of  compliance of the CSC’s own products or services, possibly includes other cloud  services. In that context, the main aspects are the use of the evaluation performed on  the cloud service and the reuse of evidence or conclusions generated during the cloud  service evaluation.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  15  Stakeholder Role Use case  Cloud Service User User The Cloud Service User is not expected here to be a primary user of the scheme, but  they should be targeted as secondary users through Cloud Service Customers. Users  are nevertheless directly targeted by some of the documentation provided by the CSP  and evaluated in the context of the scheme, and their profile should be considered  when developing and auditing user documentation.  Regulatory  authority  Regulation The Regulation role includes the development of rules and regulations to be applied at  a local, regional, national or European level. Regulators may use the scheme as a  basis for including high-level requirements (mandatory certification) or more detailed  requirements, for instance building on transparency requirements.  Regulatory  authority  Enforcement The Enforcement role includes all activities related to the enforcement of regulations  that mention the scheme. Enforcers will in particular need to verify that cloud service  providers comply with the parts of the regulation that depend on the scheme.  Out of the stakeholders using the scheme, we can distinguish between primary users, including CSPs, CSCs and  Regulatory Authorities, and secondary users, including CABs, NCCAs and Cloud Service Users. Among the secondary  users, CABs and NCCAs are mentioned because they control the issuance of the certificates and NABs and ENISA  are mentioned because they are directly involved in the operation of the scheme.  Cloud Service Users (the actual persons or machines using the certified cloud services) are not considered as primary  users for two distinct reasons:   Employees of a CSC are considered secondary users. The CSC as primary users select the cloud service and will  provide its internal users with the recommendations provided by the CSP to securely use their services.   Final customers are not considered as direct users of the scheme, because one of the prerequisites for being a  user of the scheme is the ability to understand the information made available to CSCs, which requires some  knowledge in cybersecurity that cannot be assumed from a final customer.  The intended users whose needs the scheme shall satisfy are the CSPs and the CSCs, as well as the Regulatory  Authorities. Satisfying these needs is indeed the purpose of the scheme, with one distinct objective for each category  of users:   For CSPs. The scheme shall assess how a cloud service, as described by the CSP, meets the requirements of a  predefined set of security control objectives and a related set of measures, when used according to security  recommendations provided by the CSP.   For CSCs. The scheme shall provide CSCs the information required to make informed choices about the  procurement and operation of cloud services, and shall allow CSCs to use certified cloud services in their own  development activities, and to meet their own security compliance requirements.   For Regulatory Authorities. The scheme shall allow Regulatory Authorities to refer to the scheme in European and  national regulations, including criteria based on information defined in the scheme, and it shall allow them to  enforce regulations by verifying the information provided in the certificates stored in the site managed by ENISA  For CSPs, the scheme offers:   a single certification scheme recognized across the entire European Union;   three assurance levels corresponding to different needs from the CSPs and different use cases;   two assessment methodologies tailored to the assurance levels, designed to simplify their integration with other  established methodologies such as [ISO17021] or [ISAE3402];   a set of objectives and requirements inspired from existing schemes and mapped to the assurance levels;   the possibility to use composition to simplify the certification of cloud services that rely on other already certified  cloud services; and   a certificate that can be used to demonstrate that their cloud service fulfils the requirements of the scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  16  For CSCs, the scheme offers:   a single certification scheme recognized the entire European Union;   three assurance levels corresponding to different needs from the CSCs and different use cases;   requirements mandating transparency about the split responsibility between the CSP and the CSC regarding  security;   requirements mandating transparency about the location of the processing and storage of data, and about the  applicable laws; and   the possibility to use composition to certify their own cloud service when needed.  For Regulatory Authorities, the scheme offers:   a single certification scheme recognized the entire European Union;   three assurance levels corresponding to different needs from the CSCs and different use cases; and   requirements mandating transparency about the location of the processing and storage of data, and about the  applicable laws.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  17  4. USE OF STANDARDS  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  viii. Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following element  c) references to the international, European or national standards applied in the evaluation or, where such  standards are not available or appropriate, to technical specifications that meet the requirements set out in  Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 or, if such specifications are not available, to technical specifications  or other cybersecurity requirements defined in the European cybersecurity certification scheme;  🙧  🙥  The scheme relies on a number of standards and technical specifications:   International standards ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17000, and to a lesser extent ISO/IEC 9000 and ISO/IEC  27000, are being used as references for the terminology used through the scheme, with input from all the  schemes listed below when required.   The security controls used in the scheme, together with the associated security requirements, are defined in an  Annex of the present scheme (see Annex A:. Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), and they  are based on international standards ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, ISO/IEC 27017, and on documents  previously issued by Member States to define the security controls in their respective National Schemes [C5,  SecNumCloud].   The definition of the assurance levels reuses some concepts defined in the ISO/IEC 15408-3 standard.   The conformity assessment methodology defined in the scheme is based on the ISO/IEC 17065 international  standard.  The scheme also leverages several security assessment methods and standards:   International standards ISO/IEC 17021 and ISO/IEC 27006.   International auditing standards ISAE3402 and ISAE3000.   One method defined in an Annex to the present scheme (see Annex D:, Assessment for level Basic).  The security controls and other annexes also reference a number of standards:   The ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111 standards are referenced about vulnerability handling   The ISO/IEC27005 standard is referenced about risk management  RATIONALE  ix. Additional input  This is reinforced in the request for the candidate scheme, which indicates that “the candidate scheme (…)  should take into account existing and relevant schemes and standards.”  The text mentions regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, it defines the following requirements (this is an outline, further  details are available in the regulation itself:  1. Market acceptance, as demonstrated by the existence of compliant implementations from different vendors  2. No conflict with current or foreseen European standard  3. Developed by a non-profit making organization which fulfils some criteria  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  18  a) Openness of the specification development process  b) Consensus-based decision-making process  c) Transparency of the development process  4. Requirements on the specification itself  a) Sustained maintenance for a long period  b) Publicly available for implementation and use on reasonable terms  c) IP rights essential to the specification are available on a (F)RAND basis  d) Relevant and effective, responding to market needs and regulatory requirements  e) Neutral and stable  f) Sufficient quality and level of details, with standardized interfaces available as needed  These requirements are classical, and they are based on the WTO rules, so they are in practice met by many of  the technical specifications developed by all kinds of industry groups.  Regarding the elements included in the scheme itself, the following guidance has been provided to the SOGIS  ad hoc working group:   The elements that are mandatory for the implementation of the scheme must be included as  appendices to the scheme, and they will be included in the regulation.   The elements that are optional in the implementation of the scheme may be included in other  documents, provided by ENISA on the certification framework portal.  🙧  🙥  The standards that are referenced are very classical in the IT security field.  However, in some cases, it has not been possible to rely solely on European and international standards.  For the security controls, the ISO/IEC 27000 series provides a very good basis, but it did not provide the level of details  deemed suitable for the present scheme. The structure of the controls is strongly inspired from these standards, but  the content has been enriched, in particular by introducing more detailed requirements that have been mapped to  assurance levels. These requirements have been designed by drawing inspiration from current practices in Europe,  and in particular from the documents issued by Member States who operated National Schemes for cloud services.  For the assessment methods, the scheme recognizes the two most widely used assessment method families (based  on the ISO/IEC 17000 family and on the ISAE3000 family), but there has been a need to add a specific and simplified  assessment method for the ‘basic’ level, which is defined in the scheme itself.  Both documents have been written in a way that could allow them to be considered as a basis for the establishment of  new standards.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  19  5. ASSURANCE LEVELS  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (d) where applicable, one or more assurance levels;  🙧  🙥  The scheme defines three assurance levels, with assurance level Basic corresponding to the ‘basic’ assurance level of  the EUCSA, assurance level Substantial corresponding to the ‘substantial’ assurance level of the EUCSA, and  assurance level High corresponding to the ‘high’ assurance level of the EUCSA.  As specified in the EUCSA’s Article 52(5), assurance level Basic is “intended to minimise the known basic risks of  incidents and cyberattacks” and can be further defined as follows:   Assurance level Basic should provide limited assurance that the cloud service is built and operated with  procedures and mechanisms to meet the corresponding security requirements at a level intended to minimize the  known basic risks of incidents and cyberattacks.   Assurance level Basic should be suitable for cloud services that are designed to meet typical security  requirements on services for non-critical data and systems.   The typical attacker profile for assurance level Basic should be a single person with limited skills repeating a  known attack with limited resources, not including the ability to perform social engineering attacks.   The evaluation scope for assurance level Basic shall be defined by the description of the cloud service and by the  security objectives and requirements pertaining to assurance level Basic, as defined in Annex A: (Security  Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), including processes and the software (understood as result of a  development process) underlying the service.   The evaluation depth for assurance level Basic shall consist solely of inspection activities, based on a check for  completeness and coherence of the provided documentation on processes and design intended to confirm the  fulfilment of technical and organizational measures, including requirements for fully automated testing of basic  known vulnerabilities and automated compliance checks by the CSP.  A report following defined procedures shall be generated by the CAB.  Self-gathered evidence shall be regularly submitted to the CAB to justify the continued development and operation  of the service.   The evaluation depth for assurance level Basic shall be driven by a predefined audit plan.  As specified in the EUCSA’s Article 52(6), assurance level Substantial is “intended to minimise the known  cybersecurity risks, and the risk of incidents and cyberattacks carried out by actors with limited skills and resources”  and can be further defined as follows:   Assurance level Substantial should provide reasonable assurance through evaluation by a CAB that the cloud  service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to minimise known cybersecurity risks, and the risk  of incidents and cyberattacks carried out by actors with limited skills and resources. The CAB shall determine that  the cloud service provider has assessed those risks and implemented suitable controls that, if operating  effectively, minimize those risks and meet the corresponding security requirements throughout a specified period.   Assurance level Substantial should be suitable for cloud services that are designed to meet typical security  requirements on services for business-critical data and systems.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  20   The typical attacker profile for assurance level Substantial should be a small team of persons with hacking abilities  and access to a wide range of known hacking techniques, including social engineering, but with limited resources,  in particular to launch wide attacks or to discover previously unknown vulnerabilities.   The evaluation scope for assurance level Substantial shall be defined by the description of the cloud service and  by the security objectives and requirements pertaining to assurance level Substantial, as defined in Annex A:  (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), including processes and the software (understood as  result of a development process) underlying the service. The effective operation of the relevant security controls  shall also be demonstrated throughout a specified period.   The evaluation scope for assurance level Substantial shall include, in addition to the requirements for assurance  level Basic, on-site audit including interviews and inspecting samples, plus a verification that the implementation  follows the specified processes and design, including the validation of the functional tests performed on that  implementation.  The security controls for assurance level Substantial shall include a limited pen testing using known attacks.  As specified in the EUCSA’s Article 52(7), assurance level High is “intended to minimise the risk of state-of-the-art  cyberattacks carried out by actors with significant skills and resources” and can be further defined as follows:   Assurance level High should provide reasonable assurance through evaluation by a CAB that the cloud service is  built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to minimise the risk of state-of- the-art cyberattacks carried  out by actors with significant skills and resources. The CAB shall determine that the cloud service provider has  assessed those risks and implemented suitable controls that operated effectively to minimize those risks and meet  the corresponding security requirements throughout a specified period.   Dedicated requirements are defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services) to  ensure that controls shall be automatically monitored for continuous operation in accordance with their design, and  that the controls shall be regularly reviewed and pen tested to validate their actual ability to prevent or detect  security breaches.   Assurance level High should be suitable for cloud services that are designed to meet specific (exceeding level  ‘substantial’) security requirements for mission-critical data and systems.   The typical attacker profile for assurance level High should be a team of highly skilled persons with access to  significant resources to design and perform attacks, get insider access, discover or buy access to previously  unknown vulnerabilities.   The evaluation scope for assurance level High shall be defined by the description of the cloud service and by the  security objectives and requirements pertaining to assurance level High, as defined in Annex A: (Security  Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), including processes and the software (understood as result of a  development process) underlying the service. The effective operation of the relevant security controls shall also be  demonstrated throughout a specified period.   The evaluation depth for assurance level High shall be based on the depth for assurance level Substantial, to  which requirements on depth of inspection or testing shall be added to verify that the controls implemented by the  CSP actually meet their objective.  In particular, these requirements concern the automated monitoring of controls and the review and penetration  testing of security controls. Such activities shall be planned over multiple years, and they shall be performed by  personnel with appropriate competences, in particular when penetration testing or in-depth technical reviews are  required.   The evaluation depth for assurance level High shall be driven by a full justification of the coverage for all  mappings, including for processes.  It may also include higher expectations for some processes and their implementation, as defined in the security  controls pertaining to assurance level High.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  21  RATIONALE  Additional input  Article 52 provides details about the assurance levels, and in particular:  1.  A European cybersecurity certification scheme may specify one or more of the following assurance levels for  ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes: ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ or ‘high’. The assurance level shall be  commensurate with the level of the risk associated with the intended use of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT  process, in terms of the probability and impact of an incident.  3.  The security requirements corresponding to each assurance level shall be provided in the relevant European  cybersecurity certification scheme, including the corresponding security functionalities and the corresponding  rigour and depth of the evaluation that the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process is to undergo.  5.  A European cybersecurity certificate or EU statement of conformity that refers to assurance level ‘basic’ shall  provide assurance that the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes for which that certificate or that EU  statement of conformity is issued meet the corresponding security requirements, including security  functionalities, and that they have been evaluated at a level intended to minimise the known basic risks of  incidents and cyberattacks. The evaluation activities to be undertaken shall include at least a review of technical  documentation. Where such a review is not appropriate, substitute evaluation activities with equivalent effect  shall be undertaken.  6.  A European cybersecurity certificate that refers to assurance level ‘substantial’ shall provide assurance that  the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes for which that certificate is issued meet the corresponding  security requirements, including security functionalities, and that they have been evaluated at a level intended to  minimise the known cybersecurity risks, and the risk of incidents and cyberattacks carried out by actors with  limited skills and resources. The evaluation activities to be undertaken shall include at least the following: a  review to demonstrate the absence of publicly known vulnerabilities and testing to demonstrate that the ICT  products, ICT services or ICT processes correctly implement the necessary security functionalities. Where any  such evaluation activities are not appropriate, substitute evaluation activities with equivalent effect shall be  undertaken.  7.  A European cybersecurity certificate that refers to assurance level ‘high’ shall provide assurance that the ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes for which that certificate is issued meet the corresponding security  requirements, including security functionalities, and that they have been evaluated at a level intended to  minimise the risk of state-of-the-art cyberattacks carried out by actors with significant skills and resources. The  evaluation activities to be undertaken shall include at least the following: a review to demonstrate the absence of  publicly known vulnerabilities; testing to demonstrate that the ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes  correctly implement the necessary security functionalities at the state of the art; and an assessment of their  resistance to skilled attackers, using penetration testing. Where any such evaluation activities are not  appropriate, substitute activities with equivalent effect shall be undertaken.  Recitals also provide additional information about assurance levels  (65) The assurance level of a European certification scheme is a basis for confidence that an ICT product,  ICT service or ICT process meets the security requirements of a specific European cybersecurity certification  scheme. In order to ensure the consistency of the European cybersecurity certification framework, a European  cybersecurity certification scheme should be able to specify assurance levels for European cybersecurity  certificates and EU statements of conformity issued under that scheme. Each European cybersecurity certificate  might refer to one of the assurance levels: ‘basic’, ‘substantial’ or ‘high’, while the EU statement of conformity  might only refer to the assurance level ‘basic’. The assurance levels would provide the corresponding rigour and  depth of the evaluation of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process and would be characterised by reference  to technical specifications, standards and procedures related thereto, including technical controls, the purpose of  which is to mitigate or prevent incidents. Each assurance level should be consistent among the different  sectorial domains where certification is applied.  (66) A European cybersecurity certification scheme might specify several evaluation levels depending on the  rigour and depth of the evaluation methodology used. Evaluation levels should correspond to one of the  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  22  assurance levels and should be associated with an appropriate combination of assurance components. For all  assurance levels, the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process should contain a number of secure functions, as  specified by the scheme, which may include: a secure out-of-the-box configuration, a signed code, secure  update and exploit mitigations and full stack or heap memory protections. Those functions should have been  developed, and be maintained, using security-focused development approaches and associated tools to ensure  that effective software and hardware mechanisms are reliably incorporated.  (67) For assurance level ‘basic’, the evaluation should be guided at least by the following assurance  components: the evaluation should at least include a review of the technical documentation of the ICT product,  ICT service or ICT process by the conformity assessment body. Where the certification includes ICT processes,  the process used to design, develop and maintain an ICT product or ICT service should also be subject to the  technical review. Where a European cybersecurity certification scheme provides for a conformity self-  assessment, it should be sufficient that the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes has carried out a self-assessment of the compliance of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process  with the certification scheme.  (68) For assurance level ‘substantial’, the evaluation, in addition to the requirements for assurance level  ‘basic’, should be guided at least by the verification of the compliance of the security functionalities of the ICT  product, ICT service or ICT process with its technical documentation.  (69) For assurance level ‘high’, the evaluation, in addition to the requirements for assurance level  ‘substantial’, should be guided at least by an efficiency testing which assesses the resistance of the security  functionalities of ICT product, ICT service or ICT process against elaborate cyberattacks performed by persons  who have significant skills and resources.  🙧  🙥  High-level presentation  All Assurance level defined in the EUCS scheme satisfy all requirements that are applicable to all EUCSA assurance  levels:   Every assurance level is commensurate with the level of risk associated to the intended use of the cloud service,  as demonstrated in the definition of suitable services and typical attacker profiles (Article 52(1)).   Every assurance level defines security requirements and functionalities, as well as the rigour and depth required in  the evaluation (Article 52(3)).   Every assurance level requires that evaluation activities include a review of technical documentation (Article 52(5),  Recital 67).   Every assurance level requires a review of the cloud service’s main processes, including the development process  used for the development of the cloud service (Recital 67).  Those are the only requirements defined for assurance level ‘basic’ in the EUCSA, which are all satisfied by assurance  level Basic.  In addition, assurance level Substantial satisfies the requirements pertaining to the EUCSA’s assurance level  ‘substantial’:   Assurance level Substantial security controls include a vulnerability assessment activity that perform a review of  publicly known vulnerabilities (Article 52(6)).   Assurance level Substantial security controls include a review of the functional tests of the cloud service’s security  functionalities as well as some independent testing requirements (Article 52(6)),   The assessment methodology for assurance level Substantial mandates the review of a mapping between the  documentation of security functionalities and their implementation to ensure compliance (Recital 68).  Finally, assurance level High satisfies the requirements pertaining to the EUCSA’s assurance level ‘high’:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  23   Assurance level High security controls include a vulnerability assessment activity that perform a review of publicly  known vulnerabilities (Article 52(7)).   Assurance level High security controls include a review of the functional tests of the cloud service’s security  functionalities, as well as automated monitoring requirements, (Article 52(7)),   Assurance level High security controls require the use of state-of-the-art security functionalities (Article 52(7)).   The assessment methodology for assurance level High mandates the review of a full mapping between the  documentation of security functionalities and their implementation to ensure compliance (Recital 68).   The assessment methodology for assurance level High mandates both design efficiency and operating efficiency  to be assessed during the evaluation (Recital 69). This assessment includes penetration testing to assess the  resistance of security functionalities of the cloud services (Article 52(7), Recital 69).  Note that, throughout this document, references to the assurance levels defined in the EUCSA use lowercase and  quotes (‘basic’, ‘substantial’, ‘high’), whereas the assurance levels defined in EUCS are capitalized (Basic, Substantial,  High). The names assigned to assurance levels in EUCS may be later modified.  DETAILED PRESENTATION  This presentation is the full output of the thematic group on assurance levels, which provides a full background  PARAMETERS  Intention  The intention provides a general description of the Assurance Level, most likely matching quite closely the definition  from the EU CSA.  Suitability  Suitability is about potential restrictions of the types and categories that may be covered.  Attacker profile  The attacker profile cannot be very specific, because of the great variety of attackers, and it always defines a wide  category of attackers. Typical expected results are as follows:   The least sophisticated attackers in the range should be stopped, regardless of their motivation.   The most sophisticated attackers in the range should be deterred to attack that particular service. This means that,  if they have a specific reason to attack that particular service, they may succeed with difficulties, but if they are  looking for generic revenue, the difficulty should encourage them to move to the next target.  Note that this applies as well to the ‘high’ level. Security certification cannot provide guarantees against a motivated  nation-state determined to attack a specific site but may discourage them if they are “harvesting” information.  Scope of the Evaluation  In ISO/IEC 15408-3, scope is defined as “the effort is greater because a larger portion of the IT product is included”.  This is about gradually adding elements to be evaluated. The scope of the evaluation should comprise the service  provided by the CSP and clearly identify all underlying and supporting services and processes.  Depth  In ISO/IEC 15408-3, depth is defined as “the effort is greater because it is deployed to a finer level of design and  implementation detail”. This is about considering more and more details and asking more precise questions. The  general principle is to follow an incremental approach, i.e., that all requirements of a lower level are similarly included  in the depth of the higher level.  Rigour  In ISO/IEC 15408-3, a more rigorous assessment is defined as “the effort is greater because it is applied in a more  structured, formal manner”. This is about requiring more structure in the service (for instance, a security model based  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  24  on a specific formalism/method) or adding more structure to the assessment (for instance, requiring a specific method  to collect evidence or provide results).  APPLICATION TO ASSURANCE LEVELS  Level Basic Substantial High  Intention Provide limited assurance  through a review by an  independent third party that the  cloud service is built and  operated with procedures and  mechanisms to meet the  corresponding security  requirements at a level intended  to minimize the known basic  risks of incidents and  cyberattacks.  Provide reasonable assurance  through evaluation by an  independent third party that the  cloud service is built and  operated with procedures and  mechanisms to minimise known  cybersecurity risks, and the risk  of incidents and cyberattacks  carried out by actors with limited  skills and resources. The CSP  has assessed those risks and  implemented suitable controls  that, if operating effectively,  minimize those risks and meet  the corresponding security  requirements throughout a  specified period.  Provide reasonable assurance  through evaluation by an  independent auditor that the cloud  service is built and operated with  procedures and mechanisms to  minimise the risk of state-of- the- art cyberattacks carried out by  actors with significant skills and  resources. The CSP has assessed  those risks and implemented  suitable controls that operated  effectively to minimize those risks  and meet the corresponding  security requirements throughout a  specified period. Security controls  are monitored for continuous  operation in accordance with their  design; they are reviewed and pen  tested to validate their actual ability  to prevent or detect security  breaches.  Intention  rationale  Scope, depth and rigour of the  assurance level is limited to  procedures and mechanisms for  those security requirements that  shall minimize basis risks only.  Scope, depth and rigour of this  assurance level requires the  cloud service provider to apply a  risk-based approach for the  suitable design and  implementation of controls that  meet the corresponding security  requirements. The systematic  risk assessment approach and  the operating effectiveness  (consistent application) of  controls throughout a specified  period is evaluated by an  independent auditor, including  for the initial conformity  assessment.  Scope, depth and rigour of this  assurance level extend the  previous level for Substantial by  additional procedures to be  performed for automated controls.  Automated monitoring is applied  by the CSP to identify exceptions  in the application of controls (e.g.  changes to the configuration) and  initiate corrective actions. Reviews  and pen tests are performed by the  independent auditor or a third party  engaged by the CSP with the  objective to identify vulnerabilities  that allow to circumvent, override  or breach controls.  Suitability The Basic level is suitable for  cloud services that are  designed to meet typical  security requirements on  services for non-critical data  and systems.  The Substantial level is suitable  for cloud services that are  designed to meet typical security  requirements on services for  business-critical data and  systems.  The High level is suitable for cloud  services that are designed to meet  specific (exceeding level  ‘substantial’) security requirements  for mission critical data and  systems.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  25  Level Basic Substantial High  Suitability  rationale  The ‘Basic level provides limited  assurance that baseline  procedures and mechanisms  are in place to address security  risks and threats in potentially  low impact information systems  (e.g.: Web site hosting public  information). It is typically not  suited for Platform or  Infrastructure capabilities, used  by a large number of services.  built on top and that require an  elevated level of security. The  Basic level demonstrates a  willingness to address security,  including the application of  security guidance from  subservice providers.  The Substantial level provides  reasonable assurance that a set  of more stringent (than in level  Basic) security controls is  designed and operated to  address security risks and  threats in potentially moderate  impact information systems to  protect business critical  information (e.g.: Confidential  business data, email, CRM –  customer relation management  systems, personal information).  It is suitable for all capabilities  types. . The Substantial level  demonstrates a robust and  mature holistic security  management to provide secure  services.  The High level provides  reasonable assurance that a set of  even more stringent security  controls is designed and operated  to address security risks and  threats in potentially high impact  information systems to protect  mission critical information (e.g.  highly confidential business data,  patents).  The costly and rigorous evaluation  process reflects the intention to  minimize the risks in using the  cloud service.  Attacker profile Single person with limited skills  repeating a known attack with  limited resources, not including  the ability to perform social  engineering attacks.  Small team of persons with  hacking abilities and access to a  wide range of known hacking  techniques, including social  engineering, but with limited  resources, in particular to launch  wide attacks or to discover  previously unknown  vulnerabilities.  Team of highly skilled persons with  access to significant resources to  design and perform attacks, get  insider attacks, discover or buy  access to previously unknown  vulnerabilities.  Attacker profile  rationale  Today, Basic is about removing  low-lying fruits and ensuring  that cloud services, including  simple ones, are designed with  security in mind. The objective  is to remove the possibility to  fall victim to trivial attacks.  When such certification  becomes mainstream, the  requirements should be revised  upwards.  This is the “standard” attacker,  corresponding to most real-life  attacks used to disclose  information, steal resources,  deny service, or tamper with a  service.  Their main characteristics come  from the definition of the level:  “known attacks” and “limited  resources”. Note that this  definition is quite ambitious and  allows the use of attacks that  leverage several vulnerabilities.  This is the sophisticated attacker,  against which detection and  mitigation is more efficient than  resistance. At this level, it may be  difficult to define precisely a way to  analyse that the objective has  been met, in particular because  there is an expectation to minimize  risks through various mitigation  methods.  Scope As defined by the service  description and the controls  pertaining to the Basic level,  including processes and the  software (understood as result  of a development process)  underlying the service.  .  As defined by the service  description and the controls  pertaining to the Substantial  level, including processes and  the software (understood as  result of a development process)  underlying the service.  Operating effectiveness of the  controls shall be demonstrated.  As defined by the service  description and the controls  pertaining to the High level,  including processes and the  software (understood as result of a  development process) underlying  the service.  Operating effectiveness of the  controls shall be demonstrated.  (including automated monitoring if  required by the control definition).  Scope rationale This may need to be rephrased,  depending on the relationship  between “controls” and  “requirements”.  Here, the idea would be to  include all controls in their  general form, but without the  more detailed requirements that  may be added for higher levels.  We refer to the same controls  from the Basic assurance level,  but with the stronger refinements  or enhancements (e.g.,  (mandated techniques,  thresholds, etc.).  Requirements must include a  limited pen testing using known  attacks.  We refer to the same controls from  the Substantial assurance level,  but with the higher refinements or  enhancements.  Enhancements often included  additional constraints, references  to state-of-the-art requirements,  and automated monitoring of some  controls.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  26  Level Basic Substantial High  Depth Inspection solely, based on a  check for completeness and  coherence of the provided  documentation on processes  and design intended to confirm  the fulfilment of technical and  organizational measures, and  interactions between the auditor  and the CSP at the beginning  and at the conclusion of the  inspection.  A report following defined  procedures is generated by the  inspection body.  Once a year, a documentation  update is provided for third- party review of the continued  development and operation of  the service.  Additional to the requirements of  Basic: On-site audit including  interviews and inspecting  samples, plus a verification that  the implementation follows the  specified policies and  procedures, and an additional  focus on development activities,  for instance on the functional  tests performed.  On the initial assessment and  once a year, the operating  effectiveness of the security  controls, i.e. their operation as  designed, needs to be  demonstrated over the previous  period.  Additional to the requirements of  Substantial: Specific requirements  on the monitoring and testing of  the controls, i.e. their operation as  intended to protect from attacks or  detect them, needs to be  demonstrated.  Different measures may be used,  such as technical reviews, and  penetration testing shall be  performed by qualified personnel,  following a multi-year plan that  needs to be validated in the audit.  Depth rationale The inspection focuses on  completeness, coherence and  plausibility of the  documentation. It needs to be  an efficient process that mostly  focuses on the existence of  processes, and of a secure by  design approach, to  demonstrate the proper design  and existence of security  measures to protect the cloud  service.  The full audit aims at providing  reasonable assurance that the  security controls are properly  designed and operate  effectively, I,e, as designed, over  a period of time.  The audit aims at providing the  same reasonable assurance as for  the Substantial level.  The main addition in depth come  from additional requirements for  level High, such as automated  monitoring and penetration testing,  which are intended to demonstrate  that the controls remain effective  under strenuous conditions.  Rigour The assessment is performed  by the CSP and driven by a  standardised checklist.  An accredited third-party then  audits the assessment report  and its supporting  documentation.  The assessment is performed by  an accredited third-party, and it  is driven by a risk analysis  performed by the CSP, which is  in the audit scope.  The assessment is performed as  for the Substantial level, but the  CAB needs to be authorized by the  NCCA to it has the required  competencies to audit the specific  requirements of the High level.  More rigour is expected in the  definition and application of  policies, usually as defined in  requirements specific to the  controls (e.g. the need to  demonstrate the coverage of  functional tests used in  development).  Rigour rationale The assessment follows all  items in a checklist suited to the  targeted cloud service, and its  results are reviewed by an  accredited third-party.  A full audit is performed by an  independent third-party, and the  checklist approach is replaced  by a more rigorous risk-based  approach, allowing the auditor to  identify controls that require  specific attention.  The rigour remains mostly the  same as for level Substantial, as it  corresponds to typical audit  conditions.  Nevertheless, specific  requirements explicitly increase the  level of rigour on some controls by  requiring additional deliverables  from the CSP.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  27  6. SELF-ASSESSMENT  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (e) an indication of whether conformity self-assessment is permitted under the scheme;  🙧  🙥  EU statements of conformity shall not be issued by CSPs in the EUCS scheme.  RATIONALE  Additional input  In addition, Article 53, provides further information on conformity self-assessment, and in particular:  1.  A European cybersecurity certification scheme may allow for the conformity self-assessment under the sole  responsibility of the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. Conformity self-  assessment shall be permitted only in relation to ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that present a  low risk corresponding to assurance level ‘basic’.  2.  The manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes may issue an EU statement of  conformity stating that the fulfilment of the requirements set out in the scheme has been demonstrated. By  issuing such a statement, the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes shall  assume responsibility for the compliance of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process with the requirements  set out in that scheme.  Recitals also provide additional information:  (78)  European cybersecurity certification schemes could provide for a conformity assessment to be carried out  under the sole responsibility of the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes  (‘conformity self-assessment’). In such cases, it should be sufficient that the manufacturer or provider of ICT  products, ICT services or ICT processes itself carry out all of the checks to ensure that the ICT products, ICT  services or ICT processes conform with the European cybersecurity certification scheme. Conformity self-  assessment should be considered to be appropriate for low complexity ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes that present a low risk to the public, such as simple design and production mechanisms. Moreover,  conformity self-assessment should be permitted for ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes only where  they correspond to assurance level ‘basic’.  (79)  European cybersecurity certification schemes could allow for both conformity self-assessments and  certifications of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. In such a case, the scheme should provide for  clear and understandable means for consumers or other users to differentiate between ICT products, ICT  services or ICT processes with regard to which the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or  ICT processes is responsible for the assessment, and ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes that are  certified by a third party.  🙧  🙥  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  28  The issuance of EU statements of conformity by cloud service providers could only have been allowed for all cloud  services that present a low risk (Article 53(1)), i.e., to a subset of the cloud services that could be certified at level  Basic.  The ad hoc Working Group consistently expressed that self-assessment was not suitable for cloud services, even at  level Basic and even on a strictly defined subset of services. In addition, there are many elements in the scheme,  including the definition of the security objectives and requirements, that are entirely new. Rather than allowing CSPs to  interpret these security requirements, it is preferable to only allow accredited CABs to use the scheme, making it easier  to bring the various elements of the scheme to a higher level of maturity in a consistent way, and to control their usage  in the meantime through guidance and guidelines for CABs.  Although divergent opinions have been expressed, in particular in the surveys performed over the summer, we have  decided to not allow the issuance of EU statements of conformity in the initial version of this scheme, as there are  enough challenges to be met in that first version.  This decision may be reconsidered in future releases of the scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  29  7. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS  APPLICABLE TO A CAB  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (f) where applicable, specific or additional requirements to which conformity assessment bodies are subject  in order to guarantee their technical competence to evaluate the cybersecurity requirements;  🙧  🙥  All CABs performing assessments in the context of the EUCS scheme will need to be accredited for [ISO17065],  complemented by the requirements defined for the EUCS scheme (see Annex E:, Competence requirements for  CABs). The requirements will define several profiles corresponding to the various roles in the conformity assessments,  in order to allow CABs that only perform a subset of the of the conformity assessment activities, in particular those that  only perform evaluation activities.  The technical competence requirements associated to accreditation are sufficient to perform conformity assessments  at levels Basic and Substantial. However, advanced competences are required in order to perform a conformity  assessment at level High. As a consequence, conformity assessment bodies shall be authorised by the national  cybersecurity certification authority to carry out in the context of an evaluation at level High conformity assessment  tasks related to highly technical topics including:   Penetration testing, including the design and performance of penetration tests and the analysis of penetration  testing activities performed by a CSP or its contractors.   Analysis of development activities, and in particular the review of the design and implementation of security  measures by the CSP.  Further details are provided in Annex E: (Competence requirements for CABs).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  30  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 60 covers Conformity assessment bodies:  1.  The conformity assessment bodies shall be accredited by national accreditation bodies appointed pursuant  to Regulation (EC) No 765/2008. Such accreditation shall be issued only where the conformity assessment body  meets the requirements set out in the Annex to this Regulation.  3.  Where European cybersecurity certification schemes set out specific or additional requirements pursuant to  point (f) of Article 54(1), only conformity assessment bodies that meet those requirements shall be authorised by  the national cybersecurity certification authority to carry out tasks under such schemes.  Article 58, about National Cybersecurity Certification Authorities, also covers that topic:  7.  National cybersecurity certification authorities shall:  (c) without prejudice to Article 60(3), actively assist and support the national accreditation bodies in the  monitoring and supervision of the activities of conformity assessment bodies, for the purposes of this Regulation;  (e) where applicable, authorise conformity assessment bodies in accordance with Article 60(3) and restrict,  suspend or withdraw existing authorisation where conformity assessment bodies infringe the requirements of  this Regulation;  The Annex to the Cybersecurity Act (Requirements to be met by Conformity Assessment Bodies) provides  detailed information on the conditions to be met by all CABs. However, it does not include any reference to point  (f) of Article 54 (1), so we don’t reproduce it here.  🙧  🙥  The competence required for CABs are rather generic, since most of the controls are related to the processes used by  the CSP. Nevertheless, some controls require competences, in particular at the highest levels of assurance.  Pen testing and analysis of development activities are provided as examples, since those activities do require specific  competencies, but the “including” formulation does not preclude the addition of further activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  31  8. EVALUATION METHODS AND  CRITERIA  Foreword for Reviewers  The present chapter is not fully ready for review, the evaluation methods and criteria are still being defined. The  structure is set, though, and we are mostly missing the mapping between the measures in the scheme and the  security objectives of Article 51.  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (g) the specific evaluation criteria and methods to be used, including types of evaluation, in order to  demonstrate that the security objectives referred to in Article 51 are achieved;  🙧  🙥  The EUCS scheme uses a set of evaluation criteria that is defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements  for Cloud Services).  The EUCS assessment methodology, based on the [ISO17065] standard, is defined in Annex B: (Meta-approach for  the assessment of cloud services). This methodology defines two assessment approaches that may be used by CABs:   an assessment approach that may be used for assurance levels Substantial and High, defined in Annex C:,  (Assessment for levels Substantial and High), which draws inspiration from both the [ISO17021] standard and  from the ISAE family of standards [IAASB Handbook];   an evidence-based assessment approach, defined in Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic), that may be used  solely for assurance level Basic.  In order to achieve a high level of interoperability between the assessment methods, the EUCS assessment  methodology also defines strict guidelines and requirements on the assessment process and on its deliverables, which  shall be followed independently of the assessment method used in a specific evaluation.  Article 51 objectives are covered by the security objectives requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and  requirements for Cloud Services). Table 3 below provides a high-level vision based of the coverage of Article 51  requirements by security categories from Annex A:.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  32  Table 3: Coverage or Article 51 by requirement categories  Security objectives from Article 51 Categories from Annex A:  (a) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data  against accidental or unauthorised storage, processing,  access or disclosure during the entire life cycle of the ICT  product, ICT service or ICT process;  This is covered in many categories of the scheme, including in  particular the CKM category (covering cryptography) and the  CS category (covering the security of communications)  (b) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data  against accidental or unauthorised destruction, loss or  alteration or lack of availability during the entire life cycle of  the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process;  This is covered in many categories of the scheme, including in  particular the CKM category (covering cryptography) and the  CS category (covering the security of communications)  (c) that authorised persons, programs or machines are able  only to access the data, services or functions to which their  access rights refer;  This is mostly covered by the IAM category (covering identity  management, authentication, and access control)  (d) to identify and document known dependencies and  vulnerabilities;  This is mostly covered by the PM category (defining  relationships with suppliers) and the OPS category (defining  vulnerability handling)  (e) to record which data, services or functions have been  accessed, used or otherwise processed, at what times and  by whom;  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (defining logging)  (f) to make it possible to check which data, services or  functions have been accessed, used or otherwise  processed, at what times and by whom;  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (defining logging)  (g) to verify that ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes do not contain known vulnerabilities;  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (defining general  pen testing measures) and by the DEV category (defining  vulnerability testing in the development context)  (h) to restore the availability and access to data, services  and functions in a timely manner in the event of a physical or  technical incident;  This is mostly covered by the BCM category (defining business  continuity) and the PS category (defining physical security  measures)  (i) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are  secure by default and by design;  This is mostly covered in the DEV category (defining  methodology), with complements in many other categories  (j) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are  provided with up-to-date software and hardware that do not  contain publicly known vulnerabilities, and are provided with  mechanisms for secure updates.  This is mostly covered by the OPS category (vulnerability  handling), in the CCM category (for change management) and  in the DEV category (for development methodologies)  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 51. Security objectives of European cybersecurity certification schemes  A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall be designed to achieve, as applicable, at least the following  security objectives:  (a) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data against accidental or unauthorised storage,  processing, access or disclosure during the entire life cycle of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process;  (b) to protect stored, transmitted or otherwise processed data against accidental or unauthorised  destruction, loss or alteration or lack of availability during the entire life cycle of the ICT product, ICT service or  ICT process;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  33  (c) that authorised persons, programs or machines are able only to access the data, services or functions to  which their access rights refer;  (d) to identify and document known dependencies and vulnerabilities;  (e) to record which data, services or functions have been accessed, used or otherwise processed, at what  times and by whom;  (f) to make it possible to check which data, services or functions have been accessed, used or otherwise  processed, at what times and by whom;  (g) to verify that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes do not contain known vulnerabilities;  (h) to restore the availability and access to data, services and functions in a timely manner in the event of a  physical or technical incident;  (i) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are secure by default and by design;  (j) that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes are provided with up-to-date software and hardware  that do not contain publicly known vulnerabilities, and are provided with mechanisms for secure updates.  Recital (74) provide a rational for Article 51:  (74) The purpose of European cybersecurity certification schemes should be to ensure that ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes certified under such schemes comply with specified requirements that aim to protect  the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored, transmitted or processed data or of the related  functions of or services offered by, or accessible via those products, services and processes throughout their life  cycle. It is not possible to set out in detail the cybersecurity requirements relating to all ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes in this Regulation. ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes and the  cybersecurity needs related to those products, services and processes are so diverse that it is very difficult to  develop general cybersecurity requirements that are valid in all circumstances. It is therefore necessary to adopt  a broad and general notion of cybersecurity for the purpose of certification, which should be complemented by a  set of specific cybersecurity objectives that are to be taken into account when designing European cybersecurity  certification schemes. The arrangements by which such objectives are to be achieved in specific ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes should then be further specified in detail at the level of the individual  certification scheme adopted by the Commission, for example by reference to standards or technical  specifications if no appropriate standards are available.  🙧  🙥  The requirements defined in the EUCS scheme have been drawn from a number of existing standards and conformity  assessment schemes, and they cover all categories defined in information security standards such as [ISO27001]. In  particular, the structure of the requirements is inspired from the [C5] criteria and from the [SecNumCloud] scheme.  Regarding assessment methods, a key objective from the scheme has been to minimize the disruption of existing  practices regarding certification and assurance for CSPs. The choice was made to use a hybrid methodology, based  on both the [ISO17021] methodology that is used for [ISO27001] certifications and on the [ISAE3402] methodology  used by many companies to get assurance reports on the security of their information systems.  As a result, the proposed methodology presents numerous advantages:   It proposes several assurance levels with increasing requirements that correspond to the levels defined in  [EUCSA];   It allows combined assessments with both [ISO17021] and [ISAE3402] assessments, allowing CSPs to contain  the investment on compliance.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  34  9. NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR  CERTIFICATION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (h) where applicable, the information which is necessary for certification and which is to be supplied or  otherwise be made available to the conformity assessment bodies by an applicant;  🙧  🙥  When a CSP wishes to get a cloud service certified in the EUCS scheme, or to maintain the certification of an already  certified cloud service, the CSP shall submit an application document, following the template defined in Annex F:  (Scheme Document Content requirements), completed with all required information, which depends in part on the  reason that triggered the conformity assessment.  During the evaluation, the CSP shall submit all the information needed to demonstrate that the implementation of their  cloud service meets the security requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud  Services) for the targeted assurance level, including but not limited to:   policies and procedures defined at the organization level and that apply to the design and operation of the cloud  services under evaluation;   policies and procedures that are specific to the design and operation of the cloud services under evaluation;   documentation related to the cloud services under evaluation, including design documentation, and if required,  test documentation, implementation details;   if required, records that can be used as evidence that the abovementioned policies and procedures are being  followed;   if subservice organizations are used, records and documents that can provide assurance that the subservice  organizations satisfy the requirements of the scheme that they are responsible for;   where explicitly stated, specific documents and records required by the CAB to assess the fulfilment of  requirements pertaining to specific security controls.  The information to be provided also depends on the assurance level required for the certification, as defined in  Chapter 5 (Assurance Levels). The information shall be provided following the assessment processes defined in  Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and  High) and Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic).  In the context of the conformity assessment, the CSP shall grant the CAB:   access to all information, such as records and documentation, including service level agreements, of which  management is aware that is relevant to the cloud service;   access to additional information that the CAB may request from management for the purpose of the evaluation;   unrestricted access to personnel within the Service Organization from whom the CAB determines it may be  necessary to obtain evidence relevant to the evaluation;  All records and documentation supporting the conformity assessment shall be appropriately archived by the CSP  and/or the CAB, as defined in Chapter 15 (Record Retention) and Chapter 18 (Availability of Information).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  35  As part of a new certification, it shall be possible to reuse evaluation results from another ICT certification or  assessment. The applicant may therefore make available to the CAB previous evaluation results to be re-used as  evidence. The CAB shall reuse such results for its tasks only when the provided evidence conforms to the  requirements for such evidence, the evidence has been evaluated following a methodology recognized by the scheme,  and the authenticity of the evidence can be confirmed.  In addition, the CSP shall submit to the CAB the link to the supplementary cybersecurity information required by  Article 55 of the EUCSA, in accordance to the rules defined in Chapter 23 (Supplementary Information).  Security requirements are defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services) related to the  availability and content of this supplementary information, to be fulfilled by certified cloud services at all assurance  levels  Additional information may be required when the conformity assessment is performed as a consequence of the  vulnerability management process defined in Chapter 14 (New Vulnerabilities), or of the nonconformity management  process defined in Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance), to ensure that the vulnerability or nonconformity has been properly  handled.  An important part of the information provided by the CSP is the description of its cloud service, which shall follow the  principles below:   The description shall provide the information that is likely to be relevant from a CAB’s perspective to understand  the cloud service and associated controls to meet the applicable EUCS requirements as defined in Annex A:  (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services). Other aspects of the cloud service do not need to be  covered in the provided information.   If the CSP uses subservice organizations in the provision of the cloud service, the description shall indicate that  complementary subservice organization controls that are suitably designed and operating effectively are  necessary, along with the CSP’s own controls, to meet certain of the EUCS requirements. The information shall  include a presentation of applicable EUCS requirements, with the CSP’s controls, the types of complementary  subservice organization controls assumed in the design of the CSP’s controls, and pointers to assurance  documentation where evidence can be found that the subservice organization satisfies these complementary  subservice organization controls with an level assurance suitable for the targeted level of assurance. The  assurance documentation referred to in that presentation shall be included in the information provided to the CAB.   The description shall indicate that Complementary Customer Controls that are suitably designed and are operating  effectively are necessary, along with the CSP’s controls, to meet some of the applicable EUCS requirements. The  description shall present the applicable EUCS requirements, the CSP’s controls and the Complementary  Customer Controls assumed in the design of the CSP’s controls.  General rules regarding the protection of the information provided by an applicant shall comply with the requirements  established under Chapter 24 (Additional Topics).  RATIONALE  The information to be provided by the CSP is mostly guided by the requirements defined in the security controls in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services). The present chapter only defines the main  principles, which grants the CAB both necessary and limited access to:   all pertinent documents, including policies and procedures, as well as records, logs, and other documents that can  attest that the procedures and policies are being applied appropriately;   interactions with employees, including individual interviews and group meetings, to gather information on the  application of procedures, or to provide explanations pertaining to the definition and implementation of security  controls;   interactions with the CSP systems, in particular to verify that technical security controls are properly implemented,  which may either be performed directly by an auditor, or performed by a CSP employee in front of an auditor.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  36  There may be some restrictions in the availability of the information, in particular related to the confidential nature of  the information, so some information may only be available to the CAB for a limited time, and only on the premises of  the CSP. Such limitations should be considered in the contractual agreement between the CAB and the CSP, to  ensure that they are acceptable to the CAB and that possible additional costs are covered by the CSP.  In addition to the information related to the requirements, the CSP needs to provide other information to the CAB for  evaluation:   the supplementary cybersecurity information required by Article 55 of the EUCSA;   any relevant information pertaining to a vulnerability or nonconformity that has triggered the conformity  assessment.  This provision has been added in the case where the CAB would need specific information related to an issue or to the  supplementary cybersecurity information that has not been explicitly planned in the security controls’ requirements.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  37  10. MARKS AND LABELS  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (i) where the scheme provides for marks or labels, the conditions under which such marks or labels may be  used;  🙧  🙥  The European Cybersecurity Certification Framework may provide for a label and associated mark.  When available, such a label shall be specifically implemented for this scheme, in order to allow its application on each  certificate, certified cloud service and related documentation. The labels used on the cloud service and related  documentation shall contain exactly the same information as the label included on the certificate, and follow all the  guidelines provided with the label and associated mark defined for the European Cybersecurity Certification  Framework.  A label and associated mark shall only be used when the certificate is awarded and until its expiration, and in  association with the certified cloud service: the non-respect of this condition shall be considered as an irregularity, as  defined by Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring).  Without prejudice to the rules for monitoring compliance as described under Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring),  depending on the circumstances, the nature and impact of the non-respect, wrong use, misuse, abuse of the mark and  or label may have other legal implications in the field of IP right protection, possible criminal allegations (e.g. fraud,  deceit), market surveillance regulations related to consumer protection (e.g. misleading and or unlawful comparative  advertising of cloud services). These legal implications are outside the scope of this EUCS scheme.  RATIONALE  A label and associated mark, established for the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework and specifically  implemented for this scheme, will allow to:   highlight that the cloud service has been certified in the European Union and to provide immediate information  regarding the certificate by referring to the framework (ECCF), the evaluation scheme and the assurance level;   make the certification easily recognizable as both the label and the associated mark may be used in the cloud  service’s web site and printed on technical documents and on leaflets used for marketing purposes;   provide a direct link (in the form of a QR code) to the ENISA website (as per Article 50) - where all the information  regarding the certificate are disclosed, including the current status of the certificate.  Figure 1: Demo label for the EUCS scheme  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  38  The “demo label”, shows the basic information that the label associated with the scheme may contain:   logo of the ECCF (to be registered, regulated and protected by the entity in charge of the enforcement of the  labelling framework);   logo of the EUCS (to be registered, regulated and protected by the entity in charge of the enforcement of the  labelling framework);   QR code pointing to the web portal of ENISA - as per the Article 50 of the CSA – and to the page where the  effective status of the certificate of the cloud service and the information regarding its lifecycle can be retrieved;   CSA assurance level (with the introduction of a specific colour identifying each level);   specific EUCS assurance level;   the sentence “Certified in the European Union”, together with the flag of the EU.  The introduction of the QR code will imply, as defined by Chapter 20 (Disclosure Policy), a procedure for the release of  the QR code.  The demo label only contains summary information. In particular, it does not contain any reference to a date or to an  issuing CAB. The use of the label therefore needs to be be strictly controlled to ensure that:   The label is only used in direct relationship with a certified cloud service;   The label is only used when the corresponding certificate is valid (i.e. after issuance, before withdrawal or  expiration);   The assurance levels and logos mentioned on the label are the appropriate ones for the particular cloud service;  and   The label is only used with the QR-code obtained through the procedure defined in Chapter 20, which points to  ENISA’s Web site.  Compliance monitoring is in charge of ensuring that CSPs comply to these requirements.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  39  11. COMPLIANCE MONITORING  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (j) rules for monitoring compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the requirements  of the European cybersecurity certificates or the EU statements of conformity, including mechanisms to  demonstrate continued compliance with the specified cybersecurity requirements;  🙧  🙥  Without prejudice to NCCA activities defined under Articles 58.7 and 58.8 of the EUCSA, monitoring compliance of  cloud services that have been issued European cybersecurity certificates shall demonstrate their continued compliance  with the specified cybersecurity requirements.  In particular, this monitoring shall allow where possible to avoid and where needed to detect the following general  cases of non-compliance:   a non-compliance in the application by a CSP of the rules and obligations related to a certificate issued on their  cloud services;   a non-compliance in the conditions under which the certification takes place and that are not related to the  individual cloud service;   a nonconformity of a certified cloud service with the EUCS security requirements, which includes and is not limited  to:  o a change in the cloud service itself leading to a change of the cloud service’s security posture;  o a significant security incident that has affected the certified cloud service or has resulted in a data breach or  loss of sensitive information;  o a change in the threat environment after the issuance of the certificate, which has an adverse impact on the  security of the certified cloud service;  o a vulnerability identified and related to the certified cloud service, that has an adverse impact on the security  of the certified cloud service.  The general monitoring of the certified cloud services shall be based on sampling, using generic criteria such as cloud  service capabilities, assurance level, CSP, CAB and any relevant information brought to the knowledge of the NCCA  (e.g., complaints, security events). The NCCAs on their respective territories and in cooperation with other relevant  market surveillance authorities, shall sample annually a minimum of 5% of the cloud services which have been the  subject of a successful conformity assessment in the context of the EUCS scheme in the previous year and at least  one cloud service per annum.  The NCCA shall involve in the monitoring the CAB that has issued the certificate, and if necessary, its subcontractors.  The monitoring shall consist in the re-assessment of the cloud service, together – when necessary – with an audit to  confirm or disprove the above-mentioned relevant information brought to the knowledge of the NCCA. The re-  assessments and audits procedures are defined in Annex G: (Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance).  Where a cloud service is selected the CSP shall be informed of the selection reasons.  Re-assessments and audits shall be financially supported by the CSP.  In addition to this general monitoring, the activities described hereinafter shall be undertaken.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  40  The following deviations and irregularities shall be considered as potential non-compliance elements in the application  by a CSP of the rules and obligations related to a certificate issued on their cloud service:   any deviation from the requirements applicable to the information supplied or made available to a CAB, and that  might be discovered after the emission of a certificate, such as:  o a version of the information delivered that does not correspond to the version of the cloud service when it was  certified;  o self-established evidence that was not in-line with the reality of the cloud service;   any deviation from the requirements regarding the certificate content and the supplementary information as  required by Chapter 9 (Necessary information for certification), Chapter 17 (Certificate Format), Chapter  18  (Availability of Information), and Chapter 23 (Supplementary Information), including and not limited to:  o deviation from referencing the proper cloud service identifiers;  o misalignment of the description of the cloud service scope3;  o deviation from constraints of the certificate including those of Chapter 12 (Certificate Management)4;  o deviations from the conditions of use of the scheme's marks and labels as defined in Chapter 10 (Marks and  Labels);  o undue modifications or alterations of the certificate document as defined in Chapter 17 (Certificate Format);  o omission to declare alteration of supplementary information as defined by Chapter  18 (Availability of  Information);   any deviation from the requirements on the certificate holder’s obligations towards maintaining the certificate  validity, such as:  o failure to apply mandatory maintenance activities;  o failure to implement and enforce mandatory processes as requested by the Terms and Conditions of a  certificate and of the label;  o deviations from the certified cloud service scope, including obligations from Article 56.8 of the EUCSA,  including: undeclared modifications of the cloud service, its development and operating processes, the list of  its dependencies5, or the list of utilized tools6.  Such non-compliance in the application by a CSP of the requirements related to a certificate issued on their cloud  service shall be monitored by:  1. requiring any applicant to a certificate to commit to the CAB to a number of obligations, including but not limited to:  o to transmit information to the CAB deemed reliable and that would not risk falsifying their judgment;  o not to declare a cloud service as certified while the evaluation is still undergoing;  o to declare a cloud service as certified only for the scope specified in the certificate;  o to stop immediately the use of any advertisement mentioning the certification in the event of suspension or  withdrawal of the certification;  o to make sure that the cloud service operated with references to the issued certificate is the one which was the  object of certification7;  o to commit to scrupulously respecting the rules of use of the label established for the scheme; and  o to notify the CAB about significant changes in the certified cloud service, including but limited to changes of  subservice organizations, changes in the supplementary information or in any documentation element that is  provided with the certificate.  2. using the following available dispositive to track the non-respect of the previous obligations:  o the activities of market surveillance established under Article 58.7.(a) of the CSA, with a report to the CAB  who issued the certificate;  o the quality measures in place within the CAB, and the possibility to establish and handle complaints;  3. an assessment of the gravity of the irregularity by the CAB;  3 e.g., failure to describe some of the underlying capabilities that the service relies on.  4 e.g., advertising a certified cloud service after the product certificate has expired.  5 e.g., the introduction of new libraries or tools that may adversely impact security  6 e.g., a change in the tools in the development chain  7 At any time, the operated service must be the result of applying the processes described during  the certification process to the service as it was  certified.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  41  4. using the possibility of the dialog between the CAB and the CSP to try and solve minor issues, and of the  provisions of Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance) where necessary.  The NCCA shall be informed of the results of these activities.  In addition to the activities of market surveillance, the NCCA may establish rules for a periodic dialog between the  issuers of certificates and the certificates owners, as to formally check and report the respect of previously stated  obligations.  ENISA may provide for harmonisation into the EUCS scheme guidance on the commitments that may be part of an  application request, with an indication of the associated gravity.  The following deviations shall be considered as potential issues related to non-compliance in the conditions under  which the certification takes place and that are not related to the individual cloud service:   failure to meet obligations regarding handling complaints towards maintaining the certificate validity, including:  o obligations for auditing the scheme compliance of the CAB, its subcontractors and the certificate holders  related to certificate use as implicitly required by Article 58.8.(b) of the EUCSA;  o obligations for supervising and enforcing CAB’s and certificate holder’s scheme compliance as implicitly  required by Art. 58.7.(a) of the EUCSA;  o obligations for complaint handling as implicitly required by Art. 58.7.(f);   deviations from evaluation requirements:  o unjustified deviations from the evaluation methodology and applicable supporting documents described under  Chapter 8 (Evaluation Methods and Criteria);  o deviations from expected evaluation competence, as described under Chapter 7 (Specific requirements  applicable to a CAB).  Such non-compliance in the conditions under which the certification takes place and that are not related to an  individual cloud service shall:  1. be avoided where possible through:  o the audits permitted through Article 58.8.(b) and (c) of the EUCSA;  o the permanent monitoring of the CAB by their Accreditation bodies and of the CAB’s subcontractors by the  CAB and their Accreditation bodies, as requested by Chapters 7 (Specific requirements applicable to a  CAB).and 22 (Peer Assessment);  2. be detected through:  o the quality process of the CAB, including the report to the NCCA of the identified issue, and the requirement  associated to their accreditation to handle complaints.  The following shall be considered as potential issues of non-conformity of a certified cloud service with its security  requirements:   a change in the cloud service itself leading to a change of the cloud service’s security posture;   a significant security incident that has affected the certified cloud service or has resulted in a data breach or loss  of sensitive information;   a change in the threat environment which has an adverse impact on the security of the certified cloud service;   a vulnerability identified and related to the certified cloud service, that has an adverse impact on the security of the  certified cloud service.  Such non-conformity of a certified cloud service with its security requirements shall be monitored under the following  responsibilities:  1. CSPs shall:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  42  o inform the CAB of major changes in the certified cloud service or in its Information Security Management  System that may have an impact on the statements included in the related certificate;  o monitor any vulnerability that would be relevant to their cloud service, either published by or received from  end users and security researchers as defined in Article 55.1.(c), or discovered by the CSP, and submit an  impact analysis where necessary to their CAB;  o monitor the known dependencies and vulnerabilities identified by any other source that may apply to the  certified cloud service, and submit an impact analysis where necessary to their CAB;  o inform the CAB of any security incident that they notify to regulatory authorities;  o work in cooperation with the CAB and where necessary with the NCCA to support their monitoring activities;  o such activities may be assessed within the certification process of the cloud service, through the controls  defined in the Incident Management category;  2. CABs shall;  o monitor any vulnerability from any source that would be relevant to their scope of evaluation and certification;  o monitor the handling of incidents reported by CSPs; and  o report to their NCCA any detected vulnerability affecting the conformity of a certified cloud service to the  requirements related to the certification.  Where deemed necessary by the CAB or at the discretion of the NCCA, a series of evaluation tasks may be requested  to be performed with the support8 of the CSP as to confirm the impact of a non-conformity.  These activities related to monitoring compliance shall be part of the annual summary report of a NCCA.  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 58, on NCCAs, includes:  7. National cybersecurity certification authorities shall:  (a) supervise and enforce rules included in European cybersecurity certification schemes pursuant to point  (j) of Article 54(1) for the monitoring of the compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the  requirements of the European cybersecurity certificates that have been issued in their respective territories, in  cooperation with other relevant market surveillance authorities;  Article 59, on Peer reviews, includes:  3. Peer review shall assess:  (b) the procedures for supervising and enforcing the rules for monitoring the compliance of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes with European cybersecurity certificates pursuant to point (a) of Article 58(7);  🙧  🙥  The requirements have been established considering:   potential irregularities (as of Article 56.8 of the EUCSA): An irregularity affecting a cloud service’s conformity  arises from the description of the service as stated in the certificate, or in the implementation of the controls  described during the conformity assessment. Though such irregularities are addressed as a cloud service’s non-  compliance post-certification, they may arise any time;   potential gaps into the technical competencies of a CAB;   potential vulnerabilities and modifications of a cloud service or of its environment.  8 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  43  Associated non-compliance issues have been identified and counter-measures for the prevention and detection thereof  established.  This process benefits of the provisions of the EUCSA:   market surveillance installed by Article 58.7.(a);   obligation on auditing the scheme compliance of CABs and certificate holders mandated by Article 58.8.(b);   the right to contest certificates (Article 63.1), and the need to the responsible bodies or authorities to handle  complaints regarding the validity of a certificate (Article 63.2), and therefore service compliance as required by  Article 54.1.(j);   the power of a NCCA – through the power of Article 58.8.(b) – to launch an audit of the certificate holder and  issuer for any purpose related to their compliance to the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework.  As for the CSP’s task to monitor the known dependencies and vulnerabilities: The Terms and Conditions of the  certificate require that a CSP monitors the threat landscape and notifies the CAB about any vulnerability in their  certified cloud service. A CAB or one of their accredited subcontractors may propose CSPs such a service.  As for the CSP’s requirement to report to their CABs security incidents that they report to other regulatory authorities:  the objective is to ensure that the CAB gets notified of significant incidents without adding a significant burden for  CSPs during a crisis. So, no new criteria are here added.  Where necessary, the conditions to support new evaluation activities have been indicated, as they might have a  financial impact.  Finally, the implementation of compliance monitoring by NCCAs may be the subject of peer review between NCCAs,  as defined in Article 59; however, the peer review process is  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  44  12. CERTIFICATE MANAGEMENT  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (k) where applicable, the conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing the European  cybersecurity certificates, as well as the conditions for extending or reducing the scope of certification;  Article 56 on Cybersecurity Certification also covers this issue:  9.  A European cybersecurity certificate shall be issued for the period provided for in the European  cybersecurity certification scheme and may be renewed, provided that the relevant requirements continue to be  met.  🙧  🙥  Figure 2: Processes related to the issuance and maintenance of a certificate  The reference standard for these activities is ISO/IEC 17065 and in particular, its Clause 7.10, where ‘changes  affecting a certificate’ are discussed.  Conditions for issuing a certificate  A CAB shall only issue a certificate when:   the applicant has committed to all obligations that need to be fulfilled under this scheme to obtain the certificate;   the evaluation of the cloud service is successful and in line with the evaluation requirements set in this scheme in  Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and  High, and Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic) for the requested assurance level; and  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  45   the review of the evaluation results is successful and in line with the requirements of ISO/IEC 17065 and with the  requirements set in this scheme in Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services) for the  required assurance level.  The review shall be performed independently of the evaluation, and it shall cover all reports provided during the  evaluation to ensure that the conclusions are consistent with the evidence adduced and that the accepted evaluation  criteria and evaluation methods have been correctly applied.  The certificate shall be related to the version of the supplementary cybersecurity information produced by the vendor  as specified in Article 55 of the CSA.  The CAB shall establish a period of validity for the certificate that shall not exceed the maximum period defined in  Chapter 19 (Certificate validity).  Conditions for maintaining a certificate  During the validity period of the certificate, periodic reassessments are required to ensure that the CSP continues to  fulfil the requirements set in this scheme. Such periodic reassessments shall not be separated by more than one year.  This period may be reduced by the CAB if there are specific attention points that require an earlier reassessment.  Maintenance activities shall be initiated upon the following conditions:   when the cloud service has been selected through the sampling rule installed for the general monitoring of  certified cloud service, as defined by Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring) and Annex G: (Certification Lifecycle  and continued assurance);   following a confirmed nonconformity with security requirements, under the conditions defined in Chapter 13 (Non-  Compliance);   following an identified non-compliance with the accreditation requirements of the CAB, the CSA provisions, or the  scheme requirements, that affects the certification.  Maintenance activities may be initiated on the request of the owner of the certificate upon one of the following  conditions:   a periodic reassessment is due to be performed;   a renewal assessment is required to extend the validity period of the certificate;   a change of the certified cloud service requires an update of the content of the certificate of the information  published in compliance to Article 55(1);   a significant change occurs in the certified cloud service or in the design and implementation of the security  measures that fulfil the requirements of this scheme.  Depending on the nature of the previous conditions, and in accordance with the requirements established in  Chapter 11 (Compliance Monitoring), Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance) and Chapter 14 (New Vulnerabilities), the  maintenance activities shall be triggered at the discretion of the CSP, the CAB, or the NCCA. The National  Accreditation Body may also trigger maintenance activities where a complaint has been issued.  When the maintenance activities are initiated by the CSP, the request to the CAB shall be accompanied with an Impact  Analysis report (IAR), in accordance with Annex G:, Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance.  In all other cases when the maintenance activities are initiated by any other party (CAB, NCCA, and any stakeholder  acting as a sponsor of the associated maintenance activities), the request shall be supported by a maintenance  rationale containing a description of the potential or actual non-conformity or the identified non-compliance stated and  its potential impact on the certificate.  Based on the IAR or the maintenance rationale and on the requirements defined in this scheme for re-assessment or  renewal, the CAB shall validate whether some evaluation tasks are deemed necessary before its review and decision,  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  46  and validate accordingly the scope of and the workload associated to these tasks. The CAB shall also validate the  result of the necessary evaluation tasks once completed.  Typical conformity assessment activities are defined in Annex G:, Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance:   Periodic conformity assessment, including a partial re-assessment of the cloud service, to be performed at regular  intervals, during the validity period of the certificate, as defined in Chapter 19, Certificate validity.   Renewal conformity assessment, including a full re-assessment of the cloud service, to be performed before the  expiration date of the certificate.   Restoration conformity assessment, following a request from a CSP to consider changes in the certified cloud  services, or following a request from a CAB or from the NCCA related to a nonconformity (Chapter 13, Non-  Compliance) or to a new vulnerability (Chapter 14, New Vulnerabilities).  The CSP shall support9 the CAB for the conformity assessment activities deemed necessary, unless otherwise  specified in Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance).  Upon review and decision of the CAB, the maintenance activities shall result in one the following decisions:   continuing the certificate, corresponding to keeping the existing certificate alive, without change;   updating the certificate to reflect some changes in the certified cloud service, including an extension of its scope;   renewing the certificate with a new validity period and optionally some updates, corresponding to re-issuing the  same certificate with a new validity period;   withdrawing the certificate, and issuing a certificate with either a reduced assurance level, or a reduced scope of  the certificate to still meet the current assurance level, potentially with a new validity period;   suspending the certificate pending remedial action by the CSP;   withdrawing the certificate.  Decisions shall be accompanied with a Maintenance Report issued by the CAB, in accordance with Annex G:  (Certification Lifecycle and continued assurance), and uniquely linked to the certificate; it shall motivate the decision  and, where applicable, indicate any necessary change to the initial certificate.  In the case no maintenance has been requested for a certificate that has reached its expiration date, in the case no  maintenance has been requested when a periodic assessment is due, or more generally in the case a maintenance  shall be initiated and no action was taken by any of the responsible parties in due time the certificate shall be  suspended and the CSP notified of the non-compliance. If the CSP does not perform the maintenance in due time (as  defined in Chapter 13, Non-Compliance), then the certificate shall be withdrawn.  All withdrawn certificates shall be subject to archiving. Archiving shall consist of still providing access to the certificate  and associated information, with the clear indication of its withdrawal, for instance that its expiration date has passed.  The following table shall be considered by the CAB to support the appropriate decision on most frequent possible  cases.  Table 4: Nominal decisions associated with the maintenance of certificates  Cases Nominal decisions  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils  the requirements without significant changes in the service  Continue the certificate until the next periodic assessment  or until its expiration date  9 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  47  Cases Nominal decisions  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils  the requirements and the changes impact the security of users  without any reduction in the scope of certification or assurance  level  Update the certificate with the new information and  continue the certificate until the next periodic assessment  or until its expiration date  A renewal conformity assessment has been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service still fulfils  the requirements, possibly with changes that impact the security  of users without any reduction in the scope of certification or  assurance level  Renew the certificate with a new expiration date and if  required with the new information  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service only fulfils  the requirements after reducing the scope of certification or  reducing the assurance level  Withdraw the certificate and issue a new certificate with the  reduced scope or assurance level, possibly with a different  expiration date  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, have determined that the cloud service does not fulfil  the requirements anymore, and action from the CSP is possible  to maintain the certificate at the same assurance level and scope,  though not immediately,  or improper use of the certificate is not solved by suitable  retractions and appropriate corrective actions by the CSP.  Suspend the certificate pending remedial action from the  CSP  The maintenance evaluation activities have been performed and  reviewed, and have determined that the cloud service does not  fulfil the requirements anymore  Withdraw the certificate  The periodic assessment has not been performed in due time Suspend the certificate pending remedial action from the  CSP  Remediation action has not been performed in due time after  suspension  Withdraw the certificate  A certificate shall only remain in the ‘suspended’ status for a maximum duration of 3 months that may only be extended  with the explicit and motivated approval of the NCCA. In case no action is taken by the vendor in due time the status of  certificate shall be changed into ‘withdrawn’ by the CAB.  Any change of the status of a certificate shall be disclosed without undue delay according to the requirements of  Chapter 20 (Disclosure Policy).  RATIONALE  Requirements have been established considering the requirements associated with ISO/IEC 17065, and ISO/IEC  17067, Conformity assessment - Fundamentals of product certification and guidelines for product certification  schemes.  The full life cycle of a certificate, starting from its issuance with a defined validity period till its due or potential  expiration (by validity period or preliminary to this due to a selection under the sampling rules for the general  monitoring of certificates, a potential or actual non-conformity with security requirements, or an identified non-  compliance with the accreditation requirements of the CAB, the EUCSA provisions, or the scheme requirements) has  been considered.  One fundamental condition for issuing a certificate for the cloud service is successful evaluation, based on the present  scheme. Other conditions stem from relevant provisions of the EUCSA, such as necessary authorizations for CAB  based on Article 60.3 of the EUCSA which are external to the certification in its technical meaning, and may, if not  fulfilled after certification, be considered as non-conformance cases.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  48  All other certification activities are related to the phase after the certificate is issued, where ‘a change affecting  certification’ occurs as mentioned in ISO/IEC 17065. These activities are described as ‘maintenance’. In that case, the  CAB is obliged to act in response to a given trigger.  Wording from ISO/IEC 17065 describing all relevant activities related to the certificate which has been issued applies  (see Clause 7.10).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  49  13. NON-COMPLIANCE  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (l) rules concerning the consequences for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that have been  certified or for which an EU statement of conformity has been issued, but which do not comply with the  requirements of the scheme;.  🙧  🙥  Chapter 11, Rules for monitoring compliance, defines several categories of non-compliance instances that may be  uncovered through monitoring activities. When such non-compliance instances are uncovered, the consequences for  the various stakeholders, including the CSP, the CAB and its subcontractors, and the NCCA, are as follows.  For confirmed deviations or irregularities associated to non-compliance by a CSP to the requirements related to a  certificate issued on their cloud service, the following consequences shall occur in the general case:   the CAB who has issued the certificate shall request the CSP for assertions and amendments to restore  compliance, to be provided within the time frame of 14 days for certificates at the assurance level ‘high’, or 30  days for certificates at the assurance levels ‘basic’ or ‘substantial’;   continued non-compliance past the allowed time frame shall trigger a suspension of the certificate for the cloud  service, a suspension of all certification activities by the CAB on behalf of the CSP for other services, with  information about the suspension by the CAB to the NCCA.  In the particular case of a confirmed deviation from the requirements of the certificate holder’s obligations towards  maintaining the certificate validity, or towards informing the appropriate authorities or bodies of any subsequently  detected vulnerabilities, as requested by Article 56.8 of the CSA, the following consequences shall occur:   an immediate suspension of the certificate, with information about the suspension by the CAB to the NCCA.  For a cloud service certified at assurance level High, in the case of a confirmed deviation from the requirements of the  certificate holder’s obligation of informing the appropriate authorities or bodies of any subsequently detected major  nonconformity to the requirements of the scheme through continuous monitoring, the following consequences shall  occur   an immediate suspension of the certificate, with information about the suspension by the CAB to the NCCA.  The notification of the owner of a certificate of the suspension of the certificate shall mark the beginning of a  suspension period of 14 days for certificates at the assurance level High, or 30 days for certificates at the assurance  levels Basic or Substantial. During this period:   the impact of the non-compliance on the certified cloud service shall be estimated with the necessary support10 of  the CSP;  10 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  50   when the non-compliance is verified to impact a certificate, this shall be treated as a non-conformity of the certified  cloud service, the CAB who has issued the certificate shall request the CSP for assertions and amendments to  restore compliance;   the CSP shall accept or refuse the handling of the verified nonconformity and the associated maintenance  activities, as defined in Chapter 12 (Conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing certificates);   when the handling is refused, the certificate shall be withdrawn;   when the handling is accepted, the CSP shall proceed to the necessary changes to the cloud service   when the defined period is not sufficient for the above described task, the issuer of the certificate, upon receiving a  duly justified request, may extend the grace period, no more than three times the above described duration;   when necessary (e.g. lack of availability of the CAB), the CAB may decide to further extend the suspension period  up to a maximum of 90 days;   if at the end of the suspension period, the handling of the verified non-conformity and the associate maintenance  activities have not been completed, then the certificate shall be withdrawn.  ENISA shall be informed for publication on its website, and provided with all the information to be published:   at the suspension of the certificate;   at any extension of the suspension period;   at the end of the suspension of the certificate;   at the withdrawal of the certificate.  In the case of a suspension or of the extension of a suspension, the information provided to be published to ENISA  shall include at least the end date of the suspension period, the reason for the suspension, and recommendations for  the users of the certificates.  The NCCA shall be informed at any extension of a suspension period.  For a confirmed non-compliance in the conditions under which the certification takes place and that are not related to  the individual cloud service, the concerned CAB shall proceed, under the control of the NCCA, to the following:   the identification, with the support of relevant teams and subcontractors, of potentially impacted certified cloud  services;   where deemed necessary by the CAB, or at the discretion of the NCCA, the request for a series of conformity  assessment activities to be performed on one or more cloud services by either the CAB or subcontractor who  performed the audit or any other CAN or subcontractor that would be in a better technical position to perform  these activities, leading to updated assurance reports;   the review by the CAB of the updated assurance reports, and where necessary, the re-issuance of certificates in  accordance with the requirements of Chapter 12 (Conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing  certificates), or the notification to the CSPs of the impacts of the non-compliance on their certificates.  These activities shall occur within the maximum period of 14 days for certificates at assurance level High or 30 days for  certificates at assurance levels Basic and Substantial, which may only be extended after approval by the NCCA.  When a CAB or the NCCA mandates new evaluation activities to be performed, these activities and the related review  and issuance activities shall be supported11 by the CAB that proved to be non-compliant12.  Where impacts are confirmed to affect a certificate, they shall be treated as a nonconformity of the certified cloud  service, following the above-defined rules.  11 Where necessary, support shall imply financial support to described activities.  12 Or by a subcontractor of the CAB if that subcontractor proved to be non-compliant in breach of its contractual obligations.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  51  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Recitals provide additional information:  (65) National cybersecurity certification authorities should in particular monitor and enforce the obligations of  manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes established in its respective territory  in relation to the EU statement of conformity, should assist the national accreditation bodies in the monitoring  and supervision of the activities of conformity assessment bodies by providing them with expertise and relevant  information, should authorise conformity assessment bodies to carry out their tasks where such bodies meet  additional requirements set out in a European cybersecurity certification scheme, and should monitor relevant  developments in the field of cybersecurity certification. National cybersecurity certification authorities should also  handle complaints lodged by natural or legal persons in relation to European cybersecurity certificates issued by  those authorities or in relation to European cybersecurity certificates issued by conformity assessment bodies,  where such certificates indicate assurance level ‘high’, should investigate, to the extent appropriate, the subject  matter of the complaint and should inform the complainant of the progress and the outcome of the investigation  within a reasonable period. Moreover, national cybersecurity certification authorities should cooperate with other  national cybersecurity certification authorities or other public authorities, including by the sharing of information  on the possible non-compliance of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with the requirements of this  Regulation or with specific European cybersecurity certification schemes. The Commission should facilitate that  sharing of information by making available a general electronic information support system, for example the  Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance (ICSMS) and the Rapid Alert System for  dangerous non-food products (RAPEX), already used by market surveillance authorities pursuant to Regulation  (EC) No 765/2008.  🙧  🙥  This is a rather simple set of rules:   The main ruleset is about non-conformity in the cloud service (and its operation). The way in which it is discovered  is not mentioned here, most likely through monitoring or complaints.  o In that ruleset, the CSP has an opportunity to fix the issue without any visible consequence (no suspension,  no withdrawal).  o If they fail to do this timely, then a suspension occurs.  o There is one exception, when a CSP fails in its continued assurance and maintenance duties; then, the  suspension occurs directly. This is intended to highlight the responsibility of the CSP to continue working on  security after the issuance of the certificate; also, it highlights the fact that, at that stage, the CAB only gets  involved (with an opportunity to perform evaluation activities) if the CSP reports issues as planned.   The second ruleset is about what happens when a suspension occurs (directly or after failure to act swiftly when a  non-conformity is discovered.  o Another delay starts running, this time with notification of the NCCA, and with publicity through ENISA’s Web  site (including automated notification of customers who have registered for updates on the certificate with  ENISA).  o If need be, the delay can be extended, when duly justified. The NCCA is notified of extensions, and my signal  at some point that “enough is enough”.  o When the delay expires, withdrawal occurs; withdrawal may also occur if the CSP refuses to implement  corrective actions.   The third ruleset is about what happens when a CAB fails to do their work properly.  o All certificates issued by that CAB have to be reviewed. That review may involve some work.  o If that review shows that certificates are impacted, then some evaluation work may need to be redone, as well  as the corresponding review work, and if needed, the modification of the certificate.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  52  o CSPs are notified when their certificates are impacted, but they are no held directly responsible of the work  that needs to be redone. However, if a non-conformity is identified in their cloud service during that review,  then this non-conformity needs to be handled following the first ruleset (and the second if needed).  In all cases, the entity responsible for the non-conformity is responsible for supporting the additional work, including,  but not limited to, additional costs.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  53  14. NEW VULNERABILITIES  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (m) rules concerning how previously undetected cybersecurity vulnerabilities in ICT products, ICT services  and ICT processes are to be reported and dealt with;  🙧  🙥  Vulnerability handling  CSPs shall use the general steps of ISO/IEC 30111 for vulnerability handling: preparation, receipt, verification,  remediation development, release, post release, with the following specific application rules for the EUCS scheme.  These rules are defined in the present chapter, as well as in the definition of the security controls related to incident  management, in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  PREPARATION  CSPs shall develop methods for receiving vulnerability information and make them public in accordance with Article  55.1.c) of the CSA.  RECEIPT  In the following cases where:   the CSP of the certified cloud service receives vulnerability information according to Article 55.1.(c) of the EUCSA;   there is a new publicly disclosed vulnerability on the referenced online repositories according to Article 55.1.(d) of  the EUCSA;   the CSP finds out a related vulnerability to its certified cloud service in any other way,  The CSP shall start handling the vulnerability according to its defined policies and procedures. If the vulnerability  analysis determines that the risk for the cloud service related to the vulnerability is major13, then the CSP shall report  without delay to the CAB that issued the certificate a description of the vulnerability, together with a description of its  impact.  The time between the CSP learns about the vulnerability and the notification of the CAB shall not exceed five (5)  working days. Failure to notify the CAB of a vulnerability with major impact or to do so within five (5) working days shall  be considered as a non-compliance to the rules of the scheme, as defined in Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance).  At the time the CSP notifies the CAB, the analysis of the vulnerability may not be finalized. In such a case, the CSP  shall provide to the CAB a delay for the delivery of the full analysis, which shall not exceed ninety (90) days after the  CSP became aware of the vulnerability.  The information may contain details about the possible exploit(s) of the vulnerability: in that case, it shall carry the  appropriate TLP classification as to ensure the relevant protection, in accordance with the standard rules defined in  13 According to the CSP’s own vulnerability assessment scale, which shall be defined as part of its vulnerability handling policy, as required in  Annex  Annex A:, Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services, and shall consider the potential impact and the likelihood of exploitation of  the vulnerability in the context of the cloud service.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  54  https://www.first.org/tlp/, or with alternative classification and mechanisms previously agreed between the CSP and the  CAB.  VERIFICATION AND REMEDIATION DEVELOPMENT  In addition to the security controls defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), the  CSP’s processes shall include the following steps:   In its analysis of the vulnerability with major impact, the CSP shall propose (1) whether or not the certificate should  be suspended until a remediation is released, and (2) whether or not a restoration conformity assessment should  be performed on the cloud service after remediation. The CAB shall agree on the proposed actions or make  alternative proposals within five (5) working days. When both parties deem necessary or are unable to agree on  such decisions, they may inform the NCCA and ask for its advice.   If a maintenance conformity assessment has been deemed necessary, it shall be performed before lifting a  potential suspension of the certificate.  RELEASE AND POST-RELEASE  There are no specific rules related to these phases, beyond the requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives  and requirements for Cloud Services).  Vulnerability disclosure  CSPs may use the following standard as for the general rules related to vulnerability disclosure:   ISO/IEC 29147 Information technology – Security techniques – Vulnerability disclosure.  During the vulnerability analysis, the cloud service may apply an embargo period, meaning that the possible  vulnerability is not further disclosed. This period shall not last longer than three (3) months. The NCCA may, however,  consider extending this period when a justified request is received, in particular when it is confirmed that time must be  given to downstream vendors integrating the cloud service for analysing the impact of the vulnerability (both from a  technical and certification point of view).  In addition to the general disclosure rules above, once a strategy to correct the issue has been defined by the CSP  with the approval of the CAB, information related to the confirmed vulnerability shall be disclosed to the NCCA, in  accordance with Article 56.8) of the CSA.  The information shall not contain details about the possible exploit of the vulnerability. It shall contain the necessary  elements for the NCCA to understand the impact of the vulnerability, the changes to be brought to the cloud service,  and where applicable, information by the CAB on the broader applicability of the vulnerability to other certified cloud  services.  The NCCA shall in accordance with Article 58 7 h) share this information with the other NCCAs, which may also decide  to further analyse the problem or, after informing the CSP about the information exchange, ask the related CABs to  analyse whether further certified cloud services are affected. This information exchange shall be done in confidentiality,  including application of encryption and need-to-know principle.  When a correction has been brought to the certified cloud service, the CSP shall establish the necessary CVE with the  support of the NCCA and related national CSIRT, and proceed to its publication on the relevant list, in accordance with  the requirements of Article 55 of the CSA. ENISA shall be informed of the changes of status of the related certificates.  NCCAs may develop their capacity to act as “coordinators” as defined in ISO/IEC 29147, and alternatively, designate  their national CSIRT to play this role. In that case, the CSIRT shall have access to the necessary details related to the  vulnerabilities and to the certificated cloud services.  https://www.first.org/tlp/  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  55  RATIONALE  The current description has been strongly inspired from the EUCC, with a few significant simplifications. In particular,  there is no mention of an attack potential in the analysis of a vulnerability.  This requirement has been replaced by a decision about the suspension and the need to perform another conformity  assessment (which is only expected when an incident is linked to a dysfunction in the application of processes).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  56  15. RECORD RETENTION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (n) where applicable, rules concerning the retention of records by conformity assessment bodies;  🙧  🙥  Each CAB shall maintain a records system in accordance with the requirements of the accreditation standard ISO/IEC  17065 (or to the applicable accreditation standard for its internal or external evaluation facilities, e.g. ISO/IEC17021-3).  The records system shall include all records and other documents produced in connection with each conformity  assessment, as well as documents and evidence provided by the CSP about the implementation of security controls;  the record system shall also include a list of all the documents and evidence made available temporarily by the CSP  during the conformity assessment. It shall be sufficiently complete to enable the course of each certification to be  traced.  All records shall be securely and accessibly stored for a period of at least seven (7) years after the expiration or  withdrawal of the certificate.  In case a later expiration date of the certificate is attributed in accordance with the conditions of Chapter 12 (Certificate  Management), it shall be taken into account for the new calculation of the retention period of the records, with the  same rule as previously stated. New or revised information related to the activities described under Chapter 12  (Certificate Management) shall be added to the previous records for the certificate.  RATIONALE  The proposal consists is to require records to be kept for seven (7) years after the expiration of the certificate, or until  legal actions related to the certificate are completed.  If the certificate is renewed, then the records are kept for seven (7) years after the new date, with a full history of the  certificate, including records related to all conformity assessments.  Also, there is a split responsibility between the CAB and the CSP regarding the documents and evidence that the CSP  made available in a restricted manner to the CAB: It is the CSP’s responsibility to keep these records, while the CAB  only maintains a list of the documents.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  57  16. RELATED SCHEMES  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (o) the identification of national or international cybersecurity certification schemes covering the same type  or categories of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes, security requirements, evaluation criteria and  methods, and assurance levels;  🙧  🙥  Within the EU, the following national cybersecurity certification schemes cover the same type or categories of services:   The SecNumCloud scheme in France, operated by ANSSI:  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/prestataires-  de-service-dinformatique-en-nuage-secnumcloud/   The C5 methodology in Germany, defined by BSI:  https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Kriterienkatalog/Kriterienkatalog_node.  html   The Zeker-Online scheme in the Netherlands, operated by the Zeker-Online foundation:  https://www.zeker-online.nl  These schemes only provide a partial coverage of the requirements provided in the present scheme, and they also  include some requirements that have not been included in the present scheme14. In particular, each scheme defines  only a single assurance level.  Nevertheless, it shall be considered that:   a certificate issued under these schemes may where necessary15 be transformed into a certificate under the  EUCS scheme if all required activities are conducted;   a CAB may accept to use the results of evaluation activities performed under these schemes for a certification  under the EUCS scheme;   a certificate issued under these schemes may be used for certifications under the EUCS scheme whereby the  CSP uses the certificate as assurance documentation for subservice organizations until its period of validity, if  evaluation work confirms that the subservice meets all requirements of the EUCS scheme.  ENISA may establish associated guidance as to support the conditions related to these possibilities. This guidance  shall be established in cooperation with the ECCG.  Based on the recommendations established by this Chapter, the European Commission and EU Member States may  consider to establish a date of one (1) year after the implementing act has been adopted pursuant to Article 49(7) for  existing schemes to cease producing effect.  14 In most cases, the requirements that have not been included are related to aspects beyond security, to aspects that are not relevant in a cybersecurity  certification scheme, for instance related to procurement, or to aspects that are covered differently in the EUCS scheme.  15 To satisfy market or regulatory requirements.  https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/prestataires-de-service-dinformatique-en-nuage-secnumcloud/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/prestataires-de-service-dinformatique-en-nuage-secnumcloud/ https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Kriterienkatalog/Kriterienkatalog_node.html https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/DigitaleGesellschaft/CloudComputing/Kriterienkatalog/Kriterienkatalog_node.html https://www.zeker-online.nl/  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  58  Some of these schemes may continue to run conformity assessment activities covering the same type or category of  ICT services, security requirements, evaluation criteria and methods and go beyond the scope of the EUCS scheme in  terms of assurance levels or requirements.  Further to these National schemes, no international schemes have been identified that cover the same services,  security requirements, evaluation criteria and methods.  RATIONALE  Additional information from the EUCSA  Article 57 provides additional information regarding National cybersecurity schemes and certificates:  1.  Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, national cybersecurity certification schemes, and the related  procedures for the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that are covered by a European cybersecurity  certification scheme shall cease to produce effects from the date established in the implementing act adopted  pursuant to Article 49(7). National cybersecurity certification schemes and the related procedures for the ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes that are not covered by a European cybersecurity certification  scheme shall continue to exist.  2.  Member States shall not introduce new national cybersecurity certification schemes for ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes already covered by a European cybersecurity certification scheme that is in force.  🙧  🙥  We acknowledge in this chapter that there were pre-existing schemes in Europe; these schemes were very different in  nature, in some cases not even issuing any kind of declaration (like Germany’s C5). Nevertheless, the companies who  went through a conformity assessment using one of these schemes have been gathering evidence, which led to an  analysis by a CAB, and some of this information may be relevant for EUCS conformity assessments.  Out of the three reuse hypotheses included, the first one (transformation of a certificate) is the least likely to be used,  because the differences are quite significant. The reuse of evidence and of evaluation results, though, could lead to  significant optimizations of the evaluation process. Finally, the use of previously issued documentation (certificates,  reports) as a basis for composition may allow smaller vendors, who rely on someone else’s infrastructure to get started  earlier with their certification.  Regarding the details of such reuse, we are following the path set by the EUCC scheme by allowing these details to be  provided later, in a guidance issued by ENISA and elaborated with the Member States through the ECCG.  We have also proposed to delay the issuance of certificates through the scheme for one year, giving the community  enough time to develop the required guidance. This is covered in greater details in Chapter 25 (Further  Recommendations).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  59  17. CERTIFICATE FORMAT  Foreword for Reviewers  This chapter is still work in progress.  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (p) the content and the format of the European cybersecurity certificates and the EU statements of  conformity to be issued;  🙧  🙥  RATIONALE  A proposal for the Certification Report format is included in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements). A  proposed format for the certificate itself will be added later.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  60  18. AVAILABILITY OF  INFORMATION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (q) the period of the availability of the EU statement of conformity, technical documentation, and all other  relevant information to be made available by the manufacturer or provider of ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes;  🙧  🙥  Each CSP shall maintain a publication system for the information to be made available to the public, in accordance  with the procedures described in Chapter 23 (Supplementary Information) for the Supplementary cybersecurity  information.  All information shall be available for a period of at least seven (7) years after the expiration or withdrawal of the  certificate.  In case a later expiration date of the certificate is attributed in accordance with the activities described under  Chapter 12 (Certificate Management), it shall be taken into account for the calculation of the availability period of the  information, with the same rule as previously stated.  Available information shall be updated with the new or revised information related to the activities performed under  Chapter 12 (Certificate Management).  Records of information made available to the CAB for the conformity assessment process shall be stored securely, and  made available on its request to the CAB or the NCCA (according to Article 58.8(a) of the EUCSA) up to five years  after expiration of the certification, in line with the duration established under Chapter 15 (Record Retention). These  records shall include all documentation and evidence made available to the CAB during the conformity assessment,  including those that were only made available in a restricted manner, for a limited time or only on the CSP’s premises.  Over the period of validity of a certificate, some of the information associated to the cloud service may be deprecated  and replaced by new information, and the need to maintain available information on the cloud service only relates to  the valid and up-to-date information. The deprecated information shall still be archived for the duration of the related  certificate when the information was deprecated plus seven (7) years.  RATIONALE  The period of retention for CSPs shall not be shorter than the retention of records by the CAB that is of seven (7) years  after the end of validity period of the certificate. This applies in particular to the information made available in a  restricted manner to the CAB, which is retained under the sole responsibility of the CSP, whereas the CAB only  maintains a list of the records made available).  It is to be noted that CSPs may however have to extend this period, in order to comply with other regulations that state  a different period of availability of documentation, up to ten (10) years.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  61  19. CERTIFICATE VALIDITY  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (r) maximum period of validity of European cybersecurity certificates issued under the scheme;  🙧  🙥  The maximum period of validity of the certificates shall be three (3) years. In order to maintain the validity of the  certificate for its full period of validity, the CSP shall follow the processes defined in in Chapter 12 (Certificate  Management), and the certified cloud service shall be subject to a periodic conformity assessment or to a renewal  conformity assessment at most one (1) year after the previous initial, periodic, or renewal conformity assessment.  Under certain conditions, and following the processes defined in Chapter 12 (Certificate Management), a CAB may  continue a certificate with an extended validity period beyond the initial three (3) years.  RATIONALE  According to the large variety of cloud services that can be certified under this scheme, to their and evolution (often  with frequent updates), to the various levels of assurance that can be achieved and the associated effort to generate  assurance that the scheme’s requirements are fulfilled, an average maximum of three (3) years was selected for the  general case.  Since this is a maximum, it remains possible to issue a certificate for a shorter period of time, in particular if the CAB  believes that issuing a certificate for three (3) years would lead to potential risks.  The chapter also defines the 1-year limit between periodic assessments. This limit applies to all levels, but the nature  of the activities to be performed depends on the level.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  62  20. DISCLOSURE POLICY  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (s) disclosure policy for European cybersecurity certificates issued, amended or withdrawn under the  scheme;  🙧  🙥  The certificates shall be disclosed by ENISA, with the related certification report and any relevant information as  requested by other chapters of this document, in a dedicated website on European cybersecurity certification schemes,  in accordance with Article 50.1 of the CSA.  The certificates shall be disclosed with their applicable status, as decided through the application of the requirements  established by Chapter 12 (Certificate Management) and Chapter 13 (Non-Compliance).  The certificates may also be disclosed by the NCCAs and the issuing CABs on their websites. Any change to the  status of a certificate shall be reported to the NCCA and to ENISA.  Amendments and withdrawals of certificates resulting from maintenance activities shall as well be published, in a way  that users of certificates can identify which versions of a certified cloud service are certified (where applicable) and  which relevant information shall apply (such as guidance).  ENISA shall establish in cooperation with the ECCG the conditions and/or guidance for the delivery and for the  publication in due time of certificates and their updates, and associated relevant information, and shall make them  publicly available on its website dedicated to cybersecurity certification.  Such information on the website on European cybersecurity certification schemes shall be available in English  language. It shall be available at least for the entire period of validity of the certificate.  The certificates may be complemented with additional information, such as a QR-code providing a direct link to the  corresponding certificate and related information, as to offer a better user experience and to publicise the certificates.  ENISA may therefore establish a procedure for the generation of a QR-code: such procedure may imply that CABs,  ahead of the release of a certificate, request from ENISA the generation of the QR-code to be applied on the certificate  and provided to the CSPs for their commercial and technical documents.  CSPs may use certificates published on ENISA’s website for commercial purposes, but they shall not modify the  certificate, and in particular, they shall always include a link to the original certificate on ENISA’s website to allow  customers to check the current status of the certificate. Only cloud services with a valid certificate shall be promoted as  certified cloud services by their relevant CSP, or users of these services.  If a certificate is suspended, the information published on ENISA’s website shall include the date of the end of the  suspension period, a reason for the suspension, as well as recommendations for the users of the certificate.  Once a certificate has expired or has been withdrawn, ENISA shall move it to a dedicated archive part of the website,  where it shall remain available for at least (5) years. CSPs shall not refer to such expired or withdrawn certificates in  their commercial information, and any access to the expired or withdrawn certificate through its initial URL or QR-code  shall lead to the prominent display of the current status of the certificate.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  63  RATIONALE  ENISA will publish the certificates with appropriate relevant information attached. To manage accurate and up to date  dataflows, ENISA will establish conditions and/or guidance for the delivery and publication of information.  In accordance with Chapter 17 (Certificate Format), both certificates and associated certification reports, as well as  relevant information for the secure configuration and usage of the certified cloud service (guidance) shall be made  available to the users (and potential users) of certificates. Amendments to certificate will also need to contain the same  type of information as the issuance of certificates, including guidance, and users shall be given an easy access to the  status of the certificates when using ENISA dedicated Website.  As to offer an easy access to the Supplementary cybersecurity information defined by Article 55, a validated link to that  information will be made available into the certificate.  ENISA shall be informed without undue delay of the evolution of the certificates, be it an amendment or a withdrawal,  in line with the requirements of relevant Chapters of this scheme and Recital 93 of the CSA.  As to offer the necessary flexibility and enforcing character of the conditions for presentation of the information to  ENISA, and for its publication, ENISA will establish generic conditions and/or guidance.  The generic conditions and/or guidance should make sure information is accurate and up to date as the information  provided by ENISA could act as a single point of reference. It should define what information is to be transmitted to  ENISA and within what reasonable timeframe. According to principles of transparency and openness, the outlines of  these conditions/guidance should be made public on the ENISA Website.  As to promote valid certificates, certificates that have expired will be archived and made available on a different  webpage than the valid ones.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  64  21. MUTUAL RECOGNITION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (t) conditions for the mutual recognition of certification schemes with third countries;  🙧  🙥  The mutual recognition of certification schemes with third countries shall be supported by the establishment of a  Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) between the participants.  This MRA may include the following information:   participants to the MRA;   purpose and spirit of the Agreement;   membership;   scope;   exceptions;   definitions;   conditions for recognition of certificates;   peer assessments;   publications;   sharing of Information;   acceptance of new participants and compliant authorities or bodies;   administration of this Agreement;   disagreements;   costs of this Agreement;   revision;   duration;   voluntary termination of participation;   commencement and continuation;   effect of this Agreement.  Conditions for recognition of certificates by participants to such an Agreement shall include at a minimum the following  conditions:   the participants shall commit themselves to recognise applicable conformant certificates by any accepted  Participant;   acceptance of participants shall confirm that the evaluation and certification processes have been carried out in a  duly professional manner:  o on the basis of commonly accepted ICT security evaluation criteria;  o using commonly accepted ICT security evaluation methods;  o in the context of an evaluation and certification scheme managed by a compliant certification body in the  accepted participant's country;  o the conformant certificates and certification reports issued satisfy the objectives of this Agreement;   certificates which meet all these conditions shall be termed as conformant certificates for the purposes of this  Agreement;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  65   ICT security evaluation criteria are to be those laid down in Chapter 8 (Evaluation Methods and Criteria) of this  document;   minimum requirements for Certification Reports are laid down in Annex 13 to this document;   the scheme of the participants or to which the participants adhere shall be organised with a proper National  Authority and conformity assessment bodies (CABs), in accordance with the following requirements:  o the National Authority supervises the certification activities, notifies and authorises where applicable CABs,  and reports any vulnerability of certified cloud services to the NCCAs of the EU participants;  o the CAB has been accredited in its respective country by a recognised Accreditation Body in accordance with  ISO/IEC 17065 and has been authorised where necessary by the National Authority;  o the CAB is accepted as compliant by the Participants through a peer assessment mechanism installed for the  MRA;  o the CAB has been where necessary subject to an assessment by the National Authority in order to confirm its  competence to perform evaluations, in accordance with Chapter 7 (Specific requirements applicable to a  CAB) of this document;   in order to assist the consistent application of the criteria and methods between evaluation and certification  schemes, the participants plan to work towards a uniform interpretation of the currently applicable criteria and  methods and commit to accept the supporting documents that results from this work. In pursuit of this goal, the  participants also plan to conduct regular exchanges of information on interpretations and discussions necessary to  resolve differences of interpretation;   in further aid to the goal of consistent, credible and competent application of the criteria and methods, the  certification bodies shall undertake the responsibility for the monitoring of all evaluations in progress within the  MRA at an appropriate level, and carrying out other procedures to ensure that all CABs:  o perform evaluations impartially;  o apply the criteria and methods correctly and consistently;  o have and maintain the required technical competencies;  o adequately protect the confidentiality of sensitive or protected information.  The MRA may include a limitation of the assurance level of the certificates subject to recognition.  CAB(s) of the participants of such an Agreement that issue(s) certificates at the equivalent assurance level ‘high’ of the  CSA shall be subject to peer assessments in line with the procedure set up in this scheme (Annex H:, Peer  assessment).  The procedure may be adapted and simplified for the CABs that issue certificates at the equivalent assurance levels  ‘basic’ or ‘substantial’ of the CSA as to benefit from the international Accreditation system, and shall at least consist of  the following activities by the peer assessment team regarding review of the:   documentation associated to 2 certification projects of the ‘substantial’ assurance level;   procedures associated to the security of information.  RATIONALE  Additional input from the EUCSA  The context for mutual recognition is provided in the EUCA recitals:  (104) In order to further facilitate trade, and recognising that ICT supply chains are global, mutual recognition  agreements concerning European cybersecurity certificates may be concluded by the Union in accordance with  Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Commission, taking into  account the advice from ENISA and the European Cybersecurity Certification Group, may recommend the  opening of relevant negotiations. Each European cybersecurity certification scheme should provide specific  conditions for such mutual recognition agreements with third countries.  🙧  🙥  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  66  The text is here strongly inspired from the EUCC scheme, around which some MRAs already exist. In the context of  the EUCS scheme, a number of parameters, including the evaluation criteria and methods, are specific to the scheme;  mutual recognition is therefore likely to be possible only with third countries that will operate a scheme locally that use  the criteria and methods defined in the EUCS scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  67  22. PEER ASSESSMENT  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  Article 54. A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements:  (u) where applicable, rules concerning any peer assessment mechanism established by the scheme for the  authorities or bodies issuing European cybersecurity certificates for assurance level ‘high’ pursuant to Article  56(6). Such mechanism shall be without prejudice to the peer review provided for in Article 59;  🙧  🙥  The EUCS scheme requires that each authority16 or body issuing certificates at the assurance level High undergo a  peer assessment at periodic intervals.  While every authority or body issuing certificates for assurance level ‘high’ pursuant to Article 56.6 of the EUCSA,  including their subcontractors, shall operate under its own responsibility, a peer assessment shall be established for  those issuing EUCS certificates at level High to:   assess that they work in a harmonised way and produce the same quality of certificates;   allow the reuse of certificates for composite service certification, as offered by Chapter 3 (Purpose of the scheme),  including the reuse of a certified cloud service’s evaluation results when used as base component in a composite  service;   identify any potential strength that result out of their daily work and that may benefit to others;   identify any potential weakness that result out of their daily work and that shall to be considered for improvement  by the peer assessed CAB;   find a harmonised way to handle nonconformities and vulnerabilities and exchange best practices regarding the  handling of complaints.  Note: The peer assessment is not intended to interfere with or make judgement to the activities performed by the  NCCA, as this is the subject of the peer review process as required by Article 59 of EUCSA. Nor shall it interfere with  or make judgement to the activities performed by the National Accreditation Body (NAB).  In order to allow timely feedback with respect to questions of the national aspects of the scheme that are handled by  the NCCA, a representative of the NCCA of the assessed CAB shall participate to the peer assessment.  The peer assessment of each CAB issuing certificates of assurance level ‘high’ shall take place on a regular basis,  with a periodic interval that shall not exceed five (5) years.  The ECCG17  shall establish and maintain a planning of peer assessments ensuring that this periodicity is respected,  and take into consideration the level of priority that may be given to the peer assessment of a CAB issuing certificates  at the assurance level ‘high’ in case of alleged non-compliance of this CAB, and in case of CBs with recent activity  engaged in certifications for the first time or after a long lasting break (more than two years).  16 From the perspective of peer assessment, an authority that is issuing certificates as the assurance level high should be considered as a CAB, and  participate in the same way to peer assessment.  17 The ECCG may establish a dedicated subgroup to handle peer assessments, based on the organisation to be installed for the maintenance of the  EUCS scheme (see Chapter 25, Further Recommendations).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  68  In the case of Article 56.6.(a) of the EUCSA, both the CAB issuing the certificates and the NCCA proceeding to the  prior approval for each individual certificate shall be subject to the peer assessment. This shall include the procedure  established by of the NCCA for prior approval for each individual certificate.  In the case of Article 56.6.(b) of the CSA, both the CAB issuing the certificates and the NCCA shall be subject to the  peer assessment. This shall include the general delegation requirements defined by the NCCA.  Peer assessments shall follow the procedure established in Annex H: (Peer assessment). Unless duly justified, peer  assessments shall be performed on site for the peer assessed CAB and, where applicable, for a selected set of its  subcontractors.  The peer assessment team may decide to reuse results of previous peer assessments of the assessed authority or  body covering part of the scope, under the following conditions:   such results shall be not older than five (5) years;   where previous peer assessments of the peer assessed CAB were performed under a different scheme, these  shall be provided with the description of the peer assessment procedures in place for that different scheme;   the peer assessment report shall clearly indicate which parts were reused without further assessment, and which  parts were reused with additional assessment;  The peer assessment team shall report their findings to the ECCG in a peer assessment report, with an indication of  the severity of any shortcomings. The peer assessment report shall include where necessary guidelines or  recommendations on actions or measures to be taken by the peer assessed CAB, as well as the measures proposed  by the peer assessed CAB to handle the findings.  When establishing measures to handle the findings, the peer assessed CAB may ask for the support of the peer  assessment team. These measures shall be transmitted to the ECCG, indicating how they intend to correct the  findings, within the peer assessment report. Where necessary, the ECCG may inform the relevant:   NCCA of the peer assessed CAB for its consideration of the potential impact of the remaining findings on the  certificates issued by the peer assessed CAB, or any authorisation or notification related to the peer assessed  CAB and associated subcontractors;   National Accreditation Body (NAB) of the peer assessed CAB for its consideration of the potential impact of the  remaining findings on the accreditation of the peer assessed CAB and associated subcontractors;  and may ask for their conclusions.  The peer assessed CAB and related NCCA shall have the opportunity to address with the ECCG any shortcomings  and recommendations identified in the report, before the results of the peer assessment are published by ENISA. Also,  the NAB shall have the opportunity to address any shortcomings and recommendations in case any have been brought  up to the NAB before the results are published.  ENISA may participate in the peer assessments.  CABs shall inform applicants to certification at the assurance level High of the EUCS scheme that their certification  projects may be subject to the peer assessment installed by this scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  69  RATIONALE  Additional input from the EUCSA  Additional information about peer assessment is provided in the EUCA recitals:  (100) Without prejudice to the general peer review system to be put in place across all national cybersecurity  certification authorities within the European cybersecurity certification framework, certain European  cybersecurity certification schemes may include a peer-assessment mechanism for the bodies that issue  European cybersecurity certificates for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes with an assurance level  ‘high’ under such schemes. The ECCG should support the implementation of such peer-assessment  mechanisms. The peer assessments should assess in particular whether the bodies concerned carry out their  tasks in a harmonised way, and may include appeal mechanisms. The results of the peer assessments should  be made publicly available. The bodies concerned may adopt appropriate measures to adapt their practices and  expertise accordingly.  🙧  🙥  In addition to the peer review between NCCAs, introduced in Article 59 of the EUCSA, which is outside of the scope of  this scheme, a peer assessment may be defined for each scheme, with scheme specific objectives defined here for the  EUCC scheme in the first part of this Chapter, and requirements.  This approach guarantees the high quality of evaluation activities as required for a ‘high’ level of security assurance  and the harmonisation of the evaluation methods between different CAB, therefore allowing more objective results and  to proceed to composite cloud service certifications within different CABs.  It is essential that a planning is established for such activities, including reassessments, and necessary priorities  associated to newcomers to certification, or those facing issues with certification.  The procedure in Annex H: (Peer assessment) takes into consideration the possibility to reuse results from other peer  assessment mechanisms.  The results of the peer assessment will be made publicly available on the ENISA website dedicated to cybersecurity  certification, as recommended by Recital 100 of the CSA.  It is considered of importance that where applicable, the assessed body or authority presents the effective measures to  adapt their practices and expertise accordingly to the ECCG, in order to reinsure other participants to the scheme of  the quality of the certificate it issues.  In cases where the quality of the certificates is considered by the ECCG not in line with the requirements of this  scheme, the ECCG may inform and consult the NCCA and the National Accreditation Body of the assessed body or  authority for their conclusions on the impacts on its authorisation and accreditation.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  70  23. SUPPLEMENTARY  INFORMATION  ARTICLE 54 REFERENCE  A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the following elements  (v) format and procedures to be followed by manufacturers or providers of ICT products, ICT services or ICT  processes in supplying and updating the supplementary cybersecurity information in accordance with Article 55.  🙧  🙥  All Supplementary cybersecurity information defined in Article 55 of the EUCSA shall be provided during conformity  assessment by CSPs to the CAB in the course of the conformity assessment.  In particular, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 17 (Certificate Format), a link to the website and relevant  pages where that information is made available shall be provided to be integrated into the certificate. Once all other  requirements for certification have been fulfilled, the issuing body shall request the CSP to provide the URL (link) so  that this can be processed before the certificate can be uploaded to the ENISA Website for certification.  CSPs shall make Supplementary cybersecurity information in accordance with Article 55 of the EUCSA publicly  available on their websites.  The information shall be available in electronic form and in English language and shall remain available at least until  the expiration or withdrawal of the corresponding European cybersecurity certificate. It shall be updated in accordance  with the requirements of Chapter 12 (Certificate Management).  In addition, “guidance and recommendations18 to assist end users with the secure configuration, installation,  deployment, operation and maintenance of the cloud services”, as defined by Article 55.1.(a), shall be updated as  required to reflect the evolution of the cloud service, in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 12 (Certificate  Management).  18 Within the shared responsibility model, these recommendations only cover the part for which the CSC is responsible. Recommendations for activities  under the responsibility of the CSP do not need to be made publicly available.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  71  RATIONALE  Additional input from the EUCSA  Article 55 defines the Supplementary cybersecurity information for certified ICT products, ICT services and ICT  processes:  1.  The manufacturer or provider of certified ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes or of ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes for which an EU statement of conformity has been issued shall make publicly  available the following supplementary cybersecurity information:  (a) guidance and recommendations to assist end users with the secure configuration, installation,  deployment, operation and maintenance of the ICT products or ICT services;  (b) the period during which security support will be offered to end users, in particular as regards the  availability of cybersecurity related updates;  (c) contact information of the manufacturer or provider and accepted methods for receiving vulnerability  information from end users and security researchers;  (d) a reference to online repositories listing publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to the ICT product, ICT  service or ICT process and to any relevant cybersecurity advisories.  2.  The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall be available in electronic form and shall remain available  and be updated as necessary at least until the expiry of the corresponding European cybersecurity certificate or  EU statement of conformity.  🙧  🙥  In addition to the public availability of the information, as requested by Article 55, the need for having access to all or  part of it during certification may be requested, such as to test that the information complies with the requirements of  the scheme. The CSP should have the URL up and running before the certificate is issued or updated, and provisioned  with the information provided for the conformity assessment. This specific need to review part of Supplementary  cybersecurity information during the conformity assessment phase shall however only occur where the relevant  Chapters of this scheme establish a requirement to do so.  For an easy and harmonised access of users of certificates to the webpages where the information will be accessible  on the Websites of CSPs, the associated link will have to be provided in the certificate.  The conditions to deliver the Supplementary cybersecurity information should be part of a more detailed disclosure  policy that ENISA will establish in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 20 (Disclosure Policy).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  72  24. ADDITIONAL TOPICS  Foreword for Reviewers  This chapter introduces a few topics that are not addressed in Article 54, but may still be relevant for the present  scheme. The topics do not all have the same level of maturity:  The two first ones (Security Profiles and Force Majeure) are high-level proposals that need to be further detailed  and instantiated in the scheme, whereas the two last ones (Security of Information and Composition) are more  mature, and are ready to be integrated in the scheme.  24.1 SECURITY PROFILES  PROPOSAL  Cloud services are likely to be used in ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that will themselves be subject to  certification in the context of another conformity assessment scheme, and in particular of another European  cybersecurity certification scheme. Some of these conformity assessment schemes may have specific requirements,  for instance related to an industry vertical.  In order to simplify the use of certificates issued in the EUCS scheme in other schemes, it is therefore important to  support the definition of such specific vertical requirements, and to allow cloud services to take these requirements into  consideration in their certification.  Such specific requirements shall be defined in a Security Profile, following some principles:   A security profile shall not remove or weaken any requirement defined in the EUCS scheme.   A security profile shall not modify the assessment methodology or the assessment methods defined in the EUCS  scheme.   A security profile shall follow the processes defined in the scheme, and shall produce the same deliverables.   A security profile shall specify the EUCS assurance level that it targets.   A security profile may define new security controls, or may add new requirements to an existing security control,  as long as these requirements do not weaken existing EUCS requirements.   A security profile may mandate a higher frequency of periodic assessments.   A security profile may define a dedicated section in the document templates defined in the EUCS scheme.  In order to be recognized in the context of EUCS, Security Profiles shall be published on ENISA’s Website, after  approval from the ECCG.  A CSP may choose to claim conformity to the requirements of one or several security profiles in addition to the core  requirements of the scheme. If this claim is confirmed by the conformity assessment, then the CSP may list the  security profile(s) in the certificate documentation.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  73  24.2 FORCE MAJEURE  PROPOSAL  In case of force majeure, a NCCA may take temporary measures to ensure the continuity of certification, by extending  the timelines related to the periodic and renewal assessments, by relaxing requirements on the execution of conformity  assessment activities, and if necessary, by extending the validity of certificates.  The NCCA shall inform ENISA about the extension and provide transparency on reasons and the duration of  extension, and ENISA shall make the information available on their website.  The NCCA shall inform the ECCG about the temporary measures, and if several NCCAs are affected by the same  force majeure event, they shall coordinate to ensure that they apply equivalent temporary measures.  24.3 SECURITY OF INFORMATION  PROBLEM STATEMENT  Annex to the EUCSA,  item 16: The conformity assessment body and its staff, its committees, its subsidiaries, its  subcontractors, and any associated body or the staff of external bodies of a conformity assessment body shall  maintain confidentiality and observe professional secrecy with regard to all information obtained in carrying out their  conformity assessment tasks under this Regulation or pursuant to any provision of national law giving effect to this  Regulation, except where disclosure is required by Union or Member State law to which such persons are subject, and  except in relation to the competent authorities of the Member States in which its activities are carried out. Intellectual  property rights shall be protected. The conformity assessment body shall have documented procedures in place in  respect of the requirements of this point.  RECOMMENDATION  Unless otherwise provided for in this scheme and without prejudice to existing national provisions and practices in the  Member States on confidentiality, all parties19 involved in the application of this Scheme shall maintain confidentiality  and observe professional secrecy with regard to all information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks in order to  protect the following:  a) personal data, in accordance with GDPR20;  b) commercially sensitive and confidential information and trade secrets of a natural or legal person, including  intellectual property rights, during the certification lifecycle of the cloud service and up to the end of the  indicated retention time for all certification information, unless disclosure is necessary in the public interest, or  subject to court orders;  c) exchange of information necessary for the effective implementation of this scheme, in particular for the  purpose of peer reviews, peer assessments or audits, effective collaboration between the involved authorities  and bodies, the handling of publicly unknown and subsequently detected vulnerabilities in the process of, or  after certification, and the handling of complaints.  Without prejudice to previous paragraph, information exchanged on a confidential basis between competent authorities  and between competent authorities and the Commission shall not be disclosed to the public without the prior  agreement of the originating authority.  All information received from the CABs or their subcontractors or the CSPs shall only be used for the purpose of the  certification and deemed confidential by the NCCAs – unless a different agreement is reached between the parties or  unless an information flow is required by a specific regulation of the scheme.  19 Including at least the CAB, the NCCA, and their staff, their committees, their subsidiaries, their subcontractors, and any associated body or the staff of  external bodies of the CAB or the NCCA.  20 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  74  All parties involved in the application of this Scheme shall implement security measures in order to ensure the  confidentiality of the information provided during the certification process. ENISA may provide guidance on how to  insure the security of information based on the workflows associated with the activities described in the EUCS scheme.  RATIONALE  Security of information is key in cybersecurity related activities. All cybersecurity certification related activities fall into  the latter.  Information provided by the applicant to the CAB for certification might be sensitive, especially as, the higher the  evaluation level, the deeper the evaluator shall go into the analysis of the cloud service and related life-cycle, based on  information details that may comprise commercially confidential information and trade secrets, including intellectual  property rights.  Information developed by cybersecurity certification activities, such as Assurance Reports, which are associated to  vulnerabilities assessment, handling and release, will also contain information sensitive parts that, when poorly  protected, may obviously endanger the users of associated cloud services, even when these cloud services are  certified.  Therefore, the obligations of the different actors of the scheme to insure the security of information shall be established  and take into consideration the requirements for CSPs and developers to comply with Article 55 of the EUCSA, and the  necessary respect of Freedom of Information policies and legal frameworks, Access to Information Acts, and/or any  other similar national, European and international policies and regulations by any individuals or entities.  24.4 COMPOSITION  PROBLEM STATEMENT  The composition of certificates is not mentioned explicitly in the EUCSA, but it is a common way of building complex  certified products or services by leveraging previously certified products and services. In the context of the EUCS  scheme, the objective is twofold:   Allow certified cloud services to be certified along a supply chain.   Reduce the costs of certifying a cloud service that relies on previously certified products and services by allowing  the reuse of evidence and of audit results.  The use of composition leads to specific issues related to the evaluation of composed cloud services, and also to the  maintenance of the certification for composed cloud services, relatively to the maintenance of the certification of their  components.  RECOMMENDATION  Cloud services are layered systems, in which infrastructure and platform capabilities from a service are often used as a  basis for other services. There may also be some dependencies between an application capability and another  service. These services used by a CSP in the provision of its own cloud service are referred to as sub-services,  supplied by sub-service providers or organizations. The general rules for the consideration of such sub-service  providers in the assessment of a cloud service is covered extensively in Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment  of cloud services). In addition, CSPs need to fulfil specific requirements related to their service providers and suppliers  that are defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  Composition is a particular case, in which the sub-service (then called a base service) is itself a cloud service that has  been certified in the EUCS scheme. In such a case the cloud service (or dependent service) relying on the base  service can expect the assessment of the requirements related to the base service to be greatly simplified, because  they use the same security framework, and because the rules of the scheme (and in particular those related to the  CABs) are trusted.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  75  In order to be eligible for composition, the base cloud service shall satisfy some specific requirements, defined in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services), which will allow the assessment of dependent  cloud services to be further simplified. These specific requirements consist in defining precisely, in terms of specific  EUCS security objectives and requirements, how security responsibilities are split between the base service and the  dependent service:   The base cloud service shall provide a description of their contribution to the EUCS requirement fulfilment of their  dependent services, properly justified through references to their own controls; and   The base service shall provide a list of actionable requirements on Complementary Customer Controls (CCCs,  based on the EUCS objectives and requirements) that define the requirements to be fulfilled by the dependent  cloud service in order for the base service to fulfil the requirements for EUCS certification at the chosen assurance  level.  These two conditions are defined as requirements for base services in Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements  for Cloud Services). Therefore, they are in the scope of the conformity assessment for the base service.  This information can then be used by the CSP of the dependent service in several ways:   During the design phase, the CSP can use the information about the base service to drive design decisions for its  dependent service;   When building documentation for its certification, the description of the base service’s contribution and of its CCCs  can be used directly by the CSP of the dependent service, who will simply need to document is its implementation  of the CCCs; and   The CAB only needs to verify that this information has not been modified and if necessary that a subset has been  properly selected, and will focus on verifying that the CCCs are fulfilled by the dependent service.  In addition, there are a few simple rules that must be followed:   In order to apply composition, the base service shall be certified at a level equal or greater than the level targeted  by the dependent service;   In order to apply composition fully, the base service shall claim compliance to the security profiles that the  dependent service claims compliance to. If the dependent service claims compliance to a security profile that is  not claimed by the base service, then this security profile is excluded from the composition, and a classical  process shall be used if necessary to demonstrate that the base service satisfies as a subservice the expectations  of the dependent service relative to that security profile;   The dependent service shall add to the requirements to be fulfilled the requirements from the base service’s  CCCs.   In its description of its contribution of the base service to the fulfilment of the scheme’s requirements, the  dependent service shall indicate when the description is the one provided by the base service in its  documentation.  Finally, note that:   A dependent service may use composition with more than one base services;   Although composition cannot only be applied to base services that have been certified through the EUCS scheme,  ENISA will issue with the support of ECCG some guidance about a similar approach for base services that have  been assessed through existing National schemes listed in Chapter 16 (Related Schemes), in order to facilitate  the transition from National schemes to the EUCS scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  76  25. FURTHER  RECOMMENDATIONS  Foreword for Reviewers  The recommendations in this chapter are not intended to be included in the scheme. They are related to the  lifecycle of the scheme, specifically measures to be considered between the formal adoption of the scheme and  the emission of the first certificates, and measures related to the maintenance of the scheme.  They nevertheless represent important topics that will need to be addressed in order for the scheme to be  successful. The scheme adoption topic, in particular, will be of paramount importance for this new scheme, and  requires our full attention.  25.1 SCHEME ADOPTION  25.1.1 Problem statement  25.1.1.1 EUCSA Reference  Article 57 1. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, national cybersecurity certification schemes, and the  related procedures for the ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that are covered by a European  cybersecurity certification scheme shall cease to produce effects from the date established in the implementing act  adopted pursuant to Article 49(7). National cybersecurity certification schemes and the related procedures for the ICT  products, ICT services and ICT processes that are not covered by a European cybersecurity certification scheme shall  continue to exist.  25.1.1.2 Additional information  The transition period is here considered as the period between the date of adoption of the implementing act adopted  pursuant to Article 49(7), and the date established into this implementing act when national schemes shall cease to  produce effect.  25.1.2 Recommendation  The EUCS scheme is the first scheme for cloud services at an international level, It will replace at least partly a few  existing national schemes, but it is mostly a new scheme that needs to be set up gradually across the European Union.  Prerequisites for scheme adoption  In order for relevant bodies in a Member State to start issuing certificates at the Basic and Substantial levels, the  following should happen:   existing and new CABs get accredited to ISO/IEC 17065, and their internal and external evaluation facilities get  accredited to relevant standards;   the NCCA notifies accredited CABs to the EC;   CSPs need to get acquainted with the various components of the scheme and update their processes to conform  to its requirements;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  77   CABs need to work with the NCCA to set up monitoring activities; and   the NCCA sets up the market surveillance process.  In order for the relevant bodies in a Member State to start issuing certificates at level High, the following should also  happen:   the NCCA establishes how High certificates will be issued and take the relevant action (get its CAB-NCCA  accredited, and/or designate a CAB for general delegation, and/or organize a prior approval process of  certificates); and   existing and new CABs, including their internal or external evaluation facilities get authorized by the NCCA before  notification to the EC;  In addition, before relevant bodies in any Member State can start issuing certificates, the following should happen at  European level:   a maintenance organization is put in place for the EUCS scheme, to further develop the scheme and to support  any interpretation and harmonisation question related to the adoption of the new scheme.  The AHWG recommends an adoption period of one (1) year between the adoption of the scheme and the issuance of  the first certificate as being technically acceptable.  Scheme adoption and transition period  ENISA may establish associated rules for adopting the scheme as to support the conditions for the scheme to operate.  These rules shall be established in cooperation with the ECCG.  For Member States who operate a national scheme for which a transition to the EUCS scheme is required, the  transition also needs to be organized to ensure that, after a period of time, only EUCS certificates can be issued, The  transition period should allow for:   termination of current certification projects under the existing schemes, or their easy conversion into EUCS  projects;   smooth transfer of certificates that require maintenance in the long run, therefore under for the EUCS scheme, or  reuse for composite evaluations and certifications under the EUCS scheme.  The guiding principles for the transitions are as follows:   Certificates can be issued by the National scheme at most until the end of the transition period.   Certificates issued by the National scheme remain valid until the end of their validity period, which cannot be  extended.   The transition to the European scheme is accelerated by defining rules about the reuse of evidence and  evaluation results previously used toward the issuance of a National certificate  These rules will be complemented with relevant guidance at the beginning of the transition period, in particular  regarding the potential reuse of certificates, evaluation results, and evidence from the national schemes. Such  certificates, evaluation results and evidence issued on a given cloud service may be used during the conformity  assessment of the same cloud service, or during the conformity assessment of another cloud service for which that  cloud service is a subservice.  The AHWG recommends a transition period of one (1) year after the issuance of the first certificates as being  technically acceptable.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  78  25.2 SCHEME MAINTENANCE  25.2.1 Problem statement  25.2.1.1 EUCSA Reference  Article 62.4 – The ECCG shall have the following tasks:  e) to adopt opinions addressed to the Commission relating to the maintenance and review of existing European  cybersecurity certifications schemes.  25.2.2 Recommendation  The AHWG recommends the following for the maintenance of the EUCS scheme.  The ECCG should mandate groups of experts involving NCCAs, CABs and associated auditors, CSPs and CSCs to:   improve the security controls and associated requirements;   improve the assessment methodology and associated documents;   provide guidance to CABs and CSPs about the prerequisites and operation of the scheme.  The expert groups should focus on methodology harmonization of evaluation activities, analysis of new technologies  and vulnerability classes, and propose new or revised supporting documents.  As an alternative, some of the annexes to the scheme, and in particular Annex A: (Security Objectives and  requirements for Cloud Services), may be considered for submission to a European Standards Developing  Organization (SDO) as a basis for a future European standard, to be referenced in future versions of the EUCS  scheme.  The ECCG should define adequate terms of reference for these expert groups. ENISA should publish the list of  mandated expert groups and their associated mandates.

CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria  Foreword for Reviewers  The security controls were initially based on the proposed made by CSP-CERT. However, during and around the  fall plenary meeting, a number of issues were brought to our attention regarding these controls under  development, including concerns about complexity as well as consistency and clarity issues.  Due to the limited time remaining, the decision was taken to reorganize the security controls and to use the  structure and when applicable, the wording of the BSI’s C5:2020 criteria, which have the advantage of having  been used in practice for quite some time. The criteria have been reorganized into requirements, which have then  been assigned to assurance levels. Then, additional sources have been considered, in particular the  SecNumCloud scheme, but also relevant standards such as ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27017  There are a few known caveats in this content, including:   The focus has been on the definition of requirements, so the formulation of the objectives is not as  consistent as that of requirements.   Guidance is not included, except for elements from C5’s criteria and SecNumCloud’s requirements that  have been moved to guidance.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  82  PRINCIPLES  This Annex is an essential component of the scheme, as it defines the technical objectives and requirements that  CSPs need to fulfil in order to get a cloud service certified.  Abstraction level  Because this annex is intended to also be an annex to the implementing act for the scheme, it is important to keep a  rather high level of abstraction. The objective is here to define whenever possible the requirements in a technology-  neutral fashion, and also to avoid mentioning specific technical details which could become outdated very fast.  The requirements defined in this annex shall therefore be complemented by guidance, to be published by ENISA with  the support of the ECCG. The requirements in the guidance shall provide the scheme users with a reference way to  fulfil the requirements defined in the scheme, typically by providing additional details that describe the required  “currently accepted techniques” or “state-of-the-art”.  Most requirements in this annex are written using “shall”, whereas the guidance and a limited number of requirements  in this annex are written with “should”. The term “should” is used to indicate recognized means of fulfilling the  requirements of the EUCS scheme.  Organization  The requirements are grouped in 19 categories, and each category is divided in a number of themes. Each theme is  structured as follows:   An objective that the requirements aim at achieving.   Requirements to be met by the controls implemented in support of the certified cloud services, with each  requirement associated to an assurance level.   In some cases, an indication of guidance to be made available, typically when part of a requirement inherited from  an existing set of criteria or requirements has been moved to guidance, or when a key concept is expected to be  detailed in guidance.  There are many cross-references between requirements and themes. For instance, the ISP-02 theme, which defines  how policies and procedures are to be defined, is referenced many times.  Assurance levels  The requirements defined in the present Annex are labelled Basic, Substantial or High:   Requirements labelled Basic apply to all assurance levels.   Requirements labelled Substantial apply to levels Substantial and High, and they will in most cases be considered  as guidance for level Basic (i.e., the reference method to achieve the Basic requirements, which are often less  detailed).   Requirements labelled High only apply to level High.  Typically, the requirements corresponding to an objective are organized as follows:   Basic requirements define a baseline, often with limited details or constraints   Substantial requirements add to that baseline further details and constraints. Sometimes, there are a few specific  Substantial requirements.   High requirements add further constraints. Some are also related to continuous monitoring, or to additional testing  and review requirements, contributing to an increase in the depth of the audit.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  83  Continuous monitoring  The requirements related to continuous monitoring typically mention “automated monitoring” or “automatically monitor”  in their text. The intended meaning of “monitor automatically” is:  1. Gather data to analyse some aspects of the activity being monitored at discrete intervals at a sufficient  frequency;  2. Compare the gathered data to a reference or otherwise determine conformity to specified requirements in the  EUCS scheme;  3. Report deviations to subject matter experts who can analyse the deviations in a timely manner;  4. If the deviation indicates a nonconformity, then initiate a process for fixing the nonconformity; and  5. If the nonconformity is major, notify the CAB of the issue, analysis, and planned resolution.  These requirements stop short on requiring any notion of continuous auditing, because technologies have not reached  an adequate level of maturity. Nevertheless, the introduction of continuous auditing, at least for level High, remains a  mid- or long-term objective, and the introduction of automated monitoring requirement in at least some areas is a first  step in that direction, which can be met with the technology available today.  Further guidance will be provided about acceptable mechanisms and processes.

Guidance will explain that  automated testing will be acceptable at the Basic level.  OPS-19.2 The required qualifications will be further defined in guidance, and they should  include some kind of personal of  service certification  OPS-19.4 The idea is here that the CAB shall review the penetration testing plan and to identify nonconformities to be fixed  (i.e., tests that are missing and may need to be included and performed in the following years), following  procedures to be defined in guidance for auditors  OPS-19.5 The idea is also here to use the program to ensure that if there is an internal team, they use external providers to  ensure that their competencies remain adequate, and to learn new things.  OPS-19.7 At this level, the CSP needs to ask the question of the potential exploitation of the vulnerability in the past, by  determining potential symptoms of exploitation and searching for them in logs.

This organization is not necessarily permanent and may  be reconsidered.  The current proposal is built on the following hypotheses:   All CSPs are subject to the same requirements in order to get their cloud services certified, regardless of the  way in which their cloud services are implemented (e.g., a SaaS provider implementing a full stack vs. a SaaS  provider using a subservice provider’s infrastructure for the delivery of its own service).   The auditor is in charge of assessing the level of compliance and assurance for subservice providers based  solely on the information available, including assurance reports of various origins and evidence provided by  the CSP in their risk assessment of their subservice providers.  As we added more details, such as requirements for documents, these aspects have been the subject of  discussions until the last days before the release of this draft candidate scheme.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  160  B.1 INTRODUCTION  B.1.1 Definitions  Audit  In EUCS, the definition of an audit is taken from [ISO17000]:   A systematic, independent, documented process for obtaining records, statements of fact or other relevant  information and assessing them objectively to determine the extent to which specified requirements are fulfilled.  ISAE/ISA proposes another definition for the term:   A systematic process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding management assertions about  conformity with the predefined framework to ascertain the degree of correspondence between those assertions  and established criteria and [additional to ISO] communicating the results to interested users.  For the purpose of this annex, we will consider that the definitions are sufficiently close to be considered equivalent.  Reasonable assurance  A reasonable assurance engagement21 is defined in [ISAE3000] as:  An assurance engagement in which the practitioner22 reduces engagement risk to an acceptably low level in the  circumstances of the engagement as the basis for the practitioner’s conclusion. The practitioner’s conclusion is  expressed in a form that conveys the practitioner’s opinion on the outcome of the measurement or evaluation of the  underlying subject matter against criteria.  Reasonable assurance aims at reducing to an acceptably low level the risk of reaching an inappropriate conclusion  when the information provided on the subject matter (here, the description of the cloud service and the CSP’s  management claim) is materially misstated. Such risk is never reduced to nil and therefore, there can never be  absolute assurance.  The conclusion in a reasonable assurance engagement is framed in a positive sense: \"Based on the procedures  performed, in our opinion, the cloud service XYZ satisfies the requirements of the EUCS at level LLL.\"  Limited Assurance  A limited assurance engagement is defined in [ISAE3000] as:  An assurance engagement in which the practitioner reduces engagement risk to a level that is acceptable in the  circumstances of the engagement but where that risk is greater than for a reasonable assurance engagement as  the basis for expressing a conclusion in a form that conveys whether, based on the procedures performed and  evidence obtained, a matter(s) has come to the practitioner’s attention to cause the practitioner to believe the  subject matter information is materially misstated. The nature, timing, and extent of procedures performed in a  limited assurance engagement is limited compared with that necessary in a reasonable assurance engagement but  is planned to obtain a level of assurance that is, in the practitioner’s professional judgment, meaningful. To be  meaningful, the level of assurance obtained by the practitioner is likely to enhance the intended users’ confidence  about the subject matter information to a degree that is clearly more than inconsequential.  For a limited assurance engagement the auditor collects less evidence than for a reasonable assurance engagement  but sufficient for a negative form of expression of the auditor’s conclusion. The practitioner achieves this ordinarily by  performing different or fewer tests than those required for reasonable assurance or using smaller sample sizes for the  tests performed.  21 An audit performed in the context of the EUCS scheme is a kind of assurance engagement.  22 Auditor  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  161  In contrast with a reasonable assurance conclusion, the conclusion in a limited assurance engagement is accordingly  framed in a negative sense: \"Based on the procedures performed, nothing came to our attention to indicate that the  cloud service XYZ does not satisfy the requirements of the EUCS at level Basic.\"  Determination activities  In the conformity assessment of a cloud service, the following determination activities are essential.  Inquiry  Inquiry consists of seeking relevant information or representations of knowledgeable persons. Inquiries range from  formal written inquiries to interviews and informal oral inquiries.  Observation  Observation consists of looking at a process or procedure being performed by others, for example, the observation of  the performance of control activities. Observation provides evidence about the performance of a process or procedure,  but is limited to the point in time at which the observation takes place, and by the fact that the act of being observed  may affect how the process or procedure is performed. Observation is an appropriate way to obtain evidence if there is  no documentation of the operation of a control, like segregation of duties. Observation is also useful for physical  controls.  Inspection  Inspection is defined in [ISO17000] as the “examination of an object of conformity assessment and determination of its  conformity with detailed requirements or, on the basis of professional judgement, with general requirements”.  In the context of EUCS, inspection involves examining records or documents, whether internal or external, in paper  form, electronic form, or on other media, or a physical examination of evidence. Inspection of records and documents  provides evidence of varying degrees of reliability, depending on their nature and source and, in the case of internal  records and documents, on the implementation of the controls over their production. Inspection is often used to  determine whether manual controls are being performed. Evidence could include written explanations, check marks, or  other indications of follow-up recorded on documentation.  Re-performance of monitoring activities or manual controls  Obtaining documents used in the monitoring activity or manual control activity and independently re-performing of the  procedures. Comparing any exception items identified with those identified by the responsible control owner.  Re-performance of programmed processing  Input test data, manually calculated expected results, and compared actual results of processing to expectations.  B.1.2 Mapping requirements to controls  It is common practice in examinations that follow established assurance standards and criteria catalogues, that CSPs  map their internal controls (the technical and organisational measures in place to prevent risks or to detect and correct  undesired events) to the requirements/criteria of the standard. The information is typically presented in a statement of  applicability (e.g. for ISO 27001 in form a table that outlines which of the controls in ISO 27001 Annex A are applicable  and references to further documentation about the applicable controls) or a description about the service-related  system of internal control (e.g. attestations based on AICPA SOC 2). Mappings are typically presented per  requirement/criterion of the assurance standards with multiple internal controls assigned to each requirement/criterion  to demonstrate compliance.  In the EUCS scheme, the criteria are outlined in form of Security Objectives and related Security Requirements in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services). They represent the mandatory baseline per  assurance level for which the CSP must demonstrate compliance.  CSPs can map their internal controls per applicable Security Control Objective and related Security Requirements. Re-  using existing descriptions can limit additional efforts for the CSP and contribute to the fast adoption of the EUCSA. It  also allows the CSP to demonstrate compliance with multiple assurance standards and criteria catalogues during a  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  162  single examination (“test once, rely often”). However, this requires the mapping to be complete, accurate and valid.  Further, the nature, timing and extent of evaluation procedures applied by the CAB must provide the required level of  evidence.  B.1.3 Subservice providers  The cloud services offered to a CSC will in most cases rely on several subservices, which may be provided internally  at the CSP, externally by a different CSP, or externally by a provider that does not provide cloud services (e.g., a  hosting provider).  In order to complete the conformity assessment of a Cloud service by a CSP that uses subservice providers, it is  relevant to identify the subservice providers and apply the relevant procedures outlined below.  ASSESSMENT METHODS  The assessment needs to consider all subservices listed in the description of the service, internally or externally  provided. Internal subservices are necessarily in the scope of the assessment, but external subservices can be  handled using two different methods:  1. Include the sub-service provider in the scope (inclusive method);  2. Exclude the sub-service provider from the scope (carve out method).  Both methods are dealing with the services provided by a subservice organization, whereby the CSP’s description of  its service presents the nature of the services provided by a subservice organization. In both cases, internal and  external subservices are treated similarly and considered as provided by subservice organizations.  Inclusive method  With the inclusive Method the subservice provider’s controls to meet the applicable Security Objectives and the related  Security Requirements are included in the CSP’s description of its system. The subservice providers are part of the  scope of the CSP’s conformity assessment.  Carve-out method  With the carve-out method the subservice organization’s relevant control objectives and related controls are excluded  (carved-out) from the CSP’s description of its system. The subservice organizations are not part of the scope of the  CSP’s conformity assessment. Instead, the CSP’s description presents those controls that are designed and  implemented to monitor the operating, and if applicable the functional, effectiveness of the controls at the subservice  organisation. The monitoring activities shall meet the Security Objectives and the related Security Requirements for  “Procurement Management (Supply Chain Management)” outlined in the scheme.  SUBSERVICES IN EUCS  In the context of the EUCS scheme, subservices assessed using the inclusive method shall simply be considered as  part of the scope of the CSP’s conformity assessment. The CSP shall be responsible for ensuring that all required  evidence is available about the subservice organization, about the services it provides, and about these services are  integrated in its own systems in the provision of the cloud service to be assessed.  Subservices assessed using the carve-out methods shall be considered at all stages of the conformity assessment,  and in particular during the dependency analysis (see B.8). During that phase, the auditor shall review the assurance  documentation available for the subservice.  In the rest of this annex and in the following annexes, when subservices are mentioned, the intended meaning is  “subservices assessed using the carve-out method”, unless specified otherwise.  B.1.4 Complementary controls  Information security of a cloud service can only be assured, when the involved parties are aware of and follow their  individual responsibilities. For the designs of its internal controls the CSP assumes that user entities (CSCs) and  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  163  subservice organizations operate complementary controls that work in combination with the CSP’s internal controls to  achieve certain objectives.  In the EUCS scheme, the CSP shall present the Complementary Customer Controls (CCCs) and the Complementary  Subservice Organization Controls (CSOCs) assumed in the design of its internal controls as part of the description of  the cloud service.  If the CSP uses a subservice organization, the CSP shall obtain relevant information about the CCCs that the  subservice organization assumed in the design of their internal controls. Relevant information can be obtained from the  subservice organization, e.g. in form of descriptions of the cloud service in accordance with this scheme or other  assurance reports that require this information as well (e.g. ISAE 3402, AICPA SOC 2 or BSI C5). For these CCCs the  CSP has to ensure that appropriate internal controls are in place. During a conformity assessment, the CAB has to  evaluate whether the controls related to the CCCs are suitably designed, implemented and operating effectively.  B.1.5 Presentation  The assessment of cloud services for all levels of the EUCS is based on a meta-approach, which is described here.  This meta-approach for assessing and determining conformity describes the overall flow and requirements of the  conformity assessment of cloud services in the context of the EUCS scheme.  The meta-approach is the same for all levels, except for the audit itself:   For the assurance levels Substantial and High, the Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) shall use an audit  approach based on either ISO standards or ISAE standards, both complemented with the requirements as defined  in this meta approach, leading to providing reasonable assurance, as defined in B.1.1. This approach is described  in Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and High).   For the Basic level, as mentioned in the EU Cybersecurity Act, the CAB shall use a simpler audit approach leading  to limited assurance, as defined in B.1.1. This approach is described in Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic).  The structure of this meta-approach starts with defining a clear objective, followed by the development and execution  of an audit plan, and ending with the analysis of the gathered evidence and the delivery of an assurance report.  Figure 3: The structure of the Meta-Approach  The term “audit” is used for all conformity assessment activities performed by the audit team and audit team leader  (together called “the auditor”) of the CAB, including the analysis of obtained evidence in an assurance report.  To be able to conclude whether all requirements of the EUCS are met, considering the carve-outs and the use of sub  service organization, a separate analysis and evaluation needs to take place. This dependency analysis, during which  the audit team and audit team leader, or another team designated by the CAB (nevertheless called “the auditor” for  simplification), analyses the assurance documentation available for the CSP’s subservice providers, and provides the  results in the evaluation report.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  164  The audit report and the evaluation report together may form the basis for awarding a certificate, after review by a  team of the CAB independent from the auditor, and together with the delivery of a certification report.  Following [ISO17065], the CAB who issues a certificate is required to perform internally the review and decision  activities. However, other activities may be subcontracted, and in particular the audit. Throughout this documentation,  the auditor may therefore be part of the CAB or of a subcontractor to the CAB.  B.2 OBJECTIVE OF THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT  B.2.1 Introduction  The overall objective of the conformity assessment is to determine whether or not and to what extent a cloud service  delivered by a CSP is in conformity with the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements defined in  the EUCS.  To enable the CAB to perform the conformity assessment the CSP shall prepare and submit an Application Document,  including the description of its service that outlines the underlying and supporting processes and the accompanying  CSP’s statement about the conformity of their cloud service with the requirements of the EUCS. The CSP shall use the  template as included in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements) to the EUCS.  The object of the conformity assessment performed by the CAB shall be the cloud service for which a description is  provided, and the objective of the conformity assessment is to assess how this cloud service is built and operated with  meeting the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined in the EUCS. This objective  shall be stated in a statement endorsed by the CSP’s top management, in a form that complies with the requirements  defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements).  B.2.2 Basic level  The objective is to provide limited assurance through the execution of an audit (evaluation) by an independent auditor  that the cloud service is designed to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined in the EUCS that are applicable to assurance level Basic.  The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing audit procedures as defined in Sections D.3  and D.4 about:   the information presented in the description as provided together with or embedded in the application;   the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements; and   the existence and implementation of these controls as of a specified date during the initial conformity assessment.  B.2.3 Substantial Level  The objective is to provide reasonable assurance through the execution of an audit (evaluation) by an independent  auditor that the cloud service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined in the EUCS for the assurance level Substantial.  The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing audit procedures as defined in Sections C.3  and C.4 about:   the information presented in the description as provided together with or embedded in the application (C.3.1);   the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements  (C.4.1);   the existence and implementation of these controls as of a specified date during the initial conformity assessment  (C.4.2); and   the operating effectiveness (consistent application) of these controls throughout a specified period in subsequent  conformity assessments (C.4.3).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  165  B.2.4 High Level  The objective is to provide reasonable assurance through the execution of an audit (evaluation) by an independent  auditor that the cloud service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS for the assurance level High.  The auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence by executing audit procedures  As defined in Sections C.3  and C.4 about:   the information presented in the description as provided together with or embedded in the application (C.3.1);   the suitability of the design of controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements  (C.4.1);   the existence and the implementation of these controls as of a specified date during the initial conformity  assessment (C.4.2); and   the operating effectiveness (consistent application) of these controls throughout a specified period in subsequent  conformity assessments (C.4.3); and  B.3 ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT  Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement the CAB shall determine whether the  application request is appropriate by performing a review of the application.  The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application to assess the applicability of the criteria as  set in the EUCS, including the decision whether the chosen assurance level is appropriate in the circumstances.  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.2 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.2.  B.4 DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN  The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in an effective manner, including setting the scope,  timing and direction of the assessment, and determining the nature, timing and extent of planned audit procedures that  are required to be carried out in order to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This activity shall result in  an audit plan, and including aspects that are specific to each assurance level.  In all cases, and for all levels, if the CAB has subcontracted the audit, the CAB may at this point require a review of the  audit plan, which shall then be included in the contractual agreement between the CAB and its subcontractor.  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.3 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.3.  B.5 EXECUTION  B.5.1 Introduction  In the phase the auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence regarding:   the suitability of the design of controls, including controls over the processes out-sourced to subservice  organizations (such as hosting, infrastructure, platform, etc.) to meet the Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS;   the actual existence and implementation of controls to be in accordance with their design as of a point in time  (specified date); and   for the Substantial and High assurance levels, the operating effectiveness of the implemented controls throughout  a period over time (specified period);  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  166  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.4 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.4. The auditor shall document the procedures executed, the evidence  gained and conclusions reached using the appropriate document (depending on the assurance level).  Figure 4: The structure of the Meta-approach  B.6 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  Once the auditor has gathered all required evidence, the auditor shall evaluate its sufficiency and appropriateness.  This part of the process is specific to every assurance level, with the exception of nonconformity handling, which is  common to all three assurance levels and is described below.  Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.5 and additional information specific to levels  Substantial and High are provided in section C.5.  B.6.1 Nonconformity handling  If the audit procedures reveal nonconformities (or deviations) in the design, operation or, if required, functionality of the  controls, the auditor has to determine whether the applicable Security Requirements of the EUCS were still met. The  auditor should consider the following procedures for the determination:   Notification of the CSP if the nonconformity has been identified by the auditor;   Inquiry regarding their assessment of the cause of the identified nonconformity;   Assessment of the CSP’s handling of the identified nonconformity;   Assessment whether comparable nonconformities have been identified by the CSP’s monitoring processes and  what measures have been taken as a result; and   Qualification of the deviation as minor or major;  These procedures are linked to each other, because the requirements for the handling of an identified nonconformity  depend on the qualification of the nonconformity as minor or major. A major nonconformity is defined in [ISO17021] as  a “nonconformity that affects the capability of the management system to achieve the intended results”, with a note  stating that nonconformities could be qualified as major in the following circumstances:   there is a significant doubt that effective process control is in place, or that products or services will meet specified  requirements;   a number of minor nonconformities associated with the same requirement or issue could demonstrate a systemic  failure and thus constitute a major nonconformity.  In their analysis of nonconformities, CABs should consider both the requirement that is not being fulfilled and the  objective to which it refers, to gain an understanding of the impact of the nonconformity to the achievement of the  objective.  For a minor nonconformity, the auditor needs to determine that:   The CSP has determined the cause of the nonconformity;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  167   The CSP has defined a list of compensating controls that are in place to address the risks arising from the  deviation a list of corrective actions to be performed in order to address the nonconformity and a timeline to  implement the corrective actions;   The compensating controls already in place and the corrective actions proposed by the CSP are sufficient to  determine that the security requirement is met with the expected level of assurance.  The analysis of compensating controls may include the assessment of alternative organisational and technical  measures of the CSP to meet the Security Requirement of the EUCS, which have not been considered in the design of  this Security Requirement (e.g. use of new technical measures that provide at least an equal level of security but that  are not prescribed in the Security Requirements of the EUCS). Compensating controls are also considered a  temporary measure, and nonconformities, even minor, are expected to be corrected in the following conformity  assessments. The auditor may therefore define a list of conformity assessment activities to be performed in  subsequent conformity assessments.  For a major nonconformity, the auditor needs to determine that:   The CSP has determined the cause of the nonconformity;   The CSP has defined and implemented a list of corrective actions to address the nonconformity.   The corrective actions implemented by the CSP have adequately addressed the nonconformity.  Compensating actions are not allowed for major nonconformities, for which corrective actions shall be defined and  implemented in order to obtain or maintain a certificate. Nevertheless, if the corrective actions implemented are  sufficient to modify the qualification of the nonconformity as a minor nonconformity, then the remaining nonconformity  can be handled as a minor nonconformity, possibly with compensating controls.  The definition of minor and major nonconformities as well as the requirements related to their handling will be refined in  guidance provided by ENISA with the support of the ECCG.  Regardless of the qualification of the nonconformities as minor or major, the following information about the CSP’s  measures to handle such nonconformities and optimise its internal controls shall be disclosed in the assurance report:   If the nonconformity was detected by the CSP itself, when and in the course of which measures the nonconformity  was detected.   If the nonconformity was already stated in an assurance report of a previous audit, an indication should be given  of when and by what means the nonconformity was detected, together with a separate indication that the detection  occurred in a previous audit period.   The measures to be taken to remedy the nonconformity in the future and when these measures are likely to be  completed or effectively implemented.  B.7 ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT  After evaluating the result of the audit procedures the auditor shall form a conclusion and issue an assurance report  that satisfies the requirements defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements) for the targeted  assurance level. Additional information specific to level Basic are provided in section D.6 and additional information  specific to levels Substantial and High are provided in section C.6  The conclusion shall include the audit team’s recommendation as to whether the cloud service satisfies the  requirements of the EUCS scheme, pending the results of the dependency analysis. The conclusion shall be based on  the evidence obtained and the audit activities performed.  This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP. The CSP may contest the content of the assurance report  and in particular the audit team’s recommendation. If the dispute remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint  with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  168  B.8 PERFORMING THE DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS  B.8.1 Objectives  The objective of the dependency analysis is to validate that the assurance documentation (assurance reports,  certificates) available for the subservices operated by internal or external subservice organisations used by the CSP in  the operation of its cloud service are adequate.  For every subservice organisation, the basis for this dependency analysis is the risk assessment of the provider that  has been performed by the CSP. As required by EUCS (see Annex A:, Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud  Services), the assurance report shall contain a rationale explaining how the CSP uses the subservice to satisfy the  scheme requirements, and for each subservice a pointer to an assurance component for the subservice.  The dependency analysis consists in analysing these assurance components to determine whether or not the  subservice meet the expectations from the CSP at the targeted assurance level.  B.8.2 Assessing the availability of assurance documentation  The first step is to list the assurance documentation available for every subservice provider, and to assess the overall  relevance of each assurance component for the dependency review.  The following elements are essential.  About the assurance component itself:   Type of assurance component, with all required details (e.g., ISO27001 certificate, Type 1 or Type 2 for an ISAE  report);   Period covered or period of validity, possibly complemented with bridge letters or similar statements;   Applicable framework (existing standard or private framework);   Inclusion of a mapping to EUCS in the assurance component;  About the auditor’s professional competence and independence:   Name of the CAB or audit organization, name of the audit lead.   Evidence of the CAB/audit organization’s and the auditor’s competence (accreditation, personal certification, etc.).   Evidence of the CAB/audit organization’s and the auditor’s independence (accreditation, etc.).  By analysing this information, the auditor shall determine whether the assurance documentation available for a given  subservice provider is adequate to provide assurance corresponding to the targeted EUCS assurance level.  ENISA, with the support of the ECCG, will issue guidance about the acceptability of different types of assurance  components for the different EUCS assurance levels, including potential gaps and attention points.  B.8.3 Assessing assurance related to individual requirements  The second step consists in verifying that the assurance documentation available for the subservice provider is  adequate to determine that the subservice provider meets the expectations of the CSP relative to individual EUCS  requirements.  This assessment is performed for every subservice provider, and then for every EUCS requirement for which the CSP  has declared to rely partially or fully on the assurance provided by the subservice provider, by formulating an  assumption on the subservice’s control.  The auditor shall for each such assumption determine whether or not the assurance provided in the available  assurance documentation is adequate. There are several ways to reach a conclusion that the assurance is adequate:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  169   The required information is available with the expected assurance level in the assurance documentation.   The information available in the assurance documentation does not cover the full scope of the requirement, but  additional controls implemented by the subservice provider or compensating controls implemented by the CSP  allow the auditor to determine that the information is adequate.   The information available in the assurance documentation does not offer the expected level of assurance, but the  controls implemented by the CSP to assess and monitor the subservice provider allow the auditor to determine  that the information is adequate.  Finally, if the assurance documentation mentions nonconformities on the controls used to meet an assumption, the  corrective measures proposed and implemented by the subservice provider and reviewed by its auditor shall be  adequate to guarantee that the assumption is indeed met.  ENISA, with the support of the ECCG, will issue guidance about the adequacy of different types of assurance  components for the different EUCS assurance levels, including acceptable additional and compensating controls that  may be implemented by the subservice providers and by the CSP.  B.8.4 EUCS-certified subservices  When a subservice has been certified in the EUCS scheme, the processes defined above may be simplified:   The auditor’s competence and independence does not need to be assessed;   The report can be considered as being fully compliant with the rules of the EUCS scheme for the assurance level  of the report;   No mapping to the EUCS scheme’s requirements is needed.  Finally, if the cloud service and its subservice satisfy the requirements for composition, the assessment may be  simplified further since the information provided by the subservice organization has already been assessed.  B.9 ISSUING THE EVALUATION REPORT  After evaluating the adequacy of the assurance provided to support assumptions about subservice providers, the  auditor shall form a conclusion, combine it with the conclusion from the assurance report, and issue an evaluation  report.  The conclusion shall include the audit’s team recommendation as to whether the assurance documentation is  adequate or not to support the certification of the CSP using these subservice providers. The conclusion shall be  based on the audit activities and express whether, in all material respects,  (i) the audit documentation provided for every subservice provider is adequate to provide assurance corresponding to  the targeted EUCS assurance level,  (ii) for every assumption formulating by the CSP regarding a contribution of a subservice provider to the conformity to  an EUCS requirement, the audit documentation provided for that subservice provider is adequate to determine that  the assumption formulated by the CSP is correct, with the targeted EUCS assurance level, and  (iii) for every nonconformity identified in assurance documentation regarding a control used to determine that an  assumption formulated by the CSP is correct, appropriate corrective actions have been proposed, implemented  and validated by an auditor.  The auditor shall then combine this conclusion of the dependency analysis with the conclusion from the assurance  report, for a conclusion regarding the fulfilment of relevant EUCS requirements by the cloud service, and make a  recommendation regarding the possible certification of the cloud service under the conditions outlined in the CSP’s  application.  The auditor shall issue the evaluation report that satisfies the requirements defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document  Content requirements).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  170  This dependency report shall be first addressed to the CSP. The CSP may contest the content of the assurance report  and in particular the audit team’s recommendation. If the dispute remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint  with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.  The auditor then delivers the evaluation report, comprising at least the assurance report and the present evaluation  report, and if applicable, additional assurance or evaluation reports of sub service providers, to the Conformity  Assessment Body (CAB) accredited to issue EUCS certificates, which will then proceed to a review and certification  decision.  B.10 REVIEW OF THE EVALUATION  Once an assurance report and an evaluation report (and, if required, supporting reports) have been delivered by the  auditor, the CAB shall perform a review of all information and results related to the evaluation, based on these reports:   The review shall not be subcontracted;   The review shall be carried out by one or more persons who have not been involved in the audit phase, whom will  be called collectively the reviewer;   The recommendations for a certification decision based on the review shall be documented, unless the review and  the certification decision are completed concurrently by the same person;   The persons carrying out the review shall not normally overturn a negative recommendation of the audit team. If  such a situation does arise, the CAB shall document and justify the basis for the decision to overturn the  recommendation.  The review shall include at least the following activities:   A review of the sufficiency of the information provided in the assurance report and supporting documentation with  respect to the EUCS requirements and the certification scope;   A review of the nonconformities identified in the assurance report and related corrective actions   A review of the issues identified in the evaluation report’s dependency analysis; and   A recommendation for the certification decision, based on a documented opinion on whether or not the  requirements of the EUCS have been satisfied by the CSP and by the auditor.  B.10.1 Review of the sufficiency of the assurance report  The CAB shall review the assurance report and supporting documentation concerning the following aspects:  General  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   Does the report contain the required parts?   Does the provided documentation include the required support documentation?   Is the conformity assessment performed in due time?  Security controls and requirements  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   If there is a mapping from a set of controls provided by the CSP to the security controls and requirements defined  in EUCS, is this mapping adequate?   For every control or requirement analysed during the audit, have the appropriate activities been performed and  documented?  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  171  Nonconformities  The CAB shall review the assurance report and supporting documentation concerning the handling of nonconformities  detected during the audit.  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer.   For every major nonconformity identified during the audit, is adequate information provided in the assurance  report?   For every minor nonconformity identified during the audit, is adequate information provided in the assurance  report?   For every nonconformity identified during the audit, does the reviewer accept the analysis provided by the auditor?  B.10.2 Review of the evaluation report  Dependency analysis  The CAB shall review the dependency analysis and supporting documentation concerning the adequacy of the  assurance documentation available about subservice providers.  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   For every subservice provider mentioned in the assurance report, is there adequate assurance documentation  available?   For every assumption in the assurance report about a subservice provider, is the documentation available  adequate to determine that assumption correct?  Recommendation for the certification decision  The CAB shall review the recommendation for the certification decision provided in the evaluation report and how it  combined the conclusions of the audit report with those of the dependency analysis.  The review shall answer the following questions, with proper justifications. In case of a negative answer, the review  shall provide an analysis of the consequences of the negative answer:   Is the certification decision proposed in the assurance report adequate according to the provided documentation?   In the case of a maintenance conformity assessment, does the proposed certification decision include all the  information required to maintain the certificate, with proper justification?   If the cloud service depends on subservice providers, is the assurance documentation adequate or not to support  the certification of the CSP using these subservice providers?  B.10.3 Review reporting  The results of the review shall be documented in a report, which shall include all the answers to the question above,  together with a justification.  If the conformity assessment results in the issuance or maintenance of a certificate, this review report shall be included  in the publicly available certification or maintenance report.  B.11 CERTIFICATION DECISION  The CAB shall assign at least one person to make the certification decision based on all information related to the  evaluation, its review, and any other relevant information. The certification decision shall be carried out by a person or  group of persons that has not been involved in the audit activities (but may have been involved in the review process).  The certification decision shall not be subcontracted.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  172  The CAB shall notify the CSP of a decision not to grant certification, to withdraw a certificate, or to suspend a  certificate, and shall identify the reasons for the decision. The CSP may contest the CAB’s decision. If the dispute  remains unresolved, the CSP may file a complaint with the NCCA to request their opinion on the matter of the dispute.  B.12 CERTIFICATION  If the certification decision is negative, i.e. if the cloud service has been determined not to meet the EUCS scheme’s  requirements, the consequences are as follows:   In the case of an initial conformity assessment, no further action is required, i.e. no certificate shall be issued;   In the case of a maintenance conformity assessment, the certificate shall be suspended by appending the  maintenance report as rationale for the suspension, and then the process for handling nonconformities shall be  followed.  If the certification decision is positive, i.e. if the cloud service has been determined not to meet the EUCS scheme’s  requirements, the consequences are as follows, depending of the nature of the assessment.   In the case of an initial assessment, the CAB shall issue a new certificate, including the full certification report, and  set the expiration date three (3) years after the date of issuance, unless the CAB has explicitly indicated a shorter  validity period for the certificate;   In the case of a periodic assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the maintenance  report, and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed;   In the case of a renewal assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the maintenance  report, by setting the expiration date of the certificate three (3) years after the date of this update, and if needed by  updating elements in the certificate that have changed;   In the case of a restoration assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the  maintenance report, and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed, and shall return the  certificate’s status to “certified”;   In the case of a restoration assessment, the CAB shall update the existing certificate by appending the  maintenance report, and if needed by updating elements in the certificate that have changed;  The reports mentioned in the paragraph above are specified in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  173  ANNEX C: ASSESSMENT FOR  LEVELS SUBSTANTIAL AND HIGH  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable conformity assessment methods for levels  'substantial' and 'high'.  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria  Foreword for Reviewers  This annex has been recently separated from the main meta-approach, in order to support the integration of the  conformity assessment method for level Basic with the meta-approach, so there may be  a few remaining  inconsistencies in the text.  The current proposal is built on the following hypotheses:   All CSPs are subject to the same requirements in order to get their cloud services certified, regardless of the  way in which their cloud services are implemented (e.g., a SaaS provider implementing a full stack vs. a SaaS  provider relying on a subservice provider’s infrastructure).   The auditor is in charge of assessing the level of compliance and assurance for subservice providers based  on the information available, including assurance reports of various origins and evidence provided by the CSP  in their risk assessment of their subservice providers.  Some important templates, described in annexes, are missing, as we first need to determine to which extent they  are to be considered as requirements or as guidance.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  174  C.1 INTRODUCTION  The content of this Annex complements the Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services) for  conformity assessments where the CSP claims compliance to the Substantial and High assurance levels.  This Annex follows the content of the Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), and refines the  definition of the steps related to the audit by providing additional detail.  C.2 ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT  Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement the CAB shall determine whether the  application request is appropriate by performing a review of the application.  The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application to assess the applicability of the criteria as  set in the EUCS scheme, and to ensure that:   the application request contains all the mandatory information;   the information about the CSP and the service is sufficient for conducting of the assessment and the certification  process, and it fulfils the requirements defined in the EUCS scheme;   the CSP has acknowledged and understands its responsibilities as set out in Annex F: (Scheme Document  Content requirements)   any known difference in understanding between the CAB and the CSP is resolved, including agreement regarding  standards or other normative documents;   the scope of certification is clearly defined;   the resources, capabilities and competences are available to perform the conformity assessment activities,  including knowledge of the relevant industry, an understanding of information technology and systems and  experience in evaluating risks as they relate to the suitable design of controls, and experience in the design and  execution of tests of controls and the evaluation of the results.  The CAB may also express its opinion on the suitability of the assurance level selected by the CSP.  In the case of a recertification, the CAB shall also ensure that:   the reason for the recertification is clearly described; and   where applicable, the CSP has provided an impact assessment of the changes implemented since the last  assessment.  Once all the review criteria are fulfilled and the CAB and CSP have reached an agreement about the conditions of the  engagement, the auditor shall conduct the following major audit activities:  1. Developing the audit plan (section C.3);  2. Execution of assessment procedures (section C.4);  3. Analysis of results (section C.5);  4. Issue of an assurance report (section C.6) and of an evaluation report (section B.9).  Once the auditor has delivered the assurance report, the CAB shall perform the following activities:  5. Review of the evaluation (section B.10);  6. Certification decision (section B.11); and  7. Certification (section B.12).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  175  C.3 DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN  C.3.1 Introduction  The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in an effective manner, including setting the scope,  timing and direction of the assessment, and determining the nature, timing and extent of planned audit procedures that  are required to be carried out in order to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This activity shall result in  an audit plan as described in ISO 19011 and 17021, and including the aspects presented in section C.3.2 and C.3.3  below.  For each activity mentioned below: the auditor shall document the procedures executed, the information and  documentation used, the evidence gained, and the conclusion reached, as described in section C.3.3..  C.3.2 Initial activities  In this phase the auditor shall:   Obtain an Understanding of the CSP’s cloud service offered and the controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements, by reading provided documentation and inquiries of people  involved.  o The auditor shall obtain and read the CSP’s description of its system, identify the boundaries of that system,  and how it interfaces with other systems (e.g. cloud services provided by subservice organizations) and shall  evaluate whether those aspects of the description are fairly presented.   Assess, if applicable, the mapping between the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined  by the EUCS and the CSP’s control framework:  o To conclude whether the applicable Security Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS are  covered by the CSP’s internal controls;  o To identify any remaining risks (as a result of gaps in the mapping) and the possible impact of them;   Determine to what extent and for which elements of the CSP’s internal controls sub service organisations are  being used and how the CSP controls and monitors the services provided by these sub service organisations;  o To determine which assessment approach is appropriate: using the inclusive or carve-out method, or a  suitable alternative.  o To identify which sub service organisations do have an acceptable assurance report which can be (re)used.   Assess how the CSP dealt with complementary controls towards customers of the CSP (user entities) and towards  sub service organisations, as well complementary controls of sub service organisations towards the CSP.   Consider materiality, i.e. the relative importance and effect of possible omissions or deviations with respect to the  fair presentation of the description, the suitability of the design of controls and the operating effectiveness of  controls, primarily based on qualitative factors, for example: whether the description includes the significant  aspects of the cloud systems in accordance with the requirements as defined by the EUCS; whether the  description omits or distorts relevant information;  o Determine to what extent, if any, to use the work of an internal audit function from the CSP and/or to use  specific experts;  o The use of an internal audit function is highly dependent of a number of criteria  o The use of a specific expert is dependent of the nature of the audit procedure and the complexity of the item  to be examined.   Determine audit procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design,  implementation and the operating effectiveness of the CSP’s internal controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS. These procedures are described in the  detailed audit plan (C.3.3).   Determine the roles and responsibilities of the audit team members, as well as guides and observers or  interpreters;   Determine the logistics and communications arrangements, including specific arrangements for the locations to be  audited (e.g. datacentre visits);   Determine matters related to confidentiality and information security of records obtained during the audit;   Determine any follow-up actions from a previous audit or other source(s) e.g. lessons learned, project reviews.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  176  In the case of a recertification, the auditor shall also:   Analyse the impact assessment to determine the subset of audit activities that need to be performed in order to  cover the changes in the Cloud service since the last assessment; and   Analyse the reason for the recertification to determine the subset of audit activities that need to be performed in  order to satisfy the specific requirements for that trigger (see Annex G:, Certification Lifecycle and continued  assurance).  C.3.3 Detailed audit plan  Sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design, existence, and operating effectiveness of the CSP’s  controls shall be gathered using one or more of the following activities: inquiry, observation, inspection, and re-  performance of the control and re-performance of programmed processing, as defined in B.1.1.  Detailed reference audit procedures per Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the  EUCS shall be developed, using general guidelines on how to perform some of the audit activities. These references  audit procedures shall be the basis for the establishment of the audit plan, but they may need to be adapted to the  specific circumstances of the assessment, as explained below.  The CSP's actual approach to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the  EUCS will be different per CSP. Although they will all have certain elements in common, the actual design,  implementation and operation of the controls to meet the security requirements, will be different per organization.  As the actual design, implementation and operation of these controls will be different per organizations, the risks that  prevent the CSP from meeting the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS will  be different as well. The risks depend e.g. on   services provided by the CSP;   components of the systems used to provide the services;   environment in which the systems operate.  To deal with this situation, the auditor must be able to tailor the audit procedures for the specific circumstances. By  doing so, the following aspects are typically to be considered:   Whether there have been changes to the systems used to operate the service or the organization (e.g. changes in  processes, IT systems);   The competence of the personnel who perform the measures or monitor its performance and whether there have  been changes in key personnel;   History of errors in the operation of the measures (known from previous examinations);   The relevance and reliability of the evidence to be obtained;   The nature of the measures (including their level of automation) and the frequency with which it operates;   The degree to which the measures rely on the effectiveness of other measures.  The audit procedures need to be adapted to a specific security requirement and desired level of certification. Security  requirements have been constructed in a way that all security requirements for level basic are applicable to levels  substantial and high, while security requirements for level substantial also apply to level high. Therefore, it is necessary  to access all security requirements on the specific level, including those from lower levels. Security requirements that  were initially written for level Basic, are also applicable to levels Substantial and High, but they would be assessed in  different ways according the certification level.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  177  Figure 5: the Audit procedure  Based on the analysis above the auditor shall determine for each control and security measure under audit:   the nature (what kind of audit procedure),   the extent (how many or how often to execute the procedure), and   the timing (at what point in time or over what period)  of the evidence gathering audit procedures.  NATURE  The nature of an audit procedures relates to the kind of an audit procedures and describes the way how to obtain the  evidence required.  Selecting the nature depends on the specific characteristics of the specific control or security measure under audit.  The rigour and depth increase from substantial to high assurance level. The different natures of activities are described  in section B.1.1.  EXTENT  The extent of an audit procedure relates to the number of observations to be performed, the rigour and dept of  inquiries, how many inspections are needed, and the number of re-performances of a specific audit procedure.  Determining the extent depends on the specific characteristics of the control or security measure and the assurance  level required. The extent in case of the assurance level high is much higher than for assurance level substantial. In  many cases, especially for testing operating effectiveness, a sampling approach is appropriate.  Sampling  The size of the samples to select in order to test the operating effectiveness of controls primarily depends on the  nature and frequency of the control. The following sample sizes should provide reasonable assurance that the tested  controls operated effectively during the specified period and that the associated control objectives were achieved  during that specified period. Where the population of occurrences falls between the levels identified in the table below,  the number of items to test shall be interpolated, exercising professional judgment in determining the appropriate  sample size.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  178  Table 5: Determining sample size  Frequency of the control Assumed population of control  occurrences  Sample Size  (per specified period)  More than daily Over 250 25 - 60  Daily 250 20 - 40  Weekly 52 5 - 15  Monthly 12 2 - 5  Quarterly 4 2  Annually 1 1  Timing  The timing of an audit procedure relates to the point in time of a period to be covered of an audit procedure.  For obtaining evidence about design and implementation/existence the audit procedures are built around a certain  point in time: the reporting date.  For obtaining evidence about operating effectiveness the audit procedure need to cover a period before the reporting  date (typically 12 months, or 3-6 months for an initial audit), which is fixed in the scheme and in Annex G: (Certification  Lifecycle and continued assurance), depending on the assessment type.  Documentation  The detailed plan shall be documented following the requirements defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content  requirements) for the “Audit Plan and Execution”.  For each control or security measure under audit the template shall be used covering the following topics:   the control or security measure under audit;   for the suitability of the design, the existence and implementation, and operating effectiveness:  o nature of the audit procedure;  o timing of the audit procedure;  o extent of the audit procedure;   the documents used, the names and function of the inquired people, other information;   the evidence obtained;   the conclusion reached.  These procedures will vary between engagements and depends, among other things, on the requested assurance  level (Substantial or High) and the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material non-conformity  of the matter being investigated. All the three elements increase in scope, depth and rigour as the level of assurance  increases.  C.3.4 Audit plan review  The auditor may request the reviewer (see B.10) to provide an opinion on the audit plan, to ensure that they agree on  the structure and content of the plan before its execution. The CSP may explicitly request this review to be performed  before starting the execution of the audit plan.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  179  C.4 EXECUTION  C.4.1 Suitability of the Design of Controls  A control is suitably designed, when actions or events that comprise a risk (e.g. for information security) are prevented,  or detected and corrected. Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls requires the auditor to  determine whether   The risks that threaten the achievement of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined by the EUCS have been identified by the CSP;   The controls would, if operating effectively, provide reasonable assurance that those risks would not prevent the  Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS from being met.  To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall:   obtain an understanding of the CSP’s process for identifying and evaluating the risks that threaten the  achievement of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements and assessing the  completeness and accuracy of the CSP’s identification of those risks,   evaluate the linkage of the controls with those risks, which is typically a consideration of frequency or timing of the  occurrence or performance of the control (e.g. monthly, weekly, per triggering action or event such as a service  request);   evaluate the party responsible for conducting the control (e.g. competence and authority of the person, group or  system);   understand the specific activity being performed by the party to determine especially how the control is triggered,  how it is executed, which tools or systems are used to support the execution and which records are kept  evidencing the execution; and   validate the source of information (for example a log file, archive, ticketing system, etc.) to which the control is  applied to determine whether this source is reliable and ensures for completeness and accuracy of information  processing.  Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls typically requires the auditor to perform inquiries  with the CSP’s subject matter experts and the examination of supporting documentation that describe how the control  should operate, e.g. written policies, procedures or process flowcharts.  C.4.2 Existence and Implementation of controls and security measures  In order to prevent, or detect and correct actions that comprise a risk, the controls have to be placed in operation as  designed.  After the auditor has concluded that a control is suitably designed, is has to be concluded per control whether the  control actually exists and is implemented as designed.  To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall obtain evidence that the controls and security measures have been  implemented by examining exemplary actions or events that triggered the occurrence or performance of the controls  (e.g. tickets) and to inspect the environment in which it operates (e.g. suitable configuration of the tools or systems  used to execute the control in accordance with the design).  C.4.3 Operating effectiveness  Controls considered to be suitable in design, shall be tested for operating effectiveness over a certain period of time  (specified period). The auditor shall design the tests in a manner to cover a representative number of actions and  events that triggered the occurrence or performance of the controls throughout the specified period.  For initial certification the period shall be at least 3 months for level Substantial and 6 months for level High; for  subsequent certification the period is 12 months or the time since the operating effectiveness was last tested in a  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  180  previous conformity assessment. In all cases, the period to consider shall be the period that precedes immediately the  conformity assessment.  In determining the nature, timing and extent of the tests the following the auditor shall consider:   the nature and frequency of the controls being tested,   the types of available evidential matter,   the nature of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements to be met;   the assessed level of control risk,   the expected efficiency and effectiveness of the tests, and   the results of tests of the control environment.  A control is operating effectively, if   it was consistently applied as designed throughout the specified period, and   in case of manual controls, they were applied by individuals who have the appropriate competence and authority  (e.g. changes being only approved by personnel who are responsible for the service being provided).  To be able to conclude on this the auditor shall perform procedures such as inspection, observation, or re-  performance in combination with inquiry to obtain evidence about the following:   how the control was applied;   the consistency with which the control was applied; and   by whom or by what means the control was applied.  An inquiry alone is NOT sufficient to determine whether a control operated effectively. This also applies to controls, if  applicable, over the out-sourced processes to sub-service providers.  At level High, in addition to the testing for operating effectiveness, the CAB and the CSP shall define procedures for  the automated monitoring of key security controls, including at least:   A description of automated monitoring mechanisms implemented by the CSP;   A description of the procedures implemented by the CSP to handle the deviations and nonconformities identified  through automated monitoring;   A description of the procedures used to notify the CAB, at least when any major nonconformity is identified  through automated evidence gathering.  Specific controls and requirements are defined in  Annex A:, Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services  that define the general requirements for these procedures, and also define the minimum et of automated evidence  gathering mechanisms to be implemented by the CSP.  C.5 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  C.5.1 Evaluation of evidence obtained  The auditor shall evaluate the sufficiency and appropriateness of the evidence obtained from the executed audit  procedures to conclude about the suitability of the design, existence and implementation, and operating effectiveness.  The evidence obtained shall be appropriate and sufficient to enable the auditor to take informed decisions.  In addition, when using information produced (or provided) by the CSP, the auditor shall evaluate whether this  information is reliable enough for executing the planned audit procedures by obtaining evidence about the accuracy  and completeness of such information and evaluating whether the information was appropriately precise, detailed,  consistent and current.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  181  Sufficiency is the measure of the quantity of evidence. The quantity of evidence needed is affected by the risks of that  the description is not fairly presented and that the controls were not suitably designed or operating and, if required,  functioning effectively, and also by the quality of such evidence (the higher the quality, the less may be required).  Obtaining more evidence, however, may not compensate for its poor quality.  Appropriateness is the measure of the quality of evidence; that is, its relevance and its reliability in providing support  for the auditor’s opinion. The reliability of evidence is influenced by its source and by its nature, and is dependent on  the individual circumstances under which it is obtained.  All relevant evidence shall be considered, regardless of whether it appears to corroborate or to contradict the analysis  of the description or the controls against the applicable security requirements of the EUCS.  If the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to conclude on a given requirement, then the audit  shall be considered inconclusive. This should be considered as a nonconformity, and handled as defined in B.6.1.  C.5.2 Analysis of controls to meet the applicable Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements of the EUCS  The analysis of the suitability of the design, existence and implementation, and operating effectiveness of the CSP’s  internal controls, is based on the requirements outlined in section C.4 above.  For analysing whether the CSP’s internal controls meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security  Requirements of the EUCS, the auditor has to consider whether the controls fully cover all aspects of the Security  Requirements. Several controls may be required in combination per Security Requirement to fully meet each security  requirement.  If the CSP already performs audits in accordance with other standards (e.g. ISO 27001 or SOC 2), it is possible that  the controls presented in the description may be optimally aligned with the criteria of these standards, but that their  descriptions do not fully meet all aspects of the Security Requirement of the EUCS to which they are mapped to.  The auditor’s test procedures and the results thereof shall be documented in the report according to the examples in  the table below  Security Control  Objectives  <Service-Org>’s  Description of Controls  Tests Performed Test Results  Objective: description  ID – Security  requirement  ID – Title of Control  [Control Description]  Test performed by the  auditor  Test result by the  auditor  In describing the tests of controls in the assurance report, the auditor shall clearly state per control tested, whether the  items tested represent all or a selection of the items in the population. The auditor shall further indicate the nature of  the tests in sufficient detail to enable the CAB’s review team as the report recipient to review whether the auditor has  obtained sufficient and appropriate objective in accordance with the requirements as outlined in section C.4.  If nonconformities (or deviations) have been identified, the auditor shall record them against a specific control,  including a description of the objective evidence on which the nonconformity is based, the extent of testing performed  that led to identification of the nonconformities (including the sample size where sampling has been used), and the  number and nature of the nonconformities noted. The auditor shall report nonconformities even if, on the basis of tests  performed, he has concluded that the related Security Requirement of the EUCS were met, and even if the CSP has  implemented corrective actions to address the nonconformities and the auditor has determined that the corrective  actions effectively address the nonconformities.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  182  C.6 ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT  After evaluating the result of the audit procedures the auditor shall form a conclusion and issue an assurance report.  The conclusion shall include the audit team’s recommendation as to whether the cloud service should be certified or  not. The conclusion shall be based on the evidence obtained and the audit activities performed, and express whether,  in all material respects,  (1) For Substantial Level:  (i) the CSP’s description fairly presents its cloud service, including the controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS, and is free from material misstatements as of a  specified date (in case of an initial conformity assessment) or throughout a specified period (in case of a  subsequent conformity assessment);  (ii) the controls stated in the CSP’s description were suitably designed, existed and were implemented to provide  reasonable assurance that the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS  were met as of a specified date (in case of an initial conformity assessment) or throughout a specified period (in  case of a subsequent conformity assessment); and  (iii) the controls stated in the CSP’s description operated effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the  Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS were met throughout a specified  period; or.  (2) For High Level:  (iv) (i) and (ii) above noted for Substantial Level; and  (v) the controls stated in the CSP’s description operated and functioned effectively to provide reasonable  assurance that the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS were met  throughout a specified period.  The auditor shall issue the assurance report using the template in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content  requirements).  This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  183  ANNEX D: ASSESSMENT FOR  LEVEL BASIC  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable conformity assessment method for level Basic.  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 8, Evaluation Methods and Criteria  Foreword for Reviewers  This annex has been integrated recently.  Some important templates, described in annexes, are missing, as we first need to determine to which extent they  are to be considered as requirements or as guidance. Also, for level Basic, some documents are based on  checklists, which will be built with numerous references to the scheme’s security requirements, as defined in  Annex A: (Security Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  184  D.1 INTRODUCTION  At the Basic assurance level, the conformity assessment is greatly simplified, and it relies solely on evidence provided  by the CSP, if needed upon explicit request from the CAB. For consistency reasons, we will use the same terminology  (audit, auditor, audit team) as for the other assurance levels, also the evaluation performed is not a full-fledged audit of  the cloud service to be certified.  For the assurance level Basic the reviewer shall use the approach defined in the present Annex.  This approach is facilitating a controlled environment for providing limited assurance while keeping the associated cost  for certification affordable for smaller CSP’s, through limited evaluation of the control framework of the CSP by an  independent reviewer that the cloud service is built and operated with procedures and mechanisms to meet the  corresponding Security Objectives and related Security Requirements defined in the EUCS.  The EU Cybersecurity Act requires for the assurance level Basic that the evaluation must minimise the known basic  risks of incidents and cyberattacks, and that a review of technical documentation is required at a minimum.  While the CSP shall be required to conduct the necessary initial verification of compliance with the objectives and  controls of this scheme, at the basic level there will be a review of the documentation created or compiled by the CSP  as a part of its internal verifications.  D.2 ACCEPTING THE CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT ENGAGEMENT  Before agreeing to accept or continue a conformity assessment engagement the CAB shall determine whether the  application request is appropriate by performing a review of the application.  The CAB shall conduct a review of the information obtained for application to assess the applicability of the criteria as  set in the EUCS, including the decision whether the chosen assurance level is appropriate in the circumstances, and to  ensure that:   the application request contains all the mandatory information;   the information about the CSP and the service is sufficient for conducting of the assessment and the certification  process;   the CSP has acknowledged and understands its responsibilities as set out in TBD   any known difference in understanding between the CAB and the CSP is resolved, including agreement regarding  standards or other normative documents;   the scope of certification is clearly defined;   the means are available to perform all evaluation activities;   the resources, capabilities and competences are available to perform the engagement, including knowledge of the  relevant industry, an understanding of information technology and systems and experience in evaluating risks as  they relate to the suitable design of controls, and experience in the design and execution of tests of controls and  the evaluation of the results.  In addition, the auditor shall obtain a legally binding declaration of the CSP that it acknowledges and understands its  responsibility and complies at least, with the following:   the CSP is responsible for the preparation of the description of its system (“Description”), and accompanying  CSP’s assertion (“Management Statement”);   if the certification applies to ongoing service provision, the certified service continues to fulfil the security  requirements;   the CSP agrees to on-site reviews in case they would be necessary to clarify assertions or to resolve complaints  disputes;   the CSP makes claims regarding certification consistent with the scope of certification;   the CSP does not use its service certification in such a manner as to bring the certification body into disrepute and  does not make any statement regarding its service certification that the certification body may consider misleading  or unauthorized;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  185   upon suspension, withdrawal, or termination of certification, the CSP discontinues its use of all advertising matter  that contains any reference thereto and takes any other required measure, and inform their customers;   in referring to its service certification in communication media such as documents, brochures or advertising, the  CSP complies with the requirements of the certification body;   the CSP complies with any requirements that may be prescribed in the certification scheme relating to the use of  marks of conformity, and on information related to the service;   the CSP keeps a record of all complaints made known to it relating to compliance with security requirements and  makes these records available to the certification body when requested, and  o takes appropriate action with respect to such complaints and any deficiencies found in service that affect  compliance with the security requirements;  o documents the actions taken;   the CSP informs the certification body, without delay, of changes that may affect its ability to conform with the  certification requirements.   the CSP agrees to fees payable to the CAB for the execution of the conformity assessment communicated  beforehand  In the case of a recertification, the CAB shall also ensure that:   the trigger for the recertification is clearly described; and   where applicable, the CSP has provided an impact assessment of the changes implemented since the last  assessment.  Once all the review criteria are fulfilled and the CAB and CSP have reached an agreement about the conditions of the  engagement, the auditor shall conduct the following major audit activities:  1. Developing the audit plan (section D.3);  2. Execution of assessment procedures (section D.4);  3. Analysis of results (section D.5);  4. Issue of an assurance report (section D.6) and of an evaluation report (section B.9).  Once the auditor has delivered the assurance report, the CAB shall perform the following activities:  5. Review of the evaluation (section B.10);  6. Certification decision (section B.11); and  7. Certification (section B.12).  D.3 DEVELOPING THE AUDIT PLAN  D.3.1 Introduction  The CAB shall plan the engagement so that it will be performed in an effective manner, including setting the scope,  timing and direction of the audit to be carried out in order to achieve the objective of the conformity assessment. This  can be achieved by using a predefined audit plan.  For each activity mentioned below: the auditor shall document the high-level audit plan following the requirements  defined in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content requirements), including the procedures executed, the information  and documentation used, the evidence gained, and the conclusion reached.  There shall be at least one meeting between the CAB and the CSP during the development of the audit plan, to  provide clarifications about the cloud service and related controls and about the next phases of the audit.  D.3.2 Initial activities  In this phase the assessor shall:  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  186   Obtain an Understanding of the CSP’s cloud service offered and the controls to meet the Security Control  Objectives and related Security Requirements, by reading provided documentation and inquiries of people  involved.  o The auditor shall obtain and read the CSP’s description of its system, identify the boundaries of that system,  and how it interfaces with other systems (e.g. cloud services provided by subservice organizations) and shall  evaluate whether those aspects of the description are fairly presented.   Review the CSP’s mapping between the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements as defined by the  EUCS and the CSP’s control framework:  o To conclude whether the applicable Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the  EUCS are covered by the CSP’s internal controls;  o To identify any remaining risks (as a result of gaps in the mapping) and the possible impact of them;   Determine to what extent and for which processes the CSP uses sub service providers and how the CSP controls  and monitors the services provided by these sub service providers;  o To determine which assessment approach is appropriate: using the inclusive or carve-out method.  o To identify which sub service providers do have an acceptable assurance report which can be (re)used.   Review how the CSP dealt with complementary controls towards customers of the CSP (user entities) and  towards sub service providers, as well complementary controls of sub service providers towards the CSP:  o Does the CSP has CCC for its costumer defined?  o Does the CSP fulfils the CCC of the subservice provider for the services consumed?   Consider the relative importance and effect of possible omissions or deviations with respect to the fair  presentation of the description,  o whether the description includes the significant aspects of the cloud systems;  o whether the description omits or distorts relevant information;   Determine self-assessment and audit procedures to obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the  design and implementation of the CSP’s internal controls to meet the Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements as defined by the EUCS by using a review plan.  D.3.3 The audit plan  Sufficient and appropriate objective evidence about the design and implementation of the CSP’s internal controls can  be obtained through, inspection of the provided documentary evidence and if necessary, by inquiry to be able to  evaluate the provided documentary evidence in order to determine whether  1. the evidence addresses the security requirements of the scheme in a sufficiently comprehensive manner;  2. the evidence is sufficiently clear and unambiguous in how the requirements are met and how controls have been  implemented by the CSP;  3. the evidence is prima facie plausible (i.e. it appears in the professional opinion of the reviewer that there are no  elements in the evidence that are manifestly inaccurate, incomplete or false) and verifiable (can in principle be  verified by an on-site audit).  This can be achieved by using a standardized self-assessment and audit plan (To be developed), The CAB shall then  provide the self-assessment plan to the CSP, together with indications on its specific application to the targeted cloud  service.  D.4 EXECUTION  In the phase the auditor shall obtain sufficient and appropriate objective evidence by evaluation the provided  documentary evidence by the CSP regarding:   the suitability of the design of controls, including controls over the out-sourced processes (such as hosting,  infrastructure, platform, etc.) to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined by the EUCS;   the actual existence and implementation of controls to be in accordance with their design as of a point in time  (specified date).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  187  The execution phase starts when the CSP provides the results of their self-assessment, together with all required  supporting documentation. The auditor shall document the procedures executed, the evidence gained and conclusions  reached using a standardized document (To be developed)  A control is suitably designed when actions or events that comprise a risk (e.g. for information security) are prevented  or detected and corrected. Obtaining evidence regarding the suitability of the design of controls requires the auditor to  determine whether   The risks that threaten the achievement of the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements as  defined by the EUCS have been identified by management;   The controls are, if operating effectively, able to prevent or detect Security Control Objectives and related Security  Requirements of the EUCS from not being met.  In order to prevent, or detect and correct actions that comprise a risk, the controls have to be placed in operation as  designed. After the auditor has concluded that a control is suitably designed, is has to be concluded per control  whether the control actually exists and is implemented as designed by examining the provided documentary evidence.  To be able to conclude on this the reviewer shall obtain evidence related to exemplary actions or events that triggered  the occurrence or performance of the controls (e.g. tickets) and to inspect the environment in which it operates (e.g.  suitable configuration of the tools or systems used to execute the control in accordance with the design).  D.5 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  In forming the conclusions on the evidence obtained the auditor shall  1. Evaluate whether the described technical and organizational controls refer to or describe the applicable  requirements of the Certification framework;  2. Consider whether the provided documents adequately disclose the significant information security policies and the  selected and implemented technical and organizational measures;  3. Consider whether the information security policies and technical and organizational measures are deemed  suitable to meet the Security Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS considering the  nature of the service;  4. The information provided appears relevant, reliable, comprehensive and comparable.  On this basis the auditor shall assess if it can be concluded that nothing has come to its attention that causes the  reviewer to believe that the technical and organizational manners warranted by the CSP are not meeting in all material  aspects the requirements of the Basic level in accordance with the Certification framework and that the evidence  presented is at least sufficient for the reviewer to obtain a limited level of assurance.  The auditor shall document the results of the review in the report according to the examples in the (mapping) table  below.  Security Control  Objectives  <Service-Org>’s  Description of Controls  Documentary  evidence used or  other means of  evidence  Test Results  Objective: description  ID – Security  requirement  ID – Title of Control  [Control Description]  Description of the  evidence  Result  There shall be at least one meeting between the CAB and the CSP during the execution phase or the analysis of  results, during which the CAB may ask for additional documentation or make specific inquiries to consolidate the  evidence and the analysis of results.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  188  D.6 ISSUING THE ASSURANCE REPORT  After evaluating the result of the audit procedures, the auditor shall form a conclusion and issue an evaluation report.  The conclusion shall be based on the evidence obtained and the procedures performed, and express whether, in all  material respects, nothing has come to the reviewer’s attention that the  i. CSP’s description does not fairly presents its cloud service, including the controls to meet the Security  Control Objectives and related Security Requirements of the EUCS, and is free from material  misstatements as of a specified date;  ii. controls stated in the CSP’s are not in conformity with the Security Control Objectives and related  Security Requirements of the EUCS as of a specified date.  The reviewer shall issue the assurance report using the template in Annex F: (Scheme Document Content  requirements).  This assurance report shall be first addressed to the CSP.

EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  190  ANNEX F: SCHEME DOCUMENT  CONTENT REQUIREMENTS  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable requirements on the minimum content to be  included in the scheme documents  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter  Foreword for Reviewers  The content of this Annex specifies requirements regarding the content of documents to be used in the scheme.  Some of these requirements have been defined very late in the development of the draft candidate scheme, and  they have not gone through a full review by the members ad hoc working group.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  191  F.1 INTRODUCTION  The objective of this Annex is to define guidelines for the redaction of documents. Rather than providing full templates,  the Annex lists requirements for writing the documents, which typically takes three forms:   Requirements on content that shall be present, without constraints on the format;   Requirements on text that shall be included as is, for a few important statements; and   Requirements on the format and content of tables, to ease comparability of results.  These requirements will be refined by specific guidance for every assessment type (ISO-based, ISAE-based, or  EBCA).  F.1.1 Conventions used in this annex  Every section below starts with an introduction, followed by the requirements on the document, presented in a  sequential manner that defines the structure of the document.  Within each section, this annex uses with the following convention:   Requirements are typeset in plain text.   Guidance is typeset in italics.   Mandatory text is typeset in bold.   Items in a document are referenced by an identifier, which is defined within brackets in <SMALL CAPS>  The rules for using these requirements are as follows:   Specified sections shall be present, in the order defined, but other sections may be added before, between and  after the specified sections;   Within a section, mandatory text shall be present and the section’s requirements shall be fulfilled, but additional  content may be added;  F.1.2 List of the documents  Requirements and guidance are provided in this annex for the following documents:   For the application phase  i) The Application Document, to be filled out by the CSP to initiate a conformity assessment   For the audit preparation phase  i) The Initial Activities Planning document, to be prepared by the CSP at the beginning of the conformity  assessment  ii) The Detailed Audit Plan and Execution, to be prepared by the CSP before the audit and updated with the  results all along the audit.   For the reporting phase  i) The Assurance Report, to be prepared by the CAB to report on the audit of the cloud service from the CSP.  ii) The Evaluation Report, to be prepared by the CAB to report on the assurance provided by the CSP’s  subservice providers and to conclude on the audit by providing a certification recommendation.  iii) The Review Report, to be prepared by the CAB after the internal review of the Assurance and Evaluation  Reports.   For the certification phase  i) The Certification Report, to be prepared by the CAB when the certificate is issued   For the maintenance phase  i) The Impact Analysis Report, to be prepared by the CAB when a request about a potential nonconformity or  vulnerability does not lead to a conformity assessment.  ii) The Maintenance Report, to be prepared by the CAB after a maintenance conformity assessment, with a  focus on the updates to the cloud service and on the reason that triggered the conformity assessment  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  192  These documents do not all have the same usage and availability:   The Application Document, Assurance Report and Evaluation Report are shared between the CSP and the CAB.   In addition, the CSP shall make the Assurance Report available to its customers upon request.   The Initial Activities Planning, Detailed Audit Plan and Execution, and the Review Report are internal documents  for the CAB.   The Certification Report is a public document, to be published together with the certificate.  All documents may be made available by the CAB to the NCCA and NAB for review or assessment.  Finally, the Assurance Report is only available in a version suitable for the Substantial and High assurance levels. A  version suitable for the Basic assurance level will be provided in a later phase. Requirements for the Review Report,  for the Impact Analysis Report and for the Maintenance Report are not available in the current version.

EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  217  F.7 MAINTENANCE REPORTS  F.7.1 Impact analysis report  In some cases, the monitoring activities will lead to requests regarding potential nonconformities or vulnerabilities that  will not lead to a conformity assessment. This report would outline the answer from the SP and the analysis from the  CAB.  F.7.2 Maintenance report  The need for a maintenance report is still under discussion. A maintenance report would be a version of the  certification report tailored for maintenance assessments. In particular, it would focus on the changes since the last  report, to make the crucial information more easily accessible to scheme users.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  218  ANNEX G: CERTIFICATION  LIFECYCLE AND CONTINUED  ASSURANCE  PURPOSE This annex describes additional content related to the chapters on certification  lifecycle and continued assurance  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 11, Compliance Monitoring  Chapter 12, Certificate Management  Chapter 13, Non-Compliance  Chapter 14, New Vulnerabilities  Foreword for Reviewers  This Annex is work in progress; its content is not final, and it is only intended to provide an overview of the planned  processes for the different types of conformity assessment needed.  It has not yet reviewed by the TG3 and TG5 thematic group.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  219  G.1 ASSESSMENT DURING MAINTENANCE  The initial conformity assessment of a cloud service shall cover all parts of the assessment methods defined in  Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels Substantial and  High), Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic) for all EUCS requirements defined in Annex A: (Security Objectives and  requirements for Cloud Services).  However, during maintenance some conformity assessments may be simplified, provided that they follow the minimum  requirements defined below.  G.1.1 Periodic assessment  In a periodic assessment, the conformity assessment shall include at least the following activities.  Analysis of the change in the cloud service  These activities are required at all assurance levels.  The CAB shall at least:   Obtain an understanding of the changes operated since the last assessment in the cloud service and the CSP’s  controls to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements;   Determine a list of affected controls, based on the CSP’s Impact Assessment and if needed on additional  inquiries;   Assess the suitability of the design of the modified controls.   Assess the existence and implementation of the modified controls.  Partial reassessment of controls  These activities are only required at assurance levels Substantial and High.  The CAB shall at least:   Select a subset of controls, including at least the controls for which nonconformities have been detected in the  previous assessment and controls defined in a dedicated guidance to be provided on a regular basis by ENISA  with the support of the ECCG.   Assess the suitability of the design of the modified controls.  Effectiveness assessment  These activities are only required at assurance levels Substantial and High.  The CAB shall at least:   Assess the operating effectiveness of all controls over the period since the previous assessment of operating  effectiveness.  If some controls have been affected by the changes in the cloud service since the last assessment and if they have  been operating for less than 3 months (6 months for level High), the CAB shall assess to which extent of the changes  affect their ability to assess the operating effectiveness of the controls.  G.1.2 Renewal assessment  Alike an initial assessment, a renewal assessment of a cloud service shall cover all parts of the assessment methods  defined in Annex B: (Meta-approach for the assessment of cloud services), Annex C: (Assessment for levels  Substantial and High), Annex D: (Assessment for level Basic) for all EUCS requirements defined in Annex A: (Security  Objectives and requirements for Cloud Services).  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  220  However, in the context of a renewal assessment, some controls may not have changed since the last assessment. In  such cases, the CAB may consider the previous assessment they have made of the suitability of the design in their  analysis, provided that they put their focus on the changes in the risk environment and the potential impact of these  changes on the controls.  G.1.3 Restoration assessment  In the restoration assessment, the objective is to perform a highly focused conformity assessment on the measures  taken by the CSP to fulfil some EUCS requirements for which major nonconformities have been detected.  In a restoration assessment, the conformity assessment shall include at least the following activities.  Analysis of the change in the cloud service  These activities are required at all assurance levels.  The CAB shall at least:   Obtain an understanding of the changes operated since the last assessment in the cloud service and the CSP’s  controls to meet the Security Objectives and related Security Requirements;   Determine a list of affected controls, based on the CSP’s Impact Assessment and if needed on additional  inquiries;   Assess the suitability of the design of the modified controls;   Assess the existence and implementation of the modified controls;   Determine whether the changes on the controls are sufficient to fulfil all the EUCS requirements for which major  nonconformities have been detected  Effectiveness assessment  These activities are only required at assurance levels Substantial and High.  The CAB shall at least:   Assess the operating effectiveness of modified controls over the period since the previous assessment of  operating effectiveness.  Since the controls have been affected by the changes in the cloud service since their last assessment and if they have  been operating for less than 3 months (6 months for level High), the CAB shall assess to which extent of the changes  affect their ability to assess the operating effectiveness of the controls.  G.1.4 Ad hoc assessment  An ad hoc assessment can be triggered by a CSP at any time, typically after performing significant changes to their  cloud service or their security controls, which require a specific assessment.  The mandatory activities for an ad hoc assessment are therefore the same as for a periodic assessment.  G.2 RE-ASSESSMENT AND AUDITS FOR COMPLIANCE MONITORING  Specific procedures may be triggered by the NCCA in the context of compliance monitoring, which are described  below.  G.2.1 Re-assessment  NCCAs are required in the context of the compliance monitoring process to perform a number of re-assessments every  year, depending on the number of certificates issued or maintained during the previous year.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  221  In the first step of the re-assessment, the NCCA shall perform again the review phase performed by the CAB before  taking the decision to issue or maintain the certificate, based on the documentation that was available at the time to the  reviewer.  If needed for their review, the NCCA may contact the CSP in order to be granted access to the documents for which  they have only provided restricted access to the CAB during the audit.  Following this review, the NCCA may request additional information about any of the activities performed during any  stage of the conformity assessment. For each activity, the NCCA may:   request additional information and explanations from the CAB;   have the CAB perform the activity again, possibly while monitored by a NCCA representative;   have a NCCA representative perform the activity again.  Any NCCA representative being granted access to information from the CSP or performing any conformity assessment  shall be submitted to the same requirements as CAB employees performing similar activities.  The CSP shall support re-assessment activities as they supported the original conformity assessment activities.  G.2.2 Compliance audits  The NCCA may request a compliance audit if they have some reasons to doubt that a CSP complies to all their  obligations with respect to the scheme, for instance after receiving a complaint.  The NCCA shall address a compliance audit request to the CAB, indicating the potential non-compliance that is  suspected. Then, the process should be as follows:   The CAB shall transmit the request to the CSP, after adding any information that they deem suitable based on  their knowledge of the certified cloud service;   The CSP shall then analyse the request and provide a motivated answer to the CAB, describing in particular any  non-compliance or nonconformity they may have detected in their analysis, accompanied by supporting  documentation if required;   The CAB shall then analyse the answer from the CSP, and transmit the CSP’s answer with their analysis back to  the NCCA.  If the CSP does not confirm the CSP’s analysis, then the NCCA shall take the final decision after consulting both  parties.  If non-compliance or nonconformities have been detected, then the appropriate process(es) shall be triggered.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  222  ANNEX H: PEER ASSESSMENT  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable procedure for peer assessments  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  Chapter 22, Peer Assessment  Foreword for Reviewers  This Annex has been integrated recently, and it has not yet reviewed by the TG5 thematic group.  This Annex is an adaptation of the Annex 12 of the EUCC scheme. Because the topic is quite generic and covers  the general organization of peer assessment rather than detailed technical requirements, the content has been  only slightly modified.  Because the content has been adapted from EUCC, there may be leftover references to products, Common  Criteria, ITSEFs, and other terms that normally don’t belong to EUCS. Please flag such issues, and take note that  there is no willingness to use these terms here.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  223  H.1 SCOPE  This annex describes the applicable procedure for peer assessments. The procedure consists of four phases:  preparation, site visit, reporting, and adoption of a report.  The procedure only defines the process to be followed. In order to be as comprehensive and objective as possible,  checklists shall be further developed in cooperation with the ECCG to assist the peer assessment team. These  checklists will contain a common understanding of state of the art23 and operating practices.  H.2 OVERVIEW  The primary assessment team shall consist of two EUCS experts (Leader and co-Leader) selected from two CABs  issuing certificates at the assurance level High of the EUCS.  This primary assessment team may be extended with additional EUCS experts from other or the same CABs, and in  the case of a delegation of the issuance of certificates or of prior approval of certificates, an expert from the concerned  NCCA may be associated to the selected CAB expert into the team.  Figure 6: Assessment team organisation  Each EUCS expert in the assessment team shall have a minimum of two years of experience as a certifier at a CAB  issuing EUCS certificates at assurance level High. In addition, at least one EUCS expert in the assessment team shall  have previously participated to the assessment of competences of CABs issuing certificates at level High, as listed in  Chapter 7 (Specific requirements applicable to a CAB).  23 As discussed in cooperation with the ECCG and/or relevant subgroups.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  224  The peer assessment team may be assisted by subject matter experts. Those experts may be certifiers themselves,  but that is not essential.  It is also highly recommended that the peer assessment team members have participated in previous peer  assessments under the EUCS scheme, either as observers or team members.  The peer assessment may be observed by observers proposed by other NCCAs.  The peer assessed CAB may present to the ECCG any concern it has about the choice of the peer assessment team  members and observers, for example in case of a conflict of interest  The peer assessment activities will be carried out in four phases.  The preparation phase will involve the review of the CAB documentation by the members of the peer assessment team  in order to become familiar with the CAB’s policies and procedures.  The site visit phase will consist of a two-week visit by the peer assessment team to the CAB in order to assess the  CAB’s technical competence, and where applicable of auditors performing evaluation activities. The exact duration of  site visit will depend on the possible reuse of existing peer assessment evidence and results, and on the number of  auditors subcontracted by the CAB.  The peer assessment will include a reporting phase: the assessment team will document their findings in a peer  assessment report delivered to the ECCG.  The peer assessment will conclude with the adoption of an opinion by the ECCG of the outcome of the peer  assessment.  H.3 SCHEDULING PEER ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES  In accordance with the planning established by the ECCG, and taking into consideration the possible priorities  indicated in Chapter 22, Peer Assessment, the ECCG shall notify the CAB of the peer assessment, and will task a peer  assessment team to perform the peer assessment.  The peer assessed CAB shall submit the required number of candidate services for which the CAB has performed a  conformity assessment, for review by the peer assessment team. In general the candidate services shall cover all  technical aspects of the audit.  The required number of candidate services is:   At least two (2) services; and   At least one (1) service for every auditor accredited as subcontractor for the CAB at assurance level High, if  applicable.  The requested information and the list of candidate products (and auditors) shall be provided by the peer assessed  CAB to the peer assessment team within one month after the notification by the ECCG.  The assessment team will arrange the dates for the peer assessed CAB and where applicable auditor(s) site visit(s).  H.4 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PEER ASSESSED CB  The peer assessed CAB shall provide the following documentation:   a full description of its scope, organization and operation, including:  o the title, address and principal point of contact;  o its role according to Article 56;  o the accreditation decision for the CAB;  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  225  o the procedures for certification;  o where applicable, the procedures for the prior approval for each individual certificate or the requirements from  a general delegation;  o the rules applying within the peer assessed CB and its internal or external auditors to the protection of  protected other sensitive information;  o the titles and addresses of the auditors participating in the activities and their status (commercial or  governmental);  o the procedures by which the peer assessed CAB ensures that auditors apply the evaluation criteria and  methods correctly and consistently and protect the confidentiality of sensitive information involved;   the latest list of the certificates issues by the peer assessed CAB for the last five years;   two or more certificates and Certification Reports issued which are selected by the peer assessment team;   where reuse of the results of a previous peer assessment is proposed, associated results, under the conditions of  Chapter 22, Peer Assessment;   the list of all auditors that perform evaluations for that domain and a description of the evidence used when  assessing the competences of these auditors.  In addition, all relevant information about the quality management system that has been implemented by the CAB in  order to obtain accreditation by its NAB shall be provided. It should be noted that this information is provided for  informative purposes and that the content of this information is not the focus of the peer assessment. Any deviations  from processes described in these documents that are found shall however be reported.  All written documentation and communications for the peer assessment activities must be provided in English at least  4 weeks before the audit date.  During the site visit, English will be spoken, unless the CAB and the peer assessment team unanimously agree upon  another language.  One part of the peer assessment activities during the site visit will involve a review of at least one evaluation that has  been completed or is close to being completed within the CAB.  Although the conformity assessments for chosen services submitted for consideration need not be entirely complete,  there must be records showing that significant evaluation analysis and certification activities have been performed, and  that the majority of the evaluation report has been delivered to and reviewed by the certification team.  In addition to the selected services, the CAB may also provide the peer assessment team with information on (up to)  another two conformity assessments which were completed in the 12 months prior to the start of the peer assessment  activities. If the peer assessment team has sufficient time and resources, they will review these conformity  assessments during their site visit and, if they are found to be compliant with the EUCS scheme requirements, will take  them into consideration within the peer assessment report.  The CAB is responsible for preparing, documenting and providing general information on the candidate services. This  information will be provided to the peer assessment team for their review and selection and shall include:   a brief overview of the product,   the status of the conformity assessment (if not completed, then indicate what parts have been completed and what  remains to be done),   the target assurance level,   any Security Profile compliance claims.  The peer assessment team will select at least one candidate evaluation(s) to be assessed during the site visit(s) of the  CAB and where applicable of the auditor(s).  The CAB will identify a Point of Contact who will be the individual responsible for facilitating the peer assessment  activities and for interacting with the assessment team leader.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  226  The CAB Point of Contact is responsible for:   Coordinating the site visit(s) dates and location(s) with the peer assessment team,   Delivering the CAB materials to the peer assessment team during the Preparation Phase at least 4 weeks before  the audit date,   Coordinating any required auditor(s) visits with the peer assessment team,   Arranging all necessary approvals to allow the peer assessment team to perform the CB and auditor(s) site visits  and to have access to all information required to complete the peer assessment activities,   Coordinating the peer assessment agenda for the CAB, including scheduling certifiers for peer assessment team  interviews and briefings, ensuring the availability of materials to be reviewed during the site visit, etc.,   Providing the peer assessment team with the ability to have copies and printouts made for use during the site visit;   Providing secure storage, if required, for the peer assessment team’s documents (e.g. lunchtime, overnight);   Being generally available to answer questions and resolve issues that may arise during the site visit,   Coordinating the review of the peer assessment report by CAB representatives,   Providing feedback to the peer assessment team leader on the peer assessment draft report.  The CAB must have private room(s) available that is (are) large enough to accommodate the peer assessment team  and CAB personnel during the site visit(s). Such room(s) will serve as the meeting room throughout the site visit.  Accessibility to records and CAB personnel will be needed throughout the site visit in the meeting room.  H.5 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PEER ASSESSMENT TEAM LEADER  One member of the peer assessment team will be designated the team leader. The team leader is responsible for the  following tasks:   Coordinating the receipt of materials from the CAB,   Coordinating the decision regarding the selection of the candidate services (and auditors) and notification to the  peer assessed CAB,   Drafting the site visit(s) agenda and coordinating it with the CB,   Coordinating and completing the peer assessment draft report at the end of the site visit,   Delivering the peer assessment final report to the ECCG, and   If necessary, monitoring the CAB’s resolution of outstanding issues resulting from the peer assessment.  H.6 PREPARATION PHASE  The peer assessment team should begin preparation approximately four weeks before the site visit. The peer  assessed CAB shall provide the peer assessment team with access to all written policies and operating procedure  documents four weeks before the site visit. Electronic and/or hardcopy documentation have to be provided, depending  on the preference of the peer assessment team members and nature of documentation needed. The peer assessment  team should focus their review of the documentation on gaining an understanding of the CAB’s standard operating  procedures.  The peer assessment team leader will coordinate the review of materials during the preparation phase. If there is a  large amount of material to be reviewed, the team may divide it so that members review different portions of the  documentation. The team leader will also draft and finalize the site visit(s) agenda, with input from the team members,  at the conclusion of the preparation phase. The site visit(s) agenda must be forwarded to the peer assessed CAB no  later than one week before the site visit(s). It is recommended that the peer assessment team leader should maintain  close contact with the CAB Point of Contact during the preparation phase to keep the CAB informed of areas that will  require further investigation during the site visit.  Previous peer assessment results with associated results may be proposed by the CAB for consideration by the peer  assessment team.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  227  H.7 SITE VISIT PHASE  H.7.1 Determine that the constitution and procedures of the CB comply with the general  requirements of the EUCC scheme  A checklist shall be used to determine if the processes that the CAB uses to provide its conformity assessment  services are sufficient to ensure effective oversight of evaluations and to ensure that successful certifications comply  with the requirements of the EUCS scheme.  The CAB shall provide any relevant information associated to its accreditation to support this determination.  Where the peer assessment team decides to check some procedures of the CAB, this should occur before the  assessment process commences. Nevertheless, the peer assessment team should check that the CAB is applying its  procedures. This can be done at the site visit (see below) for the particular conformity assessments being assessed.  H.7.2 Perform the peer assessment  The peer assessment team should allocate two (2) full weeks for the site visit(s). If the peer assessment is completed  in a shorter period of time, the team will not need to stay the full two weeks.  The peer assessment team shall have access to all evaluation and certification documentation that was used by the  CAB during its conformity assessment process and especially when reviewing the evaluation documentation, and shall  be permitted to observe all activities carried out during such review. If an evaluation team/certifier meeting occurs  during the site visit, the peer assessment team should observe the meeting.  The peer assessment team should not completely review the work of the auditor, which may be covered by its own  accreditation. However, the peer assessment team should assess whether the deliverables available to the CAB are of  sufficient quality to allow the CAB to determine that the evaluation was conducted in accordance with the appropriate  methodology.  The peer assessment team will make a determination of an auditor’s technical competence by:   a visit of the auditor’s site,   interviews with audit team members on technical items related to the assessment of EUCS requirements.  Findings corresponds either to   nonconformities that are linked to a requirement from the applicable checklist or to common understanding of state  of the art and operative practices that are not met (or not fulfilled). The latter will be discussed with the ECCG and  could, where appropriate, be incorporated as a new item into the lists for use by future peer assessments.   or observations that correspond to improvement proposals made by the peer assessment team, not directly linked  to requirements from the checklist.  A non-conformity could be either critical or non-critical. A critical non-conformity challenges the reliability of the results  established by the assessed CAB. The peer assessment team shall analyse and describe the impact of each critical  non-conformity.  At the end of the site visit, the peer assessment team should present the list of findings (at least the draft list of non-  conformities associated to their criticality level) to the peer assessed CAB, so that the assessed CAB can establish a  proposed action plan to cover the findings. The peer assessment team should provide the final list of nonconformities  (associated to their criticality level) not later than 4 weeks after the site visit to the peer assessed CAB.  If non-conformities have been identified, the CAB may request the support of the peer assessment team for  establishing an action plan associated to a timescale to implement the relevant measures.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  228  H.8 REPORTING  The peer assessment team shall produce a report that summarizes and explains their findings.  The report should be agreed internally within the peer assessment team. If the peer assessment team cannot agree  internally, then majority and minority opinions shall be included in the report.  The CAB’s disagreement on findings can be incorporated to the report, no later than one month after the report has  been established.  The report shall also present the position of the peer assessment team on the relevance of proposed action plan to  cover the findings, if this plan was submitted to the team prior to the delivery of the report to the ECCG. If evidence that  cover critical non conformity is provided before issuance of the report, the team can reconsider the criticality of the  non-conformity and shall document this change in the report.  The assessment team might include into its report relevant outcomes and findings from other peer assessments  reused.  Findings from the peer assessment team included in the report shall be clearly identified, with a unique and  unambiguous identifier.  The final report shall be produced within three months after the site visit and will be reviewed by the peer assessed  CAB prior to distribution to the ECCG.  For preparation of the final report the following steps will be followed:  1. the peer assessment team will prepare a draft report, including all findings, unresolved minor and major non-  conformities detected during the peer assessment in the preparation phase and the site visit phase, and deliver it  for comments to the assessed CAB (one month);  2. the assessed CAB will comment the draft report, highlighting any points of disagreement and proposing changes  to the report (one month);  3. the peer assessment team will consider the comments received by the CB and produce a final report with possible  revisions (one month).  All three documents at points 1-3 will be delivered to the ECCG by the peer assessment team to give evidence of the  final reporting phase of the peer assessment.  If any deviations of relevance for the NAB have been found, the NAB shall be informed.  The report shall provide one of three possible verdicts:  Pass: The CAB has met all requirements and no measure is required.  Pass with controlled (minor) nonconformities: The CAB has not met all requirements, but has provided a relevant  actions plan and an acceptable timescale for correcting the nonconformities identified by the peer assessment team.  There is no remaining critical nonconformity identified in the report.  Fail: The CAB has not met the requirements and has not provided a relevant action plan and an acceptable timescale  for correcting the nonconformities identified by the peer assessment team  The peer assessment team leader (or a suitable representative with full knowledge of the assessment) shall present  the report to the ECCG, including any disagreement within the team of with the peer assessed CAB. He/she shall  present the findings of the team and its appreciation of how the measures proposed by the CAB will solve the issues.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  229  Where relevant, appropriate additions will be made to the assessment checklist to assist future peer assessment  teams.  H.9 ADOPTION OF PEER ASSESSMENT REPORT  The following procedure is provided to guarantee adequate involvement of the assessed CB to demonstrate prompt  resolution of non-conformities. The procedure also helps limiting the time for the adoption of the peer assessment.  1. The ECCG will request the ECCG subgroup dedicated to maintenance of the EUCS scheme to prepare an opinion  to be adopted by the ECCG on the conducted peer assessment.  2. The ECCG subgroup will meet to discuss the result of the peer assessment (based on documents 1-3) and invite for  the meeting the peer assessment team and the assessed CAB. Following the meeting, one of the following proposals  of opinion will be issued by the ECCG subgroup:   the final report from the assessment team is proposed to be adopted as it is;   an amended final report from the assessment team is proposed to be adopted.  In the case of non-conformities, the opinion to be adopted by the ECCG will include a recommendation to the  assessed CAB to resolve such non-conformities with an indication of the duration allocated to this resolution. This  duration should be limited to 2 months in the general case and should not exceed 6 months.  3. the ECCG subgroup will deliver to the ECCG:   the minutes of the meeting;   the proposed opinion to be adopted by the ECCG.  The ECCG subgroup shall ensure that any feedback on non-conformities or recommendations received by the CAB  that underwent the peer assessment or the NAB will be forwarded along to the ECCG.  4. The ECCG will provide its opinion on the draft opinion. In the case of favourable opinion, the assessed CAB will:   either pass the peer assessment (if the draft opinion indicated a positive verdict of the peer assessment). The  positive verdict will be published on ENISA website directly with the accompanying peer assessment findings.   or be recommended to take the necessary actions to resolve the non-conformities in the allocated duration. The  recommendation will not be published on the ENISA website.  The ECCG may also request the ECCG subgroup to re-examine the peer assessment (starting at point 2. again), only  one time.  5. When corrective actions are requested by the ECCG to the CAB, following the implementation of the corrective  actions, the assessed CAB will issue a report to the ECCG subgroup within 2 months  6. The ECCG subgroup will hold a meeting within 2 months with the assessed CAB and the assessment team to  discuss the status of resolution of the non-conformities. The lack of a report from the assessed CAB will not prevent  the ECCG subgroup to have the meeting.  7. The ECCG subgroup will prepare an opinion to be adopted by the ECCG containing either a pass (successful  correction of non-conformities) or a fail (residual non conformities already in place) and will deliver the proposed  opinion and the minutes of the meeting to the ECCG.  8. The ECCG will establish its opinion based on the draft opinion and adopt the final result (including residual  recommendation, or no recommendation for the CAB). The ECCG will adopt the proposed opinion or adopt its own  opinion, without recurring to further iterations with the ECCG subgroup. The opinion adopted by the ECCG will be  published with all relevant documents on the ENISA website.  EUCS – CLOUD SERVICES SCHEME  December 2020  230  ANNEX I: TERMINOLOGY  PURPOSE This annex describes the applicable terminology for the candidate scheme  CROSS REFERENCE TO THE  CHAPTER(S) WHERE THE ELEMENTS  ARE DECLARED APPLICABLE  All chapters and annexes  Foreword for Reviewers  This Annex defines some vocabulary to be used in the draft candidate scheme.  Its first section defines certification-related terminology. It mostly draws from [ISO17000} and related standards,  and also from other standards such as ISAE standards. This first section will later be reduced in order to leave  only the terms that are actually used in the draft candidate scheme, but the full content is left for now as a  reference.  Its second section defines more general vocabulary, which is used in particular in Annex A: (Security Objectives  and requirements for Cloud Services). Please refer to that section in case of doubt regarding a term used in that  annex. The section is less mature and some definitions will need to be revised.  .

    "abstract": "This publication is a draft version of the EUCS candidate scheme (European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services), which looks into the certification of the cybersecurity of cloud services. In accordance with Article 48.2 of the Cybersecurity Act1 (EUCSA), ENISA has set up an Ad Hoc Working Group (AHWG) to work on the preparation of the candidate scheme on cloud services, as part of the European Cybersecurity Certification Framework. This is a draft version to be used as basis for an external review. The objective of the review is to validate the principles and general organization of the proposed scheme, and to gather feedback on the proposed wording of the sections and annexes."

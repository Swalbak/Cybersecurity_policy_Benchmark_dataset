Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  03  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  Motivation. In a society that moves ever faster digital, cyber security is crucial. Today, many critical  infrastructures and commodities depend on the correct functioning of communication services. But, that is  only the beginning; with the aid of computing as service, big data and artificial intelligence based  applications are ready to hit the mass market. This will increase the dependency on information and  communication services even more. Unfortunately, this development creates also opportunity for less  well-meaning subjects. Already today criminal business models, terrorist activities, and state sponsored  attacks on cyber infrastructure are on the rise and there is no indication that this trend will turn around  soon.  Quite some time has passed since details about ongoing malicious state sponsored activities in the cyber  space have been publicly revealed.1 Since then, state sponsored activities ranked as one of the top  concerns for most governments and executives worldwide and EU.2 This development is a consequence of  various revelations3 and high-impact cyber-security incidents that are allegedly attributed to cyber- espionage campaigns4,5,6,7.  Fuelled by the frequent headlines on state sponsored surveillance, a debate is taking place concerning  cyber security, data protection, and privacy8,9,10. It is a necessary debate to reinforce trust in and resilience  of IT infrastructures and services, and the efficiency of their protection measures. Moreover, such  headlines serve as trigger to understand and assess the bigger picture of variants of state sponsored  activities that might include: cyber-espionage, non-lawful state surveillance, cyber-sabotage, and cyber- war. The interplay of actors, motives, capabilities and tools involved in these aggression acts need to be  analysed and understood, prior to the development of proper cyber-defence strategies.  Before getting into ENISA’s activities to secure the EU’s information networks, we need to reflect on the  term hostile state sponsored cyber activity. Throughout this paper, we consider that any state sponsored  activity that undermines the information and network security of another state or its of its citizens as such  an activity. Note, in the past it was often stated, that the quality difference between state sponsored and  criminal activities was mainly a difference of resources.

As a consequence, a system that is vulnerable to  state sponsored attacks, is most likely as vulnerable to criminal activities.  As network and information security (NIS) and hostile state sponsored activities have opposing objectives,  these developments have consequences for cyber security: many voices refer to the failure in protecting  data in cyber space; while others, e.g. security experts, see it as proof of a long known, yet unspoken  threat, the so-called “elephant in the room”. Regardless of the view taken, it is a fact that the cyber  security community needs to digest these developments, reassess their purpose, scope and develop  efficient defence strategies. All this is of paramount importance to the European Union and Member  States and is being followed closely by EU bodies and ENISA in particular.  ENISA policy context. In the light of what is at stake, ENISA is mandated to “[…] assist the Union  institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and the Member States in implementing the policies necessary to  meet […] requirements of network and information security […] thus contributing to the proper  functioning of the internal market”11. In this context, ENISA is setting out its position with regard to recent  discussions concerning the interplay and balance between cyber security and data protection. Moreover,  ENISA considers its involvement in these discussions to be a natural consequence of the fact that this  debate concerns potentially “[…] unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability,  authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data and the related services offered by  or accessible via those networks and systems”12.  ENISA’s related activities. While examining cyber-security topics in the context of security, resilience and  privacy, ENISA has touched upon numerous aspects and topics that are related to cyber-defence against  state sponsored aggressions. Yet not completely covering all aspects of this cyber-threat, this work is a  good basis for i) elaborating on available protection measures and assess the level of mitigation of this  threat and ii) understanding gaps and additional topics to be addressed in the development of  corresponding defences.  Here we need to point to ENISA’s work on the assessment of cyber-security trends of current cyber- threats. This work covers developments regarding state-of-play of state sponsored activities and rates their  importance. A further group of related ENISA material covers technologies to defend infrastructures.  Worth mentioning in this context is the work on cloud computing, big data, encryption, and privacy  enhancing technologies, as well as incident sharing, notification and coordination schemes. In the  reminder of this paper, we summarize relevant findings in those areas. Aim of this discussion is to  underline the relevance of this material in reducing the attack surface of technological systems to any  attack including state sponsored attacks.  Trends in cyber security threats. ENISA has assessed the major developments regarding the cyber- espionage threat.13 The assessment covers related threats, risks, and their impact, which follow recent  state sponsored activities based on information published in the media. With focus on state sponsored  activities, we assess the following trends in the domain of cyber security:   US agencies maintain many cyber-tools – also referred to as cyber-weapons – to hack their  opponents.3  11 REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL, of 21st May 2013, Art. 1, 1.  12 REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL, of 21st May 2013, Art. 1.3  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016, accessed April 2017.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  05   Cyber-operations have been launched to affect important political events in other countries, e.g. in the  form of influencing public opinion during elections; such attempts are seen as most serious influences  of democracies.   Governments are increasingly targeted by cyber-espionage campaigns.   State sponsored activities occupy very skilled and capable actors, posing thus a great challenge to the  defenders.   When called upon to defend their infrastructures, countries will need to set up novel structures and  capabilities, such as cyber-police and cyber-army. Such developments lead to impressive campaigns  that happen as we speak.14   Current legal frameworks may be insufficient for ruling involvement of democratic states in cyber- warfare activities. Member states will need to re-consider their laws to accommodate courses of  defensive actions15.   Due to increased interest in cyber-defence/cyber-attack capabilities, there will be a race in staffing  required positions. This trend may lead to blurry lines across lawful and malicious actor engagement.16  This is a serious risk.   A plethora of novel attack and defence scenarios will be launched/developed when all these new  players come to unfold their activities in the cyber-space.   Vendors of services will face challenges when called upon to fulfil security requirements related to  state sponsored activities, such as maintenance of data confidentiality, data quality, and data  integrity.17,18   Key industrial players – notably the ones acting in the supply chain of critical infrastructures – will need  to coordinate their security activities (i.e. policies, architectures, response, continuity) to be in the  position to withstand state-sponsored attacks.  Through prospective ENISA work, these trends will be continuously validated and also considered when  applicable. Examples are the ENISA activities following up on threats emerging from these threat actors;  ENISA activities leading to the protection of critical infrastructures, coordination of European response  team, ENISA following relevant policy and technological developments, observing market reactions and  liaising with industry, identifying proper protection requirements, supporting relevant stakeholders.  Apart from these trends, the concerns of industry and consumers need to be taken into account. These  concerns are related to the trust of existing digital services and products and might affect the relevant  market segments. Given the importance of the Digital Single Market to the EU’s economy and society, its  protection from cyber threats is crucial. This, in turn, demands an effective European industry to supply  the necessary NIS products and services.  Technologies to defend Infrastructures. The above listed threats should make clear that we need use any  tool at hand to protect our information society. Cryptographic tools are one of the most important  weapons against cyber-attacks. These tools provide confidentiality and integrity to electronic  14 https://www.bundeswehrkarriere.de/it?pk_campaign=Digitale%20Kraefte%20Cyber%20Kick- Off&pk_kwd=SPON_SB_X00118159 , accessed April 2017.  15 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-wie-weit-duerfen-die-hacker-der-regierung-gehen-a- 1141966.html, accessed April 2017.  16 http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-difference-between-state-backed-hackers-and-cybercrime-gangs- nothing-at-all/, accessed April 2017.  17 https://www.good.is/articles/facebook-trust-news, accessed April 2017.  18 https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/merkel-cabinet-backs-facebook-fines-to-stem-fake- news-in-germany, accessed April 2017.  https://www.bundeswehrkarriere.de/it?pk_campaign=Digitale%20Kraefte%20Cyber%20Kick-Off&pk_kwd=SPON_SB_X00118159 https://www.bundeswehrkarriere.de/it?pk_campaign=Digitale%20Kraefte%20Cyber%20Kick-Off&pk_kwd=SPON_SB_X00118159 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-wie-weit-duerfen-die-hacker-der-regierung-gehen-a-1141966.html http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-wie-weit-duerfen-die-hacker-der-regierung-gehen-a-1141966.html http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-difference-between-state-backed-hackers-and-cybercrime-gangs-nothing-at-all/ http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-difference-between-state-backed-hackers-and-cybercrime-gangs-nothing-at-all/ https://www.good.is/articles/facebook-trust-news https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/merkel-cabinet-backs-facebook-fines-to-stem-fake-news-in-germany https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/merkel-cabinet-backs-facebook-fines-to-stem-fake-news-in-germany  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  06  communication services and data stores. However, there has always been a tension between security, in  the sense of public safety and law enforcement, and the use of cryptographic tools. This tension has  resurfaced in the light of recent terrorist attacks in Europe.  Law enforcement agencies report an increasing number of cases where electronic evidence cannot be  interpreted due to encryption. In this light some politicians ask for quick solutions from the IT industry that  provide access to encrypted information, which reopened a debate on key escrow and backdoors.  Throughout this debate, advocates of cryptography have often been discredited by the motion that “if you  do nothing wrong then you have nothing to hide” and strong confidentiality is often presented as threat to  security.  However, this argument falls too short, backdoors and key escrow even when implemented with the best  intentions, is a weapon that can be easily turned to its owner. The implementation of such means will  make systems more complex and it will introduce new vulnerabilities which might be used by criminals,  terrorists and unfriendly state actors, as detailed out in ENISA’s position on lawful interception.19  Another technology area that comprises an interesting target for state sponsored activities is big data. It  will allow for obtaining massive information about a big sample of intelligence sources. Big data analytics  and hyper computing are the prospective tools for data collection, data mining and trend analytics; the  computing power these mechanisms can provide will minimise the time of analysis and at the same time  maximising the granularity of the result. This can be achieved due to the large volume of information  included. Increasing the volume of data, increases the attack impact20 by providing massive information.  Based on recent ENISA reports21, eavesdropping, interception and hijacking (cyber espionage indications)  are threats of high probability in Big Data, as the software distributions rarely have protocols that ensure  data confidentiality and integrity between communicating applications enabled or configured properly  (security by default techniques, removing back doors). Moreover, as this model is based on the Cloud  computing business model, Big Data also inherit the challenges Cloud presents.  Finally, as regards Cloud Computing, ENISA has pointed out the risks related to foreign states' national  interests and the interception of data transfers over the Internet in its Cloud Risk Assessment22. When it  comes to the threat of data being accessed with the cooperation of the Cloud provider, the only mitigation  action possible would be to ensure that encryption is used when data are transmitted and/or stored. Note  that in such a scenario, the way in which the cryptographic keys are managed is critical and the challenge  will be to find solutions that offer the required level of security at a reasonable cost. Security certification23  of the Cloud Service Provider is now a precondition for a customer and evidence needs to be provided in  regular phases.  Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Cryptographic tools are important defence mechanisms against  cyber-attacks, c.f. ENISA’s position on Cryptographic tools24. While strait forward crypto implementations  can protect confidentiality and integrity of data towards outsiders, PETs consider adversaries that play a  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-position-on-crypto, accessed  April 2017.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security, accessed April 2017  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security, accessed April 2017  22https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-security-and-resilience/publications/cloud-computing-benefits-risks-and- recommendations-for-information-security/view , accessed April 2017  23 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification , accessed April 2017  24 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on- encryption, accessed April 2017  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-position-on-crypto https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-security-and-resilience/publications/cloud-computing-benefits-risks-and-recommendations-for-information-security/view https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-security-and-resilience/publications/cloud-computing-benefits-risks-and-recommendations-for-information-security/view https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on-encryption https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on-encryption  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  07  role in a certain service, e.g., we can hide the identity of communication partners from the communication  service provider or the search phrase from a database host. Such technologies can increase the trust users  have in a given service in a society that increasingly depends on electronic services, which process large  amounts of personal data.  However, PETs also have a positive effect on network security by reducing the attack surface. Service  Providers that implement PETs can, e.g. minimize the data they need to protect, hence even a successful  attack will not gain access to excessive amounts of data. Further, data can be decomposed and distributed  in such a way that an adversary needs to compromise several services to recompose data items for a  successful attack. Our work on privacy by design helps service providers to implement such  mechanisms25,26.  Incident notification and information/intelligence sharing. It has been already understood that it is  important to understand the origin and purpose of security incidents. Incident notification has been part of  European regulation in the areas of Telecommunication and since recently in other areas of critical  information infrastructures. In the context of Cloud Computing, for example, the NIS Directive extends the  provisions of the Telecoms Package27 to Digital Service Providers (including CSP). Like Article13a in the  Telecom sector, Article 15 will impose incident reporting on the cloud providers. National competent  authorities, having under their jurisdiction cloud providers, will be established, thus enhancing Cloud  security, privacy and resilience across the EU. ENISA is supporting the activities of the proposal, paving the  way for a new era in Cloud security.  Incident notification is an important tool towards defending state sponsored activities. Yet, the creation of  the necessary holistic view of an attack will be difficult to create. This fact is aggravated by the difficulty of  attribution of attacks in cyber-space. In addition to incident notification, sharing schemes will be necessary  in order to exchange information and intelligence about cyber-attacks. Given the fully confidential nature  of defence of state sponsored attacks, the establishment of information sharing and analysis schemes will  be difficult to achieve.  Certification. Even for experts, it might be hard to assess the quality of a crypto product. A number of  European legislative initiatives related to information technology have been launched in the recent years.  The most relevant of them are the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the eIDAS  Regulation and the Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2). These legal acts rely on the availability  of trustworthy information technology products that support the deployment of robust information  systems in Europe.  Trustworthiness and security of information technology products can be enhanced by setting in place a  certification framework. In Europe, a common scheme would support the recognition of security  certification across Member States, an essential pillar towards achieving trust and security required to  promote the Digital Single Market. Currently, there is no such framework at European level, although the  already existing mechanism SOG-IS includes 10 Member States and Norway.  Conclusion. For another time reality comes to lead taboos of the past ad absurdity: although in the past  state sponsored activities have not been seriously considered, in today’s digital society state sponsored  attacks play a role at the first line of cyber-defence. Fortunately, the defence against such adversaries is no  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design, accessed April 2017.  26 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/pets, accessed April 2017.  27 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140 , accessed April 2017  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/pets http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  08  different than from other malicious users. Hence, available know-how on cyber-defence mechanisms are  fully capable of defending this cyber-threat.  In the light of the current trends in state sponsored activities, we see the following emerging issues (non- exhaustive, non-prioritised):   Work on attribution of incidents and recognition of targets/campaigns.   Coordination of available defence forces.   Identification of defence strategies tailored to state sponsored activities.   Identification of necessary synergies and emergency plans towards defending states sponsored  attacks.   Development of guidance for cyber-diplomacy.   Development of common attack scenarios/methods and their defence.   Elaborate on the role of cyber-threat intelligence and enforce its use to structure defences.   Identification of potential cyber-tools and methods portfolios for this types of attacks.   Elaborate on methods to trace activities of related threat agents and improve attribution of cyber- attacks.   Revise legal frameworks to accommodate defence activities to state sponsored cyber-attacks.   Include this kind of attacks to risk and threat assessments.   Find appropriate options to properly operate and reduce attack surface of existing security  controls, in particular regarding encryption and privacy enhancing technologies.

As a consequence, a system that is vulnerable to  state sponsored attacks, is most likely as vulnerable to criminal activities.  As network and information security (NIS) and hostile state sponsored activities have opposing objectives,  these developments have consequences for cyber security: many voices refer to the failure in protecting  data in cyber space; while others, e.g. security experts, see it as proof of a long known, yet unspoken  threat, the so-called “elephant in the room”. Regardless of the view taken, it is a fact that the cyber  security community needs to digest these developments, reassess their purpose, scope and develop  efficient defence strategies. All this is of paramount importance to the European Union and Member  States and is being followed closely by EU bodies and ENISA in particular.  ENISA policy context. In the light of what is at stake, ENISA is mandated to “[…] assist the Union  institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and the Member States in implementing the policies necessary to  meet […] requirements of network and information security […] thus contributing to the proper  functioning of the internal market”11. In this context, ENISA is setting out its position with regard to recent  discussions concerning the interplay and balance between cyber security and data protection. Moreover,  ENISA considers its involvement in these discussions to be a natural consequence of the fact that this  debate concerns potentially “[…] unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability,  authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data and the related services offered by  or accessible via those networks and systems”12.  ENISA’s related activities. While examining cyber-security topics in the context of security, resilience and  privacy, ENISA has touched upon numerous aspects and topics that are related to cyber-defence against  state sponsored aggressions. Yet not completely covering all aspects of this cyber-threat, this work is a  good basis for i) elaborating on available protection measures and assess the level of mitigation of this  threat and ii) understanding gaps and additional topics to be addressed in the development of  corresponding defences.  Here we need to point to ENISA’s work on the assessment of cyber-security trends of current cyber- threats. This work covers developments regarding state-of-play of state sponsored activities and rates their  importance. A further group of related ENISA material covers technologies to defend infrastructures.  Worth mentioning in this context is the work on cloud computing, big data, encryption, and privacy  enhancing technologies, as well as incident sharing, notification and coordination schemes. In the  reminder of this paper, we summarize relevant findings in those areas. Aim of this discussion is to  underline the relevance of this material in reducing the attack surface of technological systems to any  attack including state sponsored attacks.  Trends in cyber security threats. ENISA has assessed the major developments regarding the cyber- espionage threat.13 The assessment covers related threats, risks, and their impact, which follow recent  state sponsored activities based on information published in the media. With focus on state sponsored  activities, we assess the following trends in the domain of cyber security:   US agencies maintain many cyber-tools – also referred to as cyber-weapons – to hack their  opponents.3  11 REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL, of 21st May 2013, Art. 1, 1.  12 REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL, of 21st May 2013, Art. 1.3  13 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016, accessed April 2017.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-report-2016  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  05   Cyber-operations have been launched to affect important political events in other countries, e.g. in the  form of influencing public opinion during elections; such attempts are seen as most serious influences  of democracies.   Governments are increasingly targeted by cyber-espionage campaigns.   State sponsored activities occupy very skilled and capable actors, posing thus a great challenge to the  defenders.   When called upon to defend their infrastructures, countries will need to set up novel structures and  capabilities, such as cyber-police and cyber-army. Such developments lead to impressive campaigns  that happen as we speak.14   Current legal frameworks may be insufficient for ruling involvement of democratic states in cyber- warfare activities. Member states will need to re-consider their laws to accommodate courses of  defensive actions15.   Due to increased interest in cyber-defence/cyber-attack capabilities, there will be a race in staffing  required positions. This trend may lead to blurry lines across lawful and malicious actor engagement.16  This is a serious risk.   A plethora of novel attack and defence scenarios will be launched/developed when all these new  players come to unfold their activities in the cyber-space.   Vendors of services will face challenges when called upon to fulfil security requirements related to  state sponsored activities, such as maintenance of data confidentiality, data quality, and data  integrity.17,18   Key industrial players – notably the ones acting in the supply chain of critical infrastructures – will need  to coordinate their security activities (i.e. policies, architectures, response, continuity) to be in the  position to withstand state-sponsored attacks.  Through prospective ENISA work, these trends will be continuously validated and also considered when  applicable. Examples are the ENISA activities following up on threats emerging from these threat actors;  ENISA activities leading to the protection of critical infrastructures, coordination of European response  team, ENISA following relevant policy and technological developments, observing market reactions and  liaising with industry, identifying proper protection requirements, supporting relevant stakeholders.  Apart from these trends, the concerns of industry and consumers need to be taken into account. These  concerns are related to the trust of existing digital services and products and might affect the relevant  market segments. Given the importance of the Digital Single Market to the EU’s economy and society, its  protection from cyber threats is crucial. This, in turn, demands an effective European industry to supply  the necessary NIS products and services.  Technologies to defend Infrastructures. The above listed threats should make clear that we need use any  tool at hand to protect our information society. Cryptographic tools are one of the most important  weapons against cyber-attacks. These tools provide confidentiality and integrity to electronic  14 https://www.bundeswehrkarriere.de/it?pk_campaign=Digitale%20Kraefte%20Cyber%20Kick- Off&pk_kwd=SPON_SB_X00118159 , accessed April 2017.  15 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-wie-weit-duerfen-die-hacker-der-regierung-gehen-a- 1141966.html, accessed April 2017.  16 http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-difference-between-state-backed-hackers-and-cybercrime-gangs- nothing-at-all/, accessed April 2017.  17 https://www.good.is/articles/facebook-trust-news, accessed April 2017.  18 https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/merkel-cabinet-backs-facebook-fines-to-stem-fake- news-in-germany, accessed April 2017.  https://www.bundeswehrkarriere.de/it?pk_campaign=Digitale%20Kraefte%20Cyber%20Kick-Off&pk_kwd=SPON_SB_X00118159 https://www.bundeswehrkarriere.de/it?pk_campaign=Digitale%20Kraefte%20Cyber%20Kick-Off&pk_kwd=SPON_SB_X00118159 http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-wie-weit-duerfen-die-hacker-der-regierung-gehen-a-1141966.html http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundeswehr-wie-weit-duerfen-die-hacker-der-regierung-gehen-a-1141966.html http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-difference-between-state-backed-hackers-and-cybercrime-gangs-nothing-at-all/ http://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-difference-between-state-backed-hackers-and-cybercrime-gangs-nothing-at-all/ https://www.good.is/articles/facebook-trust-news https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/merkel-cabinet-backs-facebook-fines-to-stem-fake-news-in-germany https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-05/merkel-cabinet-backs-facebook-fines-to-stem-fake-news-in-germany  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  06  communication services and data stores. However, there has always been a tension between security, in  the sense of public safety and law enforcement, and the use of cryptographic tools. This tension has  resurfaced in the light of recent terrorist attacks in Europe.  Law enforcement agencies report an increasing number of cases where electronic evidence cannot be  interpreted due to encryption. In this light some politicians ask for quick solutions from the IT industry that  provide access to encrypted information, which reopened a debate on key escrow and backdoors.  Throughout this debate, advocates of cryptography have often been discredited by the motion that “if you  do nothing wrong then you have nothing to hide” and strong confidentiality is often presented as threat to  security.  However, this argument falls too short, backdoors and key escrow even when implemented with the best  intentions, is a weapon that can be easily turned to its owner. The implementation of such means will  make systems more complex and it will introduce new vulnerabilities which might be used by criminals,  terrorists and unfriendly state actors, as detailed out in ENISA’s position on lawful interception.19  Another technology area that comprises an interesting target for state sponsored activities is big data. It  will allow for obtaining massive information about a big sample of intelligence sources. Big data analytics  and hyper computing are the prospective tools for data collection, data mining and trend analytics; the  computing power these mechanisms can provide will minimise the time of analysis and at the same time  maximising the granularity of the result. This can be achieved due to the large volume of information  included. Increasing the volume of data, increases the attack impact20 by providing massive information.  Based on recent ENISA reports21, eavesdropping, interception and hijacking (cyber espionage indications)  are threats of high probability in Big Data, as the software distributions rarely have protocols that ensure  data confidentiality and integrity between communicating applications enabled or configured properly  (security by default techniques, removing back doors). Moreover, as this model is based on the Cloud  computing business model, Big Data also inherit the challenges Cloud presents.  Finally, as regards Cloud Computing, ENISA has pointed out the risks related to foreign states' national  interests and the interception of data transfers over the Internet in its Cloud Risk Assessment22. When it  comes to the threat of data being accessed with the cooperation of the Cloud provider, the only mitigation  action possible would be to ensure that encryption is used when data are transmitted and/or stored. Note  that in such a scenario, the way in which the cryptographic keys are managed is critical and the challenge  will be to find solutions that offer the required level of security at a reasonable cost. Security certification23  of the Cloud Service Provider is now a precondition for a customer and evidence needs to be provided in  regular phases.  Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). Cryptographic tools are important defence mechanisms against  cyber-attacks, c.f. ENISA’s position on Cryptographic tools24. While strait forward crypto implementations  can protect confidentiality and integrity of data towards outsiders, PETs consider adversaries that play a  19 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-position-on-crypto, accessed  April 2017.  20 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security, accessed April 2017  21 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security, accessed April 2017  22https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-security-and-resilience/publications/cloud-computing-benefits-risks-and- recommendations-for-information-security/view , accessed April 2017  23 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification , accessed April 2017  24 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on- encryption, accessed April 2017  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisa-position-on-crypto https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/big-data-security https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-security-and-resilience/publications/cloud-computing-benefits-risks-and-recommendations-for-information-security/view https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-security-and-resilience/publications/cloud-computing-benefits-risks-and-recommendations-for-information-security/view https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on-encryption https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-position-papers-and-opinions/enisas-opinion-paper-on-encryption  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  07  role in a certain service, e.g., we can hide the identity of communication partners from the communication  service provider or the search phrase from a database host. Such technologies can increase the trust users  have in a given service in a society that increasingly depends on electronic services, which process large  amounts of personal data.  However, PETs also have a positive effect on network security by reducing the attack surface. Service  Providers that implement PETs can, e.g. minimize the data they need to protect, hence even a successful  attack will not gain access to excessive amounts of data. Further, data can be decomposed and distributed  in such a way that an adversary needs to compromise several services to recompose data items for a  successful attack. Our work on privacy by design helps service providers to implement such  mechanisms25,26.  Incident notification and information/intelligence sharing. It has been already understood that it is  important to understand the origin and purpose of security incidents. Incident notification has been part of  European regulation in the areas of Telecommunication and since recently in other areas of critical  information infrastructures. In the context of Cloud Computing, for example, the NIS Directive extends the  provisions of the Telecoms Package27 to Digital Service Providers (including CSP). Like Article13a in the  Telecom sector, Article 15 will impose incident reporting on the cloud providers. National competent  authorities, having under their jurisdiction cloud providers, will be established, thus enhancing Cloud  security, privacy and resilience across the EU. ENISA is supporting the activities of the proposal, paving the  way for a new era in Cloud security.  Incident notification is an important tool towards defending state sponsored activities. Yet, the creation of  the necessary holistic view of an attack will be difficult to create. This fact is aggravated by the difficulty of  attribution of attacks in cyber-space. In addition to incident notification, sharing schemes will be necessary  in order to exchange information and intelligence about cyber-attacks. Given the fully confidential nature  of defence of state sponsored attacks, the establishment of information sharing and analysis schemes will  be difficult to achieve.  Certification. Even for experts, it might be hard to assess the quality of a crypto product. A number of  European legislative initiatives related to information technology have been launched in the recent years.  The most relevant of them are the NIS Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the eIDAS  Regulation and the Revised Directive on Payment Services (PSD2). These legal acts rely on the availability  of trustworthy information technology products that support the deployment of robust information  systems in Europe.  Trustworthiness and security of information technology products can be enhanced by setting in place a  certification framework. In Europe, a common scheme would support the recognition of security  certification across Member States, an essential pillar towards achieving trust and security required to  promote the Digital Single Market. Currently, there is no such framework at European level, although the  already existing mechanism SOG-IS includes 10 Member States and Norway.  Conclusion. For another time reality comes to lead taboos of the past ad absurdity: although in the past  state sponsored activities have not been seriously considered, in today’s digital society state sponsored  attacks play a role at the first line of cyber-defence. Fortunately, the defence against such adversaries is no  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design, accessed April 2017.  26 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/pets, accessed April 2017.  27 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140 , accessed April 2017  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/privacy-and-data-protection-by-design https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/pets http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0140  Securing the Cyber Space in the Light of State Sponsored Activities  May 2017  08  different than from other malicious users. Hence, available know-how on cyber-defence mechanisms are  fully capable of defending this cyber-threat.  In the light of the current trends in state sponsored activities, we see the following emerging issues (non- exhaustive, non-prioritised):   Work on attribution of incidents and recognition of targets/campaigns.   Coordination of available defence forces.   Identification of defence strategies tailored to state sponsored activities.   Identification of necessary synergies and emergency plans towards defending states sponsored  attacks.   Development of guidance for cyber-diplomacy.   Development of common attack scenarios/methods and their defence.   Elaborate on the role of cyber-threat intelligence and enforce its use to structure defences.   Identification of potential cyber-tools and methods portfolios for this types of attacks.   Elaborate on methods to trace activities of related threat agents and improve attribution of cyber- attacks.   Revise legal frameworks to accommodate defence activities to state sponsored cyber-attacks.   Include this kind of attacks to risk and threat assessments.   Find appropriate options to properly operate and reduce attack surface of existing security  controls, in particular regarding encryption and privacy enhancing technologies.

When implemented correctly, multi- factor authentication can make it significantly more difficult for an adversary to steal legitimate credentials to facilitate  further malicious activities on a network. Due to its effectiveness, multi-factor authentication is one of the Essential  Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents .  This publication has been developed to provide guidance on what multi-factor authentication is, different multi-factor  authentication methods that exist and why some multi-factor authentication methods are more secure, and therefore  more effective, than others. It also discusses how multi-factor authentication is different to multi-step authentication.  Multi-factor authentication should be implemented for remote access solutions, users performing privileged actions  and users accessing important (sensitive or high-availability) data repositories. Using multi-factor authentication  provides a secure authentication mechanism that is not as susceptible to brute force attacks as traditional single-factor  authentication methods using passwords or passphrases.  Why multi-factor authentication is important?  Adversaries frequently attempt to steal legitimate user or administrative credentials when they compromise a network.  These credentials allow them to easily propagate on a network and conduct malicious activities without additional  exploits, thereby reducing the likelihood of detection. Adversaries will also try to gain credentials for remote access  solutions, including Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), as these accesses can further mask their activities and reduce the  likelihood of being detected.  When multi-factor authentication is implemented correctly, it is significantly more difficult for an adversary to steal a  complete set of credentials as the user has to prove they have physical access to a second factor that either they have  (e.g. a physical token, smartcard or software certificate) or are (e.g. a fingerprint or iris scan).  When implementing multi-factor authentication, it is essential that it is done so correctly to minimise security  vulnerabilities and to avoid a false sense of security that could leave a network vulnerable. For example, when multi- factor authentication is used for remote access solutions in an organisation, but not for corporate workstations, an  adversary could compromise the username/passphrase from a device used for remote access and then use it to  authenticate either locally to a corporate workstation or to propagate within a network after compromising an initial  workstation on the network via spear phishing techniques. In such a scenario, multi-factor authentication for remote  access is significantly better than single-factor authentication but does not negate the requirement for appropriately  hardened devices to be used as part of a comprehensive remote access solution.  Implementing Multi-Factor  Authentication  First published: January 2012  Last updated: October 2021  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  2  What is multi-factor authentication?  Multi-factor authentication is defined as ‘a method of authentication that uses two or more authentication factors to  authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier’.  The authentication factors that make up a multi-factor authentication request must come from two or more of the  following:   something the claimant knows (e.g. a personal identification number (PIN), password or response to a challenge)   something the claimant has (e.g. a physical token, smartcard or software certificate)   something the claimant is (e.g. a fingerprint or iris scan).  The claimant being authenticated may be a person, device, service, application or any other security principal that can  be authenticated within the system.  An authentication verifier is an entry point to a confined sub-system where a single technical authentication policy is  enforced.  Multi-factor authentication often involves the use of passphrases in addition to one or more of the following multi- factor authentication methods:   Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys   physical one-time PIN (OTP) tokens   biometrics   smartcards   mobile apps   Short Message Service (SMS) messages, emails or voice calls   software certificates.  If an authentication method at any time offers a user the ability to reduce the number of authentication factors to a  single factor it is by definition no longer a multi-factor authentication method. A common example of this is when a  user is offered the ability to ‘remember this computer’ for a public web resource. In such a scenario, a user may be  authenticated initially using multi-factor authentication but a token is then set on their device such that subsequent  authentications use a single factor (usually a passphrase) as long as the token on their device is accessible and valid. In  this scenario, the claimant verified by the token is the user’s web browser rather than the user. As such, it violates the  requirement for two or more authentication factors to authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier.  Furthermore, the token has characteristics more akin to a session token than an authentication factor, which makes it  unsuitable for the purposes of authentication.  Multi-factor authentication versus multi-step  authentication  A common authentication approach often confused with multi-factor authentication is multi-step authentication. Multi- step authentication is an architectural approach to accessing resources sequentially through multiple authentication  verifiers. Each authentication verifier grants access to increasingly privileged areas of the system until access to the  desired resources is achieved. Authentication verifiers may be single-factor or multi-factor in nature.  3  While multi-step authentication may significantly improve the security of a system, it is easier for an adversary to  bypass than multi-factor authentication as there is no single point within the system that uses two or more  authentication factors to authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier. As a result, an adversary can  incrementally compromise a system, gaining ever increasing access while never having to overcome the requirement  for multi-factor authentication. For this reason, multi-step authentication is not a suitable substitute for multi-factor  authentication.  Consider a remote access solution. In this scenario (see diagram below), a computer has an Internet Protocol Security  (IPsec) certificate that authenticates the computer to the VPN concentrator, a user has a passphrase that authenticates  them to the VPN concentrator and then a passphrase that authenticates them to the Active Directory (AD) domain.  This scenario demonstrates multi-step authentication; however, there is no multi-factor authentication implemented in  this scenario. When authenticating to the VPN concentrator, the user and computer are considered separate claimants,  therefore the computer’s IPsec certificate and the user’s passphrase are not a form of multi-factor authentication.  Furthermore, the user authenticates separately to the VPN concentrator and to the AD domain. These authentications  take place on different authentication verifiers and fail to use different types of authentication factors; therefore, this  approach is also not multi-factor authentication.  The risk associated with this scenario is that an adversary may be able to compromise the computer’s IPsec certificate  at one point in time, compromise the passphrase the user uses to authenticate to the VPN concentrator at another  point in time and, finally, compromise the user’s AD credentials at yet another point in time. In this way the adversary is  able to increase their access over time, which increases the level of risk associated with this approach.  Consider a second remote access solution. In this scenario (see diagram below), the user is authenticated to the VPN  concentrator using a passphrase and one-time PIN from a physical token. All other authentication steps are the same as  in the previous scenario.  This scenario demonstrates a relatively secure remote authentication architecture with a multi-factor authentication  method used to authenticate the user to the VPN concentrator. In this case, the computer is authenticated with single- factor authentication in the form of the computer’s IPsec certificate. The multi-factor authentication takes place on  entry into the remote access environment (using the user’s passphrase and one-time PIN), which verifies access  through to the corporate environment, which remains protected by single-factor authentication in the form of the  user’s passphrase.  4  Are all multi-factor authentication methods  equally effective?  While all forms of multi-factor authentication listed in this publication provide significant advantages over single-factor  authentication, some methods are more effective than others. Notably, multi-factor authentication is most effective  when one of the authentication factors is physically separate from the device from which the user is accessing the  system or resource, such as using a physical token rather than a software certificate.  To maximise the security effectiveness of any multi-factor authentication method chosen, the authentication service (if  a dedicated authentication server) should be hardened and isolated from the rest of the network as much as possible.  This can be achieved by (at a minimum):   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (where applicable)   implementing appropriate network segmentation and segregation to limit the types of network traffic to and  from the authentication service to only traffic required for its proper operation, with particular care paid to which  devices and users on the network can access the authentication service directly   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors.  Multi-factor authentication methods  U2F security keys  This multi-factor authentication method uses a physical token or card (referred to as either a U2F security key or U2F  authenticator) as a second factor. Software on the user’s device prompts the user to either press a button on the U2F  security key or tap it using Near Field Communication (NFC). In doing so, the U2F security key uses public key  cryptography to verify the user’s identity by signing a challenge-response request from a service which had been passed  through via a web browser or mobile app. The service then verifies that the response is signed by the valid and correct  private key for that service, and grants or denies access to resources.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  5  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users do not store U2F security keys with their devices, especially those with NFC capabilities   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  authenticate using their U2F security key   use U2F security keys that have been certified to the latest U2F specification version   instruct users to report any lost or missing U2F security keys as soon as practical.  Physical one-time PIN tokens  This multi-factor authentication method uses a physical token that displays a time-limited one-time PIN on its screen as  a second factor. Alternatively, the user may be required to press a button on a physical token, which is connected to  their device, to submit the one-time PIN on their behalf. The time on both the physical token and the authentication  service are synchronised and the authentication service knows what one-time PIN should be used by all physical tokens  that it services at a particular time. When the user authenticates with a passphrase and one-time PIN, the  authentication service verifies that all details are correct for that user and grants or denies access to resources.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users do not store physical tokens with their devices   set the expiry time of the one-time PIN generated by physical tokens to the lowest value practical   instruct users to report any lost or missing physical tokens as soon as practical   ensure users know that they should never provide details (such as the serial number) of their physical token  unless they are certain it is being requested by their ICT support staff.  Biometrics  This multi-factor authentication method uses biometrics, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, as a second factor. When the  user enrols they provide a scan of the appropriate biometric as a reference point for the authentication service to  compare to. When the user authenticates they provide a passphrase along with their biometric data, the authentication  service verifies both the passphrase and the biometric data with those provided at enrolment, and grants or denies  access to resources. It should be noted though, that for every biometric mechanism, due to the wide range of  differences between individuals, some of the potential users will not be able to successfully enrol.  There are, however, potential security vulnerabilities in this multi-factor authentication method caused by the fact that  biometric characteristics are not secrets (especially if the biometric reader converts biometric data into a hashed form),  biometric matching is probabilistic rather than deterministic, and there is a reliance on the biometric capture software  installed on the user’s device. If an adversary compromises the user’s device and gains elevated privileges, then it is  possible for the adversary to use the services provided by the biometric capture software to intercept and replay  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/ https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  6  legitimate authentication requests or initiate fraudulent authentication requests on the user’s behalf – within the  limitations of any anti-replay measures. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biometrics is reliant on the quality of the  biometric readers and capture software to ensure that false negatives (denying access when it should be allowed) and,  more importantly, false positives (granting access when it should have been denied) provide an appropriate trade-off.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  provide their biometric data   ensure an alternative authentication method, including supplementary security measures, is implemented for  cases where users cannot successfully enrol using biometrics.  Smartcards  This multi-factor authentication method uses a private key stored on a smartcard as a second factor. Software on the  user’s device prompts the user to unlock the smartcard by entering a PIN or password. When the smartcard is  successfully unlocked, the software on the device verifies the user’s identity by signing an authentication request with  the user’s private key. The authentication service then verifies that the authentication request is signed by the valid and  correct private key, and grants or denies access to resources.  Like biometrics, this multi-factor authentication method has a potential security vulnerability due to the software  involved in interacting with the smartcard. If the user’s device is compromised and an adversary gains elevated  privileges, they can potentially intercept and replay legitimate authentication requests or initiate fraudulent  authentication requests on the user’s behalf – within the limitations of any anti-replay measures.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users do not store smartcards with their devices   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  unlock their smartcard   instruct users to not leave their smartcard inserted into their device and unlocked   instruct users to report any lost or missing smartcards as soon as practical.  Mobile apps  This multi-factor authentication method uses a time-limited one-time PIN or password provided via a mobile app as a  second factor. When the user enrols they either scan a QR code or provide a phone number or an email address so that  a one-time PIN or password can be provided to them to register the mobile app. During the logon process the user  requests the mobile app to provide them with a one-time PIN or password in order to complete the authentication  process. The user then provides this information to the authentication service, which verifies that all details are correct  for that user and grants or denies access to resources.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  7  The advantage of this multi-factor authentication method is that it uses a second factor that the user already has and  therefore minimises the cost to the system owner; however, there are also a number of disadvantages, namely:   use of devices for web browsing or reading emails may mean that the device running the mobile app may no  longer be secure   many devices are not secure and a device can be compromised by motivated and competent adversaries,  particularly when travelling overseas.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure the expiry time of the one-time PIN or password generated via the mobile app is set to the lowest value  practical   instruct users to report the theft or loss of a device running the mobile app, even if it is a personal device, as soon  as practical.  SMS messages, emails or voice calls  This multi-factor authentication method uses a time-limited one-time PIN or password provided via an SMS message,  email or voice call to a device as a second factor. When the user enrols they provide a phone number or an email  address so that a one-time PIN or password can be provided to them to register. During the logon process the user  requests that the authentication service provide them with a one-time PIN or password in order to complete the  authentication process. The user then provides this information to the authentication service, which verifies that all  details are correct for that user and grants or denies access to resources.  The advantage of this multi-factor authentication method is that it uses a second factor that the user already has and  therefore minimises the cost to the system owner; however, there are also a number of disadvantages, namely:   depending on the user’s location, telecommunication networks may have degraded service or no service at all,  which may affect the availability to receive a one-time PIN or password   use of devices for web browsing or reading emails may mean that an SMS message, email or voice call containing  the one-time PIN or password may no longer be secure, particularly when SMS messages are delivered via VoIP or  internet messaging platforms   many devices are not secure and a device can be compromised by motivated and competent adversaries,  particularly when travelling overseas   telecommunication networks do not provide end-to-end security and an SMS message, email or voice call may be  intercepted by motivated and competent adversaries, particularly when travelling overseas.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used, as well as those receiving second factors, as much as possible, this can be achieved  by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  8   set the expiry time of the one-time PIN or password provided via an SMS message, email or voice call to the  lowest value practical   instruct users to report the theft or loss of their device, even if it is a personal device, as soon as practical.  Software certificates  This multi-factor authentication method uses a software certificate stored on a device as a second factor. When the  user wishes to authenticate, the system attempts to access the user’s software certificate, which is stored in a file, in  the registry or in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) of their device. If successful, the software installed on their device  assists the user to verify their identity by signing an authentication request with the user’s private key. The  authentication service then verifies that the authentication request is signed by the valid and correct private key, and  grants or denies access to resources.  The security vulnerability in this multi-factor authentication method is due to a reliance on the software and the  operating system installed on the user’s device. If an adversary compromises the user’s device, then it is possible for  the adversary to use the services provided by the software in order to intercept and replay legitimate authentication  requests or initiate fraudulent authentication requests on the user’s behalf – within the limitations of any anti-replay  measures. By compromising the user’s device, an adversary can gain access to both authentication factors easily with a  low likelihood of detection. There is also the additional risk that if an adversary can gain elevated privileges, the user’s  keys and certificates can be stolen from their device and used by the adversary from their own devices or infrastructure  to enable prolonged and difficult to detect remote access to a network. For this reason, it is recommended that  organisations only use software certificates for low risk transactions or systems.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  enter their PIN or password to access their software certificate   store the software certificate in the device’s TPM (if present), otherwise store it in the device’s certificate store  rather than in a regular file on the device’s local storage   instruct users to report the theft or loss of their device, even if it is a personal device, as soon as practical.

Implementing Multi-Factor  Authentication  First published: January 2012  Last updated: October 2021  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  2  What is multi-factor authentication?  Multi-factor authentication is defined as ‘a method of authentication that uses two or more authentication factors to  authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier’.  The authentication factors that make up a multi-factor authentication request must come from two or more of the  following:   something the claimant knows (e.g. a personal identification number (PIN), password or response to a challenge)   something the claimant has (e.g. a physical token, smartcard or software certificate)   something the claimant is (e.g. a fingerprint or iris scan).  The claimant being authenticated may be a person, device, service, application or any other security principal that can  be authenticated within the system.  An authentication verifier is an entry point to a confined sub-system where a single technical authentication policy is  enforced.  Multi-factor authentication often involves the use of passphrases in addition to one or more of the following multi- factor authentication methods:   Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security keys   physical one-time PIN (OTP) tokens   biometrics   smartcards   mobile apps   Short Message Service (SMS) messages, emails or voice calls   software certificates.  If an authentication method at any time offers a user the ability to reduce the number of authentication factors to a  single factor it is by definition no longer a multi-factor authentication method. A common example of this is when a  user is offered the ability to ‘remember this computer’ for a public web resource. In such a scenario, a user may be  authenticated initially using multi-factor authentication but a token is then set on their device such that subsequent  authentications use a single factor (usually a passphrase) as long as the token on their device is accessible and valid. In  this scenario, the claimant verified by the token is the user’s web browser rather than the user. As such, it violates the  requirement for two or more authentication factors to authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier.  Furthermore, the token has characteristics more akin to a session token than an authentication factor, which makes it  unsuitable for the purposes of authentication.  Multi-factor authentication versus multi-step  authentication  A common authentication approach often confused with multi-factor authentication is multi-step authentication. Multi- step authentication is an architectural approach to accessing resources sequentially through multiple authentication  verifiers. Each authentication verifier grants access to increasingly privileged areas of the system until access to the  desired resources is achieved. Authentication verifiers may be single-factor or multi-factor in nature.  3  While multi-step authentication may significantly improve the security of a system, it is easier for an adversary to  bypass than multi-factor authentication as there is no single point within the system that uses two or more  authentication factors to authenticate a single claimant to a single authentication verifier. As a result, an adversary can  incrementally compromise a system, gaining ever increasing access while never having to overcome the requirement  for multi-factor authentication. For this reason, multi-step authentication is not a suitable substitute for multi-factor  authentication.  Consider a remote access solution. In this scenario (see diagram below), a computer has an Internet Protocol Security  (IPsec) certificate that authenticates the computer to the VPN concentrator, a user has a passphrase that authenticates  them to the VPN concentrator and then a passphrase that authenticates them to the Active Directory (AD) domain.  This scenario demonstrates multi-step authentication; however, there is no multi-factor authentication implemented in  this scenario. When authenticating to the VPN concentrator, the user and computer are considered separate claimants,  therefore the computer’s IPsec certificate and the user’s passphrase are not a form of multi-factor authentication.  Furthermore, the user authenticates separately to the VPN concentrator and to the AD domain. These authentications  take place on different authentication verifiers and fail to use different types of authentication factors; therefore, this  approach is also not multi-factor authentication.  The risk associated with this scenario is that an adversary may be able to compromise the computer’s IPsec certificate  at one point in time, compromise the passphrase the user uses to authenticate to the VPN concentrator at another  point in time and, finally, compromise the user’s AD credentials at yet another point in time. In this way the adversary is  able to increase their access over time, which increases the level of risk associated with this approach.  Consider a second remote access solution. In this scenario (see diagram below), the user is authenticated to the VPN  concentrator using a passphrase and one-time PIN from a physical token. All other authentication steps are the same as  in the previous scenario.  This scenario demonstrates a relatively secure remote authentication architecture with a multi-factor authentication  method used to authenticate the user to the VPN concentrator. In this case, the computer is authenticated with single- factor authentication in the form of the computer’s IPsec certificate. The multi-factor authentication takes place on  entry into the remote access environment (using the user’s passphrase and one-time PIN), which verifies access  through to the corporate environment, which remains protected by single-factor authentication in the form of the  user’s passphrase.  4  Are all multi-factor authentication methods  equally effective?  While all forms of multi-factor authentication listed in this publication provide significant advantages over single-factor  authentication, some methods are more effective than others. Notably, multi-factor authentication is most effective  when one of the authentication factors is physically separate from the device from which the user is accessing the  system or resource, such as using a physical token rather than a software certificate.  To maximise the security effectiveness of any multi-factor authentication method chosen, the authentication service (if  a dedicated authentication server) should be hardened and isolated from the rest of the network as much as possible.  This can be achieved by (at a minimum):   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (where applicable)   implementing appropriate network segmentation and segregation to limit the types of network traffic to and  from the authentication service to only traffic required for its proper operation, with particular care paid to which  devices and users on the network can access the authentication service directly   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors.  Multi-factor authentication methods  U2F security keys  This multi-factor authentication method uses a physical token or card (referred to as either a U2F security key or U2F  authenticator) as a second factor. Software on the user’s device prompts the user to either press a button on the U2F  security key or tap it using Near Field Communication (NFC).

Physical one-time PIN tokens  This multi-factor authentication method uses a physical token that displays a time-limited one-time PIN on its screen as  a second factor. Alternatively, the user may be required to press a button on a physical token, which is connected to  their device, to submit the one-time PIN on their behalf. The time on both the physical token and the authentication  service are synchronised and the authentication service knows what one-time PIN should be used by all physical tokens  that it services at a particular time. When the user authenticates with a passphrase and one-time PIN, the  authentication service verifies that all details are correct for that user and grants or denies access to resources.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users do not store physical tokens with their devices   set the expiry time of the one-time PIN generated by physical tokens to the lowest value practical   instruct users to report any lost or missing physical tokens as soon as practical   ensure users know that they should never provide details (such as the serial number) of their physical token  unless they are certain it is being requested by their ICT support staff.  Biometrics  This multi-factor authentication method uses biometrics, such as a fingerprint or iris scan, as a second factor. When the  user enrols they provide a scan of the appropriate biometric as a reference point for the authentication service to  compare to. When the user authenticates they provide a passphrase along with their biometric data, the authentication  service verifies both the passphrase and the biometric data with those provided at enrolment, and grants or denies  access to resources. It should be noted though, that for every biometric mechanism, due to the wide range of  differences between individuals, some of the potential users will not be able to successfully enrol.  There are, however, potential security vulnerabilities in this multi-factor authentication method caused by the fact that  biometric characteristics are not secrets (especially if the biometric reader converts biometric data into a hashed form),  biometric matching is probabilistic rather than deterministic, and there is a reliance on the biometric capture software  installed on the user’s device. If an adversary compromises the user’s device and gains elevated privileges, then it is  possible for the adversary to use the services provided by the biometric capture software to intercept and replay  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/ https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  6  legitimate authentication requests or initiate fraudulent authentication requests on the user’s behalf – within the  limitations of any anti-replay measures. Furthermore, the effectiveness of biometrics is reliant on the quality of the  biometric readers and capture software to ensure that false negatives (denying access when it should be allowed) and,  more importantly, false positives (granting access when it should have been denied) provide an appropriate trade-off.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  provide their biometric data   ensure an alternative authentication method, including supplementary security measures, is implemented for  cases where users cannot successfully enrol using biometrics.  Smartcards  This multi-factor authentication method uses a private key stored on a smartcard as a second factor. Software on the  user’s device prompts the user to unlock the smartcard by entering a PIN or password. When the smartcard is  successfully unlocked, the software on the device verifies the user’s identity by signing an authentication request with  the user’s private key. The authentication service then verifies that the authentication request is signed by the valid and  correct private key, and grants or denies access to resources.  Like biometrics, this multi-factor authentication method has a potential security vulnerability due to the software  involved in interacting with the smartcard. If the user’s device is compromised and an adversary gains elevated  privileges, they can potentially intercept and replay legitimate authentication requests or initiate fraudulent  authentication requests on the user’s behalf – within the limitations of any anti-replay measures.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users do not store smartcards with their devices   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  unlock their smartcard   instruct users to not leave their smartcard inserted into their device and unlocked   instruct users to report any lost or missing smartcards as soon as practical.  Mobile apps  This multi-factor authentication method uses a time-limited one-time PIN or password provided via a mobile app as a  second factor. When the user enrols they either scan a QR code or provide a phone number or an email address so that  a one-time PIN or password can be provided to them to register the mobile app. During the logon process the user  requests the mobile app to provide them with a one-time PIN or password in order to complete the authentication  process. The user then provides this information to the authentication service, which verifies that all details are correct  for that user and grants or denies access to resources.  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  7  The advantage of this multi-factor authentication method is that it uses a second factor that the user already has and  therefore minimises the cost to the system owner; however, there are also a number of disadvantages, namely:   use of devices for web browsing or reading emails may mean that the device running the mobile app may no  longer be secure   many devices are not secure and a device can be compromised by motivated and competent adversaries,  particularly when travelling overseas.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure the expiry time of the one-time PIN or password generated via the mobile app is set to the lowest value  practical   instruct users to report the theft or loss of a device running the mobile app, even if it is a personal device, as soon  as practical.  SMS messages, emails or voice calls  This multi-factor authentication method uses a time-limited one-time PIN or password provided via an SMS message,  email or voice call to a device as a second factor. When the user enrols they provide a phone number or an email  address so that a one-time PIN or password can be provided to them to register. During the logon process the user  requests that the authentication service provide them with a one-time PIN or password in order to complete the  authentication process. The user then provides this information to the authentication service, which verifies that all  details are correct for that user and grants or denies access to resources.  The advantage of this multi-factor authentication method is that it uses a second factor that the user already has and  therefore minimises the cost to the system owner; however, there are also a number of disadvantages, namely:   depending on the user’s location, telecommunication networks may have degraded service or no service at all,  which may affect the availability to receive a one-time PIN or password   use of devices for web browsing or reading emails may mean that an SMS message, email or voice call containing  the one-time PIN or password may no longer be secure, particularly when SMS messages are delivered via VoIP or  internet messaging platforms   many devices are not secure and a device can be compromised by motivated and competent adversaries,  particularly when travelling overseas   telecommunication networks do not provide end-to-end security and an SMS message, email or voice call may be  intercepted by motivated and competent adversaries, particularly when travelling overseas.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used, as well as those receiving second factors, as much as possible, this can be achieved  by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors  https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents https://www.cyber.gov.au/resources-business-and-government/essential-cyber-security/strategies-mitigate-cyber-security-incidents  8   set the expiry time of the one-time PIN or password provided via an SMS message, email or voice call to the  lowest value practical   instruct users to report the theft or loss of their device, even if it is a personal device, as soon as practical.  Software certificates  This multi-factor authentication method uses a software certificate stored on a device as a second factor. When the  user wishes to authenticate, the system attempts to access the user’s software certificate, which is stored in a file, in  the registry or in the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) of their device. If successful, the software installed on their device  assists the user to verify their identity by signing an authentication request with the user’s private key. The  authentication service then verifies that the authentication request is signed by the valid and correct private key, and  grants or denies access to resources.  The security vulnerability in this multi-factor authentication method is due to a reliance on the software and the  operating system installed on the user’s device. If an adversary compromises the user’s device, then it is possible for  the adversary to use the services provided by the software in order to intercept and replay legitimate authentication  requests or initiate fraudulent authentication requests on the user’s behalf – within the limitations of any anti-replay  measures. By compromising the user’s device, an adversary can gain access to both authentication factors easily with a  low likelihood of detection. There is also the additional risk that if an adversary can gain elevated privileges, the user’s  keys and certificates can be stolen from their device and used by the adversary from their own devices or infrastructure  to enable prolonged and difficult to detect remote access to a network. For this reason, it is recommended that  organisations only use software certificates for low risk transactions or systems.  For maximum security and effectiveness, the following security measures should be implemented when using this  multi-factor authentication method:   harden the devices being used as much as possible, this can be achieved by (at a minimum)   implementing the Essential Eight from the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  (if applicable)   applying any specific hardening advice provided by vendors   ensure users receive a visual notification each time an authentication request is generated that requires them to  enter their PIN or password to access their software certificate   store the software certificate in the device’s TPM (if present), otherwise store it in the device’s certificate store  rather than in a regular file on the device’s local storage   instruct users to report the theft or loss of their device, even if it is a personal device, as soon as practical.

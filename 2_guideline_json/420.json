Executive Summary  For the fifth consecutive year, last October the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign was  successfully executed across Europe. The campaign was coordinated and supported by ENISA, the European  Commission, Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), European Banking Federation, the Estonian Information  Systems Authority and cyber security organisations from the Member States. The support for which  propelled the campaigns success as measured by both the qualitative and quantitative data compiled.  Although this year’s campaign continues to break new records, the conclusions of this report highlight a  number of fundamental areas that need to be addressed in the coming years if the campaign is to continue  to grow and more importantly influence the security behaviour of citizens online.  Citizens across Europe face similar information security threats and information asset vulnerabilities; this is  because most of the platforms, operating systems and devices used are produced by the incumbent global  product/service providers. This applies to mobile phones, email messaging services, laptops and social media  channels, since the vast majority of European citizens use similar technologies. However, citizens of each  Member State have different levels of cyber security knowledge and behaviour. These differences across  Member States may be triggered by the disparity of Member States in their commitment to awareness  raising. In particular some Member States have a dedicated team of experts for planning and executing  national security awareness campaigns;  for example, the BSI in Germany and the ANSSI in France. Other  Member States assign this role to a Ministry or Government CERT alongside their other core activities  without a dedicated representative.  The effects of this is that there is a discrepancy between the measures that citizens may apply for the same  or similar vulnerability or risk is one Member State compared to that of another Member State. An example  of the situation, the Eurobarometer survey1 highlights many differences across Member States in the use of  cyber security measures, such as firewalls or the awareness of phishing attacks. Therefore, the different level  of citizens’ awareness and the potential risk-taking behaviour across Europe in turn leads to an increase in  the risk level of Europe as a whole.  The concept for the European Cyber Security Month is to address this disparity across Member States in two  stages. The first stage is to support the Member States so that the awareness and behaviour of citizens in  each Member State is raised to a mature baseline. This becomes the reference baseline across the whole of  Europe and thereby the European Cyber Security Month aligns the risk levels across Europe. The second  stage is to further lower this risk by raising the maturity of citizen’s behaviour in unison; at the European  level. ENISA and the European Commission can achieve the objectives of the European Cyber Security Month  by driving the pan-European campaign so as to ensure all Member States are actively committed to the  European Cyber Security Month and that industry is also involved at all levels of the campaign both at the  local and European level.  The ground work is in place for the European Cyber Security Month to move to the next level. This next level  will be achieved only once a governance structure has been put in place as highlighted in the conclusions of  this report.  Furthermore a governance structure will ensure that the campaign is driven by MS as they are  ultimately the benefactors of the campaign.  A secondary reason for establishing a governance structure is  1 [1] http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  http://intraenisa/reqs/Shared%20Documents/929%20ECSM%20concept%20paper/2017%2010%2020%20Concept%20Note%20ECSM.docx#_ftnref1 http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  06  to achieve another goal raised in the conclusions of this report which is to increase the commitment of the  MS to the campaign and to bring on board those MS that have yet to designate a competent body to the  campaign.  This report provides an overview of the activities organised and presents a synthesis of findings on the basis  of evaluation and performance information gathered via a questionnaire and media monitoring data.  The report is structured into three main parts: an introduction, the implementation phase and an evaluation  of the campaign.  The introduction will provide readers with the policy context, scope and target audience of the campaign.  The implementation phase of the report highlights the milestones that were achieved during the planning  and execution phase of the campaign.  This includes how events were organized and co-ordinated with  partners, marketing materials used and insights into the execution of the campaign including results.  The final section of the report deals with the evaluation of the campaign, comparing this year’s results with  the previous year’s and also provides input from the partners that was generated via a questionnaire; and  finishes with a conclusion and outlook for the future.Documenting the activities of ECSM 2017 will assist in  the organization and execution of future ECSM campaigns and allow for comparing the campaign with the  results from previous years. The evaluation results and estimated impact of ECSM activities will provide the  opportunity to discuss lessons learned deriving from this exercise and to helps draw attention to related  concerns and opportunities for further improvement.  Finally the report is intended to provide a basis for discussion among the Member States, the European  Commission and ENISA on how the ECSM can best be organised in the years to come. All Member States will  need to face up to similar challenges, namely how to engage citizens and organizations so as to affect their  information security behaviour.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  07  2. Introduction  In 2013 the EU published the “Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union”2 as a means to safeguard the  online environment and to provide the highest possible freedom and security, for the benefit of EU citizens.  This strategy was jointly adopted by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy. It outlines the EU's vision in this domain, clarifies roles and responsibilities and  proposes specific activities at EU level. Its goal is to ensure strong and effective protection and promotion of  citizens' rights so as to make the EU's online environment the safest in the world.  End users play a crucial role in ensuring security of networks and information systems. In this context they  need to be made aware of the risks they face online and be empowered to take simple steps to guard against  them. Several initiatives were developed in recent years. In particular, in October 2012, ENISA, with some  Member States, piloted the \"European Cyber Security Month\" campaign.  In the context of the ECSM project, the Commission invited the Member States to organise a yearly  cybersecurity month with the support of ENISA and the involvement of the private sector, with the goal to  raise awareness among end users. ECSM and the private sector were also encouraged to join efforts in order  to promote cybersecurity awareness at all levels, both in business practices and in the interface with  customers.  ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with ENISA publishing new material and focusing on a different  topic each week. Along with ENISA, various stakeholders, ranging from the private sector, academia, the  European Commission (EC) and other EU bodies, joining together in a common vision by organising activities  with special focus on training, conferences, online quizzes and provide general presentations to end users  toward the establishment of an EU cyber-security culture.  This report summarises the activities carried out by ENISA and the participating MS for the 2017 campaign  and presents the evaluation and conclusions of the campaign. More importantly, it seeks to trigger a  discussion among partners with respect to improvements that can be made in the future.  Scope and Objectives  The scope of this report includes all the activities within the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  campaign and their impact in 2017.  The main objectives of the campaigns within ECSM 2017 were as follows:   to generate general awareness about Network and Information Security;   to enhance awareness on information privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation;   to promote safer use of the Internet for all users;   to stimulate awareness on information security for Internet of Things;   to build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   to involve relevant stakeholders and increase the participation of EU Member States;  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-cybersecurity-strategy-european-union- %E2%80%93-open-safe-and-secure-cyberspace  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  08   to increase national media interest through the European and international dimension of the  project;   to enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media  coordination.  Evaluation Methodology  In 2017 ENISA developed an evaluation strategy to guide the Agency and MS with the gathering of data and  information for the evaluation of the campaign. Member State coordinators were urged to consider and  define the evaluation metrics duirng the planning stage of the campaign, so that the right data and  information would be collected during the execution stage.  The evaluation strategy includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches from the following sources:  1. collection of quantitative data from the MS campaign coordinators,  2. feedback from the MS campaign coordinators via the end of year Q&A questionnaire, and  3. the use of media monitoring services to gather analytical data.  An evaluation data collection form (see Annex B)  was developed by ENISA in collaboration with the Member  State coordinators for the purpose of information gathering. The evaluation form aims at extracting  pertinent information on the overall activities involved in the MS campaigns, their potential impact and  includes participants’ feedback. Guidelines (in Annex C) accompanied the data collection form, that highlight  recommended metics for each type of activity  The evaluation strategy also included a questionnaite, where the aim was to extract information on the  overall impact of the campaign based on MS campaign coordinators feedback with respect to ENISA’s  supportive role. Some of the elements assessed involve the level of support and its usefulness to MS, the  impact of promotion material used and marketing strategies followed and the role of ECSM for improving  the the outreach of MS campaigns.  The data gathered was procured by a media monitoring service and was aggregated by combining data  elements from different sources to provide insights to identify the effectiveness of the messages, media  channels and the campaign as a whole in reaching the general population.  Target Audience  This report is intended for organisations, either public or private, which supported the ECSM or intend to do  so in the future. The report is also of interest to IT security professionals and other target groups who  attended events and conferences organised across Europe during the month of October the past five years.  Further, the report targets EU national policy makers who aim to improve the security awareness of citizens,  professionals and generally IT end-users.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  09  3. Planning Phase  The role of ENISA for ECSM 2017  3.1.1 Vision statement  ENISA’s vision for ECSM is to support the Member States with the design and implementation of their  awareness raising campaigns and to promote collaboration among EU Member States, international  organizations and industry.  3.1.2 Mission statement  ENISA’s mission for ECSM is to collaborate with the EU Member States and international organizations by  finding innovative and fun ways to raise EU citizens awareness of cybersecurity, be they by organizing events,  conferences, online quizzes, transferring of best practices or the use social media to educate and inform the  public. Our mission is to enhance the delivery and synchronize ECSM among the EU Member States and  industry that will share a pan-European vision and values for cybersecurity.  3.1.3 The Objectives for ECSM 2017  A consensus on the goals of ENISA for ECSM was reached with the participating MS. The goals that were  recognized by all MS for the Agency are as follows:   To promote the underlying value that is the foundation of ECSM:  “Cyber Security is a Shared Responsibility”   To assist the Member States in implementing ECSM activities that satisfy certain criteria: have well- defined objectives, have well-specified target audience(s) per activity, have systematically defined  cybersecurity subjects, have systematically chosen delivery channels and techniques and have well- defined effectiveness metrics   To support the Member States in defining common areas of concern for cybersecurity that are shared  and will be commonly promoted to EU citizens   To support the Member States in delivering at least one cross-border awareness raising activity among  at least three EU Member States   To support the Member States with collaboration with the private sector  ENISA supported the organisation of the European Cyber Security Month campaign in various ways, such as:   coordinator of the organisation of ECSM;   hub for all participating MS;   collector of available material and generator of synergies between MS;   subject-matter expert on how to organise information security campaigns;   subject-matter expert on how to design the content and evaluation strategy for information security  campaigns;   facilitator of common messaging within the participating MS by providing tips and advice on how to be  safe and secure online;  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  10   creator of the ECSM brand and related marketing plan;   distributor of promotional material (posters and infographics).  The Agency coordinated the organisation of the ECSM campaign, by means of becoming a “hub” for all  participating MS and providing suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating synergies between MS  where possible. The Agency assisted the participating MS in defining evaluation methods and metrics during  the planning phase, in order to ensure the alignment of campaign targets and evaluation approaches.  ENISA’s Guidelines for Planning the ECSM Campaigns  ENISA developed and distributed a set of guidelines (see Annex D) to Member State coordinators for  planning the ECSM campaigns from 2017 onwards. These guidelines related to three aspects of planning a  campaign:   the objectives of security awareness,   the development of a project plan to minimize unforeseen obstacles,   and the formulation of a communication plan, including adequate delivery channels and  content.  3.2.1 A common Understanding of Security Awareness  Guideline 1: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to create campaigns aiming at activating users to  protect information from security threats. Campaigns are expected to attract recipients’ attention and make  them recognize information security concerns and respond accordingly. ECSM campaigns should also  strengthen users’ abilities to accurately perceive potential privacy threats, with regards to their shared  personal information.  3.2.2 Formulating a Project Plan  Guideline 2: Member State Coordinators are recommended to develop an ECSM project plan that can guide  management with the design, execution and evaluation of the campaign. It is imperative to produce a  documented project plan.  3.2.3 Creating a Communication Plan  Guideline 3: Member State Coordinators need to clearly define the target group or groups of the ECSM  campaign. The Member State Coordinators can broadly separate target audience into general users, young  people or business users. The design of the ECSM campaign should be customized upon the defined target  groups.  Guideline 4: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to choose information security themes addressing  both a) commonly identified security threats, and/or b) threats identified by national or international  classifications as current security threats.  Coordination  3.3.1 Conference Calls and Meetings  ENISA maintained regular communication with the MS, in order to enhance collaboration and cooperation  amongs the MS. The Agency scheduled monthly conference calls for the MS to share their plans for ECSM,  receive and provide feedback and to support in the common promotion of the pan-European campaign  strategy.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  11  The Agency prepared and distributed the meeting agenda before each conference call. Meeting minutes  where drawn up by ENISA after every call, and included a list of action points. The participation rate was  high, with an average of 12 to 15 participates per meeting.  A physical meeting was organized by ENISA and held in Brussels in April 2017. The meeting gave MS the  opportunity to discuss concerns and opportunities for improvements and finalize key areas of the campaign,  such as the themes of the month, the collaboration infrastructure and the organization and logistics of the  kick-off event.  3.3.2 Communication and Collaboration Technological Infrastracture  The collaboration mechanisms used for communication with MS is crucial for planning and executing the  campaign. ENISA provided three types of software tools for maintaining communication:  1. file repository and file exchange tools,  2. teleconference software and  3. tools for the communication and collaboration between Member State coordinators and third parties  (e.g., the private sector)  3.3.2.1 File repository and File Exchange Tools  ENISA proposed the utilisation of ENISA Sharepoint for accessing and storing files. The MS agreed on the  necessity of a file repository and registered to the proposed platform. The file repository facilitated the work  of the MS that was previously supported with the exchange of files via email.  3.3.2.2 Teleconference Software  Monthly conference calls were executed during the year in order to maintain regular contact with the MS.  The selection of the teleconference software was noted as an important decision, given that there were a  number of network and application restrictions on the side of the MS. In particular, certain tools (i.e.,  business versions, consumer versions) could not be utilised because they were restricted on the premises or  the equipment of the coordinators’ public agencies. The Agency acted as a facilitator by proposing several  options and the coordinators gradually narrowed down the option to WebX which was used in the latter end  of the year to host the monthly conference calls  3.3.2.3 Collaboration between Member State Coordinators  An important task during the planning of MS campaigns is the information sharing between the coordinators.  Information sharing regarding the MS plans allows for the identification of synergies. In order to support the  MS with this task, the Agency developed two templates to extract pertinent information.   The Activities Template, is used by coordinators to document the awareness activities that are planned by  the MS for ECSM. The ECSM activities template was designed by the Agency as a form with predetermined  options (dropdown list) given the type of activity (e.g., workshop, TV advertisement, online activity), the  relevant security theme and the target audience (e.g., home users).   The Evaluation Template, is used by the coordinators to record the evaluation information for the executed  awareness activities. The Agency prepared the evaluation report with predetermined security awareness  metrics (e.g., number of advertisement impressions, number of conference participants) and the  coordinators completed the adequate values.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  12  3.3.3 Themes of the Month  ENISA organized a workshop on April 2017 in Brussels and invited the Member State coordinators to  participate. The MS coordinators discussed and agreed upon the benefits of designing the MS campaigns  around commonly agreed security and privacy themes. ENISA suggested during the workshop potential  security themes and the MS  discussed and debated on the most relevant and current topics based on MS  cybersecurity priorities and the state of the art challenges. Following this discussion process, the MS  gradually narrowed down the alternatives and determined four themes for the month, one theme for each  one of the weeks in October.  The effectiviness of having themes of the month will need to be assessed to determine the optimum way to  organize the themes during the campaign and / or whether focus should be placed on target audiences  rather than threats / vulnerabilities.  The themes for 2017 were:  Week 1 - Theme: Cyber Security in Workplace  Targeting businesses, the aim of the theme was to raise awareness amongst employees and IT professionals  about threats such as Ransomware, Phishing, Malware and provide general cyber “Hygiene” advice.  Week 2 - Theme: Governance, Privacy and Data Protection  GDPR countdown to compliance: Ensure you are ready!!! The aim of this theme was to uncover how to  prepare your organization for the countdown to these new Directives and Regulations.  Week 3: - Theme: Cyber Security in the Home  The aim of the theme was to raise awareness amongst general users of threat from IoT, online fraud and  how to protect their home network and protect their online privacy.  Week 4 - Theme: Skills in Cyber Security  The theme sought to support the young with gaining Cyber Security skills via training and education so as to  grow the next generation of skilled Cyber Security professionals.  3.3.4 Press Releases  Member State coordinators distribute a formal press release before October announcing the ECSM and its  activities. During the physical meeting in Brussels the Agency proposed that the coordinators collaborate so  that the press releases could be distributed simuntaneously, to further foster a pan-European ECSM culture.  3.3.5 Kick-Off Event  Preparations for the fifth ECSM started in earnest with collaboration being forged between the Estonian  Information Systems Authority, Tallinn University of Technology and ENISA for this year’s Cyber Security  Month kick-off event. The kick-off event was organized to take place during the EU Presidency in Estonia and  the Digital Summit on the 29th September 2017.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  13  An assessment of the goals and scope of  the kick-off are needed if the event is going to be sustainable as a  stand alone event without the financial support of ENISA. By determining the target audience of the kick-off  event and the strategic objectives, a more effective event can be accomplished that will have greater  outreach and publicity.  Private sectors involvement in the kick-off is currently limited to speakers / panellists for the sessions.  A  number of private companies approached ENISA during the year requesting to support the event by way of  promotion and by sponsoring the lunch offered to the participants.  Following discussions with the MS it was  determined that further discussions were needed clarify the approach to take for involvement of the private  sector at the European level.  Evaluation Strategy  3.4.1 Evaluation Objectives  The Agency aimed to ensure that all Member State coordinators would capture information during the  execution of the awareness campaigns to enable the overall evaluation of ECSM and its impact. The objective  of the evaluation was to assess the effectiveness of the awareness activities, the attractiveness of the  activity, and its potential outreach and impact. The Agency urged the Member State Coordinators to  determine the evaluation metrics they would be using at the planning stage to ensure that they collected  the necessary data come the execution stage.  3.4.2 Evaluation Metrics  The Agency developed an evaluation strategy and a set of evaluation metrics for the Member State  Coordinators to use. The evaluation metrics were incorporated into a template evaluation form, for each  coordinator to complete upon finalisation of the execution stage. The evaluation metrics were segregated  per activity type, given that different information is relevant depending on the type of awareness campaign.  Marketing Material  Both the Agency and the Member States were committed to raising awareness. A series of marketing  channels and material were used to achieve this purpose, as presented below.  3.5.1 Visual identity  The Agency created some years ago a visual identity for European Cyber Security Month including a logo3, a  colour chart, typography rules, guidelines on use of imagery, design templates and a manual of formal  guidelines on the proper use of these elements. ENISA updated the ECSM logo, in order to signify the 5th  year anniversary for ECSM. The update logo for the 5th year anniversary is presented below:  3 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  14  Figure 1: Updated logo for the ECSM 5th year anniversary.  The updated logo was used by ENISA, the Member States and all partners on their websites, material, videos  and social media to link their efforts up to the European campaign.  MS showed keenness to adopt the 5 year logo in their local campaigns.  The historical background of the  campaign was now available and visible in the logo and as such added weight to the MS campaigns.  3.5.2 Slogan  The slogan “Cyber security is a shared responsibility!” remained unchanged in 2017.  3.5.3 Press releases  The Agency coordinated this year’s Press Release4 with the European Commission, to ensure maximum  outreach and to stimulate attention to the featured activities and events. The Press Release was translated  into all official languages of the European Union and was released on 2nd October instead of 29th September  as in previous years so as not to be superseded by Digital Summit that was taking place on the same day in  the same city as the kick off event. The services of a media company were procured to further disiminate  the press release to national and region journalists and press across Europe.  3.5.4 Social media - banners  The Web and Social Media banners remained the  same as in the previous years.  The banner was available in four formats to match  different needs (i.e., 815x315, 1500x500, 1200x717,  1200x630).  3.5.5 Poster and Infographics  During the physical meeting in April in Brussels the MS discussed the different marketing options and their  impact. As a result of this discussion the MS decided not to produce posters for this year, but instead to  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-month-united-against-cyber-security- threats  Figure 2: ECSM 2017 social media banner.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  15  allocate the relevant resources for the production of more videos, because of their perceived higher impact  and reach.  3.5.6 Videos  Four videos where produced for this year’s campaign, one for each themes of the month. Each of the videos  were designed to be less than 1.30 minutes long and they were shot without narration so that the message  would be conveyed via picture and text displayed at intervals, which could be translated by the MS if  required.  The first video5 for theme 1 (Cyber Security in Workplace) was a video promoting good practices for cyber  security protection in the workplace.  The second video6 for theme 2 (Governance, Privacy and Data Protection) encouraged organizations to  consider the implications of the new regulation and legislation on personal data protection.  The third video7 for theme 3 (Cyber Security in the Home) demonstrated the implications of security for the  Internet of Things and smart technologies in the home so as to encouragecitizens to be aware of these cyber  security threats.  The fourth video8 for theme 4 (Skills in Cyber Security) aimed at raising awareness of the career  opportunities in Cyber Security.  3.5.7 Website  The material on the ECSM website9 was re-organized including the tabs on the home page so as to enhance  the accessibility of the website. .  5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM67LrJ18VE  6 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EG8zRrC_6s  7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR51XZjLvRs  8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pN6a20Kf5Q&feature=youtu.be  9 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM67LrJ18VE  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  16  Figure 3: Map of ECSM 2017 activities across Europe  3.5.8 NIS Quiz  The NIS Quiz remained the same for ECSM 2017.

Execution phase  Kick-off event  The kick-off event for the 5th ECSM was held under the Estonian Presidency at Tallinn University of  Technology on 29th September 2017. The event was co-organized by ENISA and the Estonian Information  Systems Authority. The agenda10 included welcome speaches by the Director of the Estonian Information  System Authority (RIA), the Executive Director of ENISA and the Director of DGIT at the European  Commission. Moreover, it included speeches experts from from the European public sector and industry.  In dedicated panel sessions the ECSM national co-ordination teams offerred insights into their campaigns  and leading IT security experts debated on the security themes of 2017.  The panel discussions centred around the themes of the month and the role of awareness raising within  each of the topics. The group of panellists included esteemed cybersecurity experts from ADP, APWG, BHC  Laboratory, CERT Estonia, CERT Latvia, CISCO, European Banking Federation, Europol’s EC3, Hytrust, Intel,  Tallinn University of Technology, and University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.  The event attracted over 90 participants and was also live streamed via the Tallinn University  of Technology  Youtube channel.  4.1.1 Week 1: October 2-6  Theme: Cyber Security in the Workplace  Targeting businesses, the aim of the theme was to raise awareness amongst company employees, IT  professionals & senior management about threats such as Ransomware, Phishing, Malware and to provide  general cyber “Hygiene” advice.  4.1.2 Week 2: October 9-13  Theme: Governance, Privacy & Data Protection  Countdown to compliance: Ensure you're ready!!! The aim of this theme was to uncover how to prepare  your organization for the new EU Directives and Regulations such as the NIS Directive and the GDPR.  4.1.3 Week 3: October 16-20  Theme: Cyber Security in the Home  The aim of the theme was to raise awareness amongst general users of threats from IoT, online fraud / scams  and provide guidance on how protect their home network and protect their online privacy.  4.1.4 Week 4: Oct. 23-27  Theme: Skills in Cyber Security  The theme sought to support the young with gaining Cyber Security skills via training and education so as to  grow the next generation of skilled Cyber Security professionals.  10 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/draft-agenda/view  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  19  Week 4 also coincided with the launch of the European Cyber Security Challenge that was  organised by the  Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute INCIBE with direct involvement and support from ENISA.  The challenge, expert talks and job fair attracted a lot of interest, including over 200 of the best Cybersecurity  talents and hundreds of visitors from across Europe, who came to network and to compete for the European  crown.  Young talents from 15 competing national teams proved their technical and teamwork skills in the most  exciting and complex cyber competition of the year. The jury had a tough task to select only one winning  team, considering the very close final results and the intense competition on the day of the challenge.  Member State Campaigns  The following section provides insight into some of the Member States campaigns that were organized by  ECSM coordinators.  The MS listed below are a selection of those MS that are active partipants in the organization of the ECSM  campaign both at the European level and the local level.  Ideally all MS will be actively involved in shaping  the campaign in the future, which is why it is imperative that the campaign demonstrates to other MS the  benefits and value of working together in such an endeavour.  4.2.1 France  The 5th edition of ECSM campaign was coordinated at the national level by ANSSI, the national authority for  cybersecurity and cyberdefence, in France. The program of the campaign was ambitious, aiming to raise  awareness and provide advice and recommendations in both the work place and at home. For the 2017  edition more than 30 French institutional actors and stakeholders (ministers, national authorities,  associations), including political figures, were involved in promoting the ECSM initiative and useful advice  both for their own employees and the larger audiences (private companies, general public, students, etc.).  ANSSI also provided an awareness kit on the event to be shared widely, both in French and English with an  official poster, web banners and mail signature with the colors of ECSM. Finally, a press conference took  place on October, 2nd to present the national program.  Altogether, more than 70 activities were organized all over France (conferences, workshop, and exhibitions)  registered on the ENISA official website as well as on a dedicated web page: (www.ssi.gouv.fr/mois- europeen/). Furthermore, a successful digital campaign took place all through October on Twitter and  Facebook around a common identity (#TousSecNum and #ECSM) and the European themes. Three videos  were produced by different institutions around the good practices, the ransomware threats as well as the  role of cyberdiplomacy.  In numbers :   172 million messages viewed on Twitter and 14800 users actively engaged in the campaign in  October   33500 tweets and retweets around  #TousSecNum #ECSM   16600 views of the dedicated webpage in French  (https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2017/)  https://www.incibe.es/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2017/  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  20   6114 download of the press release  presenting the ECSM and more than 50 press articles  published during the month  4.2.2 Germany  In Germany the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) as the national cyber security authority shapes  information security in digitization through prevention, detection and reaction for government, business  and society. Thus, supporting the annual ECSM-campaign goes hand in hand with the efforts to raise  awareness for cyber security among these diverse target groups.  In 2017 BSI won more than 100 partners in Germany who established more than 200 activities around  October. The range of activities was quite broad, from webinars and social media activities to live-hacking  events and a whole thematic day with workshops, discussions and many more. Overall, BSI succeeded in  substantially bringing forward the ECSM campaign in Germany with a significant rise in partners and a higher  outreach to citizens than in previous years.  As the national coordinator in Germany, the BSI supported the ECSM especially with activities focussing on  private users. BSI adapted the weekly topics of ENISA and provided information material on each topic.  Basically, these were:   - four video-statements, each giving background information regarding the weekly topics,   - four polls on Facebook, presenting questions on the weekly topics  to interested users, and   - press releases on each topic.  Furthermore, BSI focused on the topic \"cybersecurity at home\" for the whole month. In addition to the above  mentioned activities, BSI published the following:   - a new brochure for private users on the secure  use of IoT- and smart home devices,   - two website articles on how to secure smart homes,   - an animated video informing about relevant security measures for smart homes,   - a short quiz on the website to test user's knowledge on cybersecurity for smart homes, and   - a radio feature on this topic.  Additionally, BSI supported an \"action day\" taking place in Bonn with a presentation and an information  booth to give advice to interested citizens.  As coordinator of the ECSM and as the national cybersecurity authority the BSI will also be highly engaged  in contributing to and promoting the ECSM in the coming years with even more ambition.  4.2.3 Luxembourg  The kick-off for ECSM 2017 took place on the Oct 12th during the opening of the Luxembourg Cybersecurity  competence center by Francine Closener, Secretary of State of the Economy. The inauguration was followed  by a dedicated Cybersecurity week Luxembourg, taking place from 16-21 November.  The Cybersecurity competence center is based on a public private partnership and part of  SECURITYMADEIN.LU innovative services to provide users with up-to-date threat analysis, solution testing  and immersive cybersecurity training through a dedicated simulation platform.  Cybersecurity week Luxembourg was filled with 15 events to support the build up of a culture of  cybersecurity among individuals and to position the country as a leading European location for cybersecurity  start-ups, talent, investors and experts who are looking for growth opportunities.  https://www.c-3.lu/ https://www.c-3.lu/ https://cybersecurityweek.lu/  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  21  Founding members (Excellium, Luxinnovation, Ministry of the Economy, PwC; SECURITYMADEIN.LU) and  supporters (Digital Skills coalition Luxembourg; Luxembourg Institute for Digital Training) of the  Cybersecurity week Luxembourg brought together over 2000 people to participate in a variety of ICT  activities. Public and private actors demonstrated their determination to collaborate towards improving the  level of digital security of companies, organizations and citizens. On the international scene, Luxembourg  has increased its visibility by attracting world-renowned experts.  PwC’s Cybersecurity Day brought together more than 200 professionals, experts, public and private actors,  start-ups and investors involved in international IT security issues as well as the tools and solutions of  tomorrow thanks to 10 companies selected for their innovative solutions originating from Europe, the USA  and Israel. The analysis of threats and vulnerabilities as well as the means to combat them, aroused the  interest of all professionals looking for new ways to enhance their security.  \"Hackers\" from around the world gathered at the Hack.lu conference and set a new record: no less than 60  speakers took turns presenting their topics!  This spotlight on cybersecurity comes at the right time, when Europe is sorely lacking in professional IT  profiles which will ensure the cyber defense of tomorrow. Creating professional career paths has become  vital and the \"Cyber Talent Day\" event contributed to this goal.  On the regulatory side, the implementation of the GDPR in 2018 worries small businesses that do not always  know where to start when it comes to compliance issues. The topic was discussed several times during the  week, and helped to clarify things for these actors.  Other events included for example a “Cybersecurity4success” conference at the Luxembourg Chamber of  Crafts; a “Hack4kids” and a “Crypto party” for kids gathering around 150 kids.  The week ended with the presentation of 5 awards: Best Security Officer (CISO); Best Thesis Award; Capture  the Flag Award; Most Promising Company Award; People’s Choice Award.  In addition, ECSM Luxembourg traditional partnership with BEE SECURE11, a governmental initiative raising  awareness among young people and public at large, was also successful this year: the ECSM is part of the  BEE SECURE campaign “Big Data”, gathering 18 national partners and associations and raising awareness  about the “traces” we leave on the internet, and how to lead a responsible online life. The campaign is mainly  displayed in schools and public spaces from October 2017 to September 2018. ECSM was also mentioned in  their launching press release.  Furthermore, RESTENA, a foundation providing network services for all public and private institutions and  organizations involved in the field of education and research, and the University of Luxembourg initiated a  blog for their students and employees to raise awareness on cyber themes during ECSM.  A first, fruitful, contact was made with the European Investment Bank. We look forward to extend our  cooperation for 2018 edition.  During the ECSM we promoted, among others, the 4 thematic video clips produced for the campaign through  our social media channels. Generally speaking, press coverage was done through 3 press communiqués ; 8  articles in the national press; 1 radio show; a dedicated website with12,000 visitors during ECSM; approx.  11 https://www.bee-secure.lu/  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  22  2500 Facebook followers and an organic reach of nearly 4000 people for #ECSM related post and 1200  tweeter followers.  4.2.4 Slovenia  For the 2017 European Cyber Security Month Campaign Slovenia focused on workplace security and cyber  security challenges that small and medium companies are facing. The main creative idea that reflected in  design, copy right and all communication channels (Facebook, TV ads, new website, online advertising) was  that the mouse could be the most frightening animal as one wrong mouse click could cause big trouble in a  sense of online security. During entire month of October, a new website targeting business users, more  specifically accountants, employees and employers was established. The site focused on this target group  and providedadvice so website users could find useful and tailored resources regarding  ransomware, online  scams targeting companies, malware, phishing, safe online banking, backup, GDPR, network security etc.  The website content hub included three main call-to-actions:   Order a poster for your company. During the entire month of October, free posters were provided  about ransomware for companies who expressed their interest.   Sign up for newsletter. New mailing list for business users was set up and every Monday morning  one tip about workplace security was distributed.   Download Security Roadmap for your company. A booklet was published with 10 crucial information  and network security challenges for SMB.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  23  5. Evaluation  Questionnaire  The questionnaire is an important tool used to gather the opinions of the MS coordinators that are engaged  in the campaign. The charts below present the replies of 15 participants representing their MS. An increase  of 3 participants compared to the previous year.  5.1.1 Results  1. How would you rate the overall implementation of the ECSM 2016 campaign (scale 1-5)?  2. Did ECSM support in a satisfactory manner the outreach and promotion of your work?  3. Did ECSM add value to your national campaign?  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  24  4. Did ECSM offer opportunities for improving your national campaigns through collaboration with other  countries?  5. Do you think ENISA succeeded in the sharing and promotion of new ideas among ECSM partners?  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  25  6. Did the four short video clips produced for ECSM support your national campaign?  7. Could ECSM better promote the awareness material produced by its partners’ campaigns?  8. Would you want ENISA to facilitate in the engagement of the private sector in future campaigns?  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  26  9. Would you want to further align ECSM with international awareness raising campaigns?  10. Do you think that ECSM offers opportunities for fostering a pan-European cyber security culture?  5.1.2 Results  MS coordinators perceived the implementation of campaign to be above average based on the results of question  one. This result is significantly better than last year’s results which was on the whole average.  The overwhelming majority of MS coordinators agreed that the campaign added value to their work, that it supports  their local national campaigns and the promotion of their work (Q2 and Q3). Nevertheless, 40% of MS coordinators  were are not entirely convinced that the campaign offered opportunities for collaboration and sharing of ideas  among the MS, while on the other hand 60% believe that it did achieve these goals (Q4 and Q5).  The feedback on the short videos clips produced by ENISA was mixed with 53% supporting their usefulness to their  campaigns, whilst the other half considered otherwise or did not take a position.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  27  A large majority of MS coordinators agreed that ECSM could do better in promoting the MS awareness material. The  feedback for better promotion of material included the following suggestions on how this could be achieved:   By providing the possibility to discuss and share materials and experiences on an internal online  platform/space accessible for the national coordinators (something like Basecamp, etc.)   By better presenting such awareness material on the ECSM website   By creating more interactions during the campaign between ENISA, the official ECSM accounts and  partners   By increasing the participation of partners and their national campaigns at the kick-off event  Feedback related to the private sector’s engagement in future campaigns was positive amongst 66% of the  participants however 34% rejected or hesitated to respond . A suggestion from a MS coordinator was that this should  be discussed in a future ECSM meeting amongst the MS.  Finally, the majority of MS coodinators were positive about the prospect of aligning ECSM with international  campaigns (Q9) and a similar results came from the question whether ECSM offers an opportunity for fostering EU- wide cyber security culture.  Web analytics  Web analytics provided the statistical data for ECSM web site and social media channels. The purpose of gathering  these figures were to evaluate the impact and visibility of the campaign.  5.2.1 ECSM Web Page  The analysis takes into consideration multiple variables in relation to different types of access points to the ECSM  website in the period of October.  Statistics for October include:   ECSM page views: 92,507   Users accessing the website: 20,486   Total Sessions: 27,247  Figure 4: Graph overview of ECSM web site sessions.  The “pie” chart demonstrates the percentage of new visitors accessing the ECSM web page only once versus those  revisiting the web page multiple times. While this is encouraging, ENISA recognises the need of finding the means  of keeping the interest of users “alive” for a greater period of time.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  28  Below is a comparison between this year’s campaign and previous years with respect to the number of sessions and  page views to the ECSM webpage. Statistics demonstrate that the ECSM website has achieved a substantial growth  in its popularity in 2017 in comparison to the almost linearly increased rate of previous campaigns.  Figure 5: Overview of annual increase of ECSM web page sessions and page views  5.2.2 NIS Quiz  The data in figure 6 indicates the dispersion of page views for the NIS Quiz before during and after October. The  total number of view for October reached 17,487 views out of a total of 92,507 views that the ECSM web site  received in the period from 1st to 31st of October. These statistics demonstrate the popularity that the NIS quiz  has gained during the campaign, equating to approximately 18,9% of the total ECSM site web traffic targeted the  NIS Quiz.  Figure 6: NIS quiz page views within ECSM October’s events  The 17,487 views of the NIS Quiz can be further broken down between the views of the main page and the  introductory video of the quiz as follows:   8,119 page views were dedicated to accessing the main NIS Quiz page   9,368 page views were dedicated for accessing the introductory youtube video of the quiz  The total number of visitors succeeding to complete the NIS Quiz compared to previous years increased from 788  last year to 2392 in 2017, an increase of 303%.  In addition, the percentage of participants that visited the NIS Quiz  home page and then went on to complete the NIS Quiz increased from 10% last year to 29.4% in 2017, reflecting  that 1/3 of all visitors went on to finish the NIS Quiz.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  29  5.2.3 ECSM Map of Activities  The following data illustrate the number of activities taking place from 2013 to 2017 during October. The graph on  the left presents the total number of events registered on ECSM website during the month October every year since  2013, while the one on the right, the number of countries that have registered at least one event for the same period  range.  Figure 7: Number of activities in October and the number of countries registering activities annually  The rate of growth in 2017 has stabilized back to the long term average growth rate. A stable growth rate of events  year on year were recorded from inception up until 2015, wherein the number of events registered almost doubled  in 2016 from the previous year.  The growth in the number of events registered is an outcome of the increased  popularity of the campaign.  The top ten MS with respect to the number of events they have registered during October are displayed in the pie  charts below for 2016 and 2017. A notable difference from last year’s campaign is the Netherlands, that rose to be  included in the top 5 MS with the most number of activities.  Figure 8: Top Ten countries with respect to the number of events registered for ECSM 2016 and 2017  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  30  5.2.4 Social Media  Twitter continues to support the promotion and outreach of the campaign. The figures below demonstrate the  fluctuation of twitter followers from September until November 2017 for the handle @CyberSecMonth. The highest  peak corresponds to the launch of ECSM and specifically the Kick-off event on the 29th of September, followed by  renewed interest again until the latter end of the month.  Useful statistics that are extracted from the graph are:   The total number of followers (12,894)   The amount of new accounts (1,870) created within this period of three months  Figure 9: The daily growth of Twitter followers from September to November 2017 to @CyberSecMonth  The graph below tracks the growth in the number of twitter followers of @CyberSecMonth over time. It shows an  accelerated growth in this year’s campaign, almost doubling versus the pervious year.  Figure 10: Annual number of Twitter followers @CyberSecMonth  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  31  5.2.5 Media Reach  There was a total of 330 articles published which mentioned ECSM from the period 23rd of September till the 7th of  November. Looking at the distribution below, it can be seen that the peak of articles mentioning ECSM took place  during the start of the campaign and then tapered off for the rest of the month. The online reach of the campaign,  that is, the size of audience exposed to the campaign’s advertisement has been estimated to be approximately  86,5m versus 112m from the previous year.  Figure 11: Number of articles published that mention ECSM from 23/09 to 7/11  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  32  Figure 12: Estimated online reach in October 2017  Figure 13: A comparison overview of online reach and number of articles published during October respectively  5.2.6 Conclusions  The majority of the indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrate a higher growth rate year on year  compared to the average level of growth from previous years. In particular the growth rate of the Twitter followers  and the number of participants completing the NIS Quiz (possibly triggered by EU's GDPR implementation  discussions) almost doubled year on year.  Some analytics did demonstrate a minor decrease such as the online reach of the campaign and the number of  publications in the period, factored possibly by the absence in this year's kick-off event of large organizations of  combined resources such as the European Banking Federation (EBF) and Europol (EC3). Nevertheless, the substantial  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  33  increase of ECSM website's popularity and of the number of activities registered media followers contributed  towards successful performance for the 2017 campaign.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  34  6. Conclusions and Future Work  The performance of the campaign based on the analytical indiocators and the positive feedback received from MS  coordinators confirm that the 2017 campaign succeeded to build on the results of previous years and grow inline  with the long term growth rate. Several factors contributed to this positive outcome, a major one being the strength  of the relationship between ENISA and the MS coordinators and another being the launch of the campaign during  the EU Presidency in Estonia with the Estonian Information Systems Authority.  Another important aspect of the work carried out this year was the introduction of guidelines by ENISA to support  in the organization and evaluation of the campaign.  First was a set guidelines for organizing a campaign at the MS  level to assist MS in the planning and execution of their national campaigns.  The second was the creation of a data  evaluation form to be used by MS to plan for and gather data points post the campaign at the evaluation stage.  The  introduction of these steps will serve to have a greater impact on future campaigns as they mature and as MS  become familiar with using them.  During the course of 2017 a number of observations were made by ENISA that will be addressed in coming years so  as to influence the success of the campaign going forward. These observations are listed below and include ENISA  perspective on how they could be addressed.  Member State Commitment  Member States participate on a voluntary basis in the organization of the campaign.  Participants are predominantly  representatives from the National Cyber Security Centres, responsible Government Ministries or the CERT  community. Some Member States have dedicated units and personnel whilst others work on a best effort basis  alongside their other core activities.  There are a dozen or so core participants to ECSM from the Member States that actively participate in the monthly  conference calls and physical meeting. The remaining Member States participate on an ad hoc basis or not at all.  EU Member States participating: Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg,  Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Switzerland  ‘Passive’ participation: Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK  EU Member States not participating: Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Slovakia  From ENISA’s perspective all Member States should be actively participating in the campaign. ENISA will  demonstrate to the MS the advantages of being involved in the campaign and the effectiveness of working together  to increase impact. In many cases lack of financial resources is identified by MS as the main reason for little  contribution to the ECSM activities or no participation.  Private Sector Involvement  Private sector involvement has been limited to participation of speakers / panellists during the annual Kick-Off event  that launches the activities of ECSM.  Discussions were held with Member States to enhance the engagement of the  private sector in the campaign either via jointly producing material or promoting the activities via their media  channels or by sponsoring activities, however consensus among the Member States was not reached and discussions  were postponed until the next face to face meeting in February 2018.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  35  From ENISA’s perspective industry involvement is critical in promoting the campaign and disseminating the  messages to a wider audience. There is keen interest from industry to be involved, the question is; What is the ideal  model for guiding this relationship?  The latest Joint Commission of the European Parliament and Council12 emphasized the strong role for the industry  in this endeavour and gave particular attention to digital service providers and manufacturers: “It (industry) needs  to support users (individuals, businesses and public administrations) with tools that allow them to take responsibility  for their own actions online, making clear that maintaining cyber hygiene is an indispensable part of the offer to  consumers”.  Governance Structure  The campaign has been prominently driven by ENISA (with the role of secretariat, ‘facilitator’) over the past five  years; with Member States participating on a voluntary basis with the majority acting as observers rather than active  participants.  Involvement of the Member States consists of providing input into the monthly conference calls and participating in  the annual physical meeting. The agenda for these meetings are prepared by ENISA and input is requested of the  Member States on decisions concerning the themes of the month, production of dissemination material,  functionality of the website, the kick-off event and other tactical aspects of the campaign.  From ENISA’s perspective a governance structure must be created to drive the decision making processes and the  responsibilities of the Member States. However this would require a commitment from the Member States,  especially those that take up an active role within the existing decision making structure.  Given the current level  commitment of the Member States only a handful would have the capability to take up such a role.  For example, a similar governance structure could be created to that of the CSIRT Network; in which the current EU  Presidency chairs and the past and future EU Presidency co-chair the steering committee, with the Member States  including the EC have voting rights. Working groups would be created within this structure to tackle certain aspects  of the campaign. The role of the Agency would be to act as facilitator and advisor to the group.  Collaboration with the European Commission  The European Commission (EC) so far supports the campaign mainly through hosting and participating at the annual  physical ECSM meeting, participation of senior officials at the launch event and translation of the annual press  release and NIS Quiz in 2016.  In 2017 the European Commission introduced the concept of “Cyber Security Ambassadors”. Its main aim is to inform  European Commission officials about the important Cyber Security European Commission achievements regarding  policies (e.g. Cyber Security Package, Prize), legislation (NIS, GDPR), training efforts (ENISA, EC – Cyber Aware and  CNECT University), operations (CERT-EU) and campaigns such as the ECSM, EU Code Week, etc. In this context,  European Commission staff who are willing to perform as Ambassadors in the European setting are expected to  promote the European Commission Cyber Security efforts in contacts outside the EX, strengthen the presence of the  European Commission and support European citizens and organizations in their Cyber Security awareness efforts by  12 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  36  providing information and advice. ENISA actively supported this initiative and will continue to do so by preparing  and update relevant dissemination material.  From ENISA’s perspective the support of the European Commission for ECSM could be stepped up in a number of  ways, such as for a permanent European Commission representative to be involved in the steering of the campaign  via the monthly conference calls and physical meeting. The European Commission could use its privileged position  to outreach to communities and stakeholders, to garner support and help promoting the campaign. Another aspect  to this is the visibility of the kick-off event, that would be greatly impacted by the attendance of a Vice President or  Commissioner, for which the EC could play a pivotal role in securing. Finally, the commitment to the campaign from  the Member States could be stepped up with the right message from the right officials within the European  Commission.  International Collaboration  Cyber Security campaigns aimed towards citizens is now a global phenomenon, with the majority of developed  nations campaigning; particularly in October.  In the 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union13 the EC invited the Member States to organize a yearly  campaign, with the support of ENISA and included a recommendation to synchronize the EU-US cybersecurity month  starting 2014. The Working Group, established at the EU-US Summit14 15 in November 2010 is tasked with developing  collaborative approaches in cyber security, including efforts towards a programme of immediate joint campaigns  activates as well as a roadmap towards synchronized annual awareness efforts. In this respect some small steps have  been taken to align and cross promote the campaign themes and messages with that of the U.S. but with further  willingness from both parties a fully synchronized campaign could be achieved in the coming years.  From ENISA’s perspective synchronizing with the U.S. would further strengthen the campaign’s outreach and  promotion, and would widen the portfolio of materials available to citizens.  However, synchronizing with the U.S.  is not the end goal; the end goal is to synchronize the campaigns globally into a unified message that resonates  beyond boarders. In that case is probably worth to consider the current timing of ECSM during the month of October.  If the collaboration between Europe and the USA in the context of ECSM is not considered as a priority for the future,  perhaps we should consider shifting the ECSM activities towards spring or early summer avoiding the period of July- August (just before the ECSM) that poses organisational problems.  Annual ECSM Launch Event  The annual kick-off event to launch the campaign has had mixed results over the years. However due to the  collaboration with authorities in the hosting MS in 2017 and with the industry in 2016, the participation was higher  than average and attracted a number of high profile panellists. This development indicates that the event is  sustainable only with the support of another co-organizer and that it has not matured enough to stand on its own,  as yet.  13 http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  14 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-246_en.htm  15 http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-246_en.htm http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  37  The next steps in the evolution of the campaign is to reassess the goal and scope of the kick-off and re-examine the  input from the Member States, EC and the private sector.  From ENISA’s perspective the kick-off event requires the support of a prominent European figure to give it visibility  and a reassessment of the goals and scope is needed if it is to continue.  Website Redesign  The ECSM website has served the campaign well over the past 5 years. Certain features have been enhanced and  webpages were added to streamline the experience for the user. The main goal of the website is to inform the  general public of events that occur in their area and to provide them with tools needed to protect themselves online,  such as recommendations and the NIS Quiz. The website also acts as a depository of material from all the Member  States and from European Institutions such as Europol. This allows campaign coordinators from the Member States  to re-use material that have been created by others that they are focusing on at the National level. ECSM website  also seeks to drive traffic to the Member States relevant campaigns and includes a dedicated supporters page. One  may argue that the ECSM may be used as an information resource also targeted towards the citizens. As it is depicted  in the graphs of Annex A the uptake of the ECSM social media channels is very good indicating that they are a better  path towards the EU citizens. In this respect, ENISA will continue investing on the use of the ECSM social media  channels.

The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission DG CONNECT and Partners are deploying the  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) every October.  The European Cyber Security Month aims at generating general awareness about cyber security; generating  specific awareness on Network and Information Security (NIS); promoting safer use of the Internet for all  users; building a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM; involving relevant stakeholders;  increasing national media interest through the European and global dimension of the project; and enhancing  attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media coordination.  This document reflects the effort of ENISA to support EU Member States on the design and implementation  of national European Cyber Security Month campaigns, though guidelines.  1.1 ENISA’s Vision for ECSM 2017  The vision of ENISA for ECSM is to support the EU Member States with the design and implementation of  their awareness raising campaigns and to promote collaboration among EU Member States, international  organizations and industry.  1.2 ENISA’s Mission statement for ECSM 2017  ENISA’s mission is to collaborate with the EU Member States and international organizations by finding  innovative and fun ways to raise EU citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity, be they by organizing events,  conferences, online quizzes, transferring of best practices or the use social media to educate and inform the  public. Our mission is to enhance the delivery and synchronize ECSM among the EU Member States and  industry that will share a pan-European vision and values for cybersecurity.  2 Guidelines for Planning European Cyber Security Month  2.1 A common Understanding of Security Awareness  To develop effective ECSM campaigns with pan-European coverage, EU State Members should share a  common understanding of the concept of security awareness. For this purpose, this document presents  widely accepted definitions of information security awareness.  Information security awareness is usually associated with organizational contexts and is part of a broader  information security communication framework. ENISA (2010) defines security awareness as a “component  of the education strategy of an organization which tries to change the behavior and patterns in how targeted  audience (e.g. employees, public, etc.) use technology and the Internet and it is a distinct element from  training. It consists of a set of activities which turn users into organizations’ first line of defense… awareness  activities occur on an ongoing basis, using a variety of delivery methods and are less formal and shorter than  training” (ENISA, 2010, p. 15). NIST special publication (NIST, 2003) states that information security  awareness aims at instilling a common understanding of information security concepts and topics; covers a  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  48  broad audience of users; relies on attractive packaging techniques and is expected to bring short-term  results. Maeyer (2007) defines security awareness as “an organized and ongoing effort to guide the behavior  and culture of an organization with regards to security issues”. Thomson and von Solms (1998) state that  security awareness is “about making users aware of the value and importance of information and security  procedures”. Information security awareness aims at a state in which “users would intuitively act towards  protecting information security”, when processing information with information systems and tools. An  information security awareness program aims at transiting from users’ “ad-hoc secure behaviors to constant  secure behaviors” (Okenyi and Owens, 2007). In organizational contexts, security awareness has been highly  associated with users’ compliance to information security policies (Bulgurcu et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011;  Haeussinger and Kranz, 2013; Talib and Dhillon, 2015). Regardless of their differences, these definitions  reflect a common concept surrounding security awareness: the target to attract the attention of users to  security messages, to make them understand the importance of information security and their potential  security obligations. Also, it is generally accepted that security awareness is associated with some form of  users’ behavioral change (Albrechtsen, 2008; ENISA, 2010; Okenyi and Owens, 2007; Tsohou et al., 2015).  Recently, information privacy became an essential component of users’ awareness, when handling digital  services; especially with regards to protecting their personal information. For that purpose, this document  also presents prevailing definition on what constitutes general privacy awareness to inform the Member  State Coordinators of ECSM campaigns.  Information privacy awareness is defined as “someone's ability to accurately perceive potential privacy  threats” (Könings et al, 2013, p.164). In another definition privacy awareness “measures the awareness of  Internet users regarding a general existence and possibility of Internet privacy issues, without focusing on  technical details or on a user” (Brecht et al., 2012 p.3). Cetto et al. (2014, p. 2) state that privacy awareness  is “an individual's knowledge of who can access which shared personal information and moreover, the  degree to which actual and perceived visibility of shared items match”. Malandrino et al. (2013, p.2) refer to  privacy awareness as “perception of: 1) Who is tracking, receiving or collecting private information (2) When  information is collected (3) What information other entities receive, store and use (4) How pieces of  information are processed, linked and aggregated to potentially build detailed users' profiles”. Information  privacy awareness is also considered as “user's attention, perception and cognition of whether others  receive or have received personal information about him/her, his/her presence and activities, which  personal information others receive or have received in detail, how these pieces of information are or may  be processed and used, and what amount of information about the presence and activities of others might  reach and/or interrupt the individual” (Pötzsch, 2009, p. 228). Information privacy awareness has also been  widely associated with the terms of use and privacy settings of online contexts, such as social media (Moey  et. Al., 2016; Sohoraye et al., 2015; Kuo and Talley, 2014; Bergmann, 2009).  Based on the above analysis, we formulate the following first guideline for the Member State Coordinators  of ECSM campaigns.  Guideline 1: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to create campaigns aiming at activating users to  protect information from security threats. Campaigns are expected to attract recipients’ attention and make  them recognize information security concerns and respond accordingly. ECSM campaigns should also  strengthen users’ abilities to accurately perceive potential privacy threats, with regards to their shared  personal information.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  49  2.2 Formulation of Project Plan  Developing the yearly ECSM campaigns requires proper formulation of a project plan, including specifying  the ECSM team, their roles and responsibilities, the budget, ECSM activities, milestones, timeline and  deadlines.  When specifying the budget, the Member State Coordinators should consider personnel costs, operational  costs, advertisement costs, any technical development and support costs. While considering the costs of  an initiative, the possible contribution of third parties should be considered. This is valid when an  information security awareness program is part of a public–private partnership (ENISA, 2010).  It is important to produce a documentation of the overall project plan, given that ECSM is a yearly  initiative. The future event coordinators will find the documentation invaluable.  Guideline 2: Member State Coordinators are recommended to develop an ECSM project plan that can  guide the management of all involved activities for design, execution and evaluation. It is imperative to  produce a documented project plan.  2.3 Definition of Communication Plan  In the early stages of a security awareness campaign design it is imperative to define the target group or  groups (ENISA, 2010; NIST, 2003).  There are several potential recipients and categories of recipients that a security awareness campaign may  target, such as home users, adults, citizens, employees, parents, public officers, teenagers, Internet users  (ENISA, 2011). Obviously, there is an overall between these categories, and this is one reason why it is  crucial to identify clearly defined target groups. More importantly, it is necessary to recognize and  separate target groups, because society consists of a diverse collection of individuals with differing  interests, levels of expertise and priorities (ENISA, 2010); thus, it is difficult to find issues and messages  that will be relevant to everyone.  ENISA (2011) offers a useful categorization that can be valuable to the Member State Coordinators, which  separates three broad categories of recipients: general users, young people and business users.  Category of Users  Description  General users  Citizens, consumers, parents, educators, adults,  home users, Internet users, primarily aged 25 and  older  Young people  Kids, young children, teenagers, 13- to 18-year-old  students, schools  Business users  SMEs, IT professionals, IT civil servants,  companies, government institutions, public  administrations  Guideline 2: Member State Coordinators need to clearly define the target group or groups of ECSM  national campaigns. The Member State Coordinators can broadly separate target audience into general  users, young people or business users. The design of the ECSM campaigns should be customized upon the  defined target groups.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  50  The communication channels that will be used for delivering security awareness are a critical success  factor.  Some key recommendations for an effective awareness campaign are:   Reach out to as broad an audience as possible   Use influential and credible communication channels and senders of messages   Use more than one communication channel to engage the recipients successfully  Traditional communication channels (ENISA, 2010; NIST, 2003) that can be used are: brochures, leaflets,  comics, screensavers, newsletters, posters, emails, events, puzzles, do and don’t lists, emails, radio or TV,  SMSs, website.  The Member State Coordinators are encouraged to also consider innovative communication means, which  may increase the possibilities of success. Mobile applications that offer notifications to the enrolled users,  and may enhance the engagement of the users given the ongoing nature of the ECSM communication  (ENISA, 2011, p.35). Another option may include online games (Cetto et al., 2014; Cone et., 2007;  Albrechtsen and Hovden, 2010), which can provide personalized content and tailor the presented context  and security challenges to the user’s past performance.  Communication channels should be chosen taking into consideration the type of target group, its profile,  as well as information technology and security knowledge.  Guideline 3: Member State Coordinators should choose to use multiple communication channels reaching  out for broad audiences and sending awareness messages from credible and influential sources.  Communication channels can be chosen from several traditional communication channels available, but  innovative communication channels are highly encouraged.  Defining the security messages that will be presented to the audience is a critical activity of the ECSM  campaign design. Common information security awareness themes (ENISA, 2010) are security threats in e- mail and electronic communication, password protection, information security policies and procedures  and security incident reporting (for business users), website policies, social engineering, etc.  Information security themes, however, should be chosen based on the current trend of information  security and privacy threats, to deliver timely guidance to the users. The Member State Coordinators are  encouraged to study the recent landscape of security and privacy threats, before deciding the themes of  the ECSM 2017 campaigns. For example, ENISA (2017) has identified the top cybersecurity threats for  2016. In priority, the top ten threats include malware, web-based and web application attacks, denial of  service, botnets, phishing, spam, ransomware, insider threat, physical damage/theft. In terms of  information privacy Unesco (2012) highlights that high privacy threats relate to user identification, adware,  spyware and malware, data logging and surveillance, deep packet inspection, location-based services and  surveillance and Internet surveillance technologies generally. Individuals are now using modern  technologies and security awareness campaigns should keep pace with the technological platforms that  are interesting to them and present relevant security themes; trends such as Internet of Things, advanced  authentication, cloud computing, mobile applications, mobile payments, big data, bring your own device  (PwC, 2016). Given that ECSM activities spread in a period of a month the Member State Coordinators can  specify few security themes and divide them across the ECSM; e.g., week 1 may focus on Internet of Things  security, week 2 may focus on bring your own device security, etc.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  51  Guideline 4: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to choose information security themes  addressing both a) commonly identified security threats, and b) threats identified by national or  international classifications as current security threats.  Guidelines for Evaluating European Cyber Security Month  3.1 Evaluation Approaches  The evaluation of a security awareness program is a challenging task. Literature includes different  approaches on how the success of such a program should be measured. For example, one category of  evaluation approaches tests the participants’ awareness through questionnaires; the participant is  requested to complete the questionnaire before the awareness program and following the awareness  program, and it is expected that awareness level will be raised. In this category, Parsons (2014) created a  questionnaire that can be used to evaluate an employee’ s security awareness. The questionnaire tests the  awareness of an employee on common security threats, such as password management, email use,  Internet use, incident reporting, mobile computing, etc. Similarly, Kruger and Kearney (2006) developed a  questionnaire to test an individual’s security awareness, which can be automated and customized based  on the needs of the evaluators. However, this evaluation approach is not suitable for the ECSM  participants, given that the respective awareness events target broad audiences, such as the public.  ENISA (2010), offers a more holistic approach offering various awareness evaluation metrics for different  audiences:   Evaluation at the business layer measures the impact of the overall project   Evaluation at the service layer measures the awareness activities output   Evaluation at the operational layer measure the awareness processes  Examples of the evaluation metrics per layer are given below:  Layer  Indicative Metrics  Business  number of events listed/month, number of  material distributed/edition, number of material  distributed/year, number of people attending  awareness trainings per campaign, number of  unique visitors/month, time to organize an  awareness initiative  Service  number of topics on security in standard primary  and secondary school education/total topics,  number of topics on security in high school and  education/total topics, number of e-government  projects using standards/total projects  Operation  mean time between discovery and notification of a  new threat, number of reported incidents per  category/year, number of systems without  implemented password policy/total n. of systems  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  52  Such evaluation metrics had been used to assess the success of the first ECSM, in 2012, as presented in the  ENISA (2012) relevant report.  Guideline 5: Member State Coordinators are urged to define evaluation metrics at the design level to  ensure that they collect the necessary data for assigning values to the metrics after the completion of the  ECSM month events.  3.2 Evaluation Metrics  Some indicative recommended information that are important for evaluating the ECSM overall and per  country:  Overall ECSM evaluation  ECSM evaluation per country  Communication channels used per category of  recipients  Communication channels used per country  Total security themes covered per week  Security themes covered per week  Total number of security themes covered  Number of security themes covered  Total cost of ECSM per year  Cost of a country’s ECSM  Total number of events per year  Events organized per country per week  Number of activities/events organized per  country  Time to organize ECSM per country  Average duration of ECSM months  Duration of ECSM per country  Total number of locations where ECSM events  were organized  Number of events’ location per country  Total number of target audience categories  Number of target audience categories  Total number of attendees in ECSM events  Number of attendees per country  Total number of visitors in all ECSM websites and  ECSM central website during the awareness month  Number of visitors in national ECSM website  during the awareness month  Total number of individuals participating in ECSM  activities (e.g., puzzle, quiz)  Number of individuals participating in ECSM  activities (e.g., puzzle, quiz)  Total number of material distributed  Number of material distributed  Number of posters  Number of brochures  Guideline 6: Member State Coordinators are recommended to provide information from past ECSMs  (2012-2016) for assessing the metrics.

Executive Summary  For the fifth consecutive year, last October the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) campaign was  successfully executed across Europe. The campaign was coordinated and supported by ENISA, the European  Commission, Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), European Banking Federation, the Estonian Information  Systems Authority and cyber security organisations from the Member States. The support for which  propelled the campaigns success as measured by both the qualitative and quantitative data compiled.  Although this year’s campaign continues to break new records, the conclusions of this report highlight a  number of fundamental areas that need to be addressed in the coming years if the campaign is to continue  to grow and more importantly influence the security behaviour of citizens online.  Citizens across Europe face similar information security threats and information asset vulnerabilities; this is  because most of the platforms, operating systems and devices used are produced by the incumbent global  product/service providers. This applies to mobile phones, email messaging services, laptops and social media  channels, since the vast majority of European citizens use similar technologies. However, citizens of each  Member State have different levels of cyber security knowledge and behaviour. These differences across  Member States may be triggered by the disparity of Member States in their commitment to awareness  raising. In particular some Member States have a dedicated team of experts for planning and executing  national security awareness campaigns;  for example, the BSI in Germany and the ANSSI in France. Other  Member States assign this role to a Ministry or Government CERT alongside their other core activities  without a dedicated representative.  The effects of this is that there is a discrepancy between the measures that citizens may apply for the same  or similar vulnerability or risk is one Member State compared to that of another Member State. An example  of the situation, the Eurobarometer survey1 highlights many differences across Member States in the use of  cyber security measures, such as firewalls or the awareness of phishing attacks. Therefore, the different level  of citizens’ awareness and the potential risk-taking behaviour across Europe in turn leads to an increase in  the risk level of Europe as a whole.  The concept for the European Cyber Security Month is to address this disparity across Member States in two  stages. The first stage is to support the Member States so that the awareness and behaviour of citizens in  each Member State is raised to a mature baseline. This becomes the reference baseline across the whole of  Europe and thereby the European Cyber Security Month aligns the risk levels across Europe. The second  stage is to further lower this risk by raising the maturity of citizen’s behaviour in unison; at the European  level. ENISA and the European Commission can achieve the objectives of the European Cyber Security Month  by driving the pan-European campaign so as to ensure all Member States are actively committed to the  European Cyber Security Month and that industry is also involved at all levels of the campaign both at the  local and European level.  The ground work is in place for the European Cyber Security Month to move to the next level. This next level  will be achieved only once a governance structure has been put in place as highlighted in the conclusions of  this report.  Furthermore a governance structure will ensure that the campaign is driven by MS as they are  ultimately the benefactors of the campaign.  A secondary reason for establishing a governance structure is  1 [1] http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  http://intraenisa/reqs/Shared%20Documents/929%20ECSM%20concept%20paper/2017%2010%2020%20Concept%20Note%20ECSM.docx#_ftnref1 http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_423_en.pdf  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  06  to achieve another goal raised in the conclusions of this report which is to increase the commitment of the  MS to the campaign and to bring on board those MS that have yet to designate a competent body to the  campaign.  This report provides an overview of the activities organised and presents a synthesis of findings on the basis  of evaluation and performance information gathered via a questionnaire and media monitoring data.  The report is structured into three main parts: an introduction, the implementation phase and an evaluation  of the campaign.  The introduction will provide readers with the policy context, scope and target audience of the campaign.  The implementation phase of the report highlights the milestones that were achieved during the planning  and execution phase of the campaign.  This includes how events were organized and co-ordinated with  partners, marketing materials used and insights into the execution of the campaign including results.  The final section of the report deals with the evaluation of the campaign, comparing this year’s results with  the previous year’s and also provides input from the partners that was generated via a questionnaire; and  finishes with a conclusion and outlook for the future.Documenting the activities of ECSM 2017 will assist in  the organization and execution of future ECSM campaigns and allow for comparing the campaign with the  results from previous years. The evaluation results and estimated impact of ECSM activities will provide the  opportunity to discuss lessons learned deriving from this exercise and to helps draw attention to related  concerns and opportunities for further improvement.  Finally the report is intended to provide a basis for discussion among the Member States, the European  Commission and ENISA on how the ECSM can best be organised in the years to come. All Member States will  need to face up to similar challenges, namely how to engage citizens and organizations so as to affect their  information security behaviour.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  07  2. Introduction  In 2013 the EU published the “Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union”2 as a means to safeguard the  online environment and to provide the highest possible freedom and security, for the benefit of EU citizens.  This strategy was jointly adopted by the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign  Affairs and Security Policy. It outlines the EU's vision in this domain, clarifies roles and responsibilities and  proposes specific activities at EU level. Its goal is to ensure strong and effective protection and promotion of  citizens' rights so as to make the EU's online environment the safest in the world.  End users play a crucial role in ensuring security of networks and information systems. In this context they  need to be made aware of the risks they face online and be empowered to take simple steps to guard against  them. Several initiatives were developed in recent years. In particular, in October 2012, ENISA, with some  Member States, piloted the \"European Cyber Security Month\" campaign.  In the context of the ECSM project, the Commission invited the Member States to organise a yearly  cybersecurity month with the support of ENISA and the involvement of the private sector, with the goal to  raise awareness among end users. ECSM and the private sector were also encouraged to join efforts in order  to promote cybersecurity awareness at all levels, both in business practices and in the interface with  customers.  ECSM runs for the entire month of October, with ENISA publishing new material and focusing on a different  topic each week. Along with ENISA, various stakeholders, ranging from the private sector, academia, the  European Commission (EC) and other EU bodies, joining together in a common vision by organising activities  with special focus on training, conferences, online quizzes and provide general presentations to end users  toward the establishment of an EU cyber-security culture.  This report summarises the activities carried out by ENISA and the participating MS for the 2017 campaign  and presents the evaluation and conclusions of the campaign. More importantly, it seeks to trigger a  discussion among partners with respect to improvements that can be made in the future.  Scope and Objectives  The scope of this report includes all the activities within the European Cyber Security Month (ECSM)  campaign and their impact in 2017.  The main objectives of the campaigns within ECSM 2017 were as follows:   to generate general awareness about Network and Information Security;   to enhance awareness on information privacy and the General Data Protection Regulation;   to promote safer use of the Internet for all users;   to stimulate awareness on information security for Internet of Things;   to build a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM;   to involve relevant stakeholders and increase the participation of EU Member States;  2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-cybersecurity-strategy-european-union- %E2%80%93-open-safe-and-secure-cyberspace  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  08   to increase national media interest through the European and international dimension of the  project;   to enhance attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media  coordination.  Evaluation Methodology  In 2017 ENISA developed an evaluation strategy to guide the Agency and MS with the gathering of data and  information for the evaluation of the campaign. Member State coordinators were urged to consider and  define the evaluation metrics duirng the planning stage of the campaign, so that the right data and  information would be collected during the execution stage.  The evaluation strategy includes both quantitative and qualitative approaches from the following sources:  1. collection of quantitative data from the MS campaign coordinators,  2. feedback from the MS campaign coordinators via the end of year Q&A questionnaire, and  3. the use of media monitoring services to gather analytical data.  An evaluation data collection form (see Annex B)  was developed by ENISA in collaboration with the Member  State coordinators for the purpose of information gathering. The evaluation form aims at extracting  pertinent information on the overall activities involved in the MS campaigns, their potential impact and  includes participants’ feedback. Guidelines (in Annex C) accompanied the data collection form, that highlight  recommended metics for each type of activity  The evaluation strategy also included a questionnaite, where the aim was to extract information on the  overall impact of the campaign based on MS campaign coordinators feedback with respect to ENISA’s  supportive role. Some of the elements assessed involve the level of support and its usefulness to MS, the  impact of promotion material used and marketing strategies followed and the role of ECSM for improving  the the outreach of MS campaigns.  The data gathered was procured by a media monitoring service and was aggregated by combining data  elements from different sources to provide insights to identify the effectiveness of the messages, media  channels and the campaign as a whole in reaching the general population.  Target Audience  This report is intended for organisations, either public or private, which supported the ECSM or intend to do  so in the future. The report is also of interest to IT security professionals and other target groups who  attended events and conferences organised across Europe during the month of October the past five years.  Further, the report targets EU national policy makers who aim to improve the security awareness of citizens,  professionals and generally IT end-users.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  09  3. Planning Phase  The role of ENISA for ECSM 2017  3.1.1 Vision statement  ENISA’s vision for ECSM is to support the Member States with the design and implementation of their  awareness raising campaigns and to promote collaboration among EU Member States, international  organizations and industry.  3.1.2 Mission statement  ENISA’s mission for ECSM is to collaborate with the EU Member States and international organizations by  finding innovative and fun ways to raise EU citizens awareness of cybersecurity, be they by organizing events,  conferences, online quizzes, transferring of best practices or the use social media to educate and inform the  public. Our mission is to enhance the delivery and synchronize ECSM among the EU Member States and  industry that will share a pan-European vision and values for cybersecurity.  3.1.3 The Objectives for ECSM 2017  A consensus on the goals of ENISA for ECSM was reached with the participating MS. The goals that were  recognized by all MS for the Agency are as follows:   To promote the underlying value that is the foundation of ECSM:  “Cyber Security is a Shared Responsibility”   To assist the Member States in implementing ECSM activities that satisfy certain criteria: have well- defined objectives, have well-specified target audience(s) per activity, have systematically defined  cybersecurity subjects, have systematically chosen delivery channels and techniques and have well- defined effectiveness metrics   To support the Member States in defining common areas of concern for cybersecurity that are shared  and will be commonly promoted to EU citizens   To support the Member States in delivering at least one cross-border awareness raising activity among  at least three EU Member States   To support the Member States with collaboration with the private sector  ENISA supported the organisation of the European Cyber Security Month campaign in various ways, such as:   coordinator of the organisation of ECSM;   hub for all participating MS;   collector of available material and generator of synergies between MS;   subject-matter expert on how to organise information security campaigns;   subject-matter expert on how to design the content and evaluation strategy for information security  campaigns;   facilitator of common messaging within the participating MS by providing tips and advice on how to be  safe and secure online;  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  10   creator of the ECSM brand and related marketing plan;   distributor of promotional material (posters and infographics).  The Agency coordinated the organisation of the ECSM campaign, by means of becoming a “hub” for all  participating MS and providing suggestions, replying to enquiries and generating synergies between MS  where possible. The Agency assisted the participating MS in defining evaluation methods and metrics during  the planning phase, in order to ensure the alignment of campaign targets and evaluation approaches.  ENISA’s Guidelines for Planning the ECSM Campaigns  ENISA developed and distributed a set of guidelines (see Annex D) to Member State coordinators for  planning the ECSM campaigns from 2017 onwards. These guidelines related to three aspects of planning a  campaign:   the objectives of security awareness,   the development of a project plan to minimize unforeseen obstacles,   and the formulation of a communication plan, including adequate delivery channels and  content.  3.2.1 A common Understanding of Security Awareness  Guideline 1: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to create campaigns aiming at activating users to  protect information from security threats. Campaigns are expected to attract recipients’ attention and make  them recognize information security concerns and respond accordingly. ECSM campaigns should also  strengthen users’ abilities to accurately perceive potential privacy threats, with regards to their shared  personal information.  3.2.2 Formulating a Project Plan  Guideline 2: Member State Coordinators are recommended to develop an ECSM project plan that can guide  management with the design, execution and evaluation of the campaign. It is imperative to produce a  documented project plan.  3.2.3 Creating a Communication Plan  Guideline 3: Member State Coordinators need to clearly define the target group or groups of the ECSM  campaign. The Member State Coordinators can broadly separate target audience into general users, young  people or business users. The design of the ECSM campaign should be customized upon the defined target  groups.  Guideline 4: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to choose information security themes addressing  both a) commonly identified security threats, and/or b) threats identified by national or international  classifications as current security threats.  Coordination  3.3.1 Conference Calls and Meetings  ENISA maintained regular communication with the MS, in order to enhance collaboration and cooperation  amongs the MS. The Agency scheduled monthly conference calls for the MS to share their plans for ECSM,  receive and provide feedback and to support in the common promotion of the pan-European campaign  strategy.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  11  The Agency prepared and distributed the meeting agenda before each conference call. Meeting minutes  where drawn up by ENISA after every call, and included a list of action points. The participation rate was  high, with an average of 12 to 15 participates per meeting.  A physical meeting was organized by ENISA and held in Brussels in April 2017. The meeting gave MS the  opportunity to discuss concerns and opportunities for improvements and finalize key areas of the campaign,  such as the themes of the month, the collaboration infrastructure and the organization and logistics of the  kick-off event.  3.3.2 Communication and Collaboration Technological Infrastracture  The collaboration mechanisms used for communication with MS is crucial for planning and executing the  campaign. ENISA provided three types of software tools for maintaining communication:  1. file repository and file exchange tools,  2. teleconference software and  3. tools for the communication and collaboration between Member State coordinators and third parties  (e.g., the private sector)  3.3.2.1 File repository and File Exchange Tools  ENISA proposed the utilisation of ENISA Sharepoint for accessing and storing files. The MS agreed on the  necessity of a file repository and registered to the proposed platform. The file repository facilitated the work  of the MS that was previously supported with the exchange of files via email.  3.3.2.2 Teleconference Software  Monthly conference calls were executed during the year in order to maintain regular contact with the MS.  The selection of the teleconference software was noted as an important decision, given that there were a  number of network and application restrictions on the side of the MS. In particular, certain tools (i.e.,  business versions, consumer versions) could not be utilised because they were restricted on the premises or  the equipment of the coordinators’ public agencies. The Agency acted as a facilitator by proposing several  options and the coordinators gradually narrowed down the option to WebX which was used in the latter end  of the year to host the monthly conference calls  3.3.2.3 Collaboration between Member State Coordinators  An important task during the planning of MS campaigns is the information sharing between the coordinators.  Information sharing regarding the MS plans allows for the identification of synergies. In order to support the  MS with this task, the Agency developed two templates to extract pertinent information.   The Activities Template, is used by coordinators to document the awareness activities that are planned by  the MS for ECSM. The ECSM activities template was designed by the Agency as a form with predetermined  options (dropdown list) given the type of activity (e.g., workshop, TV advertisement, online activity), the  relevant security theme and the target audience (e.g., home users).   The Evaluation Template, is used by the coordinators to record the evaluation information for the executed  awareness activities. The Agency prepared the evaluation report with predetermined security awareness  metrics (e.g., number of advertisement impressions, number of conference participants) and the  coordinators completed the adequate values.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  12  3.3.3 Themes of the Month  ENISA organized a workshop on April 2017 in Brussels and invited the Member State coordinators to  participate. The MS coordinators discussed and agreed upon the benefits of designing the MS campaigns  around commonly agreed security and privacy themes. ENISA suggested during the workshop potential  security themes and the MS  discussed and debated on the most relevant and current topics based on MS  cybersecurity priorities and the state of the art challenges. Following this discussion process, the MS  gradually narrowed down the alternatives and determined four themes for the month, one theme for each  one of the weeks in October.  The effectiviness of having themes of the month will need to be assessed to determine the optimum way to  organize the themes during the campaign and / or whether focus should be placed on target audiences  rather than threats / vulnerabilities.  The themes for 2017 were:  Week 1 - Theme: Cyber Security in Workplace  Targeting businesses, the aim of the theme was to raise awareness amongst employees and IT professionals  about threats such as Ransomware, Phishing, Malware and provide general cyber “Hygiene” advice.  Week 2 - Theme: Governance, Privacy and Data Protection  GDPR countdown to compliance: Ensure you are ready!!! The aim of this theme was to uncover how to  prepare your organization for the countdown to these new Directives and Regulations.  Week 3: - Theme: Cyber Security in the Home  The aim of the theme was to raise awareness amongst general users of threat from IoT, online fraud and  how to protect their home network and protect their online privacy.  Week 4 - Theme: Skills in Cyber Security  The theme sought to support the young with gaining Cyber Security skills via training and education so as to  grow the next generation of skilled Cyber Security professionals.  3.3.4 Press Releases  Member State coordinators distribute a formal press release before October announcing the ECSM and its  activities. During the physical meeting in Brussels the Agency proposed that the coordinators collaborate so  that the press releases could be distributed simuntaneously, to further foster a pan-European ECSM culture.  3.3.5 Kick-Off Event  Preparations for the fifth ECSM started in earnest with collaboration being forged between the Estonian  Information Systems Authority, Tallinn University of Technology and ENISA for this year’s Cyber Security  Month kick-off event. The kick-off event was organized to take place during the EU Presidency in Estonia and  the Digital Summit on the 29th September 2017.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  13  An assessment of the goals and scope of  the kick-off are needed if the event is going to be sustainable as a  stand alone event without the financial support of ENISA. By determining the target audience of the kick-off  event and the strategic objectives, a more effective event can be accomplished that will have greater  outreach and publicity.  Private sectors involvement in the kick-off is currently limited to speakers / panellists for the sessions.  A  number of private companies approached ENISA during the year requesting to support the event by way of  promotion and by sponsoring the lunch offered to the participants.  Following discussions with the MS it was  determined that further discussions were needed clarify the approach to take for involvement of the private  sector at the European level.  Evaluation Strategy  3.4.1 Evaluation Objectives  The Agency aimed to ensure that all Member State coordinators would capture information during the  execution of the awareness campaigns to enable the overall evaluation of ECSM and its impact. The objective  of the evaluation was to assess the effectiveness of the awareness activities, the attractiveness of the  activity, and its potential outreach and impact. The Agency urged the Member State Coordinators to  determine the evaluation metrics they would be using at the planning stage to ensure that they collected  the necessary data come the execution stage.  3.4.2 Evaluation Metrics  The Agency developed an evaluation strategy and a set of evaluation metrics for the Member State  Coordinators to use. The evaluation metrics were incorporated into a template evaluation form, for each  coordinator to complete upon finalisation of the execution stage. The evaluation metrics were segregated  per activity type, given that different information is relevant depending on the type of awareness campaign.  Marketing Material  Both the Agency and the Member States were committed to raising awareness. A series of marketing  channels and material were used to achieve this purpose, as presented below.  3.5.1 Visual identity  The Agency created some years ago a visual identity for European Cyber Security Month including a logo3, a  colour chart, typography rules, guidelines on use of imagery, design templates and a manual of formal  guidelines on the proper use of these elements. ENISA updated the ECSM logo, in order to signify the 5th  year anniversary for ECSM. The update logo for the 5th year anniversary is presented below:  3 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/press-campaign-toolbox/visual-identity  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  14  Figure 1: Updated logo for the ECSM 5th year anniversary.  The updated logo was used by ENISA, the Member States and all partners on their websites, material, videos  and social media to link their efforts up to the European campaign.  MS showed keenness to adopt the 5 year logo in their local campaigns.  The historical background of the  campaign was now available and visible in the logo and as such added weight to the MS campaigns.  3.5.2 Slogan  The slogan “Cyber security is a shared responsibility!” remained unchanged in 2017.  3.5.3 Press releases  The Agency coordinated this year’s Press Release4 with the European Commission, to ensure maximum  outreach and to stimulate attention to the featured activities and events. The Press Release was translated  into all official languages of the European Union and was released on 2nd October instead of 29th September  as in previous years so as not to be superseded by Digital Summit that was taking place on the same day in  the same city as the kick off event. The services of a media company were procured to further disiminate  the press release to national and region journalists and press across Europe.  3.5.4 Social media - banners  The Web and Social Media banners remained the  same as in the previous years.  The banner was available in four formats to match  different needs (i.e., 815x315, 1500x500, 1200x717,  1200x630).  3.5.5 Poster and Infographics  During the physical meeting in April in Brussels the MS discussed the different marketing options and their  impact. As a result of this discussion the MS decided not to produce posters for this year, but instead to  4 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/european-cyber-security-month-united-against-cyber-security- threats  Figure 2: ECSM 2017 social media banner.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  15  allocate the relevant resources for the production of more videos, because of their perceived higher impact  and reach.  3.5.6 Videos  Four videos where produced for this year’s campaign, one for each themes of the month. Each of the videos  were designed to be less than 1.30 minutes long and they were shot without narration so that the message  would be conveyed via picture and text displayed at intervals, which could be translated by the MS if  required.  The first video5 for theme 1 (Cyber Security in Workplace) was a video promoting good practices for cyber  security protection in the workplace.  The second video6 for theme 2 (Governance, Privacy and Data Protection) encouraged organizations to  consider the implications of the new regulation and legislation on personal data protection.  The third video7 for theme 3 (Cyber Security in the Home) demonstrated the implications of security for the  Internet of Things and smart technologies in the home so as to encouragecitizens to be aware of these cyber  security threats.  The fourth video8 for theme 4 (Skills in Cyber Security) aimed at raising awareness of the career  opportunities in Cyber Security.  3.5.7 Website  The material on the ECSM website9 was re-organized including the tabs on the home page so as to enhance  the accessibility of the website. .  5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM67LrJ18VE  6 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EG8zRrC_6s  7 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR51XZjLvRs  8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pN6a20Kf5Q&feature=youtu.be  9 https://cybersecuritymonth.eu/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM67LrJ18VE  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  16  Figure 3: Map of ECSM 2017 activities across Europe  3.5.8 NIS Quiz  The NIS Quiz remained the same for ECSM 2017.

The challenge, expert talks and job fair attracted a lot of interest, including over 200 of the best Cybersecurity  talents and hundreds of visitors from across Europe, who came to network and to compete for the European  crown.  Young talents from 15 competing national teams proved their technical and teamwork skills in the most  exciting and complex cyber competition of the year. The jury had a tough task to select only one winning  team, considering the very close final results and the intense competition on the day of the challenge.  Member State Campaigns  The following section provides insight into some of the Member States campaigns that were organized by  ECSM coordinators.  The MS listed below are a selection of those MS that are active partipants in the organization of the ECSM  campaign both at the European level and the local level.  Ideally all MS will be actively involved in shaping  the campaign in the future, which is why it is imperative that the campaign demonstrates to other MS the  benefits and value of working together in such an endeavour.  4.2.1 France  The 5th edition of ECSM campaign was coordinated at the national level by ANSSI, the national authority for  cybersecurity and cyberdefence, in France. The program of the campaign was ambitious, aiming to raise  awareness and provide advice and recommendations in both the work place and at home. For the 2017  edition more than 30 French institutional actors and stakeholders (ministers, national authorities,  associations), including political figures, were involved in promoting the ECSM initiative and useful advice  both for their own employees and the larger audiences (private companies, general public, students, etc.).  ANSSI also provided an awareness kit on the event to be shared widely, both in French and English with an  official poster, web banners and mail signature with the colors of ECSM. Finally, a press conference took  place on October, 2nd to present the national program.  Altogether, more than 70 activities were organized all over France (conferences, workshop, and exhibitions)  registered on the ENISA official website as well as on a dedicated web page: (www.ssi.gouv.fr/mois- europeen/). Furthermore, a successful digital campaign took place all through October on Twitter and  Facebook around a common identity (#TousSecNum and #ECSM) and the European themes. Three videos  were produced by different institutions around the good practices, the ransomware threats as well as the  role of cyberdiplomacy.  In numbers :   172 million messages viewed on Twitter and 14800 users actively engaged in the campaign in  October   33500 tweets and retweets around  #TousSecNum #ECSM   16600 views of the dedicated webpage in French  (https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2017/)  https://www.incibe.es/ https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/agence/cybersecurite/mois-de-la-cybersecurite-2017/  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  20   6114 download of the press release  presenting the ECSM and more than 50 press articles  published during the month  4.2.2 Germany  In Germany the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) as the national cyber security authority shapes  information security in digitization through prevention, detection and reaction for government, business  and society. Thus, supporting the annual ECSM-campaign goes hand in hand with the efforts to raise  awareness for cyber security among these diverse target groups.  In 2017 BSI won more than 100 partners in Germany who established more than 200 activities around  October. The range of activities was quite broad, from webinars and social media activities to live-hacking  events and a whole thematic day with workshops, discussions and many more. Overall, BSI succeeded in  substantially bringing forward the ECSM campaign in Germany with a significant rise in partners and a higher  outreach to citizens than in previous years.  As the national coordinator in Germany, the BSI supported the ECSM especially with activities focussing on  private users. BSI adapted the weekly topics of ENISA and provided information material on each topic.  Basically, these were:   - four video-statements, each giving background information regarding the weekly topics,   - four polls on Facebook, presenting questions on the weekly topics  to interested users, and   - press releases on each topic.  Furthermore, BSI focused on the topic \"cybersecurity at home\" for the whole month. In addition to the above  mentioned activities, BSI published the following:   - a new brochure for private users on the secure  use of IoT- and smart home devices,   - two website articles on how to secure smart homes,   - an animated video informing about relevant security measures for smart homes,   - a short quiz on the website to test user's knowledge on cybersecurity for smart homes, and   - a radio feature on this topic.  Additionally, BSI supported an \"action day\" taking place in Bonn with a presentation and an information  booth to give advice to interested citizens.  As coordinator of the ECSM and as the national cybersecurity authority the BSI will also be highly engaged  in contributing to and promoting the ECSM in the coming years with even more ambition.  4.2.3 Luxembourg  The kick-off for ECSM 2017 took place on the Oct 12th during the opening of the Luxembourg Cybersecurity  competence center by Francine Closener, Secretary of State of the Economy. The inauguration was followed  by a dedicated Cybersecurity week Luxembourg, taking place from 16-21 November.  The Cybersecurity competence center is based on a public private partnership and part of  SECURITYMADEIN.LU innovative services to provide users with up-to-date threat analysis, solution testing  and immersive cybersecurity training through a dedicated simulation platform.  Cybersecurity week Luxembourg was filled with 15 events to support the build up of a culture of  cybersecurity among individuals and to position the country as a leading European location for cybersecurity  start-ups, talent, investors and experts who are looking for growth opportunities.  https://www.c-3.lu/ https://www.c-3.lu/ https://cybersecurityweek.lu/  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  21  Founding members (Excellium, Luxinnovation, Ministry of the Economy, PwC; SECURITYMADEIN.LU) and  supporters (Digital Skills coalition Luxembourg; Luxembourg Institute for Digital Training) of the  Cybersecurity week Luxembourg brought together over 2000 people to participate in a variety of ICT  activities. Public and private actors demonstrated their determination to collaborate towards improving the  level of digital security of companies, organizations and citizens. On the international scene, Luxembourg  has increased its visibility by attracting world-renowned experts.  PwC’s Cybersecurity Day brought together more than 200 professionals, experts, public and private actors,  start-ups and investors involved in international IT security issues as well as the tools and solutions of  tomorrow thanks to 10 companies selected for their innovative solutions originating from Europe, the USA  and Israel. The analysis of threats and vulnerabilities as well as the means to combat them, aroused the  interest of all professionals looking for new ways to enhance their security.  \"Hackers\" from around the world gathered at the Hack.lu conference and set a new record: no less than 60  speakers took turns presenting their topics!  This spotlight on cybersecurity comes at the right time, when Europe is sorely lacking in professional IT  profiles which will ensure the cyber defense of tomorrow. Creating professional career paths has become  vital and the \"Cyber Talent Day\" event contributed to this goal.  On the regulatory side, the implementation of the GDPR in 2018 worries small businesses that do not always  know where to start when it comes to compliance issues. The topic was discussed several times during the  week, and helped to clarify things for these actors.  Other events included for example a “Cybersecurity4success” conference at the Luxembourg Chamber of  Crafts; a “Hack4kids” and a “Crypto party” for kids gathering around 150 kids.  The week ended with the presentation of 5 awards: Best Security Officer (CISO); Best Thesis Award; Capture  the Flag Award; Most Promising Company Award; People’s Choice Award.  In addition, ECSM Luxembourg traditional partnership with BEE SECURE11, a governmental initiative raising  awareness among young people and public at large, was also successful this year: the ECSM is part of the  BEE SECURE campaign “Big Data”, gathering 18 national partners and associations and raising awareness  about the “traces” we leave on the internet, and how to lead a responsible online life. The campaign is mainly  displayed in schools and public spaces from October 2017 to September 2018. ECSM was also mentioned in  their launching press release.  Furthermore, RESTENA, a foundation providing network services for all public and private institutions and  organizations involved in the field of education and research, and the University of Luxembourg initiated a  blog for their students and employees to raise awareness on cyber themes during ECSM.  A first, fruitful, contact was made with the European Investment Bank. We look forward to extend our  cooperation for 2018 edition.  During the ECSM we promoted, among others, the 4 thematic video clips produced for the campaign through  our social media channels. Generally speaking, press coverage was done through 3 press communiqués ; 8  articles in the national press; 1 radio show; a dedicated website with12,000 visitors during ECSM; approx.  11 https://www.bee-secure.lu/  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  22  2500 Facebook followers and an organic reach of nearly 4000 people for #ECSM related post and 1200  tweeter followers.  4.2.4 Slovenia  For the 2017 European Cyber Security Month Campaign Slovenia focused on workplace security and cyber  security challenges that small and medium companies are facing. The main creative idea that reflected in  design, copy right and all communication channels (Facebook, TV ads, new website, online advertising) was  that the mouse could be the most frightening animal as one wrong mouse click could cause big trouble in a  sense of online security. During entire month of October, a new website targeting business users, more  specifically accountants, employees and employers was established. The site focused on this target group  and providedadvice so website users could find useful and tailored resources regarding  ransomware, online  scams targeting companies, malware, phishing, safe online banking, backup, GDPR, network security etc.  The website content hub included three main call-to-actions:   Order a poster for your company. During the entire month of October, free posters were provided  about ransomware for companies who expressed their interest.   Sign up for newsletter. New mailing list for business users was set up and every Monday morning  one tip about workplace security was distributed.   Download Security Roadmap for your company. A booklet was published with 10 crucial information  and network security challenges for SMB.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  23  5. Evaluation  Questionnaire  The questionnaire is an important tool used to gather the opinions of the MS coordinators that are engaged  in the campaign. The charts below present the replies of 15 participants representing their MS. An increase  of 3 participants compared to the previous year.  5.1.1 Results  1. How would you rate the overall implementation of the ECSM 2016 campaign (scale 1-5)?  2. Did ECSM support in a satisfactory manner the outreach and promotion of your work?  3. Did ECSM add value to your national campaign?  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  24  4. Did ECSM offer opportunities for improving your national campaigns through collaboration with other  countries?  5. Do you think ENISA succeeded in the sharing and promotion of new ideas among ECSM partners?  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  25  6. Did the four short video clips produced for ECSM support your national campaign?  7. Could ECSM better promote the awareness material produced by its partners’ campaigns?  8. Would you want ENISA to facilitate in the engagement of the private sector in future campaigns?  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  26  9. Would you want to further align ECSM with international awareness raising campaigns?  10. Do you think that ECSM offers opportunities for fostering a pan-European cyber security culture?  5.1.2 Results  MS coordinators perceived the implementation of campaign to be above average based on the results of question  one. This result is significantly better than last year’s results which was on the whole average.  The overwhelming majority of MS coordinators agreed that the campaign added value to their work, that it supports  their local national campaigns and the promotion of their work (Q2 and Q3). Nevertheless, 40% of MS coordinators  were are not entirely convinced that the campaign offered opportunities for collaboration and sharing of ideas  among the MS, while on the other hand 60% believe that it did achieve these goals (Q4 and Q5).  The feedback on the short videos clips produced by ENISA was mixed with 53% supporting their usefulness to their  campaigns, whilst the other half considered otherwise or did not take a position.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  27  A large majority of MS coordinators agreed that ECSM could do better in promoting the MS awareness material. The  feedback for better promotion of material included the following suggestions on how this could be achieved:   By providing the possibility to discuss and share materials and experiences on an internal online  platform/space accessible for the national coordinators (something like Basecamp, etc.)   By better presenting such awareness material on the ECSM website   By creating more interactions during the campaign between ENISA, the official ECSM accounts and  partners   By increasing the participation of partners and their national campaigns at the kick-off event  Feedback related to the private sector’s engagement in future campaigns was positive amongst 66% of the  participants however 34% rejected or hesitated to respond . A suggestion from a MS coordinator was that this should  be discussed in a future ECSM meeting amongst the MS.  Finally, the majority of MS coodinators were positive about the prospect of aligning ECSM with international  campaigns (Q9) and a similar results came from the question whether ECSM offers an opportunity for fostering EU- wide cyber security culture.  Web analytics  Web analytics provided the statistical data for ECSM web site and social media channels. The purpose of gathering  these figures were to evaluate the impact and visibility of the campaign.  5.2.1 ECSM Web Page  The analysis takes into consideration multiple variables in relation to different types of access points to the ECSM  website in the period of October.  Statistics for October include:   ECSM page views: 92,507   Users accessing the website: 20,486   Total Sessions: 27,247  Figure 4: Graph overview of ECSM web site sessions.  The “pie” chart demonstrates the percentage of new visitors accessing the ECSM web page only once versus those  revisiting the web page multiple times. While this is encouraging, ENISA recognises the need of finding the means  of keeping the interest of users “alive” for a greater period of time.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  28  Below is a comparison between this year’s campaign and previous years with respect to the number of sessions and  page views to the ECSM webpage. Statistics demonstrate that the ECSM website has achieved a substantial growth  in its popularity in 2017 in comparison to the almost linearly increased rate of previous campaigns.  Figure 5: Overview of annual increase of ECSM web page sessions and page views  5.2.2 NIS Quiz  The data in figure 6 indicates the dispersion of page views for the NIS Quiz before during and after October. The  total number of view for October reached 17,487 views out of a total of 92,507 views that the ECSM web site  received in the period from 1st to 31st of October. These statistics demonstrate the popularity that the NIS quiz  has gained during the campaign, equating to approximately 18,9% of the total ECSM site web traffic targeted the  NIS Quiz.  Figure 6: NIS quiz page views within ECSM October’s events  The 17,487 views of the NIS Quiz can be further broken down between the views of the main page and the  introductory video of the quiz as follows:   8,119 page views were dedicated to accessing the main NIS Quiz page   9,368 page views were dedicated for accessing the introductory youtube video of the quiz  The total number of visitors succeeding to complete the NIS Quiz compared to previous years increased from 788  last year to 2392 in 2017, an increase of 303%.  In addition, the percentage of participants that visited the NIS Quiz  home page and then went on to complete the NIS Quiz increased from 10% last year to 29.4% in 2017, reflecting  that 1/3 of all visitors went on to finish the NIS Quiz.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  29  5.2.3 ECSM Map of Activities  The following data illustrate the number of activities taking place from 2013 to 2017 during October. The graph on  the left presents the total number of events registered on ECSM website during the month October every year since  2013, while the one on the right, the number of countries that have registered at least one event for the same period  range.  Figure 7: Number of activities in October and the number of countries registering activities annually  The rate of growth in 2017 has stabilized back to the long term average growth rate. A stable growth rate of events  year on year were recorded from inception up until 2015, wherein the number of events registered almost doubled  in 2016 from the previous year.  The growth in the number of events registered is an outcome of the increased  popularity of the campaign.  The top ten MS with respect to the number of events they have registered during October are displayed in the pie  charts below for 2016 and 2017. A notable difference from last year’s campaign is the Netherlands, that rose to be  included in the top 5 MS with the most number of activities.  Figure 8: Top Ten countries with respect to the number of events registered for ECSM 2016 and 2017  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  30  5.2.4 Social Media  Twitter continues to support the promotion and outreach of the campaign. The figures below demonstrate the  fluctuation of twitter followers from September until November 2017 for the handle @CyberSecMonth. The highest  peak corresponds to the launch of ECSM and specifically the Kick-off event on the 29th of September, followed by  renewed interest again until the latter end of the month.  Useful statistics that are extracted from the graph are:   The total number of followers (12,894)   The amount of new accounts (1,870) created within this period of three months  Figure 9: The daily growth of Twitter followers from September to November 2017 to @CyberSecMonth  The graph below tracks the growth in the number of twitter followers of @CyberSecMonth over time. It shows an  accelerated growth in this year’s campaign, almost doubling versus the pervious year.  Figure 10: Annual number of Twitter followers @CyberSecMonth  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  31  5.2.5 Media Reach  There was a total of 330 articles published which mentioned ECSM from the period 23rd of September till the 7th of  November. Looking at the distribution below, it can be seen that the peak of articles mentioning ECSM took place  during the start of the campaign and then tapered off for the rest of the month. The online reach of the campaign,  that is, the size of audience exposed to the campaign’s advertisement has been estimated to be approximately  86,5m versus 112m from the previous year.  Figure 11: Number of articles published that mention ECSM from 23/09 to 7/11  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  32  Figure 12: Estimated online reach in October 2017  Figure 13: A comparison overview of online reach and number of articles published during October respectively  5.2.6 Conclusions  The majority of the indicators used to evaluate the campaign demonstrate a higher growth rate year on year  compared to the average level of growth from previous years. In particular the growth rate of the Twitter followers  and the number of participants completing the NIS Quiz (possibly triggered by EU's GDPR implementation  discussions) almost doubled year on year.  Some analytics did demonstrate a minor decrease such as the online reach of the campaign and the number of  publications in the period, factored possibly by the absence in this year's kick-off event of large organizations of  combined resources such as the European Banking Federation (EBF) and Europol (EC3). Nevertheless, the substantial  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  33  increase of ECSM website's popularity and of the number of activities registered media followers contributed  towards successful performance for the 2017 campaign.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  34  6. Conclusions and Future Work  The performance of the campaign based on the analytical indiocators and the positive feedback received from MS  coordinators confirm that the 2017 campaign succeeded to build on the results of previous years and grow inline  with the long term growth rate. Several factors contributed to this positive outcome, a major one being the strength  of the relationship between ENISA and the MS coordinators and another being the launch of the campaign during  the EU Presidency in Estonia with the Estonian Information Systems Authority.  Another important aspect of the work carried out this year was the introduction of guidelines by ENISA to support  in the organization and evaluation of the campaign.  First was a set guidelines for organizing a campaign at the MS  level to assist MS in the planning and execution of their national campaigns.  The second was the creation of a data  evaluation form to be used by MS to plan for and gather data points post the campaign at the evaluation stage.  The  introduction of these steps will serve to have a greater impact on future campaigns as they mature and as MS  become familiar with using them.  During the course of 2017 a number of observations were made by ENISA that will be addressed in coming years so  as to influence the success of the campaign going forward. These observations are listed below and include ENISA  perspective on how they could be addressed.  Member State Commitment  Member States participate on a voluntary basis in the organization of the campaign.  Participants are predominantly  representatives from the National Cyber Security Centres, responsible Government Ministries or the CERT  community. Some Member States have dedicated units and personnel whilst others work on a best effort basis  alongside their other core activities.  There are a dozen or so core participants to ECSM from the Member States that actively participate in the monthly  conference calls and physical meeting. The remaining Member States participate on an ad hoc basis or not at all.  EU Member States participating: Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg,  Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Switzerland  ‘Passive’ participation: Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, UK  EU Member States not participating: Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Slovakia  From ENISA’s perspective all Member States should be actively participating in the campaign. ENISA will  demonstrate to the MS the advantages of being involved in the campaign and the effectiveness of working together  to increase impact. In many cases lack of financial resources is identified by MS as the main reason for little  contribution to the ECSM activities or no participation.  Private Sector Involvement  Private sector involvement has been limited to participation of speakers / panellists during the annual Kick-Off event  that launches the activities of ECSM.  Discussions were held with Member States to enhance the engagement of the  private sector in the campaign either via jointly producing material or promoting the activities via their media  channels or by sponsoring activities, however consensus among the Member States was not reached and discussions  were postponed until the next face to face meeting in February 2018.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  35  From ENISA’s perspective industry involvement is critical in promoting the campaign and disseminating the  messages to a wider audience. There is keen interest from industry to be involved, the question is; What is the ideal  model for guiding this relationship?  The latest Joint Commission of the European Parliament and Council12 emphasized the strong role for the industry  in this endeavour and gave particular attention to digital service providers and manufacturers: “It (industry) needs  to support users (individuals, businesses and public administrations) with tools that allow them to take responsibility  for their own actions online, making clear that maintaining cyber hygiene is an indispensable part of the offer to  consumers”.  Governance Structure  The campaign has been prominently driven by ENISA (with the role of secretariat, ‘facilitator’) over the past five  years; with Member States participating on a voluntary basis with the majority acting as observers rather than active  participants.  Involvement of the Member States consists of providing input into the monthly conference calls and participating in  the annual physical meeting. The agenda for these meetings are prepared by ENISA and input is requested of the  Member States on decisions concerning the themes of the month, production of dissemination material,  functionality of the website, the kick-off event and other tactical aspects of the campaign.  From ENISA’s perspective a governance structure must be created to drive the decision making processes and the  responsibilities of the Member States. However this would require a commitment from the Member States,  especially those that take up an active role within the existing decision making structure.  Given the current level  commitment of the Member States only a handful would have the capability to take up such a role.  For example, a similar governance structure could be created to that of the CSIRT Network; in which the current EU  Presidency chairs and the past and future EU Presidency co-chair the steering committee, with the Member States  including the EC have voting rights. Working groups would be created within this structure to tackle certain aspects  of the campaign. The role of the Agency would be to act as facilitator and advisor to the group.  Collaboration with the European Commission  The European Commission (EC) so far supports the campaign mainly through hosting and participating at the annual  physical ECSM meeting, participation of senior officials at the launch event and translation of the annual press  release and NIS Quiz in 2016.  In 2017 the European Commission introduced the concept of “Cyber Security Ambassadors”. Its main aim is to inform  European Commission officials about the important Cyber Security European Commission achievements regarding  policies (e.g. Cyber Security Package, Prize), legislation (NIS, GDPR), training efforts (ENISA, EC – Cyber Aware and  CNECT University), operations (CERT-EU) and campaigns such as the ECSM, EU Code Week, etc. In this context,  European Commission staff who are willing to perform as Ambassadors in the European setting are expected to  promote the European Commission Cyber Security efforts in contacts outside the EX, strengthen the presence of the  European Commission and support European citizens and organizations in their Cyber Security awareness efforts by  12 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52017JC0450&from=EN  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  36  providing information and advice. ENISA actively supported this initiative and will continue to do so by preparing  and update relevant dissemination material.  From ENISA’s perspective the support of the European Commission for ECSM could be stepped up in a number of  ways, such as for a permanent European Commission representative to be involved in the steering of the campaign  via the monthly conference calls and physical meeting. The European Commission could use its privileged position  to outreach to communities and stakeholders, to garner support and help promoting the campaign. Another aspect  to this is the visibility of the kick-off event, that would be greatly impacted by the attendance of a Vice President or  Commissioner, for which the EC could play a pivotal role in securing. Finally, the commitment to the campaign from  the Member States could be stepped up with the right message from the right officials within the European  Commission.  International Collaboration  Cyber Security campaigns aimed towards citizens is now a global phenomenon, with the majority of developed  nations campaigning; particularly in October.  In the 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union13 the EC invited the Member States to organize a yearly  campaign, with the support of ENISA and included a recommendation to synchronize the EU-US cybersecurity month  starting 2014. The Working Group, established at the EU-US Summit14 15 in November 2010 is tasked with developing  collaborative approaches in cyber security, including efforts towards a programme of immediate joint campaigns  activates as well as a roadmap towards synchronized annual awareness efforts. In this respect some small steps have  been taken to align and cross promote the campaign themes and messages with that of the U.S. but with further  willingness from both parties a fully synchronized campaign could be achieved in the coming years.  From ENISA’s perspective synchronizing with the U.S. would further strengthen the campaign’s outreach and  promotion, and would widen the portfolio of materials available to citizens.  However, synchronizing with the U.S.  is not the end goal; the end goal is to synchronize the campaigns globally into a unified message that resonates  beyond boarders. In that case is probably worth to consider the current timing of ECSM during the month of October.  If the collaboration between Europe and the USA in the context of ECSM is not considered as a priority for the future,  perhaps we should consider shifting the ECSM activities towards spring or early summer avoiding the period of July- August (just before the ECSM) that poses organisational problems.  Annual ECSM Launch Event  The annual kick-off event to launch the campaign has had mixed results over the years. However due to the  collaboration with authorities in the hosting MS in 2017 and with the industry in 2016, the participation was higher  than average and attracted a number of high profile panellists. This development indicates that the event is  sustainable only with the support of another co-organizer and that it has not matured enough to stand on its own,  as yet.  13 http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  14 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-246_en.htm  15 http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-11-246_en.htm http://eeas.europa.eu/archives/docs/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  37  The next steps in the evolution of the campaign is to reassess the goal and scope of the kick-off and re-examine the  input from the Member States, EC and the private sector.  From ENISA’s perspective the kick-off event requires the support of a prominent European figure to give it visibility  and a reassessment of the goals and scope is needed if it is to continue.  Website Redesign  The ECSM website has served the campaign well over the past 5 years. Certain features have been enhanced and  webpages were added to streamline the experience for the user. The main goal of the website is to inform the  general public of events that occur in their area and to provide them with tools needed to protect themselves online,  such as recommendations and the NIS Quiz. The website also acts as a depository of material from all the Member  States and from European Institutions such as Europol. This allows campaign coordinators from the Member States  to re-use material that have been created by others that they are focusing on at the National level. ECSM website  also seeks to drive traffic to the Member States relevant campaigns and includes a dedicated supporters page. One  may argue that the ECSM may be used as an information resource also targeted towards the citizens. As it is depicted  in the graphs of Annex A the uptake of the ECSM social media channels is very good indicating that they are a better  path towards the EU citizens. In this respect, ENISA will continue investing on the use of the ECSM social media  channels.

The European Union Agency for Network and  Information Security (ENISA), the European Commission DG CONNECT and Partners are deploying the  European Cyber Security Month (ECSM) every October.  The European Cyber Security Month aims at generating general awareness about cyber security; generating  specific awareness on Network and Information Security (NIS); promoting safer use of the Internet for all  users; building a strong track record to raise awareness through the ECSM; involving relevant stakeholders;  increasing national media interest through the European and global dimension of the project; and enhancing  attention and interest with regard to information security through political and media coordination.  This document reflects the effort of ENISA to support EU Member States on the design and implementation  of national European Cyber Security Month campaigns, though guidelines.  1.1 ENISA’s Vision for ECSM 2017  The vision of ENISA for ECSM is to support the EU Member States with the design and implementation of  their awareness raising campaigns and to promote collaboration among EU Member States, international  organizations and industry.  1.2 ENISA’s Mission statement for ECSM 2017  ENISA’s mission is to collaborate with the EU Member States and international organizations by finding  innovative and fun ways to raise EU citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity, be they by organizing events,  conferences, online quizzes, transferring of best practices or the use social media to educate and inform the  public. Our mission is to enhance the delivery and synchronize ECSM among the EU Member States and  industry that will share a pan-European vision and values for cybersecurity.  2 Guidelines for Planning European Cyber Security Month  2.1 A common Understanding of Security Awareness  To develop effective ECSM campaigns with pan-European coverage, EU State Members should share a  common understanding of the concept of security awareness. For this purpose, this document presents  widely accepted definitions of information security awareness.  Information security awareness is usually associated with organizational contexts and is part of a broader  information security communication framework. ENISA (2010) defines security awareness as a “component  of the education strategy of an organization which tries to change the behavior and patterns in how targeted  audience (e.g. employees, public, etc.) use technology and the Internet and it is a distinct element from  training. It consists of a set of activities which turn users into organizations’ first line of defense… awareness  activities occur on an ongoing basis, using a variety of delivery methods and are less formal and shorter than  training” (ENISA, 2010, p. 15). NIST special publication (NIST, 2003) states that information security  awareness aims at instilling a common understanding of information security concepts and topics; covers a  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  48  broad audience of users; relies on attractive packaging techniques and is expected to bring short-term  results. Maeyer (2007) defines security awareness as “an organized and ongoing effort to guide the behavior  and culture of an organization with regards to security issues”. Thomson and von Solms (1998) state that  security awareness is “about making users aware of the value and importance of information and security  procedures”. Information security awareness aims at a state in which “users would intuitively act towards  protecting information security”, when processing information with information systems and tools. An  information security awareness program aims at transiting from users’ “ad-hoc secure behaviors to constant  secure behaviors” (Okenyi and Owens, 2007). In organizational contexts, security awareness has been highly  associated with users’ compliance to information security policies (Bulgurcu et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011;  Haeussinger and Kranz, 2013; Talib and Dhillon, 2015). Regardless of their differences, these definitions  reflect a common concept surrounding security awareness: the target to attract the attention of users to  security messages, to make them understand the importance of information security and their potential  security obligations. Also, it is generally accepted that security awareness is associated with some form of  users’ behavioral change (Albrechtsen, 2008; ENISA, 2010; Okenyi and Owens, 2007; Tsohou et al., 2015).  Recently, information privacy became an essential component of users’ awareness, when handling digital  services; especially with regards to protecting their personal information. For that purpose, this document  also presents prevailing definition on what constitutes general privacy awareness to inform the Member  State Coordinators of ECSM campaigns.  Information privacy awareness is defined as “someone's ability to accurately perceive potential privacy  threats” (Könings et al, 2013, p.164). In another definition privacy awareness “measures the awareness of  Internet users regarding a general existence and possibility of Internet privacy issues, without focusing on  technical details or on a user” (Brecht et al., 2012 p.3). Cetto et al. (2014, p. 2) state that privacy awareness  is “an individual's knowledge of who can access which shared personal information and moreover, the  degree to which actual and perceived visibility of shared items match”. Malandrino et al. (2013, p.2) refer to  privacy awareness as “perception of: 1) Who is tracking, receiving or collecting private information (2) When  information is collected (3) What information other entities receive, store and use (4) How pieces of  information are processed, linked and aggregated to potentially build detailed users' profiles”. Information  privacy awareness is also considered as “user's attention, perception and cognition of whether others  receive or have received personal information about him/her, his/her presence and activities, which  personal information others receive or have received in detail, how these pieces of information are or may  be processed and used, and what amount of information about the presence and activities of others might  reach and/or interrupt the individual” (Pötzsch, 2009, p. 228). Information privacy awareness has also been  widely associated with the terms of use and privacy settings of online contexts, such as social media (Moey  et. Al., 2016; Sohoraye et al., 2015; Kuo and Talley, 2014; Bergmann, 2009).  Based on the above analysis, we formulate the following first guideline for the Member State Coordinators  of ECSM campaigns.  Guideline 1: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to create campaigns aiming at activating users to  protect information from security threats. Campaigns are expected to attract recipients’ attention and make  them recognize information security concerns and respond accordingly. ECSM campaigns should also  strengthen users’ abilities to accurately perceive potential privacy threats, with regards to their shared  personal information.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  49  2.2 Formulation of Project Plan  Developing the yearly ECSM campaigns requires proper formulation of a project plan, including specifying  the ECSM team, their roles and responsibilities, the budget, ECSM activities, milestones, timeline and  deadlines.  When specifying the budget, the Member State Coordinators should consider personnel costs, operational  costs, advertisement costs, any technical development and support costs. While considering the costs of  an initiative, the possible contribution of third parties should be considered. This is valid when an  information security awareness program is part of a public–private partnership (ENISA, 2010).  It is important to produce a documentation of the overall project plan, given that ECSM is a yearly  initiative. The future event coordinators will find the documentation invaluable.  Guideline 2: Member State Coordinators are recommended to develop an ECSM project plan that can  guide the management of all involved activities for design, execution and evaluation. It is imperative to  produce a documented project plan.  2.3 Definition of Communication Plan  In the early stages of a security awareness campaign design it is imperative to define the target group or  groups (ENISA, 2010; NIST, 2003).  There are several potential recipients and categories of recipients that a security awareness campaign may  target, such as home users, adults, citizens, employees, parents, public officers, teenagers, Internet users  (ENISA, 2011). Obviously, there is an overall between these categories, and this is one reason why it is  crucial to identify clearly defined target groups. More importantly, it is necessary to recognize and  separate target groups, because society consists of a diverse collection of individuals with differing  interests, levels of expertise and priorities (ENISA, 2010); thus, it is difficult to find issues and messages  that will be relevant to everyone.  ENISA (2011) offers a useful categorization that can be valuable to the Member State Coordinators, which  separates three broad categories of recipients: general users, young people and business users.  Category of Users  Description  General users  Citizens, consumers, parents, educators, adults,  home users, Internet users, primarily aged 25 and  older  Young people  Kids, young children, teenagers, 13- to 18-year-old  students, schools  Business users  SMEs, IT professionals, IT civil servants,  companies, government institutions, public  administrations  Guideline 2: Member State Coordinators need to clearly define the target group or groups of ECSM  national campaigns. The Member State Coordinators can broadly separate target audience into general  users, young people or business users. The design of the ECSM campaigns should be customized upon the  defined target groups.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  50  The communication channels that will be used for delivering security awareness are a critical success  factor.  Some key recommendations for an effective awareness campaign are:   Reach out to as broad an audience as possible   Use influential and credible communication channels and senders of messages   Use more than one communication channel to engage the recipients successfully  Traditional communication channels (ENISA, 2010; NIST, 2003) that can be used are: brochures, leaflets,  comics, screensavers, newsletters, posters, emails, events, puzzles, do and don’t lists, emails, radio or TV,  SMSs, website.  The Member State Coordinators are encouraged to also consider innovative communication means, which  may increase the possibilities of success. Mobile applications that offer notifications to the enrolled users,  and may enhance the engagement of the users given the ongoing nature of the ECSM communication  (ENISA, 2011, p.35). Another option may include online games (Cetto et al., 2014; Cone et., 2007;  Albrechtsen and Hovden, 2010), which can provide personalized content and tailor the presented context  and security challenges to the user’s past performance.  Communication channels should be chosen taking into consideration the type of target group, its profile,  as well as information technology and security knowledge.  Guideline 3: Member State Coordinators should choose to use multiple communication channels reaching  out for broad audiences and sending awareness messages from credible and influential sources.  Communication channels can be chosen from several traditional communication channels available, but  innovative communication channels are highly encouraged.  Defining the security messages that will be presented to the audience is a critical activity of the ECSM  campaign design. Common information security awareness themes (ENISA, 2010) are security threats in e- mail and electronic communication, password protection, information security policies and procedures  and security incident reporting (for business users), website policies, social engineering, etc.  Information security themes, however, should be chosen based on the current trend of information  security and privacy threats, to deliver timely guidance to the users. The Member State Coordinators are  encouraged to study the recent landscape of security and privacy threats, before deciding the themes of  the ECSM 2017 campaigns. For example, ENISA (2017) has identified the top cybersecurity threats for  2016. In priority, the top ten threats include malware, web-based and web application attacks, denial of  service, botnets, phishing, spam, ransomware, insider threat, physical damage/theft. In terms of  information privacy Unesco (2012) highlights that high privacy threats relate to user identification, adware,  spyware and malware, data logging and surveillance, deep packet inspection, location-based services and  surveillance and Internet surveillance technologies generally. Individuals are now using modern  technologies and security awareness campaigns should keep pace with the technological platforms that  are interesting to them and present relevant security themes; trends such as Internet of Things, advanced  authentication, cloud computing, mobile applications, mobile payments, big data, bring your own device  (PwC, 2016). Given that ECSM activities spread in a period of a month the Member State Coordinators can  specify few security themes and divide them across the ECSM; e.g., week 1 may focus on Internet of Things  security, week 2 may focus on bring your own device security, etc.  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  51  Guideline 4: Member State Coordinators are encouraged to choose information security themes  addressing both a) commonly identified security threats, and b) threats identified by national or  international classifications as current security threats.  Guidelines for Evaluating European Cyber Security Month  3.1 Evaluation Approaches  The evaluation of a security awareness program is a challenging task. Literature includes different  approaches on how the success of such a program should be measured. For example, one category of  evaluation approaches tests the participants’ awareness through questionnaires; the participant is  requested to complete the questionnaire before the awareness program and following the awareness  program, and it is expected that awareness level will be raised. In this category, Parsons (2014) created a  questionnaire that can be used to evaluate an employee’ s security awareness. The questionnaire tests the  awareness of an employee on common security threats, such as password management, email use,  Internet use, incident reporting, mobile computing, etc. Similarly, Kruger and Kearney (2006) developed a  questionnaire to test an individual’s security awareness, which can be automated and customized based  on the needs of the evaluators. However, this evaluation approach is not suitable for the ECSM  participants, given that the respective awareness events target broad audiences, such as the public.  ENISA (2010), offers a more holistic approach offering various awareness evaluation metrics for different  audiences:   Evaluation at the business layer measures the impact of the overall project   Evaluation at the service layer measures the awareness activities output   Evaluation at the operational layer measure the awareness processes  Examples of the evaluation metrics per layer are given below:  Layer  Indicative Metrics  Business  number of events listed/month, number of  material distributed/edition, number of material  distributed/year, number of people attending  awareness trainings per campaign, number of  unique visitors/month, time to organize an  awareness initiative  Service  number of topics on security in standard primary  and secondary school education/total topics,  number of topics on security in high school and  education/total topics, number of e-government  projects using standards/total projects  Operation  mean time between discovery and notification of a  new threat, number of reported incidents per  category/year, number of systems without  implemented password policy/total n. of systems  European Cyber Security Month 2017  February 2018  52  Such evaluation metrics had been used to assess the success of the first ECSM, in 2012, as presented in the  ENISA (2012) relevant report.  Guideline 5: Member State Coordinators are urged to define evaluation metrics at the design level to  ensure that they collect the necessary data for assigning values to the metrics after the completion of the  ECSM month events.  3.2 Evaluation Metrics  Some indicative recommended information that are important for evaluating the ECSM overall and per  country:  Overall ECSM evaluation  ECSM evaluation per country  Communication channels used per category of  recipients  Communication channels used per country  Total security themes covered per week  Security themes covered per week  Total number of security themes covered  Number of security themes covered  Total cost of ECSM per year  Cost of a country’s ECSM  Total number of events per year  Events organized per country per week  Number of activities/events organized per  country  Time to organize ECSM per country  Average duration of ECSM months  Duration of ECSM per country  Total number of locations where ECSM events  were organized  Number of events’ location per country  Total number of target audience categories  Number of target audience categories  Total number of attendees in ECSM events  Number of attendees per country  Total number of visitors in all ECSM websites and  ECSM central website during the awareness month  Number of visitors in national ECSM website  during the awareness month  Total number of individuals participating in ECSM  activities (e.g., puzzle, quiz)  Number of individuals participating in ECSM  activities (e.g., puzzle, quiz)  Total number of material distributed  Number of material distributed  Number of posters  Number of brochures  Guideline 6: Member State Coordinators are recommended to provide information from past ECSMs  (2012-2016) for assessing the metrics.

Rule], as amended by 196  the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules 197  Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act [HITECH] and 198  the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to the HIPAA Rules 199  [Omnibus Rule]1 and assist regulated entities2 in their implementation of the Security Rule. It 200  includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for regulated entities 201  on assessing and managing risks to electronic protected health information (ePHI), identifies 202  typical activities that a regulated entity might consider implementing as part of an information 203  security program, and lists additional resources that regulated entities may find useful in 204  implementing the Security Rule. 205  The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and 206  availability of ePHI, as defined in the Security Rule. All HIPAA regulated entities must comply 207  with the requirements of the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives, 208  maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and 209  impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and 210  implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following regulated entities:  211  • Covered Healthcare Providers – Any provider of medical or other health services or 212  supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a 213  transaction for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has 214  adopted a standard. 215  • Health Plans – Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical 216  care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs). 217  • Healthcare Clearinghouses – A public or private entity that processes another entity’s 218  healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa. 219  • Business Associate – A person or entity3 that performs certain functions or activities that 220  involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides 221  services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for their own HIPAA 222  violations.  223  The Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards that a 224  regulated entity must address. Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An 225  implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach that 226  regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard. Implementation specifications are either 227  required or addressable. Regulated entities must comply with required implementation 228  specifications. Regulated entities must perform an assessment to determine whether each 229  1 For the remainder of this document, references to and discussions about the Security Rule will be to the Security Rule as  amended by the Omnibus Rule unless otherwise specified.  2 A “regulated entity” refers to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the Security Rule. Business associates  also includes business associates’ subcontractors who have access to ePHI.  3 A member of the covered entity’s workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or  healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  vii  addressable implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for 230  implementation in the regulated entity’s environment. 231  The assessment, analysis, and management of risk to ePHI provides the foundation for a 232  regulated entity’s Security Rule compliance efforts and the protection of ePHI. Readers are 233  reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 234  does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or risk management methodology. Section 3 235  and Section 4 provide background information about risk assessment and risk management 236  processes, as well as approaches that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing and 237  managing risk to ePHI. 238  Many regulated entities may benefit from more specific guidance concerning how to comply 239  with the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule. To that end, Section 5 240  highlights considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule. Key 241  activities, descriptions, and sample questions are provided for each standard. The key activities 242  suggest actions that are often associated with the security function or functions suggested by that 243  standard. Many of these key activities are often included in a robust security program and may 244  be useful to regulated entities. The descriptions provide expanded explanations about each of the 245  key activities, as well as the types of activities that a regulated entity may pursue in 246  implementing the standard. The sample questions are a non-exhaustive list of questions that a 247  regulated entity may ask itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately 248  implemented. 249  Regulated entities may implement the Security Rule more effectively if they are shown controls 250  catalogs and cybersecurity activities that align with each standard. To assist regulated entities, 251  this publication includes mappings of the Security Rule’s standards and implementation 252  specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and to applicable security 253  controls detailed in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls 254  for Information Systems and Organizations [SP 800-53]. The mapping also lists additional NIST 255  publications relevant to each Security Rule standard. Readers may draw upon these NIST 256  publications and mappings for assistance in implementing the Security Rule. 257  Additionally, the publication lists a wide variety of resources (e.g., guidance, templates, tools) 258  that regulated entities may find useful in complying with the Security Rule and improving the 259  security posture of their organizations. For ease of use, the resources are organized by topic. 260  Regulated entities could consult these resources when they need additional information or 261  guidance about a particular topic. The resource topics include: 262  • Risk Assessment and Risk Management 263  • Documentation Templates 264  • Small Regulated Entities 265  • Telehealth/Telemedicine Guidance 266  • Mobile Device Security 267  • Cloud Services 268  • Ransomware and Phishing 269  • Education, Training, and Awareness 270  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A

Rule] 362  specifically focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information (ePHI). All HIPAA-363  covered entities and business associates must comply with the requirements of the Security Rule. 364  Throughout this publication, covered entities and business associates will be referred to as 365  “regulated entities.” Whenever the term regulated entity or regulated entities appears, it is to 366  be understood as applying to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the 367  Security Rule.  368  1.1 Purpose and Scope 369  NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-66 aims to help educate readers about the security standards 370  included in the HIPAA Security Rule and assist regulated entities in their implementation of the 371  Security Rule. It includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for 372  regulated entities in assessing and managing risk to ePHI, identifies typical activities that a 373  regulated entity should consider when implementing an information security program, and lists 374  additional resources that regulated entities might find useful in implementing the Security Rule. 375  This publication is intended to be an aid to understanding the HIPAA Security Rule and does not 376  supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the Security Rule itself. Anyone seeking clarifications 377  of the HIPAA Security Rule should contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 378  (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the 379  HHS Security Rule website.4  380  The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66, Rev. 2, were used in 381  preparing this document. NIST frequently publishes new standards and guidelines or updates 382  existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To remain current with the latest 383  available list of NIST security publications, the reader should periodically visit the NIST 384  Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC5). 385  1.2 Applicability 386  The guidance provided in this publication is applicable to all covered entities and their business 387  associates of all sizes throughout the world that store, process, or transmit ePHI. While the 388  Security Rule requires regulated entities to protect ePHI, covered entities are required by the 389  Privacy Rule6 to protect all forms of protected health information (PHI). The HIPAA Privacy 390  Rule at 164.530(c)(1) states, “A covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative, 391  technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information.” 392  Essentially, this covers all PHI – oral, written, and electronic (to the extent not covered by the 393  Security Rule). This part of the Privacy Rule applies to covered entities, not business associates. 394  However, the business associate agreement (BAA) in place between a covered entity and 395  business associate would cover protections for all PHI. Additionally, business associates are 396  4 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html.  5 See http://csrc.nist.gov.  6 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html.  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html http://csrc.nist.gov/ https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  2  directly liable for impermissible uses and disclosures of PHI (i.e., a breach). A summary of a 397  business associate’s direct HIPAA liability7 is available. Federal, state, local, and tribal 398  governments and private-sector organizations that compose the critical health infrastructure of 399  the United States are encouraged to consider using the guidance in this publication, as 400  appropriate. 401  NIST publications may be useful to any entity seeking to understand the security issues raised by 402  the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of that entity’s size, structure, or distribution of security 403  responsibilities. However, specific organizational missions, resources, and structures vary 404  greatly, and entities’ approaches to implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge 405  significantly. NIST SP 800-66 aims to assist all entities seeking further information on the 406  security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of the particular structures, 407  methodologies, and approaches used to address its requirements.  408  The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of industry-409  developed guidelines and/or models. Organizations that choose to use this publication must 410  determine the value of its content for implementing the Security Rule standards in their 411  environments. The use of this publication or any other NIST publication does not ensure or 412  guarantee that an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule. This document 413  addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other provisions adopted or 414  raised by the HIPAA Rules, such as 45 CFR § 164.105. This document also does not directly 415  address provisions in the HIPAA Privacy, Breach Notification, or Enforcement Rules.  416  1.3 Document Organization 417  The remaining sections and appendices of this publication include the following: 418  • Section 2 – HIPAA Security Rule explains the key concepts included in the HIPAA 419  Security Rule.  420  • Section 3 – Risk Assessment Guidelines provides a methodology for conducting a risk 421  assessment, the results of which will enable regulated entities to identify appropriate 422  security controls for reducing risk to ePHI.  423  • Section 4 – Risk Management Guidelines introduces a structured, flexible, extensible, 424  and repeatable process that regulated entities may utilize for managing identified risks 425  and achieving risk-based protection of ePHI. 426  • Section 5 – Considerations When Applying the HIPAA Security Rule highlights key 427  activities that a regulated entity may wish to consider implementing, as well as questions 428  that a regulated entity might ask itself when implementing the Security Rule.  429  • References provides references and related source material. 430  • Appendix A – Acronyms identifies and defines the acronyms used within this document.  431  • Appendix B – Glossary defines the terms used in this document. 432  • Appendix C – Risk Assessment Tables includes many tables referenced in Section 3, 433  Risk Assessment Guidelines. 434  7 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/factsheet/index.html.  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/factsheet/index.html  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  3  • Appendix D – National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program introduces 435  the OLIR program and how it can assist regulated entities in implementing the Security 436  Rule. 437  • Appendix E – Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications 438  Crosswalk provides a catalog of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and implementation 439  specifications and maps each to relevant Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] 440  Subcategories and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to 441  other relevant NIST publications that regulated entities may find useful in implementing 442  the Security Rule. 443  • Appendix F – HIPAA Security Rule Resources provides an annotated, topical listing of 444  additional resources that regulated entities may find useful when implementing the 445  standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule.  446  1.4 How to Use this Document 447  Readers are encouraged to use this document as a resource for concepts and tools to assist 448  regulated entities in complying with the HIPAA Security Rule. Risk assessment and risk 449  management processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s compliance with the Security Rule 450  and the protection of ePHI. For that reason, regulated entities may benefit from an initial focus 451  on Section 3 and Section 4 to build fundamental risk management processes. Section 5 may be 452  useful to regulated entities seeking activities to implement for each of the Security Rule 453  standards or for regulated entities that want sample questions to self-evaluate their protection of 454  ePHI. Regulated entities may also find value in the appendices that provide an annotated listing 455  of relevant resources, discussions of relevant topics, and a crosswalk to controls and practices 456  that may help in implementing the Security Rule. 457  This resource guide can support the compliance efforts of regulated entities in many ways, 458  including:  459  • Ensuring that each organization is selecting security practices and controls that 460  adequately protect ePHI of which they are the steward,  461  • Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the size and 462  structure of the entity,8 463  • Providing guidance on best practices for developing and implementing a risk 464  management program, and 465  • Creating appropriate documentation that demonstrates effective compliance with the 466  HIPAA Security Rule. 467  468  8 Small regulated entities may benefit from the resources listed in Appendix F, especially the Health Industry Cybersecurity  Practices (HICP) Technical Volume 1: Cybersecurity Practices for Small Health Care Organizations. Medium and large  regulated entities may find the HICP Technical Volume 2: Cybersecurity Practices for Medium and Large Health Care  Organizations (also in Appendix F) useful.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  4  2 HIPAA Security Rule 469  The HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality, 470  integrity, and availability of ePHI as defined in the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated 471  entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated 472  threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, 473  standards, and implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following 474  regulated entities:  475  • Covered Healthcare Providers – Any provider of medical or other health services or 476  supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a 477  transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard. 478  • Health Plans – Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical 479  care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs). 480  • Healthcare Clearinghouses – A public or private entity that processes another entity’s 481  healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa. 482  • Business Associate – A person or entity9 that performs certain functions or activities that 483  involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides 484  services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for its own HIPAA Security 485  Rule violations. 486  2.1 Security Rule Goals and Objectives 487  As required by the “Security standards: General rules” section of the HIPAA Security Rule, each 488  regulated entity must: 489  • Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI that it creates, receives, 490  maintains, or transmits; 491  • Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or integrity 492  of ePHI;  493  • Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not 494  permitted by the Privacy Rule; and 495  • Ensure compliance with the Security Rule by its workforce. 496  Regulated entities are reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. Cybersecurity 497  practices will vary across organizations, depending on levels of technical understanding, 498  financial and human resources, and risk tolerance. This flexibility allows regulated entities to 499  customize how they implement HIPAA’s Security Rule requirements. In complying with this 500  section of the Security Rule, regulated entities must be aware of the definitions provided for 501  confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304: 502  • Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or 503  disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.” 504  9 A member of the covered entity’s workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or  healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  5  • Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed in 505  an unauthorized manner.” 506  • Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon 507  demand by an authorized person.” 508  2.2 Security Rule Organization 509  To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar with the 510  basic security terminology it uses to describe the security standards. By understanding the 511  requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it becomes easier to see which 512  resources might assist in Security Rule implementation and where to find more information. The 513  Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards and 514  implementation specifications that a regulated entity must address.10 The six sections are listed 515  below.  516  1. Security Standards: General Rules – Includes the general requirements that all 517  regulated entities must meet, establishes flexibility of approach, identifies standards and 518  implementation specifications (both required and addressable), outlines decisions that a 519  regulated entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications, and 520  requires the maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate 521  protection of electronic protected health information. 522  2. Administrative Safeguards – Defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative actions 523  and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development, implementation, and 524  maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and 525  to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in relation to the protection of 526  that information.” 527  3. Physical Safeguards – Defined as the “physical measures, policies, and procedures to 528  protect a covered entity’s electronic information systems and related buildings and 529  equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.” 530  4. Technical Safeguards – Defined as the “the technology and the policy and procedures 531  for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it.” 532  5. Organizational Requirements – Includes standards for business associate contracts and 533  other arrangements between a covered entity and a business associate and between a 534  business associate and a subcontractor, as well as requirements for group health plans. 535  6. Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements – Requires the 536  implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the 537  standards, implementation specifications, and other requirements of the Security Rule; 538  the maintenance of written (may be electronic) documentation and/or records that include 539  the policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required by the Security Rule; 540  and retention, availability, and update requirements related to the documentation. 541  10 Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and, therefore, addressed in this document but do not  have their own modules are Part 160 – General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164 – Security and  Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements (discussed in Section 4 of this  document); 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards: General rules (discussed in Section 3.1 of  this document); and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation of the security standards.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  6  Within the Security Rule’s sections are standards and implementation specifications. Each 542  HIPAA Security Rule standard is required. A regulated entity is required to comply with all of 543  the standards of the Security Rule with respect to all ePHI. Many of the standards contain 544  implementation specifications. See Table 1 for a listing of the Security Rule’s standards and 545  implementation specifications. An implementation specification is a more detailed description of 546  the method or approach that regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard.11 547  Implementation specifications are either required or addressable. However, regardless of whether 548  a standard includes implementation specifications, regulated entities must comply with each 549  standard. 550  • A required implementation specification is similar to a standard in that a regulated entity 551  must comply with it.  552  • To meet the addressable implementation specifications, a regulated entity must (i) assess 553  whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in 554  its environment, when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting the 555  ePHI; and (ii) as applicable to the regulated entity:  556  o (A) Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or  557  o (B) if implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and 558  appropriate—(1) document why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to 559  implement the implementation specification; and (2) implement an equivalent 560  alternative measure if reasonable and appropriate.  561  Regulated entities are required to document these assessments and all decisions. For federal 562  agencies, all of the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable implementation specifications will most 563  likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes, missions, 564  and resources. 565  Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a particular 566  standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation” standards, 567  compliance with the standard itself is required. 568  Appendix E of this document provides a mapping of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and 569  implementation specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and the 570  security controls detailed in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to other relevant NIST 571  publications that regulated entities may find useful in implementing the Security Rule. 572  For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the HHS Security Rule website.12  573  11 For more information on the required analysis used to determine the manner of implementation of an implementation  specification, see § 164.306(d) of the HIPAA Security Rule (Security standards – General rules: Flexibility of approach).  12 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html.  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  7  Table 1 - Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications 574  Standard Sections  Implementation Specifications  (R)=Required, (A)=Addressable  Administrative Safeguards  Security Management Process  164.308(a)(1) Risk Analysis (R)  Risk Management (R)  Sanction Policy (R)  Information System Activity Review (R)  Assigned Security Responsibility 164.308(a)(2) (R)  Workforce Security  164.308(a)(3) Authorization and/or Supervision (A)  Workforce Clearance Procedure (A)  Termination Procedures (A)  Information Access Management  164.308(a)(4) Isolating Health care Clearinghouse  Function (R)  Access Authorization (A)  Access Establishment and Modification  (A)  Security Awareness and  Training  164.308(a)(5) Security Reminders (A)  Protection from Malicious Software (A)  Log-in Monitoring (A)  Password Management (A)  Security Incident Procedures  164.308(a)(6) Response and Reporting (R)  Contingency Plan  164.308(a)(7) Data Backup Plan (R)  Disaster Recovery Plan (R)  Emergency Mode Operation Plan (R)  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  8  Standard Sections  Implementation Specifications  (R)=Required, (A)=Addressable  Testing and Revision Procedure (A)  Applications and Data Criticality Analysis  (A)  Evaluation 164.308(a)(8) (R)  Business Associate Contracts  and Other Arrangements  164.308(b)(1) Written Contract or Other Arrangement  (R)  Physical Safeguards  Facility Access Controls  164.310(a)(1) Contingency Operations (A)  Facility Security Plan (A)  Access Control and Validation Procedures  (A)  Maintenance Records (A)  Workstation Use 164.310(b) (R)  Workstation Security  164.310(c) (R)  Device and Media Controls  164.310(d)(1) Disposal (R)  Media Re-use (R)  Accountability (A)  Data Backup and Storage (A)  Technical Safeguards  Access Control 164.312(a)(1) Unique User Identification (R)  Emergency Access Procedure (R)  Automatic Logoff (A)  Encryption and Decryption (A)  Audit Controls  164.312(b) (R)  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  9  Standard Sections  Implementation Specifications  (R)=Required, (A)=Addressable  Integrity 164.312(c)(1) Mechanism to Authenticate Electronic  Protected Health Information (A)  Person or Entity Authentication 164.312(d) (R)  Transmission Security 164.312(e)(1) Integrity Controls (A)  Encryption (A)  575  576  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  10  3 Risk Assessment Guidance 577  Risk assessment and risk management processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s 578  compliance with the Security Rule [Sec. Rule] and the protection of ePHI. Readers are reminded 579  of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk 580  assessment or risk management methodology. This section provides foundational information 581  about risk assessment and an approach that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing risk 582  to ePHI. Regulated entities are free to use another risk assessment methodology13 that provides a 583  comprehensive assessment of risk to ePHI.  584  This section incorporates the risk assessment concepts and processes described in the NISTIR 585  8286 [IR 8286] series (specifically NISTIR 8286A [IR 8286A], Identifying and Estimating 586  Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management); NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Effective Use of 587  Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk [SP 800-30]; and NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk 588  Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle 589  Approach for Security and Privacy [SP 800-37]. It is intended to assist regulated entities in 590  identifying risks to ePHI. 591  The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where ePHI could be used or disclosed 592  without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed. The 593  results of the risk assessment are used to make risk management decisions on the implementation 594  of security measures required by the Security Rule to bring risk to ePHI into an organizationally 595  established risk tolerance range (i.e., reasonable and appropriate level), or if additional security 596  controls are necessary.  597  Key Terms Defined 598  When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be clearly understood. This subsection 599  defines important terms associated with risk assessment and risk management. 600  • Threat events are circumstances or events that can have a negative impact on ePHI.  601  Threat events can be: 602  o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent)  603  o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error) 604  • Threat sources refers to the intent and method targeted at causing harm to ePHI. Threat 605  sources can be: 606  o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados), 607  o Human (e.g., intentional, such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware authors; 608  unintentional, such as data entry error, accidental deletions), or 609  o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazmat contamination, 610  environmental pollution). 611  • Vulnerabilities are flaws or weaknesses in a system, system security procedures, internal 612  controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat event.  613  13 Regulated entities may benefit from the NISTIR 8286 series of publications for more comprehensive risk assessment  methodologies, including how to integrate ePHI risk assessment with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  11  • Likelihood refers to the probability that a given threat event is capable of exploiting a 614  given vulnerability to cause harm. 615  • Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the loss of 616  confidentiality, integrity, and/or the availability of ePHI.  617  • Risk refers to the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or 618  event. Risk is typically a function of the likelihood and impact calculations. 619  It can be easy to confuse some of these terms, including vulnerabilities and threats. An 620  organization may determine that it is vulnerable to damage from power surges. The threat 621  sources that could exploit this vulnerability may include overloaded circuits or too much load on 622  the local grid. Other threat sources (e.g., a data entry error) may not be able to exploit this 623  vulnerability. In this example of power surges, recommended security controls could range from 624  installing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, additional fuse boxes, standby 625  generators, or even rewiring the office. These additional security controls may help to mitigate 626  the vulnerability. 627  3.1 HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements 628  Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to: 629  Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security 630  violations. 631  The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation 632  specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management: 633  1. Risk Analysis (R14) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough 634  assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and 635  availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or 636  business associate. 637  2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to 638  reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with 639  Section 164.306(a). 640  Section 3.2 will provide a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to 641  utilize in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). Section 4 will provide risk management 642  guidance. 643  3.2 How to Conduct the Risk Assessment 644  Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies. There is no single 645  methodology that will work for all regulated entities and all situations. The following steps 646  represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment process and provide an example of 647  the risk assessment methodology described in [IR 8286A] and [SP 800-30]. It is expected that 648  14 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  12  these steps will be customized to most effectively identify risk for a regulated entity. The steps 649  listed are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted. Some steps could be 650  conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.  651  1. Prepare for the Assessment. Before beginning the risk assessment, the regulated entity 652  should understand where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. 653  Identify where ePHI is generated within the organization, where and how it enters the 654  organization (e.g., web portals), where it moves and flows within the organization (e.g., 655  to specific information systems), where it is stored, and where ePHI leaves the 656  organization. Is ePHI transmitted to external third parties, such as cloud service providers 657  or other service providers?  658  The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a regulated 659  entity’s location and a logical boundary that covers any devices or media that contain 660  ePHI, including electronic networks through which ePHI is transmitted, regardless of its 661  location. Ensure that the risk assessment scope takes teleworkers and any remote work 662  force into consideration, including any external service providers who may have access to 663  ePHI remotely. The scope should include all removable media and portable computing 664  devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) as well as the myriad of medical devices (e.g., 665  medical Internet of Things [IoT]) that can store, process, or transmit ePHI. Modern 666  mobile devices may not only contain ePHI but may also pose a greater risk to ePHI due 667  to theft or loss. In many ways, the risk assessment process will consider risks to ePHI as 668  it enters the organization, flows within the organization, and leaves the organization. 669  Additionally, the regulated entity should consider identifying the security controls 670  currently being used to protect ePHI.  671  This preparation step is essential to ensuring that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly 672  identified in the risk assessment process. For example, if the regulated entity does not 673  fully identify all parties or systems to which ePHI is transmitted, it may not be possible to 674  completely identify all relevant threats and vulnerabilities. The level of effort needed to 675  gather the necessary information15 depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and 676  the size of the regulated entity.  677  2. Identify Realistic Threats. In this step, the regulated entity identifies the potential threat 678  events and threat sources that are applicable to the regulated entity and its operating 679  environment. The listing of threat events and threat sources should include realistic and 680  probable human and natural incidents that can negatively impact the regulated entity’s 681  ability to protect ePHI. Use the information gathered from the preparation step (i.e., 682  where ePHI enters the organization, moves through the organization, is stored within the 683  organization, and leaves the organization) to identify realistic threats to ePHI. Be sure to 684  consider threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI via phishing, 685  ransomware, or insider threat.  686  687  15 Regulated entities may benefit from completing a business impact analysis (BIA) to evaluate, record, and monitor the  criticality of organizational assets, including ePHI. The BIA can help inform the determination of organizational risk tolerance  levels, which are valuable for risk management processes. See [IR 8286A] for more information.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  13  Table 2 – Common Threat Sources 688  Type Examples  Natural Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical  storms, and other such events  Human Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings, such as  unintentional acts (e.g., inadvertent data entry) or deliberate actions  (e.g., network-based attacks, malicious software upload,  unauthorized access to confidential information)  Environmental Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak  Regulated entities may make use of various sources16 when identifying relevant threats. 689  Some of the resources listed in Appendix F may help regulated entities identify common 690  threats relevant to small, medium, and large organizations. Internet searches, vendor 691  information, insurance data, and crime statistics are also viable sources of threat data. 692  Ultimately, regulated entities should identify all threats to ePHI. Examples of some 693  common threat sources are listed in Table 2. Regulated entities can also use Tables 8 to 694  10 in Appendix C as resources for identifying relevant threat events and threat sources. 695  3. Identify Potential Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions. For any of the various 696  threats identified above to result in an impactful risk, each needs a vulnerability or 697  predisposing condition that can be exploited. The identification of vulnerabilities or 698  conditions that a threat could use to cause impact is an important component of risk 699  assessment. While it is necessary to review threats and vulnerabilities as unique elements, 700  they are often considered at the same time. Many organizations will consider a given loss 701  scenario and evaluate both. What threat sources might initiate which threat events? What 702  vulnerabilities or predisposing conditions might those threat sources exploit to cause an 703  adverse impact?  704  The regulated entity develops a list of vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be 705  exploited by potential threat sources. This list should focus on realistic technical and non-706  technical areas where ePHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly 707  modified, or made unavailable when needed. Regulated entities should use internal and 708  external sources to identify potential vulnerabilities. Internal sources may include 709  previous risk assessments, vulnerability scan and system security test results (e.g., 710  penetration tests), and audit reports. External sources may include internet searches, 711  vendor information, insurance data, and vulnerability databases, such as the National 712  Vulnerability Database [NIST NVD]. In Appendix F, a suggested (but not all-inclusive) 713  resource list is provided that organizations may wish to use in vulnerability identification. 714  16 Regulated entities may benefit from [IR 8286A], specifically Section 2.2.2, when identifying threats to ePHI.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  14  4. Determine the Likelihood of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability. In this step, the 715  regulated entity determines the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a 716  vulnerability. For each threat event/threat source identified in step 2, consider:  717  • The likelihood that the threat will occur 718  • The likelihood that an occurred threat would exploit a vulnerability identified 719  in step 3 to result in an adverse impact 720  A regulated entity might consider assigning a likelihood value (e.g., very low, low, 721  moderate, high, or very high) to each threat/vulnerability pairing, as shown in Table 3. 722  Regulated entities should feel free to use a different likelihood scale based on 723  organizational needs. 724  For example, a regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a tornado occurring 725  is “Low” (located along the leftmost column of Table 3) but that if it did occur, the 726  tornado would have a “Moderate” likelihood (located along the top of Table 3) of 727  exploiting a weakness in the facility’s physical structure and result in adverse impact. 728  Using Table 3, the regulated entity locates the intersection of the two individual 729  likelihood values to assign an overall likelihood of “Low” to this threat/vulnerability 730  pairing. As another example, the regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a 731  phishing attack occurring is “Very High” and that the likelihood of the event exploiting a 732  human vulnerability is “Moderate,” resulting in an overall likelihood rating of “High.”  733  734  Table 3 – Assessment Scale for Overall Likelihood 735  Likelihood  of Threat  Event  Initiation or  Occurrence  Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts  Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Very High Low Moderate High Very High Very High  High Low Moderate Moderate High Very High  Moderate Low Low Moderate Moderate High  Low Very Low Low Low Moderate Moderate  Very Low Very Low Very Low Low Low Low  736  The regulated entity could perform this likelihood assessment for each 737  threat/vulnerability pairing. Consider that some threat events, regardless of their 738  likelihood of occurrence, may have no vulnerability to exploit, resulting in a likelihood 739  rating of “Very Low” or even “N/A.” Conversely, some identified vulnerabilities may 740  have no identified threat event that could exploit the vulnerability, also possibly resulting 741  in a likelihood rating of “N/A.”  742  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  15  5. Determine the Impact of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability. The regulated entity 743  determines the impact that could occur to ePHI if a threat event exploits a vulnerability.  744  As with likelihood determination, a regulated entity may choose to express this impact in 745  qualitative terms, such as “low,” “moderate,” and “high” or using any other scale that the 746  entity chooses. When selecting an impact rating, the regulated entity may consider how 747  the threat event can affect the loss or degradation of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or 748  availability of ePHI. Table 4 provides a brief description of each security objective (i.e., 749  confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and the impact of it not being met. The 750  regulated entity should select an impact rating for each identified threat/vulnerability pair.  751  Impact information can sometimes be obtained from existing organizational 752  documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality assessments. A business 753  impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels associated with the compromise of an 754  organization’s information assets based on a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the 755  sensitivity and criticality of those assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and 756  prioritizes the organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems, 757  services, and related technology assets) that support the organization’s critical missions. 758  Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue, the cost 759  of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems caused by a 760  successful threat action. Other impacts – such as the loss of public confidence, the loss of 761  credibility, or damage to an organization’s interest – cannot be measured in specific units 762  but can be qualified or described in terms of “high,” “moderate,” and “low” impacts, for 763  example. Qualitative and quantitative methods can both be used to determine the impact 764  of a threat event exploiting a vulnerability to cause an adverse impact. Regulated entities 765  may consult Table 5 to assist in identifying potential adverse impact and to subsequently 766  assign an impact rating to each threat/vulnerability pair. 767  Table 4.  Security Objectives and Impacts 768  Security Objective Impacts  Loss of Confidentiality System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of  information from unauthorized disclosure (i.e., the data or  information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized  persons or processes). The impact of an unauthorized disclosure of  confidential information can range from the jeopardizing of  national security to the disclosure of Privacy Act data.  Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional disclosure could  result in the loss of public confidence, embarrassment, or legal  action against the organization.  Loss of Integrity System and data integrity refers to the requirement that information  be protected from improper modification (i.e., data or information  have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner).  Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or  system by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  16  Security Objective Impacts  or data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the contaminated  system or corrupted data could result in inaccuracy, fraud, or  erroneous decisions. Also, the violation of integrity may be the first  step in a successful attack against system availability or  confidentiality. For all of these reasons, the loss of integrity reduces  the assurance of a system.  Loss of Availability Availability refers to the requirement that data or information is  accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized person or  process. If a mission-critical system is unavailable to its end users,  the organization’s mission may be affected. Loss of system  functionality and operational effectiveness, for example, may result  in the loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users’  performance of their functions in supporting the organization’s  mission.  769  Table 5 - Examples of Adverse Impacts 770  Type of Impact Impact  Harm to Operations • Inability to perform current mission or business functions  - In a sufficiently timely manner  - With sufficient confidence and/or correctness  - Within planned resource constraints  • Inability or limited ability to restore mission or business functions in the  future  - In a sufficiently timely manner  - With sufficient confidence and/or correctness  - Within planned resource constraints  • Harms (e.g., financial costs, sanctions) due to noncompliance  - With applicable laws or regulations  - With contractual requirements or other requirements in other binding  agreements (e.g., liability)  • Direct financial costs  • Relational harms  - Damage to trust relationships  - Damage to image or reputation (and, hence, future or potential trust  relationships)  Harm to Assets • Damage to or loss of physical facilities  • Damage to or loss of information systems or networks  • Damage to or loss of information technology or equipment  • Damage to or loss of component parts or supplies  • Damage to or loss of information assets  • Loss of intellectual property  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  17  Type of Impact Impact  Harm to Individuals • Injury or loss of life  • Physical or psychological mistreatment  • Identity theft  • Loss of personally identifiable information  • Damage to image or reputation  Harm to Other  Organizations  • Harms (e.g., financial costs, sanctions) due to noncompliance  - With applicable laws or regulations  - With contractual requirements or other requirements in other binding  agreements  • Direct financial costs  • Relational harms  - Damage to trust relationships  - Damage to reputation (and, hence, future or potential trust  relationships)  Harm to the Nation  • Damage to or incapacitation of a critical infrastructure sector  • Loss of government continuity of operations  • Relational harms  - Damage to trust relationships with other governments or with non- governmental entities  - Damage to national reputation (and, hence, future or potential trust  relationships)  • Damage to current or future ability to achieve national objectives  - Harm to national security  6. Determine the Level of Risk. The regulated entity assesses the level of risk to ePHI, 771  considering the information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps. 772  The level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the overall likelihood 773  of threat occurrence (i.e., step 4) and the resulting impact of threat occurrence (i.e., step 774  5). A risk-level matrix, such as the samples depicted in Table 6 and Table 7, can be used 775  to assist in determining risk levels for each threat event/vulnerability pair. Regulated 776  entities can use a different risk matrix that aligns with the ratings scales used for 777  likelihood and impact in steps 4 and 5. 778  To clarify the use of the risk matrix, consider the examples presented in step 4. For the 779  tornado threat event, the overall likelihood was assigned a rating of “Low.” However, the 780  impact of this threat event could easily be assigned a rating of “High.” Using the matrix 781  in Table 6, the intersection of “Low” likelihood and “High” impact results in an overall 782  risk rating of “Low.” For the phishing threat example, the overall likelihood was rated 783  “High.” If the regulated entity determined that the impact of a phishing threat was likely 784  to be “Moderate,” this would result in an overall risk rating of “Moderate.” The 785  regulated entity should determine the level of risk for each identified threat/vulnerability 786  pair.  787  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  18  Table 6.  Sample Risk-Level Matrix 788  Threat Likelihood  Level of Impact  Low Moderate High  High Low Moderate High  Moderate Low Moderate Moderate  Low Low Low Low  789  Table 7 - Detailed Risk-Level Matrix 790  Threat  Likelihood  Level of Impact  Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Very High Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  High Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Moderate Very Low Low Moderate Moderate High  Low Very Low Low Low Low Moderate  Very Low Very Low Very Low Very Low Low Low  7. Document the Risk Assessment Results. Once the risk assessment has been completed 791  (i.e., threat events, threat sources, and vulnerabilities identified; likelihood and impact 792  ratings calculated; and risk levels determined), the results of the risk assessment should 793  be documented. Regulated entities may benefit from documenting the risk assessment 794  results in a risk register.17 Appendix K of NIST [SP 800-30] provides a sample risk 795  assessment report outline that may prove useful to regulated entities. Other entities may 796  prefer to input the risk assessment results into a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) 797  or enterprise risk management (ERM) tool. Principally, the regulated entity should 798  document all threat/vulnerability pairs (i.e., a scenario in which an identified threat can 799  exploit a vulnerability) applicable to the organization, the likelihood and impact 800  calculations, and the overall risk to ePHI for the threat/vulnerability pair.  801  3.3 Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management 802  The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization’s risk 803  management strategy (presented in Section 4). To that end, regulated entities should not view 804  risk assessment as a one-time, static task but rather as an ongoing activity. Threats change, and 805  17 OMB Circular A-11 [OMB A-11] defines a risk register as “a repository of risk information including the data understood  about risks over time.” The risk register provides a formal communication vehicle for sharing and coordinating cybersecurity  risk activities. Regulated entities can learn more about risk registers in [IR 8286A].  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  19  some identified vulnerabilities may be remediated while new vulnerabilities appear. The 806  regulated entity may implement policies or procedures that reduce the likelihood and/or impact 807  of a threat event. This dynamic environment requires the risk assessment to be updated on a 808  periodic basis in order for risks to be properly identified, documented, and subsequently 809  managed.  810  Risk Assessment Resources 811  Regulated entities may find the HHS Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool [SRA Tool] helpful 812  in getting started with a risk assessment. The SRA tool was primarily developed to assist small 813  and medium sized regulated entities. The SRA Tool is a questionnaire that guides a regulated 814  entity through many of the same risk assessment steps described in this section. In that sense, it 815  is meant to be used in conjunction with the risk assessment guidance above. Regulated entities 816  should be aware that, as a questionnaire, there are some things that the SRA tool cannot do. It 817  cannot identify technical vulnerabilities. It is suggested to pair the SRA tool – or any 818  questionnaire tool – with a methodology that could identify technical vulnerabilities (e.g., 819  vulnerability scanning or a vulnerability management program). Software such as the SRA tool 820  will provide output only as good as the information put into the tool. For that reason, regulated 821  entities should follow established risk assessment methodology even when using tools for risk 822  assessment. Regulated entities should also be aware that use of the SRA Tool or any risk 823  assessment/management tool does not necessarily equate with compliance to the HIPAA 824  Security Rule.  825  Regulated entities may find additional resources in Appendix F that can assist in the risk 826  assessment process.  827  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  20  4 Risk Management Guidance 828  The assessment, analysis, and management of risk to ePHI provide the foundation of a regulated 829  entity’s Security Rule [Sec. Rule] compliance efforts. Readers are reminded of the Security 830  Rule’s flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or 831  risk management methodology. This section provides background information about risk 832  management as well as an approach from [IR 8286] that regulated entities may choose to use in 833  managing risk to ePHI. Regulated entities, however, are free to use another risk management 834  methodology18 that effectively protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. 835  All ePHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a regulated entity is subject to the 836  Security Rule. Regulated entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate security 837  measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, 838  integrity, and availability of ePHI. Risk management should be performed with regular 839  frequency to examine past decisions, reevaluate risk likelihood and impact levels, and assess the 840  effectiveness of past remediation efforts.  841  4.1 HIPAA Risk Management Requirements 842  Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to: 843  Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security 844  violations. 845  The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation 846  specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management. 847  1. Risk Analysis (R19) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough 848  assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and 849  availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or 850  business associate. 851  2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to 852  reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with 853  Section 164.306(a). 854  Section 3.2 provided a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to utilize 855  in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). This section provides risk management guidance in 856  accordance with 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B). 857  4.2 Risk Analysis 858  Regulated entities are required to assess risks and vulnerabilities in their environments and to 859  implement security controls to address those risks and vulnerabilities. Once the risk assessment 860  has been completed and documented, the regulated entity will have a listing of applicable 861  18 Regulated entities may benefit from the NISTIR 8286 series for more comprehensive risk management methodologies,  including how to integrate ePHI risk management with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).  19 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  21  threat/vulnerability pairs as well as the overall risk rating of each pair to the confidentiality, 862  integrity, and availability of ePHI. Some threat/vulnerability pairs may indicate a moderate or 863  high level of risk to ePHI, while others may indicate a low level of risk to ePHI. The regulated 864  entity will need to determine what risk rating poses an unacceptable level of risk to ePHI. 865  866  A regulated entity’s leadership may indicate that organizational risk tolerance is “Medium” and 867  that all risks to ePHI must be brought within that level or below. Any threat/vulnerability pairs 868  that indicate a threat rating above the organizational risk tolerance will need to be addressed. For 869  example, if using a scale of “low,” “moderate,” and “high,” the regulated entity may determine 870  that any moderate or high level of risk to ePHI is unacceptable and must be remediated.  871  Once a regulated entity implements the standards, required implementation specifications, and 872  addressable20 implementation specifications in accordance with the Security Rule, the regulated 873  entity should determine whether the risks to ePHI have been sufficiently addressed. That is, do 874  the implemented standards and implementation specifications reduce the risk of the 875  threat/vulnerability pairs that were deemed unacceptably high to levels that are within the 876  organizational risk tolerance?  877  As an example, a regulated entity’s risk assessment may have identified ransomware attacks to 878  pose a high level of risk to ePHI (i.e., High likelihood rating and High impact rating). After 879  implementing two required implementation specifications – Data Backup Plan 880  [(164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A)] and Disaster Recovery Plan [164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B)] – the regulated entity 881  reassesses that the level of risk due to ransomware attacks has been reduced to Low. The 882  likelihood of a ransomware attack may still be rated High, but the two required implementation 883  specifications have helped reduce the impact rating to Low, resulting in an overall risk rating that 884  20 Regulated entities should consult Section 2.2 and/or the [Sec. Rule] § 164.306(d) for additional information about addressable  implementation specifications and how to adequately implement them in the regulated entity’s environment.  Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance  NISTIR 8286A presents two concepts – risk appetite and risk tolerance – that may be helpful  to regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI. Risk appetite regarding cybersecurity risks is  declared at the enterprise (i.e., highest) level of the organization and provides a guidepost to  the types and amount of risk, on a broad level, that senior leaders are willing to accept in  pursuit of mission objectives. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance  risk deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership. Regulated entities  may choose to express risk tolerance qualitatively (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High,  or Very High) in alignment with the guidance presented in Section 3.  Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct. Where risk appetite statements define  the overarching risk guidance, risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that  direction. This means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the  corresponding risk appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements  represent risk limits that can assist regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  22  is within organizational risk tolerance. Another regulated entity may have determined during a 885  risk assessment that loss of confidentiality of ePHI during transmission to an external party is an 886  unacceptably high risk (i.e., outside of established risk tolerance). However, the regulated entity 887  has determined that the implemented standards and implementation specifications still do not 888  reduce the risk to levels that are within organizational risk tolerance and that additional controls 889  are needed21. 890  This process of risk analysis should be completed for each threat/vulnerability pair to determine 891  whether the implemented standards and implementation specifications have reduced risk to ePHI 892  to levels within the organizational risk tolerance level. Ultimately, the regulated entity’s risk 893  analysis processes should inform its decisions regarding the implementation of security measures 894  sufficient to reduce risks to ePHI to levels within organizational risk tolerance. Each regulated 895  entity must document22 the security controls determined to be reasonable and appropriate, 896  including analyses, decisions, and the rationale for decisions made to refine or adjust the security 897  controls.  898  4.3 Selecting Additional Security Controls to Reduce Risk to ePHI 899  A regulated entity may determine that there are identified risks to ePHI that cannot be brought 900  within established risk tolerance by any standards, required implementation specifications, or 901  addressable implementation specifications in the Security Rule. In such a situation, the regulated 902  entity should consider implementing additional security controls23 to reduce the risk to ePHI to 903  established risk tolerance. Appendix E provides a catalog of the HIPAA Security Rule standards 904  and implementation specifications, mapping each to relevant [NIST CSF] Subcategory outcomes 905  and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. Regulated entities may benefit from the mapping to 906  identify desired cybersecurity outcomes, as well as SP 800-53 management, operational, or 907  technical controls that can reduce the risk to ePHI to established risk tolerance. 908  Many organizations implement a variety of technical and non-technical controls separate from 909  the protection of ePHI. These controls may consist of policies, processes, or technology. A 910  thorough understanding of the entirety of security controls in place for a regulated entity may 911  reduce the list of applicable vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability of a threat 912  exploiting a vulnerability. Regulated entities should be sure to evaluate all technical and non-913  technical security controls at all places where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, 914  or transmitted. This evaluation should determine whether these additional security measures 915  implemented or planned are adequate to protect ePHI and reduce risk to ePHI to established risk 916  tolerance. The appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the 917  structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity. 918  21 See Section 4.3 for additional discussion.  22 Regulated entities should consider documenting these decisions in the risk register or wherever the risk assessment results were  documented. See Section 4.4.  23 It should be noted that not all possible recommended security controls can be implemented to reduce risk. To determine which  are required and appropriate for a specific organization, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted for the proposed  recommended controls to demonstrate that the costs of implementing the controls can be justified by the reduction in the level  of risk. In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and feasibility of introducing the  recommended security controls into the operating environment.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  23  For some threats and/or vulnerabilities, the regulated entity may determine that the risk to ePHI 919  cannot be brought within established risk tolerance through any standards, implementation 920  specifications, or additional security controls. In this case, the regulated entity’s leadership may 921  choose to revisit the established risk tolerance. The resulting discussions present an opportunity 922  for leadership to determine the best course of action to refine risk acceptance and tolerance in 923  light of mission objectives (e.g., through a risk exception process, an adjustment to the risk 924  tolerance statement, or increased security requirements). However, if an unacceptable level of 925  risk to ePHI cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective manner, that risk should be avoided. 926  Such a condition may require significantly redesigning relevant systems or processes that handle 927  ePHI. 928  4.4 Documenting Risk Management Activities 929  As with the risk assessment, the risk management activities should be documented. The 930  regulated entity may build on the documentation developed during the risk assessment by 931  indicating how threat/vulnerability pairs with risk levels above established risk tolerance are 932  mitigated or avoided. Some regulated entities may choose to document their risk management 933  activities through a risk register that records assessment findings, remediation plans, timelines, 934  responsible parties, etc. Other regulated entities may choose to utilize free or commercially 935  available tools to document their risk management activities. The documentation and retention of 936  risk assessment and risk management activities may be important for future risk management 937  efforts.  938  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  24  5 Considerations When Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule 939  This section presents security measures that are relevant to each standard of the Security Rule.  940  Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format. The following tables, organized by 941  HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] standard, are designed to initiate the thought process for 942  regulated entities to implement the requirements of the Security Rule. These tables highlight 943  considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule; they are not meant to 944  be prescriptive. The tables should also not be considered comprehensive for all considerations 945  when implementing the Security Rule.  946  In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the 947  following information: 948  • Key Activities – The Key Activities column lists actions that are often associated with 949  the security functions suggested by each HIPAA Security Rule standard. Some of these 950  key activities are also the implementation specifications for that standard. Each key 951  activity that is also an implementation specification has been identified as such in the 952  table (in italics in the Description section of the table) along with a note as to whether the 953  implementation specification is required or addressable.  954  Other key activities are not implementation specifications. These activities are not 955  specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is 956  in no way meant to expand upon the requirements of the Security Rule. Many of these 957  activities, however, are often included in a robust security process and may be useful to 958  regulated entities. These activities may also normally be performed as part of one or more 959  of the standard’s implementation specifications. For clarity, these activities are listed as 960  separate key activities with a footnote explaining any relationship to associated 961  implementation specifications.  962  The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation 963  specifications, both required and addressable. Seven of the standards include all of the 964  necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation 965  specifications. In these instances, the standards themselves also serve as the 966  implementation specification. As noted earlier in this document, even if there are no 967  implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned 968  Security Responsibility and Evaluation, compliance with the standard itself is still 969  required.  970  The listed key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be additional 971  activities that an organization will need to consider specific to its own operations that are 972  not included in the key activities of the tables. Each regulated entity will need to identify 973  which activities beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its 974  environment, implement those activities, and document them.  975  The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised 976  by the HIPAA Security Rule. For more detailed information about the key activities, 977  readers may consult the crosswalk presented in Appendix E. The crosswalk lists, for each 978  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  25  Security Rule standard, one or more relevant NIST publications that could provide more 979  context or information. 980  • Description – The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation 981  about the key activities. The descriptions include the types of activities that a regulated 982  entity may pursue in implementing a standard. These explanations are designed to help 983  get an entity started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule. The first description bullet 984  of each key activity that is also an implementation specification is in italics. When a 985  relationship exists between description bullets and other Security Rule standards or 986  implementation specifications, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.  987  988  • Sample Questions – This column includes questions that a regulated entity may ask 989  itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately implemented. These sample 990  questions are not exhaustive but are representative of the questions that a regulated entity 991  may find helpful when implementing the Security Rule and implementation 992  specifications. Affirmative answers to these questions do not necessarily imply that an 993  entity is meeting all of the requirements of the HIPAA security standards. Negative 994  answers to these questions should prompt the regulated entity to consider whether it 995  needs to take further action to comply with the standards. It is possible that organizations 996  with existing information security programs will have considered many of the sample 997  questions. The questions that an organization asks in implementing the Security Rule 998  should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity. 999  This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational 1000  Requirements, in detail as it does not set out general security principles. HIPAA-regulated 1001  entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further 1002  guidance if needed.  1003  Readers are reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. The following key activities, 1004  descriptions, and sample questions are meant to be informative, not prescriptive. This flexibility 1005  allows regulated entities to customize how they implement HIPAA’s Security Rule requirements. 1006  Regulated entities should customize the key activities, descriptions, and sample questions to best 1007  fit their organization. 1008  Each regulated entity (i.e., covered entity or business associate) is responsible for its own 1009  Security Rule compliance and violations and should therefore review the following key 1010  activities, descriptions, and sample questions through the lens of its own organization.  1011  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  26  5.1 Administrative Safeguards 1012  5.1.1 Security Management Process (§ 164.308(a)(1)) 1013  HIPAA Standard: Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations. 1014  Key Activities Description Sample Questions  1.

Under the HIPAA Security Rule, a  security incident is the attempted or successful  unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or  destruction of information or interference with system  operations in an information system (45 CFR § 164.304).  • Ensure that the incident response program covers all parts  of the organization in which ePHI is created, stored,  processed, or transmitted.  • Determine how the organization will respond to a security  incident.  • Establish a reporting mechanism and a process to  coordinate responses to the security incident.  • Provide direct technical assistance, advise vendors to  address product-related problems, and provide liaisons to  legal and criminal investigative groups as needed.  • Has the HIPAA-required security risk assessment resulted  in a list of potential physical or technological events that  could lead to a breach of security?  • Is there a procedure in place for reporting and handling  incidents?  • Has an analysis been conducted that relates reasonably  anticipated organizational threats (that could result in a  security incident) to the methods that would be used for  mitigation?  • Have the key functions of the organization been prioritized  to determine what would need to be restored first in the  event of a disruption?62  2. Develop and Deploy an  Incident Response Team or  Other Reasonable and  Appropriate Response  Mechanism  • Determine whether the size, scope, mission, and other  aspects of the organization justify the reasonableness and  appropriateness of maintaining a standing incident  response team.  • Identify appropriate individuals to be a part of a formal  incident response team if the organization has determined  that implementing an incident response team is  reasonable and appropriate.  • Consider assigning secondary personnel to be part of the  incident response team in the event that primary  personnel are unavailable.  • Do members of the team have adequate knowledge of the  organization’s hardware and software?  • Do members of the team have the authority to speak for  the organization to the media, law enforcement, and clients  or business partners?  • Has the incident response team received appropriate  training in incident response activities?  3. Develop and Implement Policy  and Procedures to Respond to  and Report Security Incidents  Implementation Specification  (Required)  • Identify and respond to suspected or known security  incidents; mitigate, to the extent practicable, harmful  effects of security incidents that are known to the covered  entity or business associate; and document security  incidents and their outcomes.  • Has the organization determined that maintaining a staffed  security incident hotline would be reasonable and  appropriate?  • Has the organization developed processes for  documenting and tracking incidents?  61 See Section 5.2.1, HIPAA Standard: Facility Access Controls; Section 5.3.1, HIPAA Standard: Access Control; and Appendix F Resources.  62 See Section 5.1.7, HIPAA Standard: Contingency Plan.

Repeat Evaluations  Periodically  • Establish the frequency of evaluations, and consider the  sensitivity of the ePHI controlled by the organization, its  size, complexity, and environmental and/or operational  changes (e.g., other relevant laws or accreditation  requirements).  • In addition to periodic reevaluations, consider repeating  evaluations when environmental and operational changes  that affect the security of ePHI are made to the  organization (e.g., if new technology is adopted or if there  are newly recognized risks to the security of ePHI).  • Do security policies specify that evaluations will be  repeated when environmental and operational changes are  made that affect the security of ePHI?  • Do policies on the frequency of security evaluations reflect  any and all relevant federal or state laws that bear on  environmental or operational changes affecting the security  of ePHI?  • Has the organization explored the use of automated tools  to support periodic evaluations?  1051  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  46  5.1.9 Business Associate Contracts and Other Arrangements (§ 164.308(b)(1))75 1052  HIPAA Standard: A covered entity may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic protected 1053  health information on the covered entity’s behalf only if the covered entity obtains satisfactory assurances, in accordance with § 1054  164.314(a), that the business associate will appropriately safeguard the information. A covered entity is not required to obtain such 1055  satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.  1056  Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor 1057  management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to 1058  organizations. However, to the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as 1059  covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written 1060  satisfactory assurances that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their 1061  business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a business associate agreement (BAA). These 1062  requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate. 1063  Key Activities Description Sample Questions  1.

Perform perimeter network  reconnaissance and scanning.  Adversary uses commercial or free software to scan  organizational perimeters to obtain a better understanding of  the information technology infrastructure and improve the  ability to launch successful attacks.  Perform network sniffing of exposed  networks.  Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data  channels used to transmit information uses network sniffing  to identify components, resources, and protections.  Gather information using open-source  discovery of organizational information.  Adversary mines publicly accessible information to gather  information about organizational information systems,  business processes, users or personnel, or external  relationships that the adversary can subsequently employ in  support of an attack.  Perform reconnaissance and surveillance  of targeted organizations.  Adversary uses various means (e.g., scanning, physical  observation) over time to examine and assess organizations  and ascertain points of vulnerability.  Perform malware-directed internal  reconnaissance.  Adversary uses malware installed inside the organizational  perimeter to identify targets of opportunity. Because the  scanning, probing, or observation does not cross the  perimeter, it is not detected by externally placed intrusion  detection systems.  Craft or create attack tools.  Craft phishing attacks. Adversary counterfeits communications from a legitimate or  trustworthy source to acquire sensitive information, such as  usernames, passwords, or SSNs. Typical attacks occur via  email, instant messaging, or comparable means that  commonly direct users to websites that appear to be  legitimate sites while actually stealing the entered  information.  Craft spear phishing attacks. Adversary employs phishing attacks targeted at high value  targets (e.g., senior leaders, executives).  Craft attacks specifically based on  deployed information technology  environment.  Adversary develops attacks (e.g., crafts targeted malware)  that take advantage of knowledge of the organizational  information technology environment.  Create counterfeit or spoof website. Adversary creates duplicates of legitimate websites. When  users visit a counterfeit site, the site can gather information  or download malware.  Craft counterfeit certificates. Adversary counterfeits or compromises a certificate  authority so that malware or connections will appear  legitimate.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  95  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Create and operate false front  organizations to inject malicious  components into the supply chain.  Adversary creates false front organizations with the  appearance of legitimate suppliers in the critical life cycle  path that then inject corrupted or malicious information  system components into the organizational supply chain.  Deliver, insert, or install malicious capabilities.  Deliver known malware to internal  organizational information systems (e.g.,  virus via email).  Adversary uses common delivery mechanisms (e.g., email)  to install or insert known malware (e.g., malware whose  existence is known) into organizational information systems.  Deliver modified malware to internal  organizational information systems.  Adversary uses more sophisticated delivery mechanisms  than email (e.g., web traffic, instant messaging) to deliver  malware and possibly modifications of known malware to  gain access to internal organizational information systems.  Deliver targeted malware for control of  internal systems and the exfiltration of  data.  Adversary installs malware that is specifically designed to  take control of internal organizational information systems,  identify sensitive information, exfiltrate the information back  to the adversary, and conceal these actions.  Deliver malware by providing  removable media.  Adversary places removable media (e.g., flash drives)  containing malware in locations external to organizational  physical perimeters but where employees are likely to find  the media (e.g., facilities parking lots, exhibits at conferences  attended by employees) and use it on organizational  information systems.  Insert untargeted malware into  downloadable software and/or into  commercial information technology  products.  Adversary corrupts or inserts malware into common  freeware, shareware, or commercial information technology  products. Adversary is not targeting specific organizations  but simply looking for entry points into internal  organizational information systems. Note that this is  particularly a concern for mobile applications.  Insert targeted malware into  organizational information systems and  information system components.  Adversary inserts malware into organizational information  systems and information system components (e.g.,  commercial information technology products), specifically  targeting the hardware, software, and firmware used by  organizations (based on knowledge gained via  reconnaissance).

Insert counterfeit or tampered hardware  into the supply chain.  Adversary intercepts hardware from legitimate suppliers.  Adversary modifies the hardware or replaces it with faulty or  otherwise modified hardware.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  96  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Insert tampered critical components into  organizational systems.  Adversary replaces critical information system components  with modified or corrupted components through the supply  chain, a subverted insider, or some combination thereof.  Install general-purpose sniffers on  organization-controlled information  systems or networks.  Adversary installs sniffing software onto internal  organizational information systems or networks.  Install persistent and targeted sniffers on  organizational information systems and  networks.  Adversary places software designed to collect (i.e., sniff)  network traffic over a continuous period of time within  internal organizational information systems or networks.  Insert malicious scanning devices (e.g.,  wireless sniffers) inside facilities.  Adversary uses the postal service or other commercial  delivery services to deliver a device to organizational  mailrooms that is able to scan wireless communications  accessible from within the mailrooms and then wirelessly  transmit information back to adversary.  Insert subverted individuals into  organizations.  Adversary places individuals within organizations who are  willing and able to carry out actions to cause harm to  organizational mission or business functions.  Insert subverted individuals into  privileged positions in organizations.  Adversary places individuals in privileged positions within  organizations who are willing and able to carry out actions to  cause harm to organizational mission or business functions.  Adversary may target privileged functions to gain access to  sensitive information (e.g., user accounts, system files, etc.)  and may leverage access to one privileged capability to get  to another capability.  Exploit and compromise.  Exploit physical access of authorized  staff to gain access to organizational  facilities.  Adversary follows (“tailgates”) authorized individuals into  secure or controlled locations to circumvent physical  security checks with the goal of gaining access to facilities.  Exploit poorly configured or  unauthorized information systems  exposed to the internet.  Adversary gains access through the internet to information  systems that are not authorized for internet connectivity or  that do not meet organizational configuration requirements.  Exploit split tunneling. Adversary takes advantage of external organizational or  personal information systems (e.g., laptop computers at  remote locations) that are simultaneously connected securely  to organizational information systems or networks and to  non-secure remote connections.  Exploit multi-tenancy in a cloud  environment.  Adversary, with processes running in an organizationally  used cloud environment, takes advantage of multi-tenancy to  observe the behavior of organizational processes, acquire  organizational information, or interfere with the timely or  correct functioning of organizational processes.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  97  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Exploit known vulnerabilities in mobile  systems (e.g., laptops, smart phones).  Adversary takes advantage of fact that transportable  information systems are outside of the physical protection of  organizations and logical protection of corporate firewalls  and compromises the systems based on known  vulnerabilities to gather information from those systems.  Exploit recently discovered  vulnerabilities.  Adversary exploits recently discovered vulnerabilities in  organizational information systems in an attempt to  compromise the systems before mitigation measures are  available or in place.  Exploit vulnerabilities on internal  organizational information systems.  Adversary searches for known vulnerabilities in  organizational internal information systems and exploits  those vulnerabilities.  Exploit vulnerabilities using zero-day  attacks.  Adversary employs attacks that exploit as yet unpublicized  vulnerabilities. Zero-day attacks are based on adversary  insight into the information systems and the applications  used by organizations as well as adversary reconnaissance of  organizations.  Exploit vulnerabilities in information  systems timed with organizational  mission or business operations tempo.  Adversary launches attacks on organizations in a time and  manner consistent with organizational needs to conduct  mission or business operations.  Exploit insecure or incomplete data  deletion in a multi-tenant environment.  Adversary obtains unauthorized information due to insecure  or incomplete data deletion in a multi-tenant environment  (e.g., in a cloud computing environment).  Violate isolation in a multi-tenant  environment.  Adversary circumvents or defeats isolation mechanisms in a  multi-tenant environment (e.g., in a cloud computing  environment) to observe, corrupt, or deny service to hosted  services and information or data.  Compromise critical information  systems via physical access.  Adversary obtains physical access to organizational  information systems and makes modifications.  Compromise information systems or  devices used externally and reintroduced  into the enterprise.  Adversary installs malware on information systems or  devices while the systems/devices are external to  organizations in order to subsequently infect organizations  when reconnected.  Compromise the software of  organizational critical information  systems.  Adversary inserts malware or otherwise corrupts critical  internal organizational information systems.  Compromise organizational information  systems to facilitate exfiltration of data  or information.  Adversary implants malware into internal organizational  information systems where the malware can identify and  exfiltrate valuable information over time.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  98  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Compromise mission-critical  information.  Adversary compromises the integrity of mission-critical  information, thus preventing or impeding the ability of  organizations to which information is supplied from carrying  out operations.  Compromise the design, manufacturing,  and/or distribution of information  system components (including hardware,  software, and firmware).  Adversary compromises the design, manufacturing, and/or  distribution of critical information system components at  selected suppliers.  Conduct an attack (i.e., direct or coordinate attack tools or activities).  Conduct communications interception  attacks.  Adversary takes advantage of communications that are either  unencrypted or use weak encryption (e.g., encryption  containing publicly known flaws), targets those  communications, and gains access to the transmitted  information and channels.  Conduct wireless jamming attacks. Adversary takes measures to interfere with wireless  communications so as to impede or prevent communications  from reaching the intended recipients.  Conduct attacks using unauthorized  ports, protocols, and services.  Adversary conducts attacks using ports, protocols, and  services for ingress and egress that are not authorized for use  by organizations.  Conduct attacks leveraging traffic or  data movement allowed across the  perimeter.  Adversary makes use of permitted information flows (e.g.,  email communication, removable storage) to compromise  internal information systems, which allows the adversary to  obtain and exfiltrate sensitive information through  perimeters.  Conduct simple denial-of-service (DoS)  attacks.  Adversary attempts to make an internet-accessible resource  unavailable to intended users or prevent the resource from  functioning efficiently or at all, whether temporarily or  indefinitely.  Conduct distributed denial-of-service  (DDoS) attacks.  Adversary uses multiple compromised information systems  to attack a single target, thereby causing a denial of service  for users of the targeted information systems.  Conduct targeted denial-of-service  (DoS) attacks.  Adversary conducts DoS attacks to target critical  information systems, components, or supporting  infrastructures based on adversary knowledge of  dependencies.  Conduct physical attacks on  organizational facilities.  Adversary conducts a physical attack on organizational  facilities (e.g., sets a fire).  Conduct physical attacks on  infrastructures that support  organizational facilities.  Adversary conducts a physical attack on one or more  infrastructures that support organizational facilities (e.g.,  breaks a water main, cuts a power line).  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  99  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Conduct cyber-physical attacks on  organizational facilities.

Conduct non-targeted zero-day attacks. Adversary employs attacks that exploit as yet unpublicized  vulnerabilities. Attacks are not based on any adversary  insights into specific vulnerabilities of organizations.  Conduct externally-based session  hijacking.  Adversary takes control of (i.e., hijacks) already established,  legitimate information system sessions between  organizations and external entities (e.g., users connecting  from off-site locations).  Conduct internally-based session  hijacking.  Adversary places an entity within organizations in order to  gain access to organizational information systems or  networks for the express purpose of taking control (i.e.,  hijacking) an already established, legitimate session either  between organizations and external entities (e.g., users  connecting from remote locations) or between two locations  within internal networks.  Conduct externally-based network traffic  modification (machine-in-the-middle)  attacks.  Adversary, operating outside of organizational systems,  intercepts or eavesdrops on sessions between organizational  and external systems. Adversary then relays messages  between organizational and external systems, making them  believe that they are talking directly to each other over a  private connection when, in fact, the entire communication is  controlled by the adversary. Such attacks are of particular  concern for the organizational use of community, hybrid, and  public clouds.  Conduct internally-based network traffic  modification (man-in-the-middle)  attacks.  Adversary intercepts and corrupts data sessions while  operating within the organizational infrastructure.  Conduct outsider-based social  engineering to obtain information.  Externally placed adversary takes actions (e.g., using email,  phone) with the intent of persuading or otherwise tricking  individuals within organizations into revealing critical or  sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable  information).  Conduct insider-based social  engineering to obtain information.  Internally placed adversary takes actions (e.g., using email,  phone) so that individuals within organizations reveal critical  or sensitive information (e.g., mission information).

Conduct supply chain attacks that target  and exploit critical hardware, software,  or firmware.  Adversary targets and compromises the operation of  software (e.g., through malware injections), firmware, and  hardware that performs critical functions for organizations.  This is largely accomplished as supply chain attacks on both  commercial off-the-shelf and custom information systems  and components.  Achieve results (i.e., cause adverse impacts, obtain information).  Obtain sensitive information by network  sniffing external networks.  Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data  channels that organizations (or organizational personnel) use  to transmit information (e.g., kiosks, public wireless  networks) intercepts communications.  Obtain sensitive information via  exfiltration.  Adversary directs malware on organizational systems to  locate and surreptitiously transmit sensitive information.  Cause the degradation or denial of  attacker-selected services or capabilities.  Adversary directs malware on organizational systems to  impair the correct and timely support of organizational  mission and business functions.  Cause the deterioration or destruction of  critical information system components  and functions.  Adversary destroys or causes the deterioration of critical  information system components to impede or eliminate the  organizational ability to carry out mission or business  functions. Detection of this action is not a concern.  Cause integrity loss by creating,  deleting, and/or modifying data on  publicly accessible information systems  (e.g., web defacement).  Adversary vandalizes or otherwise makes unauthorized  changes to organizational websites or data on websites.  Cause integrity loss by polluting or  corrupting critical data.  Adversary implants corrupted and incorrect data in critical  data, resulting in suboptimal actions or the loss of confidence  in organizational data and services.  Cause integrity loss by injecting false  but believable data into organizational  information systems.  Adversary injects false but believable data into  organizational information systems, resulting in suboptimal  actions or the loss of confidence in organizational data and  services.  Cause the disclosure of critical and/or  sensitive information by authorized  users.  Adversary induces (e.g., via social engineering) authorized  users to inadvertently expose, disclose, or mishandle critical  or sensitive information.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  101  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Cause unauthorized disclosure and/or  unavailability by spilling sensitive  information.  Adversary contaminates organizational information systems  (including devices and networks) by causing them to handle  information of a classification or sensitivity for which they  have not been authorized. The information is exposed to  individuals who are not authorized access to such  information, and the information system, device, or network  is unavailable while the spill is investigated and mitigated.  Obtain information by the externally  located interception of wireless network  traffic.  Adversary intercepts organizational communications over  wireless networks (e.g., targets public wireless access or  hotel networking connections, drive-by subversion of home  or organizational wireless routers).  Obtain unauthorized access. Adversary with authorized access to organizational  information systems gains access to resources that exceed  authorization.  Obtain sensitive data or information  from publicly accessible information  systems.  Adversary scans or mines information on publicly accessible  servers and web pages of organizations with the intent of  finding sensitive information.  Obtain information by opportunistically  stealing or scavenging information  systems or components.  Adversary steals information systems or components (e. g.,  laptop computers or data storage media) that are left  unattended outside of the physical perimeters of  organizations or scavenges discarded components.  Maintain a presence or set of capabilities.  Obfuscate adversary actions. Adversary takes actions to inhibit the effectiveness of the  intrusion detection systems or auditing capabilities within  organizations.  Adapt cyber attacks based on detailed  surveillance.  Adversary adapts their behavior in response to surveillance  and organizational security measures.  Coordinate a campaign.  Coordinate a campaign of multi-staged  attacks (e.g., hopping).  Adversary moves the source of malicious commands or  actions from one compromised information system to  another, making analysis difficult.  Coordinate a campaign that combines  internal and external attacks across  multiple information systems and  information technologies.  Adversary combines attacks that require both a physical  presence within organizational facilities and cyber methods  to achieve success. The physical attack steps may be as  simple as convincing maintenance personnel to leave doors  or cabinets open.  Coordinate campaigns across multiple  organizations to acquire specific  information or achieve a desired  outcome.  Adversary does not limit planning to the targeting of one  organization. Adversary observes multiple organizations to  acquire necessary information on targets of interest.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  102  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Coordinate a campaign that spreads  attacks across organizational systems  from an existing presence.  Adversary uses an existing presence within organizational  systems to extend the adversary’s span of control to other  organizational systems, including organizational  infrastructure. Adversary is, thus, in a position to further  undermine the organization’s ability to carry out mission and  business functions.  Coordinate a campaign of continuous,  adaptive, and changing cyber attacks  based on detailed surveillance.  Adversary attacks continually change in response to  surveillance and organizational security measures.  Coordinate cyber attacks using external  (outsider), internal (insider), and supply  chain (supplier) attack vectors.  Adversary employs continuous, coordinated attacks,  potentially using all three attack vectors for the purpose of  impeding organizational operations.  1431  Table 10 - Representative Examples – Non-Adversarial Threat Events 1432  Threat Event Description  Spill sensitive  information  An authorized user erroneously contaminates a device, information system, or  network by placing on it or sending to it information of a classification or sensitivity  that it has not been authorized to handle. The information is exposed to access by  unauthorized individuals, and as a result, the device, system, or network is  unavailable while the spill is investigated and mitigated.  Mishandling of  critical and/or  sensitive  information by  authorized users  An authorized privileged user inadvertently exposes critical or sensitive information.  Incorrect  privilege  settings  An authorized privileged user or administrator erroneously assigns a user excessive  privileges or sets privilege requirements on a resource too low.  Communications  contention  Communications performance is degraded due to contention.  Unreadable  display  The display is unreadable due to aging equipment.  Earthquake at  primary facility  An earthquake of an organization-defined magnitude at the primary facility makes  that facility inoperable.  Fire at primary  facility  A fire (not due to adversarial activity) at the primary facility makes that facility  inoperable.  Fire at backup  facility  A fire (not due to adversarial activity) at a backup facility makes that facility  inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or logs.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  103  Threat Event Description  Flood at primary  facility  A flood (not due to adversarial activity) at the primary facility makes that facility  inoperable.  Flood at backup  facility  A flood (not due to adversarial activity) at a backup facility makes that facility  inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or logs.  Hurricane at  primary facility  A hurricane of organization-defined strength at the primary facility makes that  facility inoperable.  Hurricane at  backup facility  A hurricane of organization-defined strength at a backup facility makes that facility  inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or logs.  Resource  depletion  Processing performance is degraded due to resource depletion.  Introduction of  vulnerabilities  into software  products  Due to inherent weaknesses in programming languages and software development  environments, errors and vulnerabilities are introduced into commonly used software  products.  Disk error Storage is corrupted due to a disk error.  Pervasive disk  error  The aging of a set of devices that were all acquired at the same time and from the  same supplier leads to multiple disk errors.  Windstorm or  tornado at  primary facility  A windstorm or tornado of organization-defined strength at the primary facility  makes that facility inoperable.  Windstorm or  tornado at  backup facility  A windstorm or tornado of organization-defined strength at a backup facility makes  that facility inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or  logs.  1433  1434  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  104  National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program 1435  In a general sense, an informative reference, sometimes called a mapping, indicates how one 1436  document relates to another document. In the [NIST CSF], for example, six informative 1437  references were included (as shown in Figure 1) although many other informative references 1438  could have been useful to stakeholders. While the concept of informative references was well 1439  received, the static nature of the Cybersecurity Framework and other NIST documents that 1440  include informative references meant that some of its informative references became outdated as 1441  the documents they referenced were updated. 1442  1443  1444  Within the context of the National Online Informative References [NIST OLIR] Program, an 1445  informative reference indicates the relationship(s) between the elements of two documents. The 1446  source document, called the Focal Document, is used as the basis for the document comparison. 1447  The second document is called the Reference Document. Note that a Focal Document or a 1448  Reference Document is not necessarily in a traditional document format (e.g., a formal 1449  publication in PDF format) but could be a product, service, or training. A Focal Document 1450  Element or a Reference Document Element is a discrete section, sentence, phrase, or other 1451  identifiable piece of content of a document. 1452  The OLIR Program is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter experts (SMEs) in defining 1453  standardized relationships between elements of their cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce 1454  documents (Reference Documents) and elements of other cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce 1455  documents (Focal Documents), like the Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 and NIST [SP 1456  800-53], Rev. 5. By removing the informative references from within the NIST documents, the 1457  OLIR program scales to accommodate a greater number of informative references while 1458  providing a more agile model for updating the relationships between elements of the Reference 1459  and Focal Documents.  1460  Figure 1 - Informative References Included in Cybersecurity Framework  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  105  The National OLIR Program provides an online catalog for displaying, sharing, and comparing 1461  informative references. The National OLIR Program offers several benefits, including: 1462  • Provides a single, easy-to-use repository where people can obtain information on many 1463  Reference Documents and analyze their relationships 1464  • Increases the transparency, alignment, and harmonization of definitions and concepts 1465  across Reference Documents 1466  • Standardizes how References are expressed – making them more consistent, clear, usable, 1467  repeatable, and organizable – and provides a way for automation technologies to ingest 1468  and utilize them 1469  • Provides the ability to authenticate the source of each Reference and allows users to 1470  identify whether the Reference was provided by a verified SME 1471  • Employs mathematical rigor (e.g., standard set theory principles, such as subset, superset, 1472  equal, intersect, and discrete logic) to express References rather than merely relying on 1473  prose, which can be ambiguous and subjective 1474  • Allows for the cybersecurity and privacy community to keep information current on 1475  relationship assertions between Reference Documents and Focal Documents 1476  Before the National OLIR Program, a person analyzing documents was often forced to conduct a 1477  manual comparison, typically by copying the contents of both documents into a spreadsheet for 1478  easier searching and sorting. To save time, an analyst might try to leverage existing document 1479  mappings from SMEs. This laborious and error-prone process would be repeated for all of the 1480  elements within the Focal Document and the Reference Document. Multiply this process by 1481  numerous analysts performing the task, and two problems quickly emerge: 1) the different 1482  opinions of analysts result in inconsistent associations, and 2) the analysts duplicate an enormous 1483  amount of effort. Streamlining this process is the main reason the OLIR Derived Relationship 1484  Mappings (DRM) capability was created. 1485  DRMs are the result of using the relationships between Reference Documents and a Focal 1486  Document to make inferences about relationships between the Reference Documents. For 1487  example, the OLIR catalog contains an informative reference that maps elements of the 1488  Cybersecurity Framework to elements in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. Another informative 1489  reference maps elements of the Cybersecurity Framework to elements in two versions of the 1490  HITRUST CSF [HITRUST]. A DRM can be created that depicts the relationships between the 1491  two Reference Documents: NIST SP 800-53, Rev.5 and the HITRUST CSF. These DRMs can be 1492  dynamically generated on the OLIR website. 1493  With much of the relationship data already defined by the SME, a user can simply generate a full 1494  report between two Reference Documents and export it to a comma-separated values format. The 1495  user can sort the reference data by Functions, Categories, Subcategories, Control Families, 1496  Security/Privacy Controls, or Security Control Enhancements (depending on the Focal 1497  Document selected). The user can then better understand the similarities and differences between 1498  the elements and determine which relationships are relevant for their purposes.  1499  In the context of HIPAA compliance, Table 12 in Appendix E lists mappings between elements 1500  of the Security Rule (i.e., standards and implementation specifications); elements of SP 800-53, 1501  Rev. 5 (i.e., security and privacy controls); and elements of the Cybersecurity Framework (i.e., 1502  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  106  Subcategory outcomes). Using the included mappings, OLIR catalog, and DRM tool, users can 1503  determine relationships to elements in a wide variety of other Reference Documents (e.g., 1504  controls catalogs, standards, practices) that may help them comply with the Security Rule and 1505  improve their organizational cybersecurity posture.  1506  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  107  Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications 1507  Crosswalk 1508  This appendix provides a listing of the HIPAA Security Rule [Sec.

Rule], as amended by 196  the Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules 197  Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act [HITECH] and 198  the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to the HIPAA Rules 199  [Omnibus Rule]1 and assist regulated entities2 in their implementation of the Security Rule. It 200  includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for regulated entities 201  on assessing and managing risks to electronic protected health information (ePHI), identifies 202  typical activities that a regulated entity might consider implementing as part of an information 203  security program, and lists additional resources that regulated entities may find useful in 204  implementing the Security Rule. 205  The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and 206  availability of ePHI, as defined in the Security Rule. All HIPAA regulated entities must comply 207  with the requirements of the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated entity creates, receives, 208  maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and 209  impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, standards, and 210  implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following regulated entities:  211  • Covered Healthcare Providers – Any provider of medical or other health services or 212  supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a 213  transaction for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has 214  adopted a standard. 215  • Health Plans – Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical 216  care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs). 217  • Healthcare Clearinghouses – A public or private entity that processes another entity’s 218  healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa. 219  • Business Associate – A person or entity3 that performs certain functions or activities that 220  involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides 221  services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for their own HIPAA 222  violations.  223  The Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards that a 224  regulated entity must address. Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An 225  implementation specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach that 226  regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard. Implementation specifications are either 227  required or addressable. Regulated entities must comply with required implementation 228  specifications. Regulated entities must perform an assessment to determine whether each 229  1 For the remainder of this document, references to and discussions about the Security Rule will be to the Security Rule as  amended by the Omnibus Rule unless otherwise specified.  2 A “regulated entity” refers to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the Security Rule. Business associates  also includes business associates’ subcontractors who have access to ePHI.  3 A member of the covered entity’s workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or  healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  vii  addressable implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard for 230  implementation in the regulated entity’s environment. 231  The assessment, analysis, and management of risk to ePHI provides the foundation for a 232  regulated entity’s Security Rule compliance efforts and the protection of ePHI. Readers are 233  reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) 234  does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or risk management methodology. Section 3 235  and Section 4 provide background information about risk assessment and risk management 236  processes, as well as approaches that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing and 237  managing risk to ePHI. 238  Many regulated entities may benefit from more specific guidance concerning how to comply 239  with the standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule. To that end, Section 5 240  highlights considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule. Key 241  activities, descriptions, and sample questions are provided for each standard. The key activities 242  suggest actions that are often associated with the security function or functions suggested by that 243  standard. Many of these key activities are often included in a robust security program and may 244  be useful to regulated entities. The descriptions provide expanded explanations about each of the 245  key activities, as well as the types of activities that a regulated entity may pursue in 246  implementing the standard. The sample questions are a non-exhaustive list of questions that a 247  regulated entity may ask itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately 248  implemented. 249  Regulated entities may implement the Security Rule more effectively if they are shown controls 250  catalogs and cybersecurity activities that align with each standard. To assist regulated entities, 251  this publication includes mappings of the Security Rule’s standards and implementation 252  specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and to applicable security 253  controls detailed in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-53, Rev. 5, Security and Privacy Controls 254  for Information Systems and Organizations [SP 800-53]. The mapping also lists additional NIST 255  publications relevant to each Security Rule standard. Readers may draw upon these NIST 256  publications and mappings for assistance in implementing the Security Rule. 257  Additionally, the publication lists a wide variety of resources (e.g., guidance, templates, tools) 258  that regulated entities may find useful in complying with the Security Rule and improving the 259  security posture of their organizations. For ease of use, the resources are organized by topic. 260  Regulated entities could consult these resources when they need additional information or 261  guidance about a particular topic. The resource topics include: 262  • Risk Assessment and Risk Management 263  • Documentation Templates 264  • Small Regulated Entities 265  • Telehealth/Telemedicine Guidance 266  • Mobile Device Security 267  • Cloud Services 268  • Ransomware and Phishing 269  • Education, Training, and Awareness 270  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A

Rule] 362  specifically focuses on safeguarding electronic protected health information (ePHI). All HIPAA-363  covered entities and business associates must comply with the requirements of the Security Rule. 364  Throughout this publication, covered entities and business associates will be referred to as 365  “regulated entities.” Whenever the term regulated entity or regulated entities appears, it is to 366  be understood as applying to both covered entities and business associates as defined in the 367  Security Rule.  368  1.1 Purpose and Scope 369  NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-66 aims to help educate readers about the security standards 370  included in the HIPAA Security Rule and assist regulated entities in their implementation of the 371  Security Rule. It includes a brief overview of the HIPAA Security Rule, provides guidance for 372  regulated entities in assessing and managing risk to ePHI, identifies typical activities that a 373  regulated entity should consider when implementing an information security program, and lists 374  additional resources that regulated entities might find useful in implementing the Security Rule. 375  This publication is intended to be an aid to understanding the HIPAA Security Rule and does not 376  supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the Security Rule itself. Anyone seeking clarifications 377  of the HIPAA Security Rule should contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 378  (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the 379  HHS Security Rule website.4  380  The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66, Rev. 2, were used in 381  preparing this document. NIST frequently publishes new standards and guidelines or updates 382  existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To remain current with the latest 383  available list of NIST security publications, the reader should periodically visit the NIST 384  Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC5). 385  1.2 Applicability 386  The guidance provided in this publication is applicable to all covered entities and their business 387  associates of all sizes throughout the world that store, process, or transmit ePHI. While the 388  Security Rule requires regulated entities to protect ePHI, covered entities are required by the 389  Privacy Rule6 to protect all forms of protected health information (PHI). The HIPAA Privacy 390  Rule at 164.530(c)(1) states, “A covered entity must have in place appropriate administrative, 391  technical, and physical safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information.” 392  Essentially, this covers all PHI – oral, written, and electronic (to the extent not covered by the 393  Security Rule). This part of the Privacy Rule applies to covered entities, not business associates. 394  However, the business associate agreement (BAA) in place between a covered entity and 395  business associate would cover protections for all PHI. Additionally, business associates are 396  4 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html.  5 See http://csrc.nist.gov.  6 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html.  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html http://csrc.nist.gov/ https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/index.html  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  2  directly liable for impermissible uses and disclosures of PHI (i.e., a breach). A summary of a 397  business associate’s direct HIPAA liability7 is available. Federal, state, local, and tribal 398  governments and private-sector organizations that compose the critical health infrastructure of 399  the United States are encouraged to consider using the guidance in this publication, as 400  appropriate. 401  NIST publications may be useful to any entity seeking to understand the security issues raised by 402  the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of that entity’s size, structure, or distribution of security 403  responsibilities. However, specific organizational missions, resources, and structures vary 404  greatly, and entities’ approaches to implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge 405  significantly. NIST SP 800-66 aims to assist all entities seeking further information on the 406  security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule, regardless of the particular structures, 407  methodologies, and approaches used to address its requirements.  408  The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of industry-409  developed guidelines and/or models. Organizations that choose to use this publication must 410  determine the value of its content for implementing the Security Rule standards in their 411  environments. The use of this publication or any other NIST publication does not ensure or 412  guarantee that an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule. This document 413  addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other provisions adopted or 414  raised by the HIPAA Rules, such as 45 CFR § 164.105. This document also does not directly 415  address provisions in the HIPAA Privacy, Breach Notification, or Enforcement Rules.  416  1.3 Document Organization 417  The remaining sections and appendices of this publication include the following: 418  • Section 2 – HIPAA Security Rule explains the key concepts included in the HIPAA 419  Security Rule.  420  • Section 3 – Risk Assessment Guidelines provides a methodology for conducting a risk 421  assessment, the results of which will enable regulated entities to identify appropriate 422  security controls for reducing risk to ePHI.  423  • Section 4 – Risk Management Guidelines introduces a structured, flexible, extensible, 424  and repeatable process that regulated entities may utilize for managing identified risks 425  and achieving risk-based protection of ePHI. 426  • Section 5 – Considerations When Applying the HIPAA Security Rule highlights key 427  activities that a regulated entity may wish to consider implementing, as well as questions 428  that a regulated entity might ask itself when implementing the Security Rule.  429  • References provides references and related source material. 430  • Appendix A – Acronyms identifies and defines the acronyms used within this document.  431  • Appendix B – Glossary defines the terms used in this document. 432  • Appendix C – Risk Assessment Tables includes many tables referenced in Section 3, 433  Risk Assessment Guidelines. 434  7 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/factsheet/index.html.  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/guidance/business-associates/factsheet/index.html  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  3  • Appendix D – National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program introduces 435  the OLIR program and how it can assist regulated entities in implementing the Security 436  Rule. 437  • Appendix E – Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications 438  Crosswalk provides a catalog of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and implementation 439  specifications and maps each to relevant Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] 440  Subcategories and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to 441  other relevant NIST publications that regulated entities may find useful in implementing 442  the Security Rule. 443  • Appendix F – HIPAA Security Rule Resources provides an annotated, topical listing of 444  additional resources that regulated entities may find useful when implementing the 445  standards and implementation specifications of the Security Rule.  446  1.4 How to Use this Document 447  Readers are encouraged to use this document as a resource for concepts and tools to assist 448  regulated entities in complying with the HIPAA Security Rule. Risk assessment and risk 449  management processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s compliance with the Security Rule 450  and the protection of ePHI. For that reason, regulated entities may benefit from an initial focus 451  on Section 3 and Section 4 to build fundamental risk management processes. Section 5 may be 452  useful to regulated entities seeking activities to implement for each of the Security Rule 453  standards or for regulated entities that want sample questions to self-evaluate their protection of 454  ePHI. Regulated entities may also find value in the appendices that provide an annotated listing 455  of relevant resources, discussions of relevant topics, and a crosswalk to controls and practices 456  that may help in implementing the Security Rule. 457  This resource guide can support the compliance efforts of regulated entities in many ways, 458  including:  459  • Ensuring that each organization is selecting security practices and controls that 460  adequately protect ePHI of which they are the steward,  461  • Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the size and 462  structure of the entity,8 463  • Providing guidance on best practices for developing and implementing a risk 464  management program, and 465  • Creating appropriate documentation that demonstrates effective compliance with the 466  HIPAA Security Rule. 467  468  8 Small regulated entities may benefit from the resources listed in Appendix F, especially the Health Industry Cybersecurity  Practices (HICP) Technical Volume 1: Cybersecurity Practices for Small Health Care Organizations. Medium and large  regulated entities may find the HICP Technical Volume 2: Cybersecurity Practices for Medium and Large Health Care  Organizations (also in Appendix F) useful.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  4  2 HIPAA Security Rule 469  The HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality, 470  integrity, and availability of ePHI as defined in the Security Rule. The ePHI that a regulated 471  entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against reasonably anticipated 472  threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures. In general, the requirements, 473  standards, and implementation specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following 474  regulated entities:  475  • Covered Healthcare Providers – Any provider of medical or other health services or 476  supplies who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with a 477  transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard. 478  • Health Plans – Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of medical 479  care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs). 480  • Healthcare Clearinghouses – A public or private entity that processes another entity’s 481  healthcare transactions from a standard format to a non-standard format or vice versa. 482  • Business Associate – A person or entity9 that performs certain functions or activities that 483  involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of or provides 484  services to a covered entity. A business associate is liable for its own HIPAA Security 485  Rule violations. 486  2.1 Security Rule Goals and Objectives 487  As required by the “Security standards: General rules” section of the HIPAA Security Rule, each 488  regulated entity must: 489  • Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI that it creates, receives, 490  maintains, or transmits; 491  • Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or integrity 492  of ePHI;  493  • Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are not 494  permitted by the Privacy Rule; and 495  • Ensure compliance with the Security Rule by its workforce. 496  Regulated entities are reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. Cybersecurity 497  practices will vary across organizations, depending on levels of technical understanding, 498  financial and human resources, and risk tolerance. This flexibility allows regulated entities to 499  customize how they implement HIPAA’s Security Rule requirements. In complying with this 500  section of the Security Rule, regulated entities must be aware of the definitions provided for 501  confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304: 502  • Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or 503  disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.” 504  9 A member of the covered entity’s workforce is not a business associate. A covered healthcare provider, health plan, or  healthcare clearinghouse can be a business associate of another covered entity.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  5  • Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed in 505  an unauthorized manner.” 506  • Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon 507  demand by an authorized person.” 508  2.2 Security Rule Organization 509  To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar with the 510  basic security terminology it uses to describe the security standards. By understanding the 511  requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it becomes easier to see which 512  resources might assist in Security Rule implementation and where to find more information. The 513  Security Rule is separated into six main sections that each include several standards and 514  implementation specifications that a regulated entity must address.10 The six sections are listed 515  below.  516  1. Security Standards: General Rules – Includes the general requirements that all 517  regulated entities must meet, establishes flexibility of approach, identifies standards and 518  implementation specifications (both required and addressable), outlines decisions that a 519  regulated entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications, and 520  requires the maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate 521  protection of electronic protected health information. 522  2. Administrative Safeguards – Defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative actions 523  and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development, implementation, and 524  maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected health information and 525  to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in relation to the protection of 526  that information.” 527  3. Physical Safeguards – Defined as the “physical measures, policies, and procedures to 528  protect a covered entity’s electronic information systems and related buildings and 529  equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized intrusion.” 530  4. Technical Safeguards – Defined as the “the technology and the policy and procedures 531  for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control access to it.” 532  5. Organizational Requirements – Includes standards for business associate contracts and 533  other arrangements between a covered entity and a business associate and between a 534  business associate and a subcontractor, as well as requirements for group health plans. 535  6. Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements – Requires the 536  implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with the 537  standards, implementation specifications, and other requirements of the Security Rule; 538  the maintenance of written (may be electronic) documentation and/or records that include 539  the policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required by the Security Rule; 540  and retention, availability, and update requirements related to the documentation. 541  10 Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and, therefore, addressed in this document but do not  have their own modules are Part 160 – General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164 – Security and  Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements (discussed in Section 4 of this  document); 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards: General rules (discussed in Section 3.1 of  this document); and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation of the security standards.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  6  Within the Security Rule’s sections are standards and implementation specifications. Each 542  HIPAA Security Rule standard is required. A regulated entity is required to comply with all of 543  the standards of the Security Rule with respect to all ePHI. Many of the standards contain 544  implementation specifications. See Table 1 for a listing of the Security Rule’s standards and 545  implementation specifications. An implementation specification is a more detailed description of 546  the method or approach that regulated entities can use to meet a particular standard.11 547  Implementation specifications are either required or addressable. However, regardless of whether 548  a standard includes implementation specifications, regulated entities must comply with each 549  standard. 550  • A required implementation specification is similar to a standard in that a regulated entity 551  must comply with it.  552  • To meet the addressable implementation specifications, a regulated entity must (i) assess 553  whether each implementation specification is a reasonable and appropriate safeguard in 554  its environment, when analyzed with reference to the likely contribution to protecting the 555  ePHI; and (ii) as applicable to the regulated entity:  556  o (A) Implement the implementation specification if reasonable and appropriate; or  557  o (B) if implementing the implementation specification is not reasonable and 558  appropriate—(1) document why it would not be reasonable and appropriate to 559  implement the implementation specification; and (2) implement an equivalent 560  alternative measure if reasonable and appropriate.  561  Regulated entities are required to document these assessments and all decisions. For federal 562  agencies, all of the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable implementation specifications will most 563  likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes, missions, 564  and resources. 565  Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a particular 566  standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation” standards, 567  compliance with the standard itself is required. 568  Appendix E of this document provides a mapping of the HIPAA Security Rule standards and 569  implementation specifications to Cybersecurity Framework [NIST CSF] Subcategories and the 570  security controls detailed in [SP 800-53]. It also provides a crosswalk to other relevant NIST 571  publications that regulated entities may find useful in implementing the Security Rule. 572  For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the HHS Security Rule website.12  573  11 For more information on the required analysis used to determine the manner of implementation of an implementation  specification, see § 164.306(d) of the HIPAA Security Rule (Security standards – General rules: Flexibility of approach).  12 See https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html.  https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  7  Table 1 - Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications 574  Standard Sections  Implementation Specifications  (R)=Required, (A)=Addressable  Administrative Safeguards  Security Management Process  164.308(a)(1) Risk Analysis (R)  Risk Management (R)  Sanction Policy (R)  Information System Activity Review (R)  Assigned Security Responsibility 164.308(a)(2) (R)  Workforce Security  164.308(a)(3) Authorization and/or Supervision (A)  Workforce Clearance Procedure (A)  Termination Procedures (A)  Information Access Management  164.308(a)(4) Isolating Health care Clearinghouse  Function (R)  Access Authorization (A)  Access Establishment and Modification  (A)  Security Awareness and  Training  164.308(a)(5) Security Reminders (A)  Protection from Malicious Software (A)  Log-in Monitoring (A)  Password Management (A)  Security Incident Procedures  164.308(a)(6) Response and Reporting (R)  Contingency Plan  164.308(a)(7) Data Backup Plan (R)  Disaster Recovery Plan (R)  Emergency Mode Operation Plan (R)  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  8  Standard Sections  Implementation Specifications  (R)=Required, (A)=Addressable  Testing and Revision Procedure (A)  Applications and Data Criticality Analysis  (A)  Evaluation 164.308(a)(8) (R)  Business Associate Contracts  and Other Arrangements  164.308(b)(1) Written Contract or Other Arrangement  (R)  Physical Safeguards  Facility Access Controls  164.310(a)(1) Contingency Operations (A)  Facility Security Plan (A)  Access Control and Validation Procedures  (A)  Maintenance Records (A)  Workstation Use 164.310(b) (R)  Workstation Security  164.310(c) (R)  Device and Media Controls  164.310(d)(1) Disposal (R)  Media Re-use (R)  Accountability (A)  Data Backup and Storage (A)  Technical Safeguards  Access Control 164.312(a)(1) Unique User Identification (R)  Emergency Access Procedure (R)  Automatic Logoff (A)  Encryption and Decryption (A)  Audit Controls  164.312(b) (R)  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  9  Standard Sections  Implementation Specifications  (R)=Required, (A)=Addressable  Integrity 164.312(c)(1) Mechanism to Authenticate Electronic  Protected Health Information (A)  Person or Entity Authentication 164.312(d) (R)  Transmission Security 164.312(e)(1) Integrity Controls (A)  Encryption (A)  575  576  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  10  3 Risk Assessment Guidance 577  Risk assessment and risk management processes are foundational to a regulated entity’s 578  compliance with the Security Rule [Sec. Rule] and the protection of ePHI. Readers are reminded 579  of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk 580  assessment or risk management methodology. This section provides foundational information 581  about risk assessment and an approach that regulated entities may choose to use in assessing risk 582  to ePHI. Regulated entities are free to use another risk assessment methodology13 that provides a 583  comprehensive assessment of risk to ePHI.  584  This section incorporates the risk assessment concepts and processes described in the NISTIR 585  8286 [IR 8286] series (specifically NISTIR 8286A [IR 8286A], Identifying and Estimating 586  Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management); NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Effective Use of 587  Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk [SP 800-30]; and NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 2, Risk 588  Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle 589  Approach for Security and Privacy [SP 800-37]. It is intended to assist regulated entities in 590  identifying risks to ePHI. 591  The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where ePHI could be used or disclosed 592  without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed. The 593  results of the risk assessment are used to make risk management decisions on the implementation 594  of security measures required by the Security Rule to bring risk to ePHI into an organizationally 595  established risk tolerance range (i.e., reasonable and appropriate level), or if additional security 596  controls are necessary.  597  Key Terms Defined 598  When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be clearly understood. This subsection 599  defines important terms associated with risk assessment and risk management. 600  • Threat events are circumstances or events that can have a negative impact on ePHI.  601  Threat events can be: 602  o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent)  603  o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error) 604  • Threat sources refers to the intent and method targeted at causing harm to ePHI. Threat 605  sources can be: 606  o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados), 607  o Human (e.g., intentional, such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware authors; 608  unintentional, such as data entry error, accidental deletions), or 609  o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazmat contamination, 610  environmental pollution). 611  • Vulnerabilities are flaws or weaknesses in a system, system security procedures, internal 612  controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat event.  613  13 Regulated entities may benefit from the NISTIR 8286 series of publications for more comprehensive risk assessment  methodologies, including how to integrate ePHI risk assessment with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  11  • Likelihood refers to the probability that a given threat event is capable of exploiting a 614  given vulnerability to cause harm. 615  • Impact refers to the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the loss of 616  confidentiality, integrity, and/or the availability of ePHI.  617  • Risk refers to the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or 618  event. Risk is typically a function of the likelihood and impact calculations. 619  It can be easy to confuse some of these terms, including vulnerabilities and threats. An 620  organization may determine that it is vulnerable to damage from power surges. The threat 621  sources that could exploit this vulnerability may include overloaded circuits or too much load on 622  the local grid. Other threat sources (e.g., a data entry error) may not be able to exploit this 623  vulnerability. In this example of power surges, recommended security controls could range from 624  installing uninterruptible power supply (UPS) systems, additional fuse boxes, standby 625  generators, or even rewiring the office. These additional security controls may help to mitigate 626  the vulnerability. 627  3.1 HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements 628  Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to: 629  Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security 630  violations. 631  The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation 632  specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management: 633  1. Risk Analysis (R14) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough 634  assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and 635  availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or 636  business associate. 637  2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to 638  reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with 639  Section 164.306(a). 640  Section 3.2 will provide a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to 641  utilize in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). Section 4 will provide risk management 642  guidance. 643  3.2 How to Conduct the Risk Assessment 644  Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies. There is no single 645  methodology that will work for all regulated entities and all situations. The following steps 646  represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment process and provide an example of 647  the risk assessment methodology described in [IR 8286A] and [SP 800-30]. It is expected that 648  14 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  12  these steps will be customized to most effectively identify risk for a regulated entity. The steps 649  listed are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted. Some steps could be 650  conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.  651  1. Prepare for the Assessment. Before beginning the risk assessment, the regulated entity 652  should understand where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted. 653  Identify where ePHI is generated within the organization, where and how it enters the 654  organization (e.g., web portals), where it moves and flows within the organization (e.g., 655  to specific information systems), where it is stored, and where ePHI leaves the 656  organization. Is ePHI transmitted to external third parties, such as cloud service providers 657  or other service providers?  658  The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a regulated 659  entity’s location and a logical boundary that covers any devices or media that contain 660  ePHI, including electronic networks through which ePHI is transmitted, regardless of its 661  location. Ensure that the risk assessment scope takes teleworkers and any remote work 662  force into consideration, including any external service providers who may have access to 663  ePHI remotely. The scope should include all removable media and portable computing 664  devices (e.g., laptops, mobile devices) as well as the myriad of medical devices (e.g., 665  medical Internet of Things [IoT]) that can store, process, or transmit ePHI. Modern 666  mobile devices may not only contain ePHI but may also pose a greater risk to ePHI due 667  to theft or loss. In many ways, the risk assessment process will consider risks to ePHI as 668  it enters the organization, flows within the organization, and leaves the organization. 669  Additionally, the regulated entity should consider identifying the security controls 670  currently being used to protect ePHI.  671  This preparation step is essential to ensuring that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly 672  identified in the risk assessment process. For example, if the regulated entity does not 673  fully identify all parties or systems to which ePHI is transmitted, it may not be possible to 674  completely identify all relevant threats and vulnerabilities. The level of effort needed to 675  gather the necessary information15 depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and 676  the size of the regulated entity.  677  2. Identify Realistic Threats. In this step, the regulated entity identifies the potential threat 678  events and threat sources that are applicable to the regulated entity and its operating 679  environment. The listing of threat events and threat sources should include realistic and 680  probable human and natural incidents that can negatively impact the regulated entity’s 681  ability to protect ePHI. Use the information gathered from the preparation step (i.e., 682  where ePHI enters the organization, moves through the organization, is stored within the 683  organization, and leaves the organization) to identify realistic threats to ePHI. Be sure to 684  consider threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI via phishing, 685  ransomware, or insider threat.  686  687  15 Regulated entities may benefit from completing a business impact analysis (BIA) to evaluate, record, and monitor the  criticality of organizational assets, including ePHI. The BIA can help inform the determination of organizational risk tolerance  levels, which are valuable for risk management processes. See [IR 8286A] for more information.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  13  Table 2 – Common Threat Sources 688  Type Examples  Natural Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical  storms, and other such events  Human Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings, such as  unintentional acts (e.g., inadvertent data entry) or deliberate actions  (e.g., network-based attacks, malicious software upload,  unauthorized access to confidential information)  Environmental Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak  Regulated entities may make use of various sources16 when identifying relevant threats. 689  Some of the resources listed in Appendix F may help regulated entities identify common 690  threats relevant to small, medium, and large organizations. Internet searches, vendor 691  information, insurance data, and crime statistics are also viable sources of threat data. 692  Ultimately, regulated entities should identify all threats to ePHI. Examples of some 693  common threat sources are listed in Table 2. Regulated entities can also use Tables 8 to 694  10 in Appendix C as resources for identifying relevant threat events and threat sources. 695  3. Identify Potential Vulnerabilities and Predisposing Conditions. For any of the various 696  threats identified above to result in an impactful risk, each needs a vulnerability or 697  predisposing condition that can be exploited. The identification of vulnerabilities or 698  conditions that a threat could use to cause impact is an important component of risk 699  assessment. While it is necessary to review threats and vulnerabilities as unique elements, 700  they are often considered at the same time. Many organizations will consider a given loss 701  scenario and evaluate both. What threat sources might initiate which threat events? What 702  vulnerabilities or predisposing conditions might those threat sources exploit to cause an 703  adverse impact?  704  The regulated entity develops a list of vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be 705  exploited by potential threat sources. This list should focus on realistic technical and non-706  technical areas where ePHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly 707  modified, or made unavailable when needed. Regulated entities should use internal and 708  external sources to identify potential vulnerabilities. Internal sources may include 709  previous risk assessments, vulnerability scan and system security test results (e.g., 710  penetration tests), and audit reports. External sources may include internet searches, 711  vendor information, insurance data, and vulnerability databases, such as the National 712  Vulnerability Database [NIST NVD]. In Appendix F, a suggested (but not all-inclusive) 713  resource list is provided that organizations may wish to use in vulnerability identification. 714  16 Regulated entities may benefit from [IR 8286A], specifically Section 2.2.2, when identifying threats to ePHI.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  14  4. Determine the Likelihood of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability. In this step, the 715  regulated entity determines the likelihood of a threat successfully exploiting a 716  vulnerability. For each threat event/threat source identified in step 2, consider:  717  • The likelihood that the threat will occur 718  • The likelihood that an occurred threat would exploit a vulnerability identified 719  in step 3 to result in an adverse impact 720  A regulated entity might consider assigning a likelihood value (e.g., very low, low, 721  moderate, high, or very high) to each threat/vulnerability pairing, as shown in Table 3. 722  Regulated entities should feel free to use a different likelihood scale based on 723  organizational needs. 724  For example, a regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a tornado occurring 725  is “Low” (located along the leftmost column of Table 3) but that if it did occur, the 726  tornado would have a “Moderate” likelihood (located along the top of Table 3) of 727  exploiting a weakness in the facility’s physical structure and result in adverse impact. 728  Using Table 3, the regulated entity locates the intersection of the two individual 729  likelihood values to assign an overall likelihood of “Low” to this threat/vulnerability 730  pairing. As another example, the regulated entity may determine that the likelihood of a 731  phishing attack occurring is “Very High” and that the likelihood of the event exploiting a 732  human vulnerability is “Moderate,” resulting in an overall likelihood rating of “High.”  733  734  Table 3 – Assessment Scale for Overall Likelihood 735  Likelihood  of Threat  Event  Initiation or  Occurrence  Likelihood that Threat Events Result in Adverse Impacts  Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Very High Low Moderate High Very High Very High  High Low Moderate Moderate High Very High  Moderate Low Low Moderate Moderate High  Low Very Low Low Low Moderate Moderate  Very Low Very Low Very Low Low Low Low  736  The regulated entity could perform this likelihood assessment for each 737  threat/vulnerability pairing. Consider that some threat events, regardless of their 738  likelihood of occurrence, may have no vulnerability to exploit, resulting in a likelihood 739  rating of “Very Low” or even “N/A.” Conversely, some identified vulnerabilities may 740  have no identified threat event that could exploit the vulnerability, also possibly resulting 741  in a likelihood rating of “N/A.”  742  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  15  5. Determine the Impact of a Threat Exploiting a Vulnerability. The regulated entity 743  determines the impact that could occur to ePHI if a threat event exploits a vulnerability.  744  As with likelihood determination, a regulated entity may choose to express this impact in 745  qualitative terms, such as “low,” “moderate,” and “high” or using any other scale that the 746  entity chooses. When selecting an impact rating, the regulated entity may consider how 747  the threat event can affect the loss or degradation of the confidentiality, integrity, and/or 748  availability of ePHI. Table 4 provides a brief description of each security objective (i.e., 749  confidentiality, integrity, and availability) and the impact of it not being met. The 750  regulated entity should select an impact rating for each identified threat/vulnerability pair.  751  Impact information can sometimes be obtained from existing organizational 752  documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality assessments. A business 753  impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels associated with the compromise of an 754  organization’s information assets based on a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the 755  sensitivity and criticality of those assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and 756  prioritizes the organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems, 757  services, and related technology assets) that support the organization’s critical missions. 758  Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue, the cost 759  of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems caused by a 760  successful threat action. Other impacts – such as the loss of public confidence, the loss of 761  credibility, or damage to an organization’s interest – cannot be measured in specific units 762  but can be qualified or described in terms of “high,” “moderate,” and “low” impacts, for 763  example. Qualitative and quantitative methods can both be used to determine the impact 764  of a threat event exploiting a vulnerability to cause an adverse impact. Regulated entities 765  may consult Table 5 to assist in identifying potential adverse impact and to subsequently 766  assign an impact rating to each threat/vulnerability pair. 767  Table 4.  Security Objectives and Impacts 768  Security Objective Impacts  Loss of Confidentiality System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of  information from unauthorized disclosure (i.e., the data or  information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized  persons or processes). The impact of an unauthorized disclosure of  confidential information can range from the jeopardizing of  national security to the disclosure of Privacy Act data.  Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional disclosure could  result in the loss of public confidence, embarrassment, or legal  action against the organization.  Loss of Integrity System and data integrity refers to the requirement that information  be protected from improper modification (i.e., data or information  have not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner).  Integrity is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or  system by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  16  Security Objective Impacts  or data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the contaminated  system or corrupted data could result in inaccuracy, fraud, or  erroneous decisions. Also, the violation of integrity may be the first  step in a successful attack against system availability or  confidentiality. For all of these reasons, the loss of integrity reduces  the assurance of a system.  Loss of Availability Availability refers to the requirement that data or information is  accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized person or  process. If a mission-critical system is unavailable to its end users,  the organization’s mission may be affected. Loss of system  functionality and operational effectiveness, for example, may result  in the loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users’  performance of their functions in supporting the organization’s  mission.  769  Table 5 - Examples of Adverse Impacts 770  Type of Impact Impact  Harm to Operations • Inability to perform current mission or business functions  - In a sufficiently timely manner  - With sufficient confidence and/or correctness  - Within planned resource constraints  • Inability or limited ability to restore mission or business functions in the  future  - In a sufficiently timely manner  - With sufficient confidence and/or correctness  - Within planned resource constraints  • Harms (e.g., financial costs, sanctions) due to noncompliance  - With applicable laws or regulations  - With contractual requirements or other requirements in other binding  agreements (e.g., liability)  • Direct financial costs  • Relational harms  - Damage to trust relationships  - Damage to image or reputation (and, hence, future or potential trust  relationships)  Harm to Assets • Damage to or loss of physical facilities  • Damage to or loss of information systems or networks  • Damage to or loss of information technology or equipment  • Damage to or loss of component parts or supplies  • Damage to or loss of information assets  • Loss of intellectual property  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  17  Type of Impact Impact  Harm to Individuals • Injury or loss of life  • Physical or psychological mistreatment  • Identity theft  • Loss of personally identifiable information  • Damage to image or reputation  Harm to Other  Organizations  • Harms (e.g., financial costs, sanctions) due to noncompliance  - With applicable laws or regulations  - With contractual requirements or other requirements in other binding  agreements  • Direct financial costs  • Relational harms  - Damage to trust relationships  - Damage to reputation (and, hence, future or potential trust  relationships)  Harm to the Nation  • Damage to or incapacitation of a critical infrastructure sector  • Loss of government continuity of operations  • Relational harms  - Damage to trust relationships with other governments or with non- governmental entities  - Damage to national reputation (and, hence, future or potential trust  relationships)  • Damage to current or future ability to achieve national objectives  - Harm to national security  6. Determine the Level of Risk. The regulated entity assesses the level of risk to ePHI, 771  considering the information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps. 772  The level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the overall likelihood 773  of threat occurrence (i.e., step 4) and the resulting impact of threat occurrence (i.e., step 774  5). A risk-level matrix, such as the samples depicted in Table 6 and Table 7, can be used 775  to assist in determining risk levels for each threat event/vulnerability pair. Regulated 776  entities can use a different risk matrix that aligns with the ratings scales used for 777  likelihood and impact in steps 4 and 5. 778  To clarify the use of the risk matrix, consider the examples presented in step 4. For the 779  tornado threat event, the overall likelihood was assigned a rating of “Low.” However, the 780  impact of this threat event could easily be assigned a rating of “High.” Using the matrix 781  in Table 6, the intersection of “Low” likelihood and “High” impact results in an overall 782  risk rating of “Low.” For the phishing threat example, the overall likelihood was rated 783  “High.” If the regulated entity determined that the impact of a phishing threat was likely 784  to be “Moderate,” this would result in an overall risk rating of “Moderate.” The 785  regulated entity should determine the level of risk for each identified threat/vulnerability 786  pair.  787  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  18  Table 6.  Sample Risk-Level Matrix 788  Threat Likelihood  Level of Impact  Low Moderate High  High Low Moderate High  Moderate Low Moderate Moderate  Low Low Low Low  789  Table 7 - Detailed Risk-Level Matrix 790  Threat  Likelihood  Level of Impact  Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Very High Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  High Very Low Low Moderate High Very High  Moderate Very Low Low Moderate Moderate High  Low Very Low Low Low Low Moderate  Very Low Very Low Very Low Very Low Low Low  7. Document the Risk Assessment Results. Once the risk assessment has been completed 791  (i.e., threat events, threat sources, and vulnerabilities identified; likelihood and impact 792  ratings calculated; and risk levels determined), the results of the risk assessment should 793  be documented. Regulated entities may benefit from documenting the risk assessment 794  results in a risk register.17 Appendix K of NIST [SP 800-30] provides a sample risk 795  assessment report outline that may prove useful to regulated entities. Other entities may 796  prefer to input the risk assessment results into a governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) 797  or enterprise risk management (ERM) tool. Principally, the regulated entity should 798  document all threat/vulnerability pairs (i.e., a scenario in which an identified threat can 799  exploit a vulnerability) applicable to the organization, the likelihood and impact 800  calculations, and the overall risk to ePHI for the threat/vulnerability pair.  801  3.3 Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management 802  The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization’s risk 803  management strategy (presented in Section 4). To that end, regulated entities should not view 804  risk assessment as a one-time, static task but rather as an ongoing activity. Threats change, and 805  17 OMB Circular A-11 [OMB A-11] defines a risk register as “a repository of risk information including the data understood  about risks over time.” The risk register provides a formal communication vehicle for sharing and coordinating cybersecurity  risk activities. Regulated entities can learn more about risk registers in [IR 8286A].  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  19  some identified vulnerabilities may be remediated while new vulnerabilities appear. The 806  regulated entity may implement policies or procedures that reduce the likelihood and/or impact 807  of a threat event. This dynamic environment requires the risk assessment to be updated on a 808  periodic basis in order for risks to be properly identified, documented, and subsequently 809  managed.  810  Risk Assessment Resources 811  Regulated entities may find the HHS Security Risk Assessment (SRA) Tool [SRA Tool] helpful 812  in getting started with a risk assessment. The SRA tool was primarily developed to assist small 813  and medium sized regulated entities. The SRA Tool is a questionnaire that guides a regulated 814  entity through many of the same risk assessment steps described in this section. In that sense, it 815  is meant to be used in conjunction with the risk assessment guidance above. Regulated entities 816  should be aware that, as a questionnaire, there are some things that the SRA tool cannot do. It 817  cannot identify technical vulnerabilities. It is suggested to pair the SRA tool – or any 818  questionnaire tool – with a methodology that could identify technical vulnerabilities (e.g., 819  vulnerability scanning or a vulnerability management program). Software such as the SRA tool 820  will provide output only as good as the information put into the tool. For that reason, regulated 821  entities should follow established risk assessment methodology even when using tools for risk 822  assessment. Regulated entities should also be aware that use of the SRA Tool or any risk 823  assessment/management tool does not necessarily equate with compliance to the HIPAA 824  Security Rule.  825  Regulated entities may find additional resources in Appendix F that can assist in the risk 826  assessment process.  827  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  20  4 Risk Management Guidance 828  The assessment, analysis, and management of risk to ePHI provide the foundation of a regulated 829  entity’s Security Rule [Sec. Rule] compliance efforts. Readers are reminded of the Security 830  Rule’s flexibility of approach. HHS OCR does not prescribe any particular risk assessment or 831  risk management methodology. This section provides background information about risk 832  management as well as an approach from [IR 8286] that regulated entities may choose to use in 833  managing risk to ePHI. Regulated entities, however, are free to use another risk management 834  methodology18 that effectively protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI. 835  All ePHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a regulated entity is subject to the 836  Security Rule. Regulated entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate security 837  measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, 838  integrity, and availability of ePHI. Risk management should be performed with regular 839  frequency to examine past decisions, reevaluate risk likelihood and impact levels, and assess the 840  effectiveness of past remediation efforts.  841  4.1 HIPAA Risk Management Requirements 842  Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires regulated entities to: 843  Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security 844  violations. 845  The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation 846  specifications. Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk management. 847  1. Risk Analysis (R19) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough 848  assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and 849  availability of electronic protected health information held by the covered entity or 850  business associate. 851  2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures sufficient to 852  reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to comply with 853  Section 164.306(a). 854  Section 3.2 provided a risk assessment methodology that regulated entities may choose to utilize 855  in accordance with 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A). This section provides risk management guidance in 856  accordance with 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B). 857  4.2 Risk Analysis 858  Regulated entities are required to assess risks and vulnerabilities in their environments and to 859  implement security controls to address those risks and vulnerabilities. Once the risk assessment 860  has been completed and documented, the regulated entity will have a listing of applicable 861  18 Regulated entities may benefit from the NISTIR 8286 series for more comprehensive risk management methodologies,  including how to integrate ePHI risk management with Enterprise Risk Management (ERM).  19 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  21  threat/vulnerability pairs as well as the overall risk rating of each pair to the confidentiality, 862  integrity, and availability of ePHI. Some threat/vulnerability pairs may indicate a moderate or 863  high level of risk to ePHI, while others may indicate a low level of risk to ePHI. The regulated 864  entity will need to determine what risk rating poses an unacceptable level of risk to ePHI. 865  866  A regulated entity’s leadership may indicate that organizational risk tolerance is “Medium” and 867  that all risks to ePHI must be brought within that level or below. Any threat/vulnerability pairs 868  that indicate a threat rating above the organizational risk tolerance will need to be addressed. For 869  example, if using a scale of “low,” “moderate,” and “high,” the regulated entity may determine 870  that any moderate or high level of risk to ePHI is unacceptable and must be remediated.  871  Once a regulated entity implements the standards, required implementation specifications, and 872  addressable20 implementation specifications in accordance with the Security Rule, the regulated 873  entity should determine whether the risks to ePHI have been sufficiently addressed. That is, do 874  the implemented standards and implementation specifications reduce the risk of the 875  threat/vulnerability pairs that were deemed unacceptably high to levels that are within the 876  organizational risk tolerance?  877  As an example, a regulated entity’s risk assessment may have identified ransomware attacks to 878  pose a high level of risk to ePHI (i.e., High likelihood rating and High impact rating). After 879  implementing two required implementation specifications – Data Backup Plan 880  [(164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A)] and Disaster Recovery Plan [164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B)] – the regulated entity 881  reassesses that the level of risk due to ransomware attacks has been reduced to Low. The 882  likelihood of a ransomware attack may still be rated High, but the two required implementation 883  specifications have helped reduce the impact rating to Low, resulting in an overall risk rating that 884  20 Regulated entities should consult Section 2.2 and/or the [Sec. Rule] § 164.306(d) for additional information about addressable  implementation specifications and how to adequately implement them in the regulated entity’s environment.  Risk Appetite and Risk Tolerance  NISTIR 8286A presents two concepts – risk appetite and risk tolerance – that may be helpful  to regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI. Risk appetite regarding cybersecurity risks is  declared at the enterprise (i.e., highest) level of the organization and provides a guidepost to  the types and amount of risk, on a broad level, that senior leaders are willing to accept in  pursuit of mission objectives. Risk tolerance represents the specific level of performance  risk deemed acceptable within the risk appetite set by senior leadership. Regulated entities  may choose to express risk tolerance qualitatively (e.g., Very Low, Low, Moderate, High,  or Very High) in alignment with the guidance presented in Section 3.  Risk appetite and risk tolerance are related but distinct. Where risk appetite statements define  the overarching risk guidance, risk tolerance statements define the specific application of that  direction. This means that risk tolerance statements are always more specific than the  corresponding risk appetite statements. Together, risk appetite and risk tolerance statements  represent risk limits that can assist regulated entities in managing risk to ePHI.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  22  is within organizational risk tolerance. Another regulated entity may have determined during a 885  risk assessment that loss of confidentiality of ePHI during transmission to an external party is an 886  unacceptably high risk (i.e., outside of established risk tolerance). However, the regulated entity 887  has determined that the implemented standards and implementation specifications still do not 888  reduce the risk to levels that are within organizational risk tolerance and that additional controls 889  are needed21. 890  This process of risk analysis should be completed for each threat/vulnerability pair to determine 891  whether the implemented standards and implementation specifications have reduced risk to ePHI 892  to levels within the organizational risk tolerance level. Ultimately, the regulated entity’s risk 893  analysis processes should inform its decisions regarding the implementation of security measures 894  sufficient to reduce risks to ePHI to levels within organizational risk tolerance. Each regulated 895  entity must document22 the security controls determined to be reasonable and appropriate, 896  including analyses, decisions, and the rationale for decisions made to refine or adjust the security 897  controls.  898  4.3 Selecting Additional Security Controls to Reduce Risk to ePHI 899  A regulated entity may determine that there are identified risks to ePHI that cannot be brought 900  within established risk tolerance by any standards, required implementation specifications, or 901  addressable implementation specifications in the Security Rule. In such a situation, the regulated 902  entity should consider implementing additional security controls23 to reduce the risk to ePHI to 903  established risk tolerance. Appendix E provides a catalog of the HIPAA Security Rule standards 904  and implementation specifications, mapping each to relevant [NIST CSF] Subcategory outcomes 905  and the security controls in [SP 800-53]. Regulated entities may benefit from the mapping to 906  identify desired cybersecurity outcomes, as well as SP 800-53 management, operational, or 907  technical controls that can reduce the risk to ePHI to established risk tolerance. 908  Many organizations implement a variety of technical and non-technical controls separate from 909  the protection of ePHI. These controls may consist of policies, processes, or technology. A 910  thorough understanding of the entirety of security controls in place for a regulated entity may 911  reduce the list of applicable vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability of a threat 912  exploiting a vulnerability. Regulated entities should be sure to evaluate all technical and non-913  technical security controls at all places where ePHI is created, received, maintained, processed, 914  or transmitted. This evaluation should determine whether these additional security measures 915  implemented or planned are adequate to protect ePHI and reduce risk to ePHI to established risk 916  tolerance. The appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the 917  structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity. 918  21 See Section 4.3 for additional discussion.  22 Regulated entities should consider documenting these decisions in the risk register or wherever the risk assessment results were  documented. See Section 4.4.  23 It should be noted that not all possible recommended security controls can be implemented to reduce risk. To determine which  are required and appropriate for a specific organization, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted for the proposed  recommended controls to demonstrate that the costs of implementing the controls can be justified by the reduction in the level  of risk. In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and feasibility of introducing the  recommended security controls into the operating environment.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  23  For some threats and/or vulnerabilities, the regulated entity may determine that the risk to ePHI 919  cannot be brought within established risk tolerance through any standards, implementation 920  specifications, or additional security controls. In this case, the regulated entity’s leadership may 921  choose to revisit the established risk tolerance. The resulting discussions present an opportunity 922  for leadership to determine the best course of action to refine risk acceptance and tolerance in 923  light of mission objectives (e.g., through a risk exception process, an adjustment to the risk 924  tolerance statement, or increased security requirements). However, if an unacceptable level of 925  risk to ePHI cannot be adequately treated in a cost-effective manner, that risk should be avoided. 926  Such a condition may require significantly redesigning relevant systems or processes that handle 927  ePHI. 928  4.4 Documenting Risk Management Activities 929  As with the risk assessment, the risk management activities should be documented. The 930  regulated entity may build on the documentation developed during the risk assessment by 931  indicating how threat/vulnerability pairs with risk levels above established risk tolerance are 932  mitigated or avoided. Some regulated entities may choose to document their risk management 933  activities through a risk register that records assessment findings, remediation plans, timelines, 934  responsible parties, etc. Other regulated entities may choose to utilize free or commercially 935  available tools to document their risk management activities. The documentation and retention of 936  risk assessment and risk management activities may be important for future risk management 937  efforts.  938  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  24  5 Considerations When Implementing the HIPAA Security Rule 939  This section presents security measures that are relevant to each standard of the Security Rule.  940  Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format. The following tables, organized by 941  HIPAA Security Rule [Sec. Rule] standard, are designed to initiate the thought process for 942  regulated entities to implement the requirements of the Security Rule. These tables highlight 943  considerations for a regulated entity when implementing the Security Rule; they are not meant to 944  be prescriptive. The tables should also not be considered comprehensive for all considerations 945  when implementing the Security Rule.  946  In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the 947  following information: 948  • Key Activities – The Key Activities column lists actions that are often associated with 949  the security functions suggested by each HIPAA Security Rule standard. Some of these 950  key activities are also the implementation specifications for that standard. Each key 951  activity that is also an implementation specification has been identified as such in the 952  table (in italics in the Description section of the table) along with a note as to whether the 953  implementation specification is required or addressable.  954  Other key activities are not implementation specifications. These activities are not 955  specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is 956  in no way meant to expand upon the requirements of the Security Rule. Many of these 957  activities, however, are often included in a robust security process and may be useful to 958  regulated entities. These activities may also normally be performed as part of one or more 959  of the standard’s implementation specifications. For clarity, these activities are listed as 960  separate key activities with a footnote explaining any relationship to associated 961  implementation specifications.  962  The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation 963  specifications, both required and addressable. Seven of the standards include all of the 964  necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation 965  specifications. In these instances, the standards themselves also serve as the 966  implementation specification. As noted earlier in this document, even if there are no 967  implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned 968  Security Responsibility and Evaluation, compliance with the standard itself is still 969  required.  970  The listed key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be additional 971  activities that an organization will need to consider specific to its own operations that are 972  not included in the key activities of the tables. Each regulated entity will need to identify 973  which activities beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its 974  environment, implement those activities, and document them.  975  The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised 976  by the HIPAA Security Rule. For more detailed information about the key activities, 977  readers may consult the crosswalk presented in Appendix E. The crosswalk lists, for each 978  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  25  Security Rule standard, one or more relevant NIST publications that could provide more 979  context or information. 980  • Description – The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation 981  about the key activities. The descriptions include the types of activities that a regulated 982  entity may pursue in implementing a standard. These explanations are designed to help 983  get an entity started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule. The first description bullet 984  of each key activity that is also an implementation specification is in italics. When a 985  relationship exists between description bullets and other Security Rule standards or 986  implementation specifications, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.  987  988  • Sample Questions – This column includes questions that a regulated entity may ask 989  itself to determine whether the standard has been adequately implemented. These sample 990  questions are not exhaustive but are representative of the questions that a regulated entity 991  may find helpful when implementing the Security Rule and implementation 992  specifications. Affirmative answers to these questions do not necessarily imply that an 993  entity is meeting all of the requirements of the HIPAA security standards. Negative 994  answers to these questions should prompt the regulated entity to consider whether it 995  needs to take further action to comply with the standards. It is possible that organizations 996  with existing information security programs will have considered many of the sample 997  questions. The questions that an organization asks in implementing the Security Rule 998  should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity. 999  This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational 1000  Requirements, in detail as it does not set out general security principles. HIPAA-regulated 1001  entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further 1002  guidance if needed.  1003  Readers are reminded of the Security Rule’s flexibility of approach. The following key activities, 1004  descriptions, and sample questions are meant to be informative, not prescriptive. This flexibility 1005  allows regulated entities to customize how they implement HIPAA’s Security Rule requirements. 1006  Regulated entities should customize the key activities, descriptions, and sample questions to best 1007  fit their organization. 1008  Each regulated entity (i.e., covered entity or business associate) is responsible for its own 1009  Security Rule compliance and violations and should therefore review the following key 1010  activities, descriptions, and sample questions through the lens of its own organization.  1011  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  26  5.1 Administrative Safeguards 1012  5.1.1 Security Management Process (§ 164.308(a)(1)) 1013  HIPAA Standard: Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations. 1014  Key Activities Description Sample Questions  1.

A covered entity is not required to obtain such 1055  satisfactory assurances from a business associate that is a subcontractor.  1056  Covered entities need to be cognizant of differentiating between best practices versus what the Security Rule requires. Vendor 1057  management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to 1058  organizations. However, to the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as 1059  covered entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written 1060  satisfactory assurances that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more of their 1061  business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a business associate agreement (BAA). These 1062  requirements would need to be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate. 1063  Key Activities Description Sample Questions  1.

Ensure that the regulated entity’s risk  analysis properly assesses risks for such access points  (e.g., risks of unauthorized access from within the  enterprise could be different than those of remote  unauthorized access).  • Authentication requires establishing the validity of a  transmission source and/or verifying an individual’s claim  that they have been authorized for specific access  privileges to information and information systems.  • What authentication methods are available?  • What are the advantages and disadvantages of each  method?  • Can risks of unauthorized access be sufficiently reduced  for each point of electronic access with available  authentication methods?  • What will it cost to implement the available methods in our  environment?  • Are there trained staff who can maintain the system or  should outsourced support be considered?  • Are passwords being used? If so, are they unique to the  individual?  • Is multi-factor authentication being used? If so, how and  where is it implemented?  2.  Evaluate Available  Authentication Options  • Weigh the relative advantages and disadvantages of  commonly used authentication approaches.  • There are three commonly used authentication approaches  available:  1. Something a person knows, such as a password  2. Something a person has or is in possession of, such as  a token (e.g., smart card, hardware token, etc.)  3. Some type of biometric identification that a person  provides, such as a fingerprint  • Multi-factor authentication (MFA) utilizes two or more of the  above approaches to enforce stronger authentication.  • Consider implementing multi-factor authentication solutions  when the risk to ePHI is sufficiently high.  • What are the strengths and weaknesses of each available  option?  • Which can be best supported with assigned resources  (e.g., budget/staffing)?  • What level of authentication is appropriate for each access  to ePHI based on the assessment of risk?  • Has the organization identified all instances of access to  ePHI (including by services, vendors, or application  programming interfaces [APIs]) and considered appropriate  authentication requirements based on the risk  assessment?  • Has the organization considered MFA for access to ePHI  that poses high risk (e.g., remote access, access to  privileged functions)?  • Is outside vendor support required to implement the  process?  132 See also Section 5.3.1, HIPAA Standard: Access Control; Section 5.3.2, HIPAA Standard: Audit Controls; and NIST [SP 800-63B], Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication  and Lifecycle Management  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  64  Key Activities Description Sample Questions  3.  Select and Implement  Authentication Options  • Consider the results of the analysis conducted under Key  Activity 2, and select appropriate authentication methods  based on the results of the risk assessment and risk  management processes.  • Implement the methods selected into organizational  operations and activities.  • Has the organization’s selection of authentication methods  been made based on the results of the risk assessment?  • If passwords are being used as an authentication element,  are they of sufficient length and strength to protect ePHI?  Is this enforced by technical policies?  • Has necessary user and support staff training133 been  completed?  • Have a formal authentication policy and procedures been  established and communicated?  • Has necessary testing been completed to ensure that the  authentication system is working as prescribed?  • Do the procedures include ongoing system maintenance  and updates?  • Is the process implemented in such a way that it does not  compromise the authentication information (e.g., password  file encryption, etc.)?  1100  1101  133 See Section 5.1.5, HIPAA Standard: Security Awareness and Training.

Vendor 1114  management and supply chain risks are important topics due to the potential they have to introduce new threats and risks to 1115  organizations. To the extent that such vendors and service providers are business associates, HIPAA treats them the same as covered 1116  entities with respect to Security Rule compliance. Covered entities and business associates are required to obtain written satisfactory 1117  assurances from business associates that PHI will be protected. Covered entities and business associates are permitted to require more 1118  of their business associates and even include more stringent cybersecurity requirements in a BAA. These requirements would need to 1119  be agreed upon by both the covered entity and the business associate. 1120  Key Activities Description Sample Questions  1.

Note: Natural and human-made disasters  can also be characterized in terms of  their severity and/or duration. However,  because the threat source and the threat  event are strongly identified, severity and  duration can be included in the  description of the threat event (e.g.,  Category 5 hurricane causes extensive  damage to the facilities that house  mission-critical systems, making those  systems unavailable for three weeks).  Range of effects  1429  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  94  Table 9 - Representative Examples – Adversarial Threat Events 1430  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Perform reconnaissance and gather information.  Perform perimeter network  reconnaissance and scanning.  Adversary uses commercial or free software to scan  organizational perimeters to obtain a better understanding of  the information technology infrastructure and improve the  ability to launch successful attacks.  Perform network sniffing of exposed  networks.  Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data  channels used to transmit information uses network sniffing  to identify components, resources, and protections.  Gather information using open-source  discovery of organizational information.  Adversary mines publicly accessible information to gather  information about organizational information systems,  business processes, users or personnel, or external  relationships that the adversary can subsequently employ in  support of an attack.  Perform reconnaissance and surveillance  of targeted organizations.  Adversary uses various means (e.g., scanning, physical  observation) over time to examine and assess organizations  and ascertain points of vulnerability.  Perform malware-directed internal  reconnaissance.  Adversary uses malware installed inside the organizational  perimeter to identify targets of opportunity. Because the  scanning, probing, or observation does not cross the  perimeter, it is not detected by externally placed intrusion  detection systems.  Craft or create attack tools.  Craft phishing attacks. Adversary counterfeits communications from a legitimate or  trustworthy source to acquire sensitive information, such as  usernames, passwords, or SSNs. Typical attacks occur via  email, instant messaging, or comparable means that  commonly direct users to websites that appear to be  legitimate sites while actually stealing the entered  information.  Craft spear phishing attacks. Adversary employs phishing attacks targeted at high value  targets (e.g., senior leaders, executives).  Craft attacks specifically based on  deployed information technology  environment.  Adversary develops attacks (e.g., crafts targeted malware)  that take advantage of knowledge of the organizational  information technology environment.  Create counterfeit or spoof website. Adversary creates duplicates of legitimate websites. When  users visit a counterfeit site, the site can gather information  or download malware.  Craft counterfeit certificates. Adversary counterfeits or compromises a certificate  authority so that malware or connections will appear  legitimate.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  95  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Create and operate false front  organizations to inject malicious  components into the supply chain.  Adversary creates false front organizations with the  appearance of legitimate suppliers in the critical life cycle  path that then inject corrupted or malicious information  system components into the organizational supply chain.  Deliver, insert, or install malicious capabilities.  Deliver known malware to internal  organizational information systems (e.g.,  virus via email).  Adversary uses common delivery mechanisms (e.g., email)  to install or insert known malware (e.g., malware whose  existence is known) into organizational information systems.  Deliver modified malware to internal  organizational information systems.  Adversary uses more sophisticated delivery mechanisms  than email (e.g., web traffic, instant messaging) to deliver  malware and possibly modifications of known malware to  gain access to internal organizational information systems.  Deliver targeted malware for control of  internal systems and the exfiltration of  data.  Adversary installs malware that is specifically designed to  take control of internal organizational information systems,  identify sensitive information, exfiltrate the information back  to the adversary, and conceal these actions.  Deliver malware by providing  removable media.  Adversary places removable media (e.g., flash drives)  containing malware in locations external to organizational  physical perimeters but where employees are likely to find  the media (e.g., facilities parking lots, exhibits at conferences  attended by employees) and use it on organizational  information systems.  Insert untargeted malware into  downloadable software and/or into  commercial information technology  products.  Adversary corrupts or inserts malware into common  freeware, shareware, or commercial information technology  products. Adversary is not targeting specific organizations  but simply looking for entry points into internal  organizational information systems. Note that this is  particularly a concern for mobile applications.  Insert targeted malware into  organizational information systems and  information system components.  Adversary inserts malware into organizational information  systems and information system components (e.g.,  commercial information technology products), specifically  targeting the hardware, software, and firmware used by  organizations (based on knowledge gained via  reconnaissance).  Insert specialized malware into  organizational information systems  based on system configurations.  Adversary inserts specialized, non-detectable malware into  organizational information systems based on system  configurations, specifically targeting critical information  system components based on reconnaissance and placement  within organizational information systems.  Insert counterfeit or tampered hardware  into the supply chain.  Adversary intercepts hardware from legitimate suppliers.  Adversary modifies the hardware or replaces it with faulty or  otherwise modified hardware.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  96  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Insert tampered critical components into  organizational systems.  Adversary replaces critical information system components  with modified or corrupted components through the supply  chain, a subverted insider, or some combination thereof.  Install general-purpose sniffers on  organization-controlled information  systems or networks.  Adversary installs sniffing software onto internal  organizational information systems or networks.  Install persistent and targeted sniffers on  organizational information systems and  networks.  Adversary places software designed to collect (i.e., sniff)  network traffic over a continuous period of time within  internal organizational information systems or networks.  Insert malicious scanning devices (e.g.,  wireless sniffers) inside facilities.  Adversary uses the postal service or other commercial  delivery services to deliver a device to organizational  mailrooms that is able to scan wireless communications  accessible from within the mailrooms and then wirelessly  transmit information back to adversary.  Insert subverted individuals into  organizations.  Adversary places individuals within organizations who are  willing and able to carry out actions to cause harm to  organizational mission or business functions.  Insert subverted individuals into  privileged positions in organizations.  Adversary places individuals in privileged positions within  organizations who are willing and able to carry out actions to  cause harm to organizational mission or business functions.  Adversary may target privileged functions to gain access to  sensitive information (e.g., user accounts, system files, etc.)  and may leverage access to one privileged capability to get  to another capability.  Exploit and compromise.  Exploit physical access of authorized  staff to gain access to organizational  facilities.  Adversary follows (“tailgates”) authorized individuals into  secure or controlled locations to circumvent physical  security checks with the goal of gaining access to facilities.  Exploit poorly configured or  unauthorized information systems  exposed to the internet.  Adversary gains access through the internet to information  systems that are not authorized for internet connectivity or  that do not meet organizational configuration requirements.  Exploit split tunneling. Adversary takes advantage of external organizational or  personal information systems (e.g., laptop computers at  remote locations) that are simultaneously connected securely  to organizational information systems or networks and to  non-secure remote connections.  Exploit multi-tenancy in a cloud  environment.  Adversary, with processes running in an organizationally  used cloud environment, takes advantage of multi-tenancy to  observe the behavior of organizational processes, acquire  organizational information, or interfere with the timely or  correct functioning of organizational processes.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  97  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Exploit known vulnerabilities in mobile  systems (e.g., laptops, smart phones).  Adversary takes advantage of fact that transportable  information systems are outside of the physical protection of  organizations and logical protection of corporate firewalls  and compromises the systems based on known  vulnerabilities to gather information from those systems.  Exploit recently discovered  vulnerabilities.  Adversary exploits recently discovered vulnerabilities in  organizational information systems in an attempt to  compromise the systems before mitigation measures are  available or in place.  Exploit vulnerabilities on internal  organizational information systems.  Adversary searches for known vulnerabilities in  organizational internal information systems and exploits  those vulnerabilities.  Exploit vulnerabilities using zero-day  attacks.  Adversary employs attacks that exploit as yet unpublicized  vulnerabilities. Zero-day attacks are based on adversary  insight into the information systems and the applications  used by organizations as well as adversary reconnaissance of  organizations.  Exploit vulnerabilities in information  systems timed with organizational  mission or business operations tempo.  Adversary launches attacks on organizations in a time and  manner consistent with organizational needs to conduct  mission or business operations.  Exploit insecure or incomplete data  deletion in a multi-tenant environment.  Adversary obtains unauthorized information due to insecure  or incomplete data deletion in a multi-tenant environment  (e.g., in a cloud computing environment).

NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  98  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Compromise mission-critical  information.  Adversary compromises the integrity of mission-critical  information, thus preventing or impeding the ability of  organizations to which information is supplied from carrying  out operations.  Compromise the design, manufacturing,  and/or distribution of information  system components (including hardware,  software, and firmware).  Adversary compromises the design, manufacturing, and/or  distribution of critical information system components at  selected suppliers.  Conduct an attack (i.e., direct or coordinate attack tools or activities).  Conduct communications interception  attacks.  Adversary takes advantage of communications that are either  unencrypted or use weak encryption (e.g., encryption  containing publicly known flaws), targets those  communications, and gains access to the transmitted  information and channels.  Conduct wireless jamming attacks. Adversary takes measures to interfere with wireless  communications so as to impede or prevent communications  from reaching the intended recipients.  Conduct attacks using unauthorized  ports, protocols, and services.  Adversary conducts attacks using ports, protocols, and  services for ingress and egress that are not authorized for use  by organizations.  Conduct attacks leveraging traffic or  data movement allowed across the  perimeter.  Adversary makes use of permitted information flows (e.g.,  email communication, removable storage) to compromise  internal information systems, which allows the adversary to  obtain and exfiltrate sensitive information through  perimeters.  Conduct simple denial-of-service (DoS)  attacks.  Adversary attempts to make an internet-accessible resource  unavailable to intended users or prevent the resource from  functioning efficiently or at all, whether temporarily or  indefinitely.  Conduct distributed denial-of-service  (DDoS) attacks.  Adversary uses multiple compromised information systems  to attack a single target, thereby causing a denial of service  for users of the targeted information systems.  Conduct targeted denial-of-service  (DoS) attacks.  Adversary conducts DoS attacks to target critical  information systems, components, or supporting  infrastructures based on adversary knowledge of  dependencies.  Conduct physical attacks on  organizational facilities.  Adversary conducts a physical attack on organizational  facilities (e.g., sets a fire).  Conduct physical attacks on  infrastructures that support  organizational facilities.  Adversary conducts a physical attack on one or more  infrastructures that support organizational facilities (e.g.,  breaks a water main, cuts a power line).  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  99  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Conduct cyber-physical attacks on  organizational facilities.  Adversary conducts a cyber-physical attack on  organizational facilities (e.g., remotely changes heating  and/or energy settings).  Conduct data scavenging attacks in a  cloud environment.

Attacks are not based on any adversary  insights into specific vulnerabilities of organizations.  Conduct externally-based session  hijacking.  Adversary takes control of (i.e., hijacks) already established,  legitimate information system sessions between  organizations and external entities (e.g., users connecting  from off-site locations).  Conduct internally-based session  hijacking.  Adversary places an entity within organizations in order to  gain access to organizational information systems or  networks for the express purpose of taking control (i.e.,  hijacking) an already established, legitimate session either  between organizations and external entities (e.g., users  connecting from remote locations) or between two locations  within internal networks.  Conduct externally-based network traffic  modification (machine-in-the-middle)  attacks.  Adversary, operating outside of organizational systems,  intercepts or eavesdrops on sessions between organizational  and external systems. Adversary then relays messages  between organizational and external systems, making them  believe that they are talking directly to each other over a  private connection when, in fact, the entire communication is  controlled by the adversary. Such attacks are of particular  concern for the organizational use of community, hybrid, and  public clouds.  Conduct internally-based network traffic  modification (man-in-the-middle)  attacks.  Adversary intercepts and corrupts data sessions while  operating within the organizational infrastructure.  Conduct outsider-based social  engineering to obtain information.  Externally placed adversary takes actions (e.g., using email,  phone) with the intent of persuading or otherwise tricking  individuals within organizations into revealing critical or  sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable  information).  Conduct insider-based social  engineering to obtain information.  Internally placed adversary takes actions (e.g., using email,  phone) so that individuals within organizations reveal critical  or sensitive information (e.g., mission information).  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  100  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Conduct attacks that target and  compromise the personal devices of  critical employees.  Adversary targets key organizational employees by placing  malware on their personally owned information systems and  devices (e.g., laptop/notebook computers, personal digital  assistants, smart phones). The intent is to take advantage of  any instances where employees use personal information  systems or devices to handle critical or sensitive information.  Conduct supply chain attacks that target  and exploit critical hardware, software,  or firmware.  Adversary targets and compromises the operation of  software (e.g., through malware injections), firmware, and  hardware that performs critical functions for organizations.  This is largely accomplished as supply chain attacks on both  commercial off-the-shelf and custom information systems  and components.  Achieve results (i.e., cause adverse impacts, obtain information).  Obtain sensitive information by network  sniffing external networks.  Adversary with access to exposed wired or wireless data  channels that organizations (or organizational personnel) use  to transmit information (e.g., kiosks, public wireless  networks) intercepts communications.  Obtain sensitive information via  exfiltration.  Adversary directs malware on organizational systems to  locate and surreptitiously transmit sensitive information.  Cause the degradation or denial of  attacker-selected services or capabilities.  Adversary directs malware on organizational systems to  impair the correct and timely support of organizational  mission and business functions.  Cause the deterioration or destruction of  critical information system components  and functions.  Adversary destroys or causes the deterioration of critical  information system components to impede or eliminate the  organizational ability to carry out mission or business  functions. Detection of this action is not a concern.  Cause integrity loss by creating,  deleting, and/or modifying data on  publicly accessible information systems  (e.g., web defacement).  Adversary vandalizes or otherwise makes unauthorized  changes to organizational websites or data on websites.  Cause integrity loss by polluting or  corrupting critical data.  Adversary implants corrupted and incorrect data in critical  data, resulting in suboptimal actions or the loss of confidence  in organizational data and services.  Cause integrity loss by injecting false  but believable data into organizational  information systems.  Adversary injects false but believable data into  organizational information systems, resulting in suboptimal  actions or the loss of confidence in organizational data and  services.  Cause the disclosure of critical and/or  sensitive information by authorized  users.  Adversary induces (e.g., via social engineering) authorized  users to inadvertently expose, disclose, or mishandle critical  or sensitive information.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  101  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Cause unauthorized disclosure and/or  unavailability by spilling sensitive  information.  Adversary contaminates organizational information systems  (including devices and networks) by causing them to handle  information of a classification or sensitivity for which they  have not been authorized. The information is exposed to  individuals who are not authorized access to such  information, and the information system, device, or network  is unavailable while the spill is investigated and mitigated.  Obtain information by the externally  located interception of wireless network  traffic.  Adversary intercepts organizational communications over  wireless networks (e.g., targets public wireless access or  hotel networking connections, drive-by subversion of home  or organizational wireless routers).  Obtain unauthorized access. Adversary with authorized access to organizational  information systems gains access to resources that exceed  authorization.  Obtain sensitive data or information  from publicly accessible information  systems.  Adversary scans or mines information on publicly accessible  servers and web pages of organizations with the intent of  finding sensitive information.  Obtain information by opportunistically  stealing or scavenging information  systems or components.  Adversary steals information systems or components (e. g.,  laptop computers or data storage media) that are left  unattended outside of the physical perimeters of  organizations or scavenges discarded components.  Maintain a presence or set of capabilities.  Obfuscate adversary actions. Adversary takes actions to inhibit the effectiveness of the  intrusion detection systems or auditing capabilities within  organizations.  Adapt cyber attacks based on detailed  surveillance.  Adversary adapts their behavior in response to surveillance  and organizational security measures.  Coordinate a campaign.  Coordinate a campaign of multi-staged  attacks (e.g., hopping).  Adversary moves the source of malicious commands or  actions from one compromised information system to  another, making analysis difficult.  Coordinate a campaign that combines  internal and external attacks across  multiple information systems and  information technologies.  Adversary combines attacks that require both a physical  presence within organizational facilities and cyber methods  to achieve success. The physical attack steps may be as  simple as convincing maintenance personnel to leave doors  or cabinets open.  Coordinate campaigns across multiple  organizations to acquire specific  information or achieve a desired  outcome.  Adversary does not limit planning to the targeting of one  organization. Adversary observes multiple organizations to  acquire necessary information on targets of interest.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  102  Threat Events  (Characterized by Tactics,  Techniques, and Procedures  [TTPs])  Description  Coordinate a campaign that spreads  attacks across organizational systems  from an existing presence.  Adversary uses an existing presence within organizational  systems to extend the adversary’s span of control to other  organizational systems, including organizational  infrastructure. Adversary is, thus, in a position to further  undermine the organization’s ability to carry out mission and  business functions.  Coordinate a campaign of continuous,  adaptive, and changing cyber attacks  based on detailed surveillance.  Adversary attacks continually change in response to  surveillance and organizational security measures.  Coordinate cyber attacks using external  (outsider), internal (insider), and supply  chain (supplier) attack vectors.  Adversary employs continuous, coordinated attacks,  potentially using all three attack vectors for the purpose of  impeding organizational operations.  1431  Table 10 - Representative Examples – Non-Adversarial Threat Events 1432  Threat Event Description  Spill sensitive  information  An authorized user erroneously contaminates a device, information system, or  network by placing on it or sending to it information of a classification or sensitivity  that it has not been authorized to handle. The information is exposed to access by  unauthorized individuals, and as a result, the device, system, or network is  unavailable while the spill is investigated and mitigated.  Mishandling of  critical and/or  sensitive  information by  authorized users  An authorized privileged user inadvertently exposes critical or sensitive information.  Incorrect  privilege  settings  An authorized privileged user or administrator erroneously assigns a user excessive  privileges or sets privilege requirements on a resource too low.  Communications  contention  Communications performance is degraded due to contention.  Unreadable  display  The display is unreadable due to aging equipment.  Earthquake at  primary facility  An earthquake of an organization-defined magnitude at the primary facility makes  that facility inoperable.  Fire at primary  facility  A fire (not due to adversarial activity) at the primary facility makes that facility  inoperable.  Fire at backup  facility  A fire (not due to adversarial activity) at a backup facility makes that facility  inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or logs.  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  103  Threat Event Description  Flood at primary  facility  A flood (not due to adversarial activity) at the primary facility makes that facility  inoperable.  Flood at backup  facility  A flood (not due to adversarial activity) at a backup facility makes that facility  inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or logs.  Hurricane at  primary facility  A hurricane of organization-defined strength at the primary facility makes that  facility inoperable.  Hurricane at  backup facility  A hurricane of organization-defined strength at a backup facility makes that facility  inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or logs.  Resource  depletion  Processing performance is degraded due to resource depletion.  Introduction of  vulnerabilities  into software  products  Due to inherent weaknesses in programming languages and software development  environments, errors and vulnerabilities are introduced into commonly used software  products.  Disk error Storage is corrupted due to a disk error.  Pervasive disk  error  The aging of a set of devices that were all acquired at the same time and from the  same supplier leads to multiple disk errors.  Windstorm or  tornado at  primary facility  A windstorm or tornado of organization-defined strength at the primary facility  makes that facility inoperable.  Windstorm or  tornado at  backup facility  A windstorm or tornado of organization-defined strength at a backup facility makes  that facility inoperable or destroys backups of software, configurations, data, and/or  logs.  1433  1434  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  104  National Online Informative References (OLIR) Program 1435  In a general sense, an informative reference, sometimes called a mapping, indicates how one 1436  document relates to another document. In the [NIST CSF], for example, six informative 1437  references were included (as shown in Figure 1) although many other informative references 1438  could have been useful to stakeholders. While the concept of informative references was well 1439  received, the static nature of the Cybersecurity Framework and other NIST documents that 1440  include informative references meant that some of its informative references became outdated as 1441  the documents they referenced were updated. 1442  1443  1444  Within the context of the National Online Informative References [NIST OLIR] Program, an 1445  informative reference indicates the relationship(s) between the elements of two documents. The 1446  source document, called the Focal Document, is used as the basis for the document comparison. 1447  The second document is called the Reference Document. Note that a Focal Document or a 1448  Reference Document is not necessarily in a traditional document format (e.g., a formal 1449  publication in PDF format) but could be a product, service, or training. A Focal Document 1450  Element or a Reference Document Element is a discrete section, sentence, phrase, or other 1451  identifiable piece of content of a document. 1452  The OLIR Program is a NIST effort to facilitate subject matter experts (SMEs) in defining 1453  standardized relationships between elements of their cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce 1454  documents (Reference Documents) and elements of other cybersecurity, privacy, and workforce 1455  documents (Focal Documents), like the Cybersecurity Framework Version 1.1 and NIST [SP 1456  800-53], Rev. 5. By removing the informative references from within the NIST documents, the 1457  OLIR program scales to accommodate a greater number of informative references while 1458  providing a more agile model for updating the relationships between elements of the Reference 1459  and Focal Documents.  1460  Figure 1 - Informative References Included in Cybersecurity Framework  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  105  The National OLIR Program provides an online catalog for displaying, sharing, and comparing 1461  informative references. The National OLIR Program offers several benefits, including: 1462  • Provides a single, easy-to-use repository where people can obtain information on many 1463  Reference Documents and analyze their relationships 1464  • Increases the transparency, alignment, and harmonization of definitions and concepts 1465  across Reference Documents 1466  • Standardizes how References are expressed – making them more consistent, clear, usable, 1467  repeatable, and organizable – and provides a way for automation technologies to ingest 1468  and utilize them 1469  • Provides the ability to authenticate the source of each Reference and allows users to 1470  identify whether the Reference was provided by a verified SME 1471  • Employs mathematical rigor (e.g., standard set theory principles, such as subset, superset, 1472  equal, intersect, and discrete logic) to express References rather than merely relying on 1473  prose, which can be ambiguous and subjective 1474  • Allows for the cybersecurity and privacy community to keep information current on 1475  relationship assertions between Reference Documents and Focal Documents 1476  Before the National OLIR Program, a person analyzing documents was often forced to conduct a 1477  manual comparison, typically by copying the contents of both documents into a spreadsheet for 1478  easier searching and sorting. To save time, an analyst might try to leverage existing document 1479  mappings from SMEs. This laborious and error-prone process would be repeated for all of the 1480  elements within the Focal Document and the Reference Document. Multiply this process by 1481  numerous analysts performing the task, and two problems quickly emerge: 1) the different 1482  opinions of analysts result in inconsistent associations, and 2) the analysts duplicate an enormous 1483  amount of effort. Streamlining this process is the main reason the OLIR Derived Relationship 1484  Mappings (DRM) capability was created. 1485  DRMs are the result of using the relationships between Reference Documents and a Focal 1486  Document to make inferences about relationships between the Reference Documents. For 1487  example, the OLIR catalog contains an informative reference that maps elements of the 1488  Cybersecurity Framework to elements in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. Another informative 1489  reference maps elements of the Cybersecurity Framework to elements in two versions of the 1490  HITRUST CSF [HITRUST]. A DRM can be created that depicts the relationships between the 1491  two Reference Documents: NIST SP 800-53, Rev.5 and the HITRUST CSF. These DRMs can be 1492  dynamically generated on the OLIR website. 1493  With much of the relationship data already defined by the SME, a user can simply generate a full 1494  report between two Reference Documents and export it to a comma-separated values format. The 1495  user can sort the reference data by Functions, Categories, Subcategories, Control Families, 1496  Security/Privacy Controls, or Security Control Enhancements (depending on the Focal 1497  Document selected). The user can then better understand the similarities and differences between 1498  the elements and determine which relationships are relevant for their purposes.  1499  In the context of HIPAA compliance, Table 12 in Appendix E lists mappings between elements 1500  of the Security Rule (i.e., standards and implementation specifications); elements of SP 800-53, 1501  Rev. 5 (i.e., security and privacy controls); and elements of the Cybersecurity Framework (i.e., 1502  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  106  Subcategory outcomes). Using the included mappings, OLIR catalog, and DRM tool, users can 1503  determine relationships to elements in a wide variety of other Reference Documents (e.g., 1504  controls catalogs, standards, practices) that may help them comply with the Security Rule and 1505  improve their organizational cybersecurity posture.  1506  NIST SP 800-66r2 ipd  IMPLEMENTING THE HIPAA SECURITY RULE:  INITIAL PUBLIC DRAFT  A CYBERSECURITY RESOURCE GUIDE  107  Security Rule Standards and Implementation Specifications 1507  Crosswalk 1508  This appendix provides a listing of the HIPAA Security Rule [Sec.

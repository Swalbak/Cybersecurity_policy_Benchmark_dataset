The EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework makes it easier for ICT manufacturers and  developers to serve the EU market. A unified certification framework across all of EU reduces  the effects a fragmented market has on the economy. To support the creation of certification  schemes under this framework the role of standardisation bodies is very important.  The SDOs (Standardisation Developing Organisations) will provide the necessary standards to  support the framework to be defined by ENISA under request from the European Commission.  There is a significant risk of creating inconsistent standards focused on vertical domains,  despite the fact that cybersecurity is highly transversal. There is a strong necessity to create  horizontal standards with a potential international coverage. The role of ENISA and its  involvement in Standardisation tasks is essential, creating a harmonized frame to develop such  standards.  Europe aims to be leading the cybersecurity certification and standardisation area for ICT  products, processes and services. The EU Cybersecurity Act is an opportunity to have a  harmonized market for cybersecurity. It brings a whole field of work, putting the consumers and  the citizens in the centre of businesses’ reflections and aims to improve EU cyber resilience and  response by building upon existing instruments provided by SDOs keeping networks and  information systems secure.  In this document, we present how valuable the cybersecurity standardisation efforts could be for  certification, what are the roles and responsibilities of SDOs in this context, and how  standardisation can support efficiently the process of certification schemes creation by following  a step by step methodology.  The methodology described in this study could be used as guidelines for new certification  scheme or standards authors. It will help setting up KPIs, useful for all stakeholders involved in  the preparation or operational phase of a certification scheme. The qualification system  proposed can be used also to define more precisely the requirements associated with the  different assurance levels mentioned in article 52 of the Cybersecurity Act. “Assurance levels of  European cybersecurity certification schemes”.  With regard to standardisation activities, we propose a set of recommendations for the  Standards Developing Organisations and the prospective authors of certification schemes:   The EU Union Rolling Work Program for standardisation should be aligned with the  Union Working Programme for certification, in order for the SDOs to provide  appropriate standards for the certification schemes   Horizontal standards (multi sectorial) for cybersecurity must be privileged in  cybersecurity evaluation but also in other domains as described in 3.1.   It is very important to avoid competition between SDOs. In the EU ESO’s cannot  develop overlapping EN (European Norms). A coordinated joint approach between  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  5  CEN, CENELEC and ETSI must be strongly encouraged and supported by the  European Commission through adequate standardisation requests.   When an international standard exists in a specific area and covers at least partially a  targeted domain, it must be the preferred choice for usage.   The competition and overlaps have to be carefully managed. The EU rolling plan can  be an appropriate coordination tool to synchronize cybersecurity evaluation framework  and associated standards.   The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 should be considered as the first reference for cybersecurity  standardization.   It is important to improve the cooperation between CEN CENELEC JTC13 and ETSI  TC Cyber and ensure that the majority of Cybersecurity standards and in particular in  cybersecurity evaluation will be developed in joint working groups. This will guarantee  that all relevant standardisation requests will be taken into account jointly.   The ISO/IEC 15408/18045 Common criteria and evaluation methods, IEC 62443-4-2  Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-2: Technical security  requirements for IACS components, EN 303-645 cybersecurity for consumer IOT can  constitute the basis for all cybersecurity evaluation. They do not overlap, nor compete  with each other, but can be seen as complementary. An introductory guide to the  usage should be developed for the creators of certification schemes.  The Standard Developing Organisations (especially European ones – CEN, CENELEC and  ETSI) have to interact in order to avoid overlapping contradictions or incompatibilities between  standards and certification schemes. ENISA should participate in the relevant committees (CEN  CENELEC JTC13 and ETSI TC CYBER as first priority), and encourage joint work between  CEN CENELEC and ETSI, especially for topics related to the EU Cybersecurity Act  implementation. To this aim, an interface mechanism between the Agency and the SDOs  should be created, allowing for quick access to information concerning the standards in the  certification areas under consideration.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA), which entered into force in June 2019, aims to establish a  European cybersecurity certification framework for ICT products, services and processes.  ENISA is participating in this new framework, by preparing candidate certification schemes on  the request from the European Commission or the European Cybersecurity Coordination Group  (representation of Member States).  Standardisation will play an important role in the framework, as the Act states the following:   Recital 54: There is a need for closer international cooperation to improve  cybersecurity standards, including the need for definitions of common norms of  behaviour, the adoption of codes of conduct, the use of international standards, and  information sharing, promoting swifter international collaboration in response to  network and information security issues and promoting a common global approach to  such issues.   Recital 69: The European cybersecurity certification schemes should be non-  discriminatory and based on international or European, unless those standards are  ineffective or inappropriate to fulfil the Union’s legitimate objectives in that regard.   Art. 52.4: The certificate or the EU statement of conformity shall refer to technical  specifications, standards and procedures related thereto   Art. 52.6: A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the  following elements:  o [..] references to the international, European or national standards applied in  the evaluation or, where such standards are not available or appropriate, to  technical specifications that meet the requirements  A general concept for the role of standards in the evaluation and certification process is  presented in the figure below.  Figure 1: Role of standards in the evaluation and certification process  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  7  Whenever a market needs to get regulated from cybersecurity perspective, it is essential to know:   what a product, service or process shall fulfil in terms of cybersecurity requirements,  and   how to check that this is the case with the appropriate level of assurance (depending on  the risk, the evaluation level targeted – basic, substantial, high –  and impact of a  potential attack).  However, this is not an easy task to implement. The challenge is that digital solutions are  developed, produced, deployed, used and maintained in very complex eco-systems across the  globe. Supply chains are very often not fully understood. Manufacturers of components, being  rather at the start of the supply chain, often have no visibility in which final product their  technology ends up (unless very specifically tailored for a use case). On the other hand, for  OEMs it is quite difficult or even impossible to know where a dedicated component (a small chip  embedded into the door of a car controlling the window) comes from. OEMs clearly know Tier 1  suppliers and maybe Tier 2. But further down the supply-chain the chance is very small to be  able to make a proper tracing.  Figure 2: Example of supply chain for digital solutions  Accordingly, it is very important that standardization and certification approaches are well  aligned across different industries when it comes to suppliers at the start of the supply-chain.  For example, manufacturers of micro-controllers usually deliver their chips into multiple sectors.  On the other hand, once the integration steps come close to a final product, the situation might  become very sector-specific. Therefore, it is essential to keep at least two views in mind:  1. The horizontal view: standards for basic technologies, such as micro-controllers,  whose final usage is not always clear, will most likely tend towards higher levels of  cybersecurity in terms of robustness against a broad range of attacks. Accordingly,  certification schemes used there need to be rather generic (e.g. ISO15408 – Common  sector agnostic (horizontal)  Sector  Agnostic  Sector  Specific  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  8  Criteria) than specific and act as building blocks for certification schemes tailored to  sectors.  2. The vertical (sectorial) view: standards in this case are typically very specific to the  sectorial needs. However, to be efficient it makes sense to have those standards built  on top of what the horizontal “catalogue” provides. This is also the case for certification  schemes. Certification schemes very specific to sectors (e.g. IEC62443) should make  use of horizontal (generic) schemes and recognize and build on top of those.  If these two views are not properly managed and considered, the industry will need extremely  high efforts to comply with standards and participate in the certification processes. A  manufacturer of a chip might need to run through many different certification schemes covering  the same or similar requirements. Hence, the intention of this document is to bring clarity for any  stakeholders impacted by the EU Cybersecurity Act when it comes to standardization in the  sense of what to fulfil from cybersecurity perspective and in terms of how this can be checked  accordingly with the appropriate level of cybersecurity assurance.  The remainder of this report is organized as follows: Section 22 summarizes the domains and  benefits of standardization. Afterwards, section 3 explains the roles of standardization bodies  followed by section 4, which provides a general description of what is a cybersecurity  certification scheme and how the standards support certification. Section 5 proposes a  structured methodology how the certification schemes can be drafted with support of  standardization. Finally, section 6 draws final conclusions and recommendations, including the  potential role of ENISA.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  9  2. THE SCOPE AND VALUE OF  CYBERSECURITY  STANDARDISATION  2.1 THE DOMAINS OF STANDARDISATION  Standardisation activities take place in international, national, and industry-based fora. Within  Europe, the three European Standards Organizations: CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate in  order to minimize the duplication of standards. Many technical committees have liaisons and co-  operation agreements within all the different technical standardisation committees. However,  there are many hundreds of technical committees within the standards community that work on  cybersecurity or have cybersecurity related work streams, and working in parallel. It has proved  to be difficult to coordinate these activities, in particular due to the different scopes covered by  the standardisation bodies and the lack of harmonisation between the terms and definitions  used. Even the term cybersecurity2 has different definitions and is often confused with IT  security.  The scope of cybersecurity includes the protection of complex environments, resulting from the  interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology – devices  and networks connected to it. This is the consequence of the global digital transformation. All  digital systems are concerned: IT of course, but also application domains, like healthcare,  energy, automotive, cloud computing, IoT, etc.  For these reasons cybersecurity is highly transversal. Improving cybersecurity is necessary for  all vertical domains.  The scope of cybersecurity is very broad and there are a high number of potential domains,  which are candidates for standardisation:   Information security management processes (ISMP):  to define criteria, methods to  guarantee the security of the management systems of a vendor, an operator, an end-  user. These processes cover the entire lifecycle till the end of life and not only the  development phase   Products, solutions and services design: to check cybersecurity functions against  risks and assess the functions and capabilities of products, solutions, services using  technical means like Cryptography, public key infrastructures, secure by design  principles, secure communications protocols,   Cybersecurity and certification evaluation criteria, evaluation methods, hardware  module evaluation, side channels attacks evaluation, random bit generators  evaluation,   Evaluation laboratories evaluation: people evaluation, development processes  evaluation, malware testing, penetration testing, static code analysis and binary  analysis.   Maintenance and operations of the cybersecurity: security operation centre  management, security operation centres indicators, vulnerability management,  vulnerabilities format,  2 Please see: Definition of Cybersecurity - Gaps and overlaps in standardisation, ENISA 2016,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/definition-of-cybersecurity  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/definition-of-cybersecurity  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  10   Standardizing stakeholder security procurement and subcontracting processes:  contract and subcontract management, product decommissioning and product  labelling, supply chain integrity and security, fraud and counterfeit management.  2.2 THE BENEFITS OF STANDARDISATION.  The benefits of standardisation in cybersecurity are clear and well known: Interoperability,  reusability, knowledge development and cybersecurity awareness, harmonisation of  terminology, consistency between different manufacturers, vendors and users, repeatability,  performance checking, security evaluation, supply chain integrity and security.  In the particular case of cybersecurity evaluation, on the one hand standardisation is necessary:  security risk evaluation, security target, protection profile, evaluation criteria, evaluation  methods, maintenance of cybersecurity certificates along the life cycle.  On the other hand,  consistency between evaluations performed by different laboratories is a key issue. For  example,tandards must be developed to support the evaluation of the evaluator, peer review  management, etc. Standardisation is likely to warrant the necessary consistency of  cybersecurity evaluation all over the EU and potentially worldwide, in order to create a  harmonised cybersecurity worldwide market. The main objective being to guarantee that any  evaluation of cybersecurity made in any of the EU member state is valuable and accepted for all  EU Member States, and that there is no need to carry out multiple evaluations.  Another important point is that evaluation under the cybersecurity security certification  framework will also introduce new requirements, for example, different assurance levels (basic,  substantial and high) to cover different risk analysis. It is very important to be able to certify  products, solutions and services at a level that is consistent with risks to be mitigated, but also  taking into account the market needs (cost, time and performance to be achieved). The cost of  evaluation cannot and must not be the same between nuclear, space or defence devices, and  simple Internet-connected thermometers of an in-house weather forecast station; but instead it  must be commensurate with the purpose the target of evaluation, serves. Impact of eventual  cyberattacks will be considerably different in the given examples. It is very important to be able  to fine-tune the cyber security evaluation according to the risk evaluation. This will need to be  standardised as well, considering operational use and lifecycle management  For these reasons there is need to define and standardise cybersecurity evaluation criteria and  evaluation methods.  Due to the transversal nature of cybersecurity, standardisation is a solution to avoid the creation  of multiple cybersecurity evaluation frameworks according to different vertical sectors –  automotive, healthcare, Cloud infrastructure, IoT, 5G, energy, etc. It is important to reuse  standards to serve a multi-sectorial approach. Consistency across vertical sectors will assure  minimum viable expectations for cybersecurity and will support greater uptake and adoption.  There are high risks associated with vertical domains developing their own set of cybersecurity  evaluation of standards for many reasons:   Ignorance of the existing standard base,   Intended willingness to simplify what is perceived as too complex,   Perceived specificity of the considered industrial domain,   Low knowledge base of the stakeholders.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  11  3. THE ROLE OF  STANDARDISATION BODIES  3.1 ASPECTS OF STANDARDISATION BODIES  Standardisation bodies have different scopes and governance. The section hereinafter  concisely presents them.  3.1.1 International level SDOs:  ISO, IEC, ITU, under UN governance are recognized by the standardisation community as  international standard organisations (SDO). These organisations are potentially addressing all  domains. The members of these SDOs are registered national bodies (NB). They are mostly  working on a consensus basis, but voting is an exceptional case, in which the principle chosen  is “one member one vote”. That is to say that each state has the same weight in a vote,  whatever the size of the country. Generally, standards published are available for a fee.  3.1.2 The EU level  In the EU there are three recognized standardization bodies: CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI. These  ESOs (European standardization organizations) are partly funded by the European Union.  CEN and CENELEC function in a similar manner to ISO and IEC, the membership is also  assured through national bodies. They have an increasingly more integrated functioning through  CCMC (CEN CENELEC Management Centre). The published standards are generally not free.  ETSI has a different governance organization from CEN and CENELEC. Membership is  assured via individual registration from companies coming from all the Member States. The  membership fee is paid on a voluntary basis and the number of votes is proportional to the  annual fee cost. There are regulations and governance mechanisms in place, in order to avoid  the majority shared by only a few members. There is also a national representation for the  European matters (like European standards ballots).  One important point is that ETSI standards and all technical reports and technical specifications  are available free of charge. This guarantees a high acceptance of standards worldwide.  3.1.3 Ad hoc standardisation bodies  In addition to the official international or European standardization bodies, there are other  entities working in specific and focused domains, for example industrial fora like 3GPP, CSA,  Fido Alliance, Global platform, IEEE, IETF, AIOTI, one M2M, TCG, Oasis etc.  These industrial bodies have different ways of functioning depending on their scope,  participation and coverage, but they intend to cover specific requirements from industry and  claim to be more efficient than traditional SDOs. Nevertheless, they do not have the official  recognition that the international SDOs have. However, the international SDOs have defined  specific procedures to import the de facto standards from these organisations, like PAS (publicly  available specifications), or so-called fast track mechanisms. This approach proved to be very  useful, as a good example we can note ISO 27000, which was created as BS 7799 and  transposed to an ISO/IEC standard using a fast track procedure.  It can be noted that national standardisation bodies are also producing high value standards,  like for example the US NIST – National Institute of Standards and Technology. One of the  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  12  NIST standards, the FIPS 140-2, has been taken as a basis to develop ISO/IEC 19790 –  Cryptographic module evaluation. This ISO/IEC standard became afterwards the reference for  the revision 3 of the FIPS 140.  3.1.4 Transposition of standards  In order to authorize exchange and transfer of standards between International and European  SDO’s, mechanisms of transposition have been put in place (Dresden, Frankfurt and Vienna  agreements), authorizing to transpose standards from one standardisation body to another  without restarting all work from scratch. It is possible, for example, to transpose an IS  (International standard) to an EN (European standard) to be referred to in European regulations,  or to transpose an EN in an IS in order to make it applicable worldwide.  The Vienna Agreement, signed in 1991, was drawn-up with the aim of preventing duplication of  efforts and reducing time when preparing standards. As a result, new standards projects are  jointly planned between CEN and ISO. Wherever appropriate, priority is given to the  cooperation with ISO, provided that the international standards meet the EU legislative and  market requirements, and that non-EU global players also implement these standards.  CENELEC enjoys close cooperation with its international counterpart, the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). In order to facilitate a consensus-finding process between  European and international standards development activities in the electrical sector, CENELEC  and IEC formalized the framework of their cooperation through the signature in 1996 of an  “agreement on common planning of new work and parallel voting”, known as the Dresden  Agreement.  After 20 years of a fruitful partnership, this has resulted in a very high level of technical  alignment (close to 80% of CENELEC standards are identical to or based on IEC publications).  CENELEC and IEC have reconfirmed their longstanding cooperation on 17 October 2016, by  signing the Frankfurt Agreement. Building on the experience of both partners, this new  agreement preserves the spirit and approach conveyed by the Dresden Agreement, in particular  the strategic commitment of CENELEC to support the primacy of international standardization. It  includes several updates aiming at simplifying the parallel voting processes and increasing the  traceability of international standards adopted in Europe thanks to a new referencing system.  3.1.5 Overlaps in standards  Cybersecurity standardisation activities take place in international, national, and industry-based  fora. Within the EU, the three European Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI  cooperate to try to minimize the amount of duplication of standards. Many groups have liaisons  and cooperation agreements within each other. Unfortunately, common understanding between  these groups has proven to be difficult.  There are many examples of duplication of work between standards organizations. Without  mentioning concrete examples, we can state that it can lead to at least duplication of efforts,  and in the worst case in the inconsistent sets of standards, which is harmful for industry, as  potential users of the standard. In addition, the relation of cybersecurity groups with other  security domains (societal security, physical security etc.) is not sufficiently addressed.  We can note the recent creation (2019) within CEN and CENELEC of a cybersecurity sectorial  forum in order to address this gap. This forum has identified 14 primarily relevant  standardisation bodies for cybersecurity within CEN and CENELEC, for which improved  collaboration is necessary:   CEN/CLC/JTC 4 Services for fire safety and security systems   CEN/CLC/JTC 8 Privacy management in products and services  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  13   CEN/CLC/JTC 13 Cyber security and data protection   CEN/TC 72 Fire detection and fire alarm systems   CLC/TC 79 Alarm systems   CEN/TC 79 Respiratory protective devices   CEN/TC 162 Protective clothing including hand and arm protection and lifejackets   CEN/TC 164 Water Supply   CEN/TC 192 Fire and rescue service equipment   CEN/TC 234 Gas Infrastructure   CEN/TC 263 Secure storage of cash, valuables and data media   CEN/TC 325 Crime prevention through building, facility and area design   CEN/TC 391 Societal and citizen security   CEN/TC 439 Private security services  One the first tasks identified by the forum was to align terminology between all these groups  and identify existing overlapping standards.  3.2 STANDARDISATION BODIES INVOLVED IN CYBERSECURITY  There is a plethora of bodies involved in cybersecurity standardisation, here we name the most  important:   ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection.  o This standardisation committee develops International standards for  information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection. They have  produced over 150 standards, including generic methods, techniques and  guidelines to address both, security and privacy aspects, such as:   Security requirements capture methodology;   Management of information and ICT security; in particular  information security management systems (ISMS), security  processes, security controls and services: ISO/IEC 270XX family;   Cryptographic and other security mechanisms, including but not  limited to mechanisms for protecting the accountability, availability,  integrity and confidentiality of information, ISO/IEC 18033, ISO/IEC  29192, ISO/IEC 10118, ISO/IEC 15946;   Security management support documentation including terminology,  guidelines as well as procedures for the registration of security  components;   Security aspects of identity management, biometrics and privacy like  ISO/IEC 24761, ISO/IEC 24745, ISO/IEC 24760, ISO/IEC  29100/29101, ISO/IEC 27101;   Conformance assessment, accreditation and auditing requirements  in the area of information security;   Security evaluation criteria and methodology ISO/IEC 15408/18045  known as Common Criteria, and also ISO/IEC 19790/24759 Security  module evaluation.   CEN CENELEC JTC13 Cybersecurity and Data Protection  o This committee develops standards for data protection, information protection  and security techniques with specific focus on cybersecurity covering all  concurrent aspects of the evolving information society, including:   Organizational frameworks and methodologies, including IT  management systems   Data protection and privacy guidelines   Processes and products evaluation schemes   ICT security and physical security technical guidelines  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  14   Smart technology, objects, distributed computing devices, data  services  o JTC13 recognizes the value of International standards and intends to reuse  as much as possible existing standards. JTC13 will identify and possibly  adopt standards already available or under development, which could support  the EU Digital Single Market, EU legal acts and standardization requests. If  required, these standards will be complemented by Technical Reports (TR)  and Technical Specifications. Special attention will be paid to ISO/IEC JTC 1  standards and in particular SC27 (see above), but is not be limited to this  group. Other SDOs and international bodies are also considered, such as  ISO, IEC, ITU-T, IEEE, NIST or industrial fora.  o For the identified standards, mentioned above, two options are considered:   Direct adoption as European Norms (EN), using Vienna or Frankfurt  agreements;   Adoption as EN with additional/complementary requirements, for  example in order to fulfil the EU legal requirements.  o The list of already transposed standards is available at the committee’s web  page3.  o CEN CENELEC JTC13 is also organizing in coordination with ETSI TC Cyber  dedicated events on cybersecurity standardisation, with the support of CCMC  (CEN CENELEC management centre) and ENISA   ETSI TC CYBER  o the ETSI TC CYBER (Cybersecurity) intends to cover:   Cyber Security Standardization from a generic point of view   Security of infrastructures, devices, services and protocols   Security advice, guidance and operational security requirements to  users, manufacturers and network and infrastructure operators   Security tools and techniques to ensure security   Creation of security specifications and alignment with work done in  other Technical Committees and International Study Groups  o It coordinates work with external groups such as the CEN/CENELEC JTC13,  the NIS Platform and ENISA.

The main standards used currently for cybersecurity evaluation are:   ISO/IEC 15408/18045 – Common criteria and evaluation methods.  These standards are under important revision at ISO/IEC  JTC1/SC27 level   IEC 62443-4-2 – Security for industrial automation and control  systems Part 4-2: Technical security requirements for IACS  components   EN 303-645 – Cybersecurity for consumer IoT, which is a standard  originally developed by ETSI and now managed under a joint  agreement by ETSI CEN CENELEC. This a good example of future  collaboration.  These three sets of standards can constitute the basis for a broad range of cybersecurity  evaluations. While they do not overlap with each other they are complementary with each other.  This has been for example identified in the domain of Industrial automated control systems  (IACS). Nevertheless, due to their complexity, identifying unique application domains of each of  these standards is not an easy task. However, such work should be performed in order to  facilitate the understanding and the reference in the development of upcoming cybersecurity  evaluation framework and in order to avoid to reinvent the wheel and redevelop new standards.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  16  4. CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  A cybersecurity certification of ICT products, processes or services (hereinafter the “target”4 of a  cybersecurity certification Scheme) is the provision of assessment and attestation that fulfilment  of specified security requirements has been demonstrated. It is carried out by Conformity  Assessment Bodies (CABs) in coordination with the vendors and service providers, who are  commonly requested to provide evidence in a transparent manner reflecting the level of  security. The CAB (evaluator) is expected to review this evidence and conduct applicable  conformity assessment activities (design review, source code review, security functional testing,  penetration testing, etc.) and generates an evaluation report which will be reviewed by the CAB  (certifier) before taking the decision to grant a certificate if the requirements are satisfied.  4.1 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE OF THE CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  European cybersecurity certification schemes5 constitute an important element in the new EU  Cybersecurity Certification Framework for ICT products, services and processes introduced by  the Cybersecurity Act.  The purpose is to ensure that the ICT product, process or service certified under one of these  new cybersecurity certification schemes, complies with specified requirements supported by  standardization organizations and the industry. This should help ensure the  protection of the  availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted or processed data  or the related functions or services offered by, or accessible via ICT products throughout their  life cycle.  The certificate issued by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) will attest that an  ICT product, process or service has been certified in accordance with such a scheme and that it  complies with the specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be  recognised in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for  purchasers to understand the security features of the product.  4.2 CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION SCHEME OWNER  The main responsibility of the Certification Scheme Owner is to maintain and update the  Certification Scheme accordingly. It should operate within an industrial consortium composed of  relevant Certification Scheme users.  The Certification Scheme Owner should be responsible for the objectives, the content and the  integrity of the scheme, and must be able to:   Maintain the scheme and provide guidance when required.   Set up a structure for the operation and management of the scheme.   Document the content of the scheme.  4 In Common Criteria, this is called a Target of Evaluation or a TOE.  5 An adopted European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme is a systematic organisation covering Evaluation  and Certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes under the authority of ENISA to ensure  that high standards of competence and impartiality are maintained, and that consistency is achieved during  the whole certification process.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  17   Ensure that the scheme is developed by persons competent in both technical and  conformity assessment aspects.   Make arrangements to protect the confidentiality of information provided by the parties  involved in the scheme.   Evaluate and manage the risks/liabilities arising from its activities.  4.3 CORE COMPONENTS OF A CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  SCHEME  According to Article 54 of the EU Cybersecurity Act, a candidate for the EU cybersecurity  certification schemes must contain a list of elements (see annexes). Among these elements, the  following three areas are necessary to build the core components of a cybersecurity certification  scheme:   A Technical Specification of Security Requirements for the target   A specification of approved evaluation methods for the auditor / evaluators in charge of  assessing the targeted ICT product, process or service   The specification of requirements for bodies certifying the targeted ICT products,  processes or services  When applicable, these three core elements are defined by standardization bodies. Otherwise,  they could be specifically defined during the creation of the cybersecurity certification scheme.  The content and purpose of each component are described below.  4.3.1 Technical Specification of Security Requirements for the ICT  product, process or service  This document contains the collection of technical requirements describing the desired  cybersecurity behaviour expected for the target covered by the certification scheme  4.3.2 Assessment Methodology  This document presents a set of validation procedures required to assess the target against the  technical specification requirements identified previously. It defines “How” the evaluator should  validate the target to prove the required level of security assurance. This mainly covers the  following aspects:   Definition of the concept of evaluation methodology (docs review, vulnerability  assessment, test procedures, Automation, Robustness, etc.)   Definition of the concept of composition methodology (if applicable)   Definition of the expected evaluation results (report, label, etc.)  4.3.3 Specification of requirements for Conformity Assessment  This document describes the requirements on bodies certifying the target products, processes  or services and defines all the policies and processes that govern the certification scheme.6  This will cover at least the following items:   Planning and Preparation (scope definition, etc.)   Application Procedure   Evaluation Process   Certificate Issuance  6 For facilitation purposes this document can be based on the international standard ISO/IEC 17065:2012  Conformity assessment - Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  18   Certificate Maintenance (life-cycle management, status, delta, upgrade, derivative,  etc.)   Vulnerability Disclosure, Patching & Assurance Maintenance   Program Management (CABs accreditation policy, surveillance, conflict, roles and  responsibilities, etc.)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  19  VALIDATION AND FORMAL ADOPTION OF THE CERTIFICATION SCHEME  STANDARIZATION ORGANIZATIONS CERTIFICATION BODIES  PREPARATION OF MISSING REQUIREMENTS  Technical Specification of  Requirements  Evaluation Methods Conformity Assessment  GAP ANALISYS  Technical Specification of  Requirements  Evaluation Methods Conformity Assessment  IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING RELATED STANDARDS  Technical Specification of  Requirements  Evaluation Methods Conformity Assessment  DEFINITION OF THE SECURITY OBJECTIVES  5. STANDARDISATION IN  SUPPORT OF CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION  As previously stated, there is a clear fundamental value for certification from cybersecurity  standardization. It is necessary to set up a close relationship and a practical coordination with  SDOs allowing a functional and efficient use of standards in support of certification.  Coordination should be based on a clear procedure and a methodology allowing to  communicate efficiently with SDOs and to study in a transparent and harmonised manner the  public specifications while creating a new certification scheme.  This section proposes an approach how to build a certification scheme, with fluent coordination  with SDOs. More specifically, we define the steps to be followed, covering the definition of the  security objectives and involving the industry stakeholders:   the identification and classification of existing relevant standards   a structured gap analysis methodology based on pre-defined qualification criteria   the preparation of the final set of documentation filling the gaps   the formal validation and adoption of the new certification scheme.  5.1 STEPS DEFINING A NEW CERTIFICATION SCHEME  The following diagram describe the drafting process and the different steps needed to develop a  new certification scheme  Figure 3:  Steps defining a new certification scheme  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  20  The procedures to develop in each stage is detailed in the following sections.  5.1.1 Stage 1. Definition of the security objectives  At this stage, the Certification Scheme Owner must identify the security objectives in  coordination with the relevant industry stakeholders7. The security objectives are expected to be  abstract statements, which in a formal way define the scope and the security properties that the  target ICT product, ICT process or ICT service is intended to address.  The statements must concisely express the intended solution to the identified security problem.  This could be a combination of assets, threats, policies and assumptions.  The method used to identify the security objectives could rely on existing standards defining a  risk analysis approach such as ISO 27005, ISO 31000, EBIOS, MEHARI, e-IoT-SCS, Magerit,  OCTAVE, etc.  5.1.2 Stage 2. Identification of the relevant standards in place  The Certification Scheme Owner must reach out to Standard Organizations to identify relevant  standards covering the three main areas of the Certification Scheme:  5.1.2.1 Technical Specification of Requirements  The Standards Organization shall identify existing standards, specifying the technical  requirements to meet the security objectives identified at Stage 1 for the target ICT product,  process or service.  In addition, these requirements must cover “What” the vendor or service provider is supposed to  provide as evidence proving a complete coverage of the security functional requirements.   Inputs: Security Objectives (Stage 1)   Outputs: List of applicable Standard Technical Specification or Requirements  5.1.2.2 Evaluation Methods  The Standards Organization shall identify existing standards specifying evaluation methods to  assess the target against the technical specification of requirements identified previously.   Inputs: List of relevant Standard Technical Specification of Requirements   Outputs: Inputs: List of applicable Standard Evaluation Methods  5.1.2.3 Conformity Assessment  Standards Organizations and Notification Bodies shall identify existing standards providing  guidance to Certification Bodies who wish to evaluate the conformity of target against the  technical specification requirements identified previously.   Inputs: List of relevant Standard Technical Specification of Requirements   Outputs: Inputs: List of applicable Conformity Assessment specification  5.1.3 Stage 3. GAP Analysis.  7 We strongly recommend at this stage involving regulatory organizations and all relevant authority  implementing / using the certification scheme in a specific market  to express the security risks acceptance  and help in prioritizing the security objectives  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  21  During this stage, the Certification Scheme Owner is expected to qualify the selected applicable  standards for each of the three areas and then identify missing areas to complete the coverage  of all the contents described in the certification scheme.  5.1.3.1 Qualification of the existing standards  The measure of the quality in the cybersecurity evaluation and certification process is a  paramount aspect to develop better and more efficient certification schemes that could at the  end build trust by providing transparent and objective information to consumers and citizens  about the level of cybersecurity of ICT products, services or processes  At the date of publication of the present report, a standardized system that could be used for  qualifying the standards used in cybersecurity evaluation / certification does not exist. Due to  the lack of this standard, this paper presents an initial proposal for a Qualification System for  Security Certification Schemes.  Annex A describes the main components of a Qualification System and include an example with  an initial proposal8 for qualification criteria and a scoring system that can be used to qualify  cybersecurity certification schemes  Classification system for the Certification schemes.  In addition to the parameters above and in order to qualify the certification scheme, the  following includes a classification system for the certification schemes prepared with the aim to  clarify and make easier the comparison process between them.  This classification system is not intended to qualify but rather to classify certification schemes in  order to have a more objective comparison. It is expected to be used upfront of any qualification  activity.  The Annex B includes a table with the proposed classification system for the cybersecurity  certification schemes  5.1.3.2 Identification of missing requirements  This step is required to ensure that technical specification of requirements (identified at Stage 2)  working together meet the objectives proposed for the Certification Scheme (mandated by the  EU)  The Certification Scheme Owner is expected to run first a gap analysis on each of the three  main parts of the scheme described above.  8 Note: The qualification system defined in this paper, shall be understood just as an initial proposal for  having a high level measure of the quality and the efficiency of the different certification schemes that will be  developed in the framework of the Cybersecurity Act.  A further development of the qualification system shall be done improving the formalism and the alignment  with the assurance structures of the actual standards used in cybersecurity evaluation and certification.  The authors of this study strongly recommend the international cooperation of Standardization  Organizations and ENISA in the further development of guidance documents for the qualification system to  ensure a general acceptance of the criteria and the procedures defined.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  22  5.1.4 Stage 4.  Preparation of the final set of documentation with missing  requirements   Request the SDOs and/or Certification Bodies to prepare a dedicated and complete  specification of requirements for the Certification Scheme.   Qualification of the final Certification Scheme in the terms of the Criteria used in stage  3 in order to make comparable certification Schemes  5.1.5 Stage 5. Validation and formal adoption of the Certification  Scheme.   Validation of the modified technical specification of requirements by the SDOs and the  National Bodies (Formal adoption of the modified standards, with the new  requirements… new standard or updating the old one)   Formal adoption in ENISA of the final set of documents for the Certification Scheme.

CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  As the EU has been leading the cybersecurity certification and standardisation area for ICT  products, processes and services, the EU Cybersecurity Act presents an opportunity to have a  harmonized market for security. It brings a whole field of work, putting the consumers and the  citizens in the centre of businesses’ reflections and aims to improve EU cyber resilience and  response by building upon existing instruments provided by SDOs keeping networks and  information systems secure.  The EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework makes it easier for ICT manufacturers and  developers to serve the EU market. A unified certification framework across all of EU reduces  the effects a fragmented market has on the economy. To support the creation of certification  schemes under this framework the role of SDOs is very important.  In this document, we presented how valuable the cybersecurity standardisation efforts could be  for certification, what are the roles and responsibilities of SDOs in this context, and how  standardisation can support efficiently the process of certification schemes creation by following  a step by step methodology.  Building robust and sustainable certification schemes is not an easy task. It will require  cooperation from a vast number of industries, SDOs and policymakers. However, the following  recommendations can eventually reduce the risks of failure. Taking it one recommendation at a  time is possible, as long as we understand what should come first: The higher accuracy defining  the object of the cybersecurity certification (the target), the better option to define precise and  detailed specification of security requirements (and by direct application higher assurance level  for the certification scheme and higher trust levels for consumers)  The criteria listed for the qualification and classification system could be used as guidelines for  new certification scheme or standards authors. It will help setting up KPIs useful for all  stakeholders involved in the preparation or operational phase of a certification scheme.  The qualification system proposed can be used also to define more precisely the requirements  associated to the different assurance levels mentioned in the article 52 of the Cybersecurity Act.  “Assurance levels of European cybersecurity certification schemes”.  With regard to standardisation activities, we propose a set of recommendations for the  Standards Developing Organisations and the prospective authors of certification schemes:   The EU Union Rolling Work Program for standardisation should be aligned with the  Union Working Programme for certification, in order for the SDOs to provide  appropriate standards for the certification schemes   Horizontal standards (multi sectorial) for cybersecurity must be privileged in  cybersecurity evaluation but also in other domains as described in 3.1.   It is very important to avoid competition between SDOs. In the EU ESO’s cannot  develop overlapping EN (European Norms). A coordinated joint approach between  CEN, CENELEC and ETSI must be strongly encouraged and supported by the  European Commission through adequate standardisation requests.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  24   When an international standard exists in a specific area and covers at least partially a  targeted domain, it must be the preferred choice for usage.   The competition and overlaps have to be carefully managed. The EU rolling plan can  be an appropriate coordination tool to synchronize cybersecurity evaluation framework  and associated standards.   The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 should be considered as the first reference for cybersecurity  standardization.   It is important to improve the cooperation between CEN CENELEC JTC13 and ETSI  TC Cyber and ensure that the majority of Cybersecurity standards and in particular in  cybersecurity evaluation will be developed in joint working groups. This will guarantee  that all relevant standardisation requests will be taken into account jointly.   The ISO/IEC 15408/18045 Common criteria and evaluation methods, IEC 62443-4-2  Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-2: Technical security  requirements for IACS components, EN 303-645 cybersecurity for consumer IOT can  constitute the basis for all cybersecurity evaluation. They do not overlap, nor compete  with each other, but can be seen as complementary. An introductory guide to the  usage should be developed for the creators of certification schemes.  As stated above, the SDO’s and mainly ESOs (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) have to interact in  order to avoid overlapping contradictions or incompatibilities between standards and  certification schemes. ENISA should participate in the relevant work (CEN CENELEC JTC13  and ETSI TC CYBER as first priority), and encourage joint work between CEN CENELEC and  ETSI, especially for topics related to the EU Cybersecurity Act implementation. To this aim, an  interface mechanism between the Agency and the SDOs should be created, allowing for quick  access to information concerning the standards in the certification areas under consideration.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  25  A ANNEX: QUALIFICATION  SYSTEM FOR  CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  Following is detailed an example of proposal of a qualification system for cybersecurity  certification schemes.  The qualification system consist of two main parts:  1. The Identification of a suitable set of parameters for qualifying the quality of a  certification scheme.  2. The definition of a scoring system for:  a. Quantifying each parameter and expressing it numerically with the aim to  make it measurable (and comparable).  b. Pondering the different parameters according to their individual contribution  level to meet the quality objectives of the certification scheme  Following sections describes in detail the different components of the qualification system  proposed  1. QUALIFICATION CRITERIA (PARAMETERS AND SCORING RANK)  This section present an initial proposal of the criteria that can be used to qualify each one of the  components of the certification schemes  1.1. Qualification Criteria for the Technical Specification of Requirements  (TSR)  Definition process of the target of the certification   Accuracy level determining the target of the certification  Accuracy level in the definition of the cybersecurity requirements is determined by the level of  precision identifying the product where applicable.

The target of the certification is a generic category of product, process or services  with a defined list of the component elements or the architecture of the system  3  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is MEDIUM.  The target of the certification is a determined type of product, process or with a  defined list of the component elements or the architecture of the system  4  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is MEDIUM-HIGH.  The target of the certification is a specific product, process or services  5  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is HIGH.

The definition process of the desired level of cybersecurity for a target is a risk assessment  process weighting the potential threats and impacts for a determined intended usage of the  target. (Different security levels can be defined for different conditions and environment of use  of the target)  The desired security level is estimated by weighting the potential threats and impacts for a  determined intended usage of the target. (Different security levels can be defined for different  conditions and environment of use of the target)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  27  Accuracy level defining the cybersecurity objectives for target of the certification  Definition of the security objectives (expected security behaviour of the target) is the most  relevant aspect to determine with precision what can be considered an appropriated level of  security for the target.  The security objectives for a target can be expressed in terms of:  A determined security behaviour of the target in a determined environment (expected  use of the target)  The resistance level of the target against specific attack methods  The higher accuracy defining the security objectives for the target, the better capacities to  determine with precision and effectiveness the minimum cybersecurity requirements needed to  achieve the desired cybersecurity behaviour of the target.

Qualification Criteria for the Assessment Methodology  Definition process of the assessment methodology  Assessment methodology is one of the most relevant component in a certification scheme  determining the level of objectivity in the evaluation process.  Assessment tasks include in some cases discretional procedures as including the expert  opinion of a qualified evaluator in a specific question. These discretional processes are more  often present in most advanced evaluations areas as vulnerability analysis or penetration  testing.   Criteria used for qualifying the objectivity level of the evaluation methodology:  o The objectivity level of the evaluation methodology can be modulated trough  different parameters or conditions which are applicable globally to the  evaluation methodology itself or individually to specific evaluations  procedures.  o Following are described some parameters that can be used for qualifying the  cybersecurity evaluation methodologies or the individual evaluation  procedures:   Assessment Style   Third-Independent-Party Assessment   Self-Assessment with double review by different internal  teams   Self-Assessment   Use evidence formalism (using a formal and structured language for  specification of technical requirements and evaluation procedures)   Yes (CC, others)   Partially (CC + Natural Language)   No (Natural Language)   Produce comparable results   Yes  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  31   Partially   No   Objectivity level (associated to individual evaluation procedures)   1 (low) to 3 (high)  Table 4: Value Rank  Objectivity  level  Level description  1  The evaluation procedure is highly dependent on the discretional  assessment of the evaluation team  2  The evaluation procedure is dependent on the discretional assessment of  the evaluation team, but the procedure is modulated by the use of external  qualifications requirements as technical knowledge of evaluators, years of  experience, use of specific tools, etc.  3  The evaluation procedure is non-dependent on discretional assessments  and always produce repeatable but not and comparable results  1.3. Qualification Criteria for the Conformity Assessment of the  Certification Scheme  Conformity Assessment is one of the most relevant components in a certification scheme  contributing to ensure the independency and the quality of the works done by the evaluator  teams.  The rigorousness level in the specification of requirements for the conformity assessment will  determine also the quality level of the certification process  Below are described some parameters that can be used for qualifying the conformity  assessment procedures:  Market Surveillance   Surveillance audits in certified products  o Number of surveillance audits in certified products conducted by the CB,  ensuring that the certified products and the manufacturer remain in  compliance with the certification program and the published standard(s) under  which the product is certified  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  o Value Rank:  Number of Surveillance Audits (SA)   SA< 2% of certified products: LOW   2%<SA< 5% of certified products: MEDIUM   SA>5% of certified products: HIGH   Public records of certificate metadata  o A metadata certificate service allows to store (in a centralized or de-  centralized way) properties related to the certified product such as the  certification validity, scope, attestation, level of certification, etc.  o These allows a service provider or a user to set up online cybersecurity  policies allowing to authorize/accept a certified product.  o Scoring System: Available YES / NO  Laboratories Surveillance   Random Evaluations (RE)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  32  o Random evaluations with reference samples verifying the results obtained by  the evaluation laboratory.  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  o Value Rank: Percentage of accredited labs audited per year by the CB with a  RE   Audited Labs < 2%:  LOW   2% < Audited  Labs < 5%: MEDIUM   Audited Labs >5%: HIGH   Round Robin Evaluations for inter-comparison  (RRE)  o Number of round robin tests conducted in different evaluations labs verifying  comparable results are obtained  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  o Value Rank: Percentage of accredited labs audited per year by the CB with a  RRE   Audited Labs < 2%:  LOW   2% < Audited  Labs < 5%: MEDIUM   Audited Labs >5%: HIGH   Capacity level to maintain updated knowledge at the state of the art of the security  (State-of –the-art Attack Methods and security requirements )  o Procedures in the Certification Bodies ensuring an updated and shared  knowledge between the evaluation labs of the state-of the-the-art Attack  Methods and security countermeasures  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  Table 5: Value Rank  Procedures maintaining  an state-of-the-art shared  knowledge in security  Level description  1  Not specific procedures are in place in the Certification Bodies for maintain  an updated knowledge at the state-of-the-art of the security.  The technical specification of security requirements include all needed  knowledge for conducting the evaluation.  SDOs as owners of the TSRs,  are in charge of maintaining the state of the art of the security requirement  by periodical updates of the International Standards in the basis of the  certification scheme  2  The state of the art in the security requirements for target of the  certification is maintained by the Certification Body based in public  sources of information, such as newspapers, public vulnerability  databases, etc.  3  The Certification Body include in his organization specific working groups  of technical experts structuring the state-of-the-art security evaluation  knowledge for the evaluation laboratories and the Certification scheme  a) Verification process of the technical knowledge of Laboratories  Procedures in place in the Certification Bodies to verify the technical qualification of the  Laboratories and the evaluators  Scoring System:   1 (low) to 3 (high)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  33  Value Rank:   LOW: Technical Qualification of the evaluation labs are granted by the general  procedures of ISO 17025. Not specific procedures are in place by the certification body  to verify the technical knowledge of the evaluation labs.   MEDIUM: Evaluation Labs are in charge of the technical qualification of their  evaluators and the evidence of the qualification is sent to the Certification Bodies   HIGH Formal procedures are in place by the Certification Body for auditing the  technical qualification of the laboratories and the evaluators. Technical qualification is  periodically audited by the CB.  2. SCORING SYSTEM  2.1. Quantification system for the qualification criteria  A quantification system shall be defined expressing numerically the different values that the  qualification criteria (parameters) can have.  Quantification system assign a value rank for each one of the different parameters used in this  qualification system. (An example of the scoring rank proposed for each parameter is included  in the previous section in order to facilitate the readability of the text)  2.2. Ponderation system and final score  A ponderation system shall be established defining the individual contribution level of each  parameter addressing the quality objectives of the certification scheme.  Ponderation system is also used as calculation method of total score of the qualification system,  as expressed in the next formula:  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =∝∗ 𝑃1 + 𝛽𝑃2 + ⋯ + 𝛾𝑃𝑛  Where α, β,γ, etc. are the ponderation rates and P1... Pn the qualification parameters  The total score will measure the quality level associated to each certification scheme and  indirectly can be used as a measure of the level of assurances and trust that would offer to  consumers and citizens.  For simplification purposes, a simple table can be used for qualifying a certification scheme  instead using the mathematical expression described above.  An example of a table describing a complete scoring system for a certification scheme is shown  below:  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  34  Table 6: Example of scoring system  Component  of the  certification  scheme  Nº  Qualification  parameters  Quantification system  Scoring rank  Assurance level value  (over 500 points)  Technical specification of security requirements  Object of the  certification  1  Accuracy Level  defining the  Scope of the  target  1 (Poor definition) to 5 (Highly  detailed)  (25)  5 per level  2  Use specific  Security  Profile/Protection  Profile for each  single type of  products  YES /NO  (10)  10 / 0  3  Operational  Environment  Consideration  YES / PARTIALLY / NO  (10)  10 / 5 / 0  4  Composition  certification  allowed  YES /NO  (5)  5 / 0  5  Other Schemes  Evidence Re-use  allowed  YES /NO  (5)  5 / 0  Security  Objectives  for the target  6  Definition Level  of the Security  Objectives  1 (Poor definition) to 5 (Highly  detailed)  25  (5 per level)  7  A process is in  place for defining  the Security  objectives of the  target  YES /NO  (10)  10 / 0  8  Security  objectives  consider the  different security  attributes (CIA)  for individual  components /  information used  in the target  YES /NO  (10)  10 / 0  9  Different security  objectives are  defined for  different cases of  use of the target  # NO  # YES  # YES up to 3  # Yes up to 5  (15)  0 / 5 / 10 / 15  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  35  10  Security  Objectives are  properly defined  through a risk  assessment  procedure  # NO  # YES  # YES and the risk appetite is clearly  defined, expressing what is covered  and what is not in the security  objectives  # YES and the risk appetite is clearly  defined, for each intended usage  scenario  (25)  0/10/15/ 25  Evaluation  areas  covered by  the TSR  11  Documentation  review  # NO  # Yes.

The EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework makes it easier for ICT manufacturers and  developers to serve the EU market. A unified certification framework across all of EU reduces  the effects a fragmented market has on the economy. To support the creation of certification  schemes under this framework the role of standardisation bodies is very important.  The SDOs (Standardisation Developing Organisations) will provide the necessary standards to  support the framework to be defined by ENISA under request from the European Commission.  There is a significant risk of creating inconsistent standards focused on vertical domains,  despite the fact that cybersecurity is highly transversal. There is a strong necessity to create  horizontal standards with a potential international coverage. The role of ENISA and its  involvement in Standardisation tasks is essential, creating a harmonized frame to develop such  standards.  Europe aims to be leading the cybersecurity certification and standardisation area for ICT  products, processes and services. The EU Cybersecurity Act is an opportunity to have a  harmonized market for cybersecurity. It brings a whole field of work, putting the consumers and  the citizens in the centre of businesses’ reflections and aims to improve EU cyber resilience and  response by building upon existing instruments provided by SDOs keeping networks and  information systems secure.  In this document, we present how valuable the cybersecurity standardisation efforts could be for  certification, what are the roles and responsibilities of SDOs in this context, and how  standardisation can support efficiently the process of certification schemes creation by following  a step by step methodology.  The methodology described in this study could be used as guidelines for new certification  scheme or standards authors. It will help setting up KPIs, useful for all stakeholders involved in  the preparation or operational phase of a certification scheme. The qualification system  proposed can be used also to define more precisely the requirements associated with the  different assurance levels mentioned in article 52 of the Cybersecurity Act. “Assurance levels of  European cybersecurity certification schemes”.  With regard to standardisation activities, we propose a set of recommendations for the  Standards Developing Organisations and the prospective authors of certification schemes:   The EU Union Rolling Work Program for standardisation should be aligned with the  Union Working Programme for certification, in order for the SDOs to provide  appropriate standards for the certification schemes   Horizontal standards (multi sectorial) for cybersecurity must be privileged in  cybersecurity evaluation but also in other domains as described in 3.1.   It is very important to avoid competition between SDOs. In the EU ESO’s cannot  develop overlapping EN (European Norms). A coordinated joint approach between  1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  5  CEN, CENELEC and ETSI must be strongly encouraged and supported by the  European Commission through adequate standardisation requests.   When an international standard exists in a specific area and covers at least partially a  targeted domain, it must be the preferred choice for usage.   The competition and overlaps have to be carefully managed. The EU rolling plan can  be an appropriate coordination tool to synchronize cybersecurity evaluation framework  and associated standards.   The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 should be considered as the first reference for cybersecurity  standardization.   It is important to improve the cooperation between CEN CENELEC JTC13 and ETSI  TC Cyber and ensure that the majority of Cybersecurity standards and in particular in  cybersecurity evaluation will be developed in joint working groups. This will guarantee  that all relevant standardisation requests will be taken into account jointly.   The ISO/IEC 15408/18045 Common criteria and evaluation methods, IEC 62443-4-2  Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-2: Technical security  requirements for IACS components, EN 303-645 cybersecurity for consumer IOT can  constitute the basis for all cybersecurity evaluation. They do not overlap, nor compete  with each other, but can be seen as complementary. An introductory guide to the  usage should be developed for the creators of certification schemes.  The Standard Developing Organisations (especially European ones – CEN, CENELEC and  ETSI) have to interact in order to avoid overlapping contradictions or incompatibilities between  standards and certification schemes. ENISA should participate in the relevant committees (CEN  CENELEC JTC13 and ETSI TC CYBER as first priority), and encourage joint work between  CEN CENELEC and ETSI, especially for topics related to the EU Cybersecurity Act  implementation. To this aim, an interface mechanism between the Agency and the SDOs  should be created, allowing for quick access to information concerning the standards in the  certification areas under consideration.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  6  1. INTRODUCTION  The EU Cybersecurity Act (CSA), which entered into force in June 2019, aims to establish a  European cybersecurity certification framework for ICT products, services and processes.  ENISA is participating in this new framework, by preparing candidate certification schemes on  the request from the European Commission or the European Cybersecurity Coordination Group  (representation of Member States).  Standardisation will play an important role in the framework, as the Act states the following:   Recital 54: There is a need for closer international cooperation to improve  cybersecurity standards, including the need for definitions of common norms of  behaviour, the adoption of codes of conduct, the use of international standards, and  information sharing, promoting swifter international collaboration in response to  network and information security issues and promoting a common global approach to  such issues.   Recital 69: The European cybersecurity certification schemes should be non-  discriminatory and based on international or European, unless those standards are  ineffective or inappropriate to fulfil the Union’s legitimate objectives in that regard.   Art. 52.4: The certificate or the EU statement of conformity shall refer to technical  specifications, standards and procedures related thereto   Art. 52.6: A European cybersecurity certification scheme shall include at least the  following elements:  o [..] references to the international, European or national standards applied in  the evaluation or, where such standards are not available or appropriate, to  technical specifications that meet the requirements  A general concept for the role of standards in the evaluation and certification process is  presented in the figure below.  Figure 1: Role of standards in the evaluation and certification process  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  7  Whenever a market needs to get regulated from cybersecurity perspective, it is essential to know:   what a product, service or process shall fulfil in terms of cybersecurity requirements,  and   how to check that this is the case with the appropriate level of assurance (depending on  the risk, the evaluation level targeted – basic, substantial, high –  and impact of a  potential attack).  However, this is not an easy task to implement. The challenge is that digital solutions are  developed, produced, deployed, used and maintained in very complex eco-systems across the  globe. Supply chains are very often not fully understood. Manufacturers of components, being  rather at the start of the supply chain, often have no visibility in which final product their  technology ends up (unless very specifically tailored for a use case). On the other hand, for  OEMs it is quite difficult or even impossible to know where a dedicated component (a small chip  embedded into the door of a car controlling the window) comes from. OEMs clearly know Tier 1  suppliers and maybe Tier 2. But further down the supply-chain the chance is very small to be  able to make a proper tracing.  Figure 2: Example of supply chain for digital solutions  Accordingly, it is very important that standardization and certification approaches are well  aligned across different industries when it comes to suppliers at the start of the supply-chain.  For example, manufacturers of micro-controllers usually deliver their chips into multiple sectors.  On the other hand, once the integration steps come close to a final product, the situation might  become very sector-specific. Therefore, it is essential to keep at least two views in mind:  1. The horizontal view: standards for basic technologies, such as micro-controllers,  whose final usage is not always clear, will most likely tend towards higher levels of  cybersecurity in terms of robustness against a broad range of attacks. Accordingly,  certification schemes used there need to be rather generic (e.g. ISO15408 – Common  sector agnostic (horizontal)  Sector  Agnostic  Sector  Specific  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  8  Criteria) than specific and act as building blocks for certification schemes tailored to  sectors.  2. The vertical (sectorial) view: standards in this case are typically very specific to the  sectorial needs. However, to be efficient it makes sense to have those standards built  on top of what the horizontal “catalogue” provides. This is also the case for certification  schemes. Certification schemes very specific to sectors (e.g. IEC62443) should make  use of horizontal (generic) schemes and recognize and build on top of those.  If these two views are not properly managed and considered, the industry will need extremely  high efforts to comply with standards and participate in the certification processes. A  manufacturer of a chip might need to run through many different certification schemes covering  the same or similar requirements. Hence, the intention of this document is to bring clarity for any  stakeholders impacted by the EU Cybersecurity Act when it comes to standardization in the  sense of what to fulfil from cybersecurity perspective and in terms of how this can be checked  accordingly with the appropriate level of cybersecurity assurance.  The remainder of this report is organized as follows: Section 22 summarizes the domains and  benefits of standardization. Afterwards, section 3 explains the roles of standardization bodies  followed by section 4, which provides a general description of what is a cybersecurity  certification scheme and how the standards support certification. Section 5 proposes a  structured methodology how the certification schemes can be drafted with support of  standardization. Finally, section 6 draws final conclusions and recommendations, including the  potential role of ENISA.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  9  2. THE SCOPE AND VALUE OF  CYBERSECURITY  STANDARDISATION  2.1 THE DOMAINS OF STANDARDISATION  Standardisation activities take place in international, national, and industry-based fora. Within  Europe, the three European Standards Organizations: CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI cooperate in  order to minimize the duplication of standards. Many technical committees have liaisons and co-  operation agreements within all the different technical standardisation committees. However,  there are many hundreds of technical committees within the standards community that work on  cybersecurity or have cybersecurity related work streams, and working in parallel. It has proved  to be difficult to coordinate these activities, in particular due to the different scopes covered by  the standardisation bodies and the lack of harmonisation between the terms and definitions  used. Even the term cybersecurity2 has different definitions and is often confused with IT  security.  The scope of cybersecurity includes the protection of complex environments, resulting from the  interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology – devices  and networks connected to it. This is the consequence of the global digital transformation. All  digital systems are concerned: IT of course, but also application domains, like healthcare,  energy, automotive, cloud computing, IoT, etc.  For these reasons cybersecurity is highly transversal. Improving cybersecurity is necessary for  all vertical domains.  The scope of cybersecurity is very broad and there are a high number of potential domains,  which are candidates for standardisation:   Information security management processes (ISMP):  to define criteria, methods to  guarantee the security of the management systems of a vendor, an operator, an end-  user. These processes cover the entire lifecycle till the end of life and not only the  development phase   Products, solutions and services design: to check cybersecurity functions against  risks and assess the functions and capabilities of products, solutions, services using  technical means like Cryptography, public key infrastructures, secure by design  principles, secure communications protocols,   Cybersecurity and certification evaluation criteria, evaluation methods, hardware  module evaluation, side channels attacks evaluation, random bit generators  evaluation,   Evaluation laboratories evaluation: people evaluation, development processes  evaluation, malware testing, penetration testing, static code analysis and binary  analysis.   Maintenance and operations of the cybersecurity: security operation centre  management, security operation centres indicators, vulnerability management,  vulnerabilities format,  2 Please see: Definition of Cybersecurity - Gaps and overlaps in standardisation, ENISA 2016,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/definition-of-cybersecurity  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/definition-of-cybersecurity  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  10   Standardizing stakeholder security procurement and subcontracting processes:  contract and subcontract management, product decommissioning and product  labelling, supply chain integrity and security, fraud and counterfeit management.  2.2 THE BENEFITS OF STANDARDISATION.  The benefits of standardisation in cybersecurity are clear and well known: Interoperability,  reusability, knowledge development and cybersecurity awareness, harmonisation of  terminology, consistency between different manufacturers, vendors and users, repeatability,  performance checking, security evaluation, supply chain integrity and security.  In the particular case of cybersecurity evaluation, on the one hand standardisation is necessary:  security risk evaluation, security target, protection profile, evaluation criteria, evaluation  methods, maintenance of cybersecurity certificates along the life cycle.  On the other hand,  consistency between evaluations performed by different laboratories is a key issue. For  example,tandards must be developed to support the evaluation of the evaluator, peer review  management, etc. Standardisation is likely to warrant the necessary consistency of  cybersecurity evaluation all over the EU and potentially worldwide, in order to create a  harmonised cybersecurity worldwide market. The main objective being to guarantee that any  evaluation of cybersecurity made in any of the EU member state is valuable and accepted for all  EU Member States, and that there is no need to carry out multiple evaluations.  Another important point is that evaluation under the cybersecurity security certification  framework will also introduce new requirements, for example, different assurance levels (basic,  substantial and high) to cover different risk analysis. It is very important to be able to certify  products, solutions and services at a level that is consistent with risks to be mitigated, but also  taking into account the market needs (cost, time and performance to be achieved). The cost of  evaluation cannot and must not be the same between nuclear, space or defence devices, and  simple Internet-connected thermometers of an in-house weather forecast station; but instead it  must be commensurate with the purpose the target of evaluation, serves. Impact of eventual  cyberattacks will be considerably different in the given examples. It is very important to be able  to fine-tune the cyber security evaluation according to the risk evaluation. This will need to be  standardised as well, considering operational use and lifecycle management  For these reasons there is need to define and standardise cybersecurity evaluation criteria and  evaluation methods.  Due to the transversal nature of cybersecurity, standardisation is a solution to avoid the creation  of multiple cybersecurity evaluation frameworks according to different vertical sectors –  automotive, healthcare, Cloud infrastructure, IoT, 5G, energy, etc. It is important to reuse  standards to serve a multi-sectorial approach. Consistency across vertical sectors will assure  minimum viable expectations for cybersecurity and will support greater uptake and adoption.  There are high risks associated with vertical domains developing their own set of cybersecurity  evaluation of standards for many reasons:   Ignorance of the existing standard base,   Intended willingness to simplify what is perceived as too complex,   Perceived specificity of the considered industrial domain,   Low knowledge base of the stakeholders.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  11  3. THE ROLE OF  STANDARDISATION BODIES  3.1 ASPECTS OF STANDARDISATION BODIES  Standardisation bodies have different scopes and governance. The section hereinafter  concisely presents them.  3.1.1 International level SDOs:  ISO, IEC, ITU, under UN governance are recognized by the standardisation community as  international standard organisations (SDO). These organisations are potentially addressing all  domains. The members of these SDOs are registered national bodies (NB). They are mostly  working on a consensus basis, but voting is an exceptional case, in which the principle chosen  is “one member one vote”. That is to say that each state has the same weight in a vote,  whatever the size of the country. Generally, standards published are available for a fee.  3.1.2 The EU level  In the EU there are three recognized standardization bodies: CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI. These  ESOs (European standardization organizations) are partly funded by the European Union.  CEN and CENELEC function in a similar manner to ISO and IEC, the membership is also  assured through national bodies. They have an increasingly more integrated functioning through  CCMC (CEN CENELEC Management Centre). The published standards are generally not free.  ETSI has a different governance organization from CEN and CENELEC. Membership is  assured via individual registration from companies coming from all the Member States. The  membership fee is paid on a voluntary basis and the number of votes is proportional to the  annual fee cost. There are regulations and governance mechanisms in place, in order to avoid  the majority shared by only a few members. There is also a national representation for the  European matters (like European standards ballots).  One important point is that ETSI standards and all technical reports and technical specifications  are available free of charge. This guarantees a high acceptance of standards worldwide.  3.1.3 Ad hoc standardisation bodies  In addition to the official international or European standardization bodies, there are other  entities working in specific and focused domains, for example industrial fora like 3GPP, CSA,  Fido Alliance, Global platform, IEEE, IETF, AIOTI, one M2M, TCG, Oasis etc.  These industrial bodies have different ways of functioning depending on their scope,  participation and coverage, but they intend to cover specific requirements from industry and  claim to be more efficient than traditional SDOs. Nevertheless, they do not have the official  recognition that the international SDOs have. However, the international SDOs have defined  specific procedures to import the de facto standards from these organisations, like PAS (publicly  available specifications), or so-called fast track mechanisms. This approach proved to be very  useful, as a good example we can note ISO 27000, which was created as BS 7799 and  transposed to an ISO/IEC standard using a fast track procedure.  It can be noted that national standardisation bodies are also producing high value standards,  like for example the US NIST – National Institute of Standards and Technology. One of the  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  12  NIST standards, the FIPS 140-2, has been taken as a basis to develop ISO/IEC 19790 –  Cryptographic module evaluation. This ISO/IEC standard became afterwards the reference for  the revision 3 of the FIPS 140.  3.1.4 Transposition of standards  In order to authorize exchange and transfer of standards between International and European  SDO’s, mechanisms of transposition have been put in place (Dresden, Frankfurt and Vienna  agreements), authorizing to transpose standards from one standardisation body to another  without restarting all work from scratch. It is possible, for example, to transpose an IS  (International standard) to an EN (European standard) to be referred to in European regulations,  or to transpose an EN in an IS in order to make it applicable worldwide.  The Vienna Agreement, signed in 1991, was drawn-up with the aim of preventing duplication of  efforts and reducing time when preparing standards. As a result, new standards projects are  jointly planned between CEN and ISO. Wherever appropriate, priority is given to the  cooperation with ISO, provided that the international standards meet the EU legislative and  market requirements, and that non-EU global players also implement these standards.  CENELEC enjoys close cooperation with its international counterpart, the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). In order to facilitate a consensus-finding process between  European and international standards development activities in the electrical sector, CENELEC  and IEC formalized the framework of their cooperation through the signature in 1996 of an  “agreement on common planning of new work and parallel voting”, known as the Dresden  Agreement.  After 20 years of a fruitful partnership, this has resulted in a very high level of technical  alignment (close to 80% of CENELEC standards are identical to or based on IEC publications).  CENELEC and IEC have reconfirmed their longstanding cooperation on 17 October 2016, by  signing the Frankfurt Agreement. Building on the experience of both partners, this new  agreement preserves the spirit and approach conveyed by the Dresden Agreement, in particular  the strategic commitment of CENELEC to support the primacy of international standardization. It  includes several updates aiming at simplifying the parallel voting processes and increasing the  traceability of international standards adopted in Europe thanks to a new referencing system.  3.1.5 Overlaps in standards  Cybersecurity standardisation activities take place in international, national, and industry-based  fora. Within the EU, the three European Standards Organizations, CEN, CENELEC, and ETSI  cooperate to try to minimize the amount of duplication of standards. Many groups have liaisons  and cooperation agreements within each other. Unfortunately, common understanding between  these groups has proven to be difficult.  There are many examples of duplication of work between standards organizations. Without  mentioning concrete examples, we can state that it can lead to at least duplication of efforts,  and in the worst case in the inconsistent sets of standards, which is harmful for industry, as  potential users of the standard. In addition, the relation of cybersecurity groups with other  security domains (societal security, physical security etc.) is not sufficiently addressed.  We can note the recent creation (2019) within CEN and CENELEC of a cybersecurity sectorial  forum in order to address this gap. This forum has identified 14 primarily relevant  standardisation bodies for cybersecurity within CEN and CENELEC, for which improved  collaboration is necessary:   CEN/CLC/JTC 4 Services for fire safety and security systems   CEN/CLC/JTC 8 Privacy management in products and services  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  13   CEN/CLC/JTC 13 Cyber security and data protection   CEN/TC 72 Fire detection and fire alarm systems   CLC/TC 79 Alarm systems   CEN/TC 79 Respiratory protective devices   CEN/TC 162 Protective clothing including hand and arm protection and lifejackets   CEN/TC 164 Water Supply   CEN/TC 192 Fire and rescue service equipment   CEN/TC 234 Gas Infrastructure   CEN/TC 263 Secure storage of cash, valuables and data media   CEN/TC 325 Crime prevention through building, facility and area design   CEN/TC 391 Societal and citizen security   CEN/TC 439 Private security services  One the first tasks identified by the forum was to align terminology between all these groups  and identify existing overlapping standards.  3.2 STANDARDISATION BODIES INVOLVED IN CYBERSECURITY  There is a plethora of bodies involved in cybersecurity standardisation, here we name the most  important:   ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection.  o This standardisation committee develops International standards for  information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection. They have  produced over 150 standards, including generic methods, techniques and  guidelines to address both, security and privacy aspects, such as:   Security requirements capture methodology;   Management of information and ICT security; in particular  information security management systems (ISMS), security  processes, security controls and services: ISO/IEC 270XX family;   Cryptographic and other security mechanisms, including but not  limited to mechanisms for protecting the accountability, availability,  integrity and confidentiality of information, ISO/IEC 18033, ISO/IEC  29192, ISO/IEC 10118, ISO/IEC 15946;   Security management support documentation including terminology,  guidelines as well as procedures for the registration of security  components;   Security aspects of identity management, biometrics and privacy like  ISO/IEC 24761, ISO/IEC 24745, ISO/IEC 24760, ISO/IEC  29100/29101, ISO/IEC 27101;   Conformance assessment, accreditation and auditing requirements  in the area of information security;   Security evaluation criteria and methodology ISO/IEC 15408/18045  known as Common Criteria, and also ISO/IEC 19790/24759 Security  module evaluation.   CEN CENELEC JTC13 Cybersecurity and Data Protection  o This committee develops standards for data protection, information protection  and security techniques with specific focus on cybersecurity covering all  concurrent aspects of the evolving information society, including:   Organizational frameworks and methodologies, including IT  management systems   Data protection and privacy guidelines   Processes and products evaluation schemes   ICT security and physical security technical guidelines  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  14   Smart technology, objects, distributed computing devices, data  services  o JTC13 recognizes the value of International standards and intends to reuse  as much as possible existing standards. JTC13 will identify and possibly  adopt standards already available or under development, which could support  the EU Digital Single Market, EU legal acts and standardization requests. If  required, these standards will be complemented by Technical Reports (TR)  and Technical Specifications. Special attention will be paid to ISO/IEC JTC 1  standards and in particular SC27 (see above), but is not be limited to this  group. Other SDOs and international bodies are also considered, such as  ISO, IEC, ITU-T, IEEE, NIST or industrial fora.  o For the identified standards, mentioned above, two options are considered:   Direct adoption as European Norms (EN), using Vienna or Frankfurt  agreements;   Adoption as EN with additional/complementary requirements, for  example in order to fulfil the EU legal requirements.  o The list of already transposed standards is available at the committee’s web  page3.  o CEN CENELEC JTC13 is also organizing in coordination with ETSI TC Cyber  dedicated events on cybersecurity standardisation, with the support of CCMC  (CEN CENELEC management centre) and ENISA   ETSI TC CYBER  o the ETSI TC CYBER (Cybersecurity) intends to cover:   Cyber Security Standardization from a generic point of view   Security of infrastructures, devices, services and protocols   Security advice, guidance and operational security requirements to  users, manufacturers and network and infrastructure operators   Security tools and techniques to ensure security   Creation of security specifications and alignment with work done in  other Technical Committees and International Study Groups  o It coordinates work with external groups such as the CEN/CENELEC JTC13,  the NIS Platform and ENISA. It collaborates with other SDOs (ISO, ITU, NIST,  ANSI etc.). The committee answers to policy requests on cybersecurity and  ICT security in broad sense.  o For security evaluation, ETSI has published the TR 103-645 – Cybersecurity  for consumer IoT, which will become the basis for a future EN.   Other relevant committees of standardization bodies :  o ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41 Internet of Things and related technologies  o ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 38 Cloud Computing and Distributed Platforms  o ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42 Artificial intelligence  ISO TC22/SC32/WG11 Automotive cybersecurity.   Industrial Forum of interest:  o 3GPP/GSMA, for 4G/5G concerns  o CSA, Cloud security has a liaison with ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27WG4  o Fido Alliance,  o Eurosmart  o Global platform, has a liaison with IOS/IEC JTC1/SC27/WG3  o IEEE,  o IETF,  o AIOTI,  o one M2M,  o TCG, has a liaison with ETSI TC CYBER  3  https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:7:0::::FSP_ORG_ID:2307986&cs=1E7D8757573B5975ED287A 29293A34D6B  https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:7:0::::FSP_ORG_ID:2307986&cs=1E7D8757573B5975ED287A29293A34D6B https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:7:0::::FSP_ORG_ID:2307986&cs=1E7D8757573B5975ED287A29293A34D6B  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  15  o Oasis, has a liaison with ETSI TC CYBER  The standardisation action to introduce these industrial and de facto standards has to be done  with SDOs through special procedures called PAS (publicly available specifications or fast track,  in order to provide a common EU legal and technical frame work.  The main standards used currently for cybersecurity evaluation are:   ISO/IEC 15408/18045 – Common criteria and evaluation methods.  These standards are under important revision at ISO/IEC  JTC1/SC27 level   IEC 62443-4-2 – Security for industrial automation and control  systems Part 4-2: Technical security requirements for IACS  components   EN 303-645 – Cybersecurity for consumer IoT, which is a standard  originally developed by ETSI and now managed under a joint  agreement by ETSI CEN CENELEC. This a good example of future  collaboration.  These three sets of standards can constitute the basis for a broad range of cybersecurity  evaluations. While they do not overlap with each other they are complementary with each other.  This has been for example identified in the domain of Industrial automated control systems  (IACS). Nevertheless, due to their complexity, identifying unique application domains of each of  these standards is not an easy task. However, such work should be performed in order to  facilitate the understanding and the reference in the development of upcoming cybersecurity  evaluation framework and in order to avoid to reinvent the wheel and redevelop new standards.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  16  4. CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  A cybersecurity certification of ICT products, processes or services (hereinafter the “target”4 of a  cybersecurity certification Scheme) is the provision of assessment and attestation that fulfilment  of specified security requirements has been demonstrated. It is carried out by Conformity  Assessment Bodies (CABs) in coordination with the vendors and service providers, who are  commonly requested to provide evidence in a transparent manner reflecting the level of  security. The CAB (evaluator) is expected to review this evidence and conduct applicable  conformity assessment activities (design review, source code review, security functional testing,  penetration testing, etc.) and generates an evaluation report which will be reviewed by the CAB  (certifier) before taking the decision to grant a certificate if the requirements are satisfied.  4.1 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE OF THE CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  European cybersecurity certification schemes5 constitute an important element in the new EU  Cybersecurity Certification Framework for ICT products, services and processes introduced by  the Cybersecurity Act.  The purpose is to ensure that the ICT product, process or service certified under one of these  new cybersecurity certification schemes, complies with specified requirements supported by  standardization organizations and the industry. This should help ensure the  protection of the  availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted or processed data  or the related functions or services offered by, or accessible via ICT products throughout their  life cycle.  The certificate issued by an accredited Conformity Assessment Body (CAB) will attest that an  ICT product, process or service has been certified in accordance with such a scheme and that it  complies with the specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting certificate will be  recognised in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders and for  purchasers to understand the security features of the product.  4.2 CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION SCHEME OWNER  The main responsibility of the Certification Scheme Owner is to maintain and update the  Certification Scheme accordingly. It should operate within an industrial consortium composed of  relevant Certification Scheme users.  The Certification Scheme Owner should be responsible for the objectives, the content and the  integrity of the scheme, and must be able to:   Maintain the scheme and provide guidance when required.   Set up a structure for the operation and management of the scheme.   Document the content of the scheme.  4 In Common Criteria, this is called a Target of Evaluation or a TOE.  5 An adopted European Cybersecurity Certification Scheme is a systematic organisation covering Evaluation  and Certification of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes under the authority of ENISA to ensure  that high standards of competence and impartiality are maintained, and that consistency is achieved during  the whole certification process.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  17   Ensure that the scheme is developed by persons competent in both technical and  conformity assessment aspects.   Make arrangements to protect the confidentiality of information provided by the parties  involved in the scheme.   Evaluate and manage the risks/liabilities arising from its activities.  4.3 CORE COMPONENTS OF A CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  SCHEME  According to Article 54 of the EU Cybersecurity Act, a candidate for the EU cybersecurity  certification schemes must contain a list of elements (see annexes). Among these elements, the  following three areas are necessary to build the core components of a cybersecurity certification  scheme:   A Technical Specification of Security Requirements for the target   A specification of approved evaluation methods for the auditor / evaluators in charge of  assessing the targeted ICT product, process or service   The specification of requirements for bodies certifying the targeted ICT products,  processes or services  When applicable, these three core elements are defined by standardization bodies. Otherwise,  they could be specifically defined during the creation of the cybersecurity certification scheme.  The content and purpose of each component are described below.  4.3.1 Technical Specification of Security Requirements for the ICT  product, process or service  This document contains the collection of technical requirements describing the desired  cybersecurity behaviour expected for the target covered by the certification scheme  4.3.2 Assessment Methodology  This document presents a set of validation procedures required to assess the target against the  technical specification requirements identified previously. It defines “How” the evaluator should  validate the target to prove the required level of security assurance. This mainly covers the  following aspects:   Definition of the concept of evaluation methodology (docs review, vulnerability  assessment, test procedures, Automation, Robustness, etc.)   Definition of the concept of composition methodology (if applicable)   Definition of the expected evaluation results (report, label, etc.)  4.3.3 Specification of requirements for Conformity Assessment  This document describes the requirements on bodies certifying the target products, processes  or services and defines all the policies and processes that govern the certification scheme.6  This will cover at least the following items:   Planning and Preparation (scope definition, etc.)   Application Procedure   Evaluation Process   Certificate Issuance  6 For facilitation purposes this document can be based on the international standard ISO/IEC 17065:2012  Conformity assessment - Requirements for bodies certifying products, processes and services.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  18   Certificate Maintenance (life-cycle management, status, delta, upgrade, derivative,  etc.)   Vulnerability Disclosure, Patching & Assurance Maintenance   Program Management (CABs accreditation policy, surveillance, conflict, roles and  responsibilities, etc.)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  19  VALIDATION AND FORMAL ADOPTION OF THE CERTIFICATION SCHEME  STANDARIZATION ORGANIZATIONS CERTIFICATION BODIES  PREPARATION OF MISSING REQUIREMENTS  Technical Specification of  Requirements  Evaluation Methods Conformity Assessment  GAP ANALISYS  Technical Specification of  Requirements  Evaluation Methods Conformity Assessment  IDENTIFICATION OF EXISTING RELATED STANDARDS  Technical Specification of  Requirements  Evaluation Methods Conformity Assessment  DEFINITION OF THE SECURITY OBJECTIVES  5. STANDARDISATION IN  SUPPORT OF CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION  As previously stated, there is a clear fundamental value for certification from cybersecurity  standardization. It is necessary to set up a close relationship and a practical coordination with  SDOs allowing a functional and efficient use of standards in support of certification.  Coordination should be based on a clear procedure and a methodology allowing to  communicate efficiently with SDOs and to study in a transparent and harmonised manner the  public specifications while creating a new certification scheme.  This section proposes an approach how to build a certification scheme, with fluent coordination  with SDOs. More specifically, we define the steps to be followed, covering the definition of the  security objectives and involving the industry stakeholders:   the identification and classification of existing relevant standards   a structured gap analysis methodology based on pre-defined qualification criteria   the preparation of the final set of documentation filling the gaps   the formal validation and adoption of the new certification scheme.  5.1 STEPS DEFINING A NEW CERTIFICATION SCHEME  The following diagram describe the drafting process and the different steps needed to develop a  new certification scheme  Figure 3:  Steps defining a new certification scheme  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  20  The procedures to develop in each stage is detailed in the following sections.  5.1.1 Stage 1. Definition of the security objectives  At this stage, the Certification Scheme Owner must identify the security objectives in  coordination with the relevant industry stakeholders7. The security objectives are expected to be  abstract statements, which in a formal way define the scope and the security properties that the  target ICT product, ICT process or ICT service is intended to address.  The statements must concisely express the intended solution to the identified security problem.  This could be a combination of assets, threats, policies and assumptions.  The method used to identify the security objectives could rely on existing standards defining a  risk analysis approach such as ISO 27005, ISO 31000, EBIOS, MEHARI, e-IoT-SCS, Magerit,  OCTAVE, etc.  5.1.2 Stage 2. Identification of the relevant standards in place  The Certification Scheme Owner must reach out to Standard Organizations to identify relevant  standards covering the three main areas of the Certification Scheme:  5.1.2.1 Technical Specification of Requirements  The Standards Organization shall identify existing standards, specifying the technical  requirements to meet the security objectives identified at Stage 1 for the target ICT product,  process or service.  In addition, these requirements must cover “What” the vendor or service provider is supposed to  provide as evidence proving a complete coverage of the security functional requirements.   Inputs: Security Objectives (Stage 1)   Outputs: List of applicable Standard Technical Specification or Requirements  5.1.2.2 Evaluation Methods  The Standards Organization shall identify existing standards specifying evaluation methods to  assess the target against the technical specification of requirements identified previously.   Inputs: List of relevant Standard Technical Specification of Requirements   Outputs: Inputs: List of applicable Standard Evaluation Methods  5.1.2.3 Conformity Assessment  Standards Organizations and Notification Bodies shall identify existing standards providing  guidance to Certification Bodies who wish to evaluate the conformity of target against the  technical specification requirements identified previously.   Inputs: List of relevant Standard Technical Specification of Requirements   Outputs: Inputs: List of applicable Conformity Assessment specification  5.1.3 Stage 3. GAP Analysis.  7 We strongly recommend at this stage involving regulatory organizations and all relevant authority  implementing / using the certification scheme in a specific market  to express the security risks acceptance  and help in prioritizing the security objectives  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  21  During this stage, the Certification Scheme Owner is expected to qualify the selected applicable  standards for each of the three areas and then identify missing areas to complete the coverage  of all the contents described in the certification scheme.  5.1.3.1 Qualification of the existing standards  The measure of the quality in the cybersecurity evaluation and certification process is a  paramount aspect to develop better and more efficient certification schemes that could at the  end build trust by providing transparent and objective information to consumers and citizens  about the level of cybersecurity of ICT products, services or processes  At the date of publication of the present report, a standardized system that could be used for  qualifying the standards used in cybersecurity evaluation / certification does not exist. Due to  the lack of this standard, this paper presents an initial proposal for a Qualification System for  Security Certification Schemes.  Annex A describes the main components of a Qualification System and include an example with  an initial proposal8 for qualification criteria and a scoring system that can be used to qualify  cybersecurity certification schemes  Classification system for the Certification schemes.  In addition to the parameters above and in order to qualify the certification scheme, the  following includes a classification system for the certification schemes prepared with the aim to  clarify and make easier the comparison process between them.  This classification system is not intended to qualify but rather to classify certification schemes in  order to have a more objective comparison. It is expected to be used upfront of any qualification  activity.  The Annex B includes a table with the proposed classification system for the cybersecurity  certification schemes  5.1.3.2 Identification of missing requirements  This step is required to ensure that technical specification of requirements (identified at Stage 2)  working together meet the objectives proposed for the Certification Scheme (mandated by the  EU)  The Certification Scheme Owner is expected to run first a gap analysis on each of the three  main parts of the scheme described above.  8 Note: The qualification system defined in this paper, shall be understood just as an initial proposal for  having a high level measure of the quality and the efficiency of the different certification schemes that will be  developed in the framework of the Cybersecurity Act.  A further development of the qualification system shall be done improving the formalism and the alignment  with the assurance structures of the actual standards used in cybersecurity evaluation and certification.  The authors of this study strongly recommend the international cooperation of Standardization  Organizations and ENISA in the further development of guidance documents for the qualification system to  ensure a general acceptance of the criteria and the procedures defined.

CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  As the EU has been leading the cybersecurity certification and standardisation area for ICT  products, processes and services, the EU Cybersecurity Act presents an opportunity to have a  harmonized market for security. It brings a whole field of work, putting the consumers and the  citizens in the centre of businesses’ reflections and aims to improve EU cyber resilience and  response by building upon existing instruments provided by SDOs keeping networks and  information systems secure.  The EU Cybersecurity Certification Framework makes it easier for ICT manufacturers and  developers to serve the EU market. A unified certification framework across all of EU reduces  the effects a fragmented market has on the economy. To support the creation of certification  schemes under this framework the role of SDOs is very important.  In this document, we presented how valuable the cybersecurity standardisation efforts could be  for certification, what are the roles and responsibilities of SDOs in this context, and how  standardisation can support efficiently the process of certification schemes creation by following  a step by step methodology.  Building robust and sustainable certification schemes is not an easy task. It will require  cooperation from a vast number of industries, SDOs and policymakers. However, the following  recommendations can eventually reduce the risks of failure. Taking it one recommendation at a  time is possible, as long as we understand what should come first: The higher accuracy defining  the object of the cybersecurity certification (the target), the better option to define precise and  detailed specification of security requirements (and by direct application higher assurance level  for the certification scheme and higher trust levels for consumers)  The criteria listed for the qualification and classification system could be used as guidelines for  new certification scheme or standards authors. It will help setting up KPIs useful for all  stakeholders involved in the preparation or operational phase of a certification scheme.  The qualification system proposed can be used also to define more precisely the requirements  associated to the different assurance levels mentioned in the article 52 of the Cybersecurity Act.  “Assurance levels of European cybersecurity certification schemes”.  With regard to standardisation activities, we propose a set of recommendations for the  Standards Developing Organisations and the prospective authors of certification schemes:   The EU Union Rolling Work Program for standardisation should be aligned with the  Union Working Programme for certification, in order for the SDOs to provide  appropriate standards for the certification schemes   Horizontal standards (multi sectorial) for cybersecurity must be privileged in  cybersecurity evaluation but also in other domains as described in 3.1.   It is very important to avoid competition between SDOs. In the EU ESO’s cannot  develop overlapping EN (European Norms). A coordinated joint approach between  CEN, CENELEC and ETSI must be strongly encouraged and supported by the  European Commission through adequate standardisation requests.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  24   When an international standard exists in a specific area and covers at least partially a  targeted domain, it must be the preferred choice for usage.   The competition and overlaps have to be carefully managed. The EU rolling plan can  be an appropriate coordination tool to synchronize cybersecurity evaluation framework  and associated standards.   The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC27 should be considered as the first reference for cybersecurity  standardization.   It is important to improve the cooperation between CEN CENELEC JTC13 and ETSI  TC Cyber and ensure that the majority of Cybersecurity standards and in particular in  cybersecurity evaluation will be developed in joint working groups. This will guarantee  that all relevant standardisation requests will be taken into account jointly.   The ISO/IEC 15408/18045 Common criteria and evaluation methods, IEC 62443-4-2  Security for industrial automation and control systems Part 4-2: Technical security  requirements for IACS components, EN 303-645 cybersecurity for consumer IOT can  constitute the basis for all cybersecurity evaluation. They do not overlap, nor compete  with each other, but can be seen as complementary. An introductory guide to the  usage should be developed for the creators of certification schemes.  As stated above, the SDO’s and mainly ESOs (CEN, CENELEC and ETSI) have to interact in  order to avoid overlapping contradictions or incompatibilities between standards and  certification schemes. ENISA should participate in the relevant work (CEN CENELEC JTC13  and ETSI TC CYBER as first priority), and encourage joint work between CEN CENELEC and  ETSI, especially for topics related to the EU Cybersecurity Act implementation. To this aim, an  interface mechanism between the Agency and the SDOs should be created, allowing for quick  access to information concerning the standards in the certification areas under consideration.  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  25  A ANNEX: QUALIFICATION  SYSTEM FOR  CYBERSECURITY  CERTIFICATION SCHEMES  Following is detailed an example of proposal of a qualification system for cybersecurity  certification schemes.  The qualification system consist of two main parts:  1. The Identification of a suitable set of parameters for qualifying the quality of a  certification scheme.  2. The definition of a scoring system for:  a. Quantifying each parameter and expressing it numerically with the aim to  make it measurable (and comparable).  b. Pondering the different parameters according to their individual contribution  level to meet the quality objectives of the certification scheme  Following sections describes in detail the different components of the qualification system  proposed  1. QUALIFICATION CRITERIA (PARAMETERS AND SCORING RANK)  This section present an initial proposal of the criteria that can be used to qualify each one of the  components of the certification schemes  1.1. Qualification Criteria for the Technical Specification of Requirements  (TSR)  Definition process of the target of the certification   Accuracy level determining the target of the certification  Accuracy level in the definition of the cybersecurity requirements is determined by the level of  precision identifying the product where applicable.  The higher accuracy defining the target of the cybersecurity certification, the better option to  define precise and detailed specification of cybersecurity requirements (and by direct  application higher assurance level for the certification scheme and higher trust levels for  consumers)  Scoring system: 1 (low) to 5 (high)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  26  Table 1: Value Rank  Accuracy  level  Level description  1  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is LOW.  The target of the certification is a generic category of product, process or services  2  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is MEDIUM-LOW.  The target of the certification is a generic category of product, process or services  with a defined list of the component elements or the architecture of the system  3  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is MEDIUM.  The target of the certification is a determined type of product, process or with a  defined list of the component elements or the architecture of the system  4  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is MEDIUM-HIGH.  The target of the certification is a specific product, process or services  5  The precision level defining the object of the security evaluation is HIGH.  The object of the certification is a specific product, process or services with a precise  definition of the internal components and the security behaviour  Other ponderation parameters:   Use specific Security Profile/Protection Profile for each single type of products  o Yes  o No   Operational Environment Consideration  o Yes  o Partially  o No   Composition certification allowed  o Yes  o No   Other Schemes Evidence Re-use allowed  o Yes  o Partially  o No  Definition process of the cybersecurity objectives for the target  There is not a single approach for the definition of the desired level of cybersecurity for a  specific ICT product, service or process.  The definition process of the desired level of cybersecurity for a target is a risk assessment  process weighting the potential threats and impacts for a determined intended usage of the  target. (Different security levels can be defined for different conditions and environment of use  of the target)  The desired security level is estimated by weighting the potential threats and impacts for a  determined intended usage of the target. (Different security levels can be defined for different  conditions and environment of use of the target)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  27  Accuracy level defining the cybersecurity objectives for target of the certification  Definition of the security objectives (expected security behaviour of the target) is the most  relevant aspect to determine with precision what can be considered an appropriated level of  security for the target.  The security objectives for a target can be expressed in terms of:  A determined security behaviour of the target in a determined environment (expected  use of the target)  The resistance level of the target against specific attack methods  The higher accuracy defining the security objectives for the target, the better capacities to  determine with precision and effectiveness the minimum cybersecurity requirements needed to  achieve the desired cybersecurity behaviour of the target.  Scoring system: 1 (low) to 5 (high)  Table 2: Value Rank  Definition level of  the security  objectives  Level description  1 LOW. The security objectives are not specifically defined  2  MEDIUM-LOW.  The security objectives are generally defined for the entire  target  3  MEDIUM.

A specific procedure is in place defining the security objectives for the  target.  Security objective are defined at individual level for the target components  Specific security objectives are defined for individual security attributes  (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) of the target components  Specific security objectives has been defined for specific use conditions  Other potential ponderation parameters:   A process is in place for defining the Security objectives of the target  o Yes  o No   Security objectives consider the different security attributes (CIA) for individual  components / information used in the target  o Yes  o No   Different security objectives are defined for different cases of use of the target  o No  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  28  o Yes  o Yes up to 3  o Yes up to 5   Security Objectives are properly defined through a risk assessment procedure  o No  o Yes  o Yes, and the risk and the risk appetite clearly defined, expressing what is  covered and what is not in the objectives  o Yes, and the risk and the risk appetite clearly defined, for each intended  usage scenario  Definition process of the evaluation areas covered in the assurance framework of the  specification of requirements  A broader scope of evaluation areas offers higher assurance levels for the certification scheme  and in the cybersecurity evaluation  Following are described main evaluation areas that can be considered for cybersecurity  evaluation of targeted products, services and processes:   Documentation review  o Verifies if the vendor’s implementation meets the requirements defined on  design and guidance papers:   Guidance documents   Design plans   Audit of security procedures associated to the target  o Security in the design procedures,  o Security procedures in the manufacturing process, and  o Monitoring and maintenance cybersecurity procedures in the aftermarket  process  Ponderation parameters: Audit inspection level:  o Documentation review  o Onsite audit inspection of the vendors ‘supply chain   Security functional testing  o Functional testing of cybersecurity functions implemented / used in the device   Robustness testing  o Stress test of cybersecurity functions and operational features implemented /  used in the device   Vulnerability Analysis  o Check for public vulnerabilities in the product.  o Potential ponderation parameters:   One time   Several times during the design and manufacturing process   Continuous monitoring system for new known vulnerabilities during  the entire product life   Penetration Testing  o Tries to hack the target with the same methods and tools as real cyber-  attackers .  o Audit level can be modulated by the attack potential9.  An attack potential is a  numerically expressed attacker's potential that is required for executing attack  scenarios for exploiting vulnerabilities in the target  o For a methodical approach to produce comparable results a measure of  target resistance against the different attacks methods covered in the  9 The attack potential is formally defined in the international standard ISO 15408  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  29  penetration testing can be used.  The use of international standards for  evaluating the resistance of a target against specific attack methods will  provide an added-value in terms of objectivity of the penetration testing  procedures.  o Potential ponderation parameters:   Pentesting Style   Non   Not limited in Time   Time-Limited   Risk-Based + Time-Limited (per profile)   Measure the resistance of the product against different type of  attacks procedures   Yes   Yes and based in international standards (For example  ISO/IEC 17825)   No   Only some specific type of attacks methods (number of  methods covered)   The attack potential is calculated for each attack method  / or risk  scenario used   Yes   No  Definition process of the technical specification of requirements included in each evaluation area   Criteria used in the definition / identification of security requirements included in each  evaluation area.  o Criteria used identifying most appropriated set of security requirements  needed to provide an appropriated level of security assurance for the target is  one of the most relevant parameters that can be used to qualify a Certification  Scheme.  o Following are described main criteria that can be used for qualify the  methodology of identification of cybersecurity requirement:   Identification of high level Security Best Practices   Identifying a list of high level cybersecurity controls or best  guidance practices that could be commonly applicable to a  generic category of products or services   Identification of a list of Minimum Security Requirements   Identifying a list of a specific cybersecurity requirements  (minimum basic requirements) that could be applicable to  specific type of products   Predefined list of cybersecurity controls that shall be  implemented in the target   Risk-based approach   Conducting a risk assessment procedure to ensure that  cybersecurity objectives determined for the expected use of  the target are meet and the potential threats are properly  mitigated by the cybersecurity requirements established   Ponderation parameters   A risk analysis is used in the drafting process of the  cybersecurity requirements   Yes   Yes, and the Risk Analysis is based in a standardized risk  assessment methodology  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  30   No  o Scoring system: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  Table 3: Value Rank  Quality of the  methodology for  identification of  security  requirements  Level description  1  LOW.

Security requirements are selected conducting a risk  assessment procedure to ensure that security objectives determined  for the expected use of the target are meet and the potential threats are  properly mitigated by the security requirements established  1.2. Qualification Criteria for the Assessment Methodology  Definition process of the assessment methodology  Assessment methodology is one of the most relevant component in a certification scheme  determining the level of objectivity in the evaluation process.  Assessment tasks include in some cases discretional procedures as including the expert  opinion of a qualified evaluator in a specific question. These discretional processes are more  often present in most advanced evaluations areas as vulnerability analysis or penetration  testing.   Criteria used for qualifying the objectivity level of the evaluation methodology:  o The objectivity level of the evaluation methodology can be modulated trough  different parameters or conditions which are applicable globally to the  evaluation methodology itself or individually to specific evaluations  procedures.  o Following are described some parameters that can be used for qualifying the  cybersecurity evaluation methodologies or the individual evaluation  procedures:   Assessment Style   Third-Independent-Party Assessment   Self-Assessment with double review by different internal  teams   Self-Assessment   Use evidence formalism (using a formal and structured language for  specification of technical requirements and evaluation procedures)   Yes (CC, others)   Partially (CC + Natural Language)   No (Natural Language)   Produce comparable results   Yes  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  31   Partially   No   Objectivity level (associated to individual evaluation procedures)   1 (low) to 3 (high)  Table 4: Value Rank  Objectivity  level  Level description  1  The evaluation procedure is highly dependent on the discretional  assessment of the evaluation team  2  The evaluation procedure is dependent on the discretional assessment of  the evaluation team, but the procedure is modulated by the use of external  qualifications requirements as technical knowledge of evaluators, years of  experience, use of specific tools, etc.  3  The evaluation procedure is non-dependent on discretional assessments  and always produce repeatable but not and comparable results  1.3. Qualification Criteria for the Conformity Assessment of the  Certification Scheme  Conformity Assessment is one of the most relevant components in a certification scheme  contributing to ensure the independency and the quality of the works done by the evaluator  teams.  The rigorousness level in the specification of requirements for the conformity assessment will  determine also the quality level of the certification process  Below are described some parameters that can be used for qualifying the conformity  assessment procedures:  Market Surveillance   Surveillance audits in certified products  o Number of surveillance audits in certified products conducted by the CB,  ensuring that the certified products and the manufacturer remain in  compliance with the certification program and the published standard(s) under  which the product is certified  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  o Value Rank:  Number of Surveillance Audits (SA)   SA< 2% of certified products: LOW   2%<SA< 5% of certified products: MEDIUM   SA>5% of certified products: HIGH   Public records of certificate metadata  o A metadata certificate service allows to store (in a centralized or de-  centralized way) properties related to the certified product such as the  certification validity, scope, attestation, level of certification, etc.  o These allows a service provider or a user to set up online cybersecurity  policies allowing to authorize/accept a certified product.  o Scoring System: Available YES / NO  Laboratories Surveillance   Random Evaluations (RE)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  32  o Random evaluations with reference samples verifying the results obtained by  the evaluation laboratory.  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  o Value Rank: Percentage of accredited labs audited per year by the CB with a  RE   Audited Labs < 2%:  LOW   2% < Audited  Labs < 5%: MEDIUM   Audited Labs >5%: HIGH   Round Robin Evaluations for inter-comparison  (RRE)  o Number of round robin tests conducted in different evaluations labs verifying  comparable results are obtained  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  o Value Rank: Percentage of accredited labs audited per year by the CB with a  RRE   Audited Labs < 2%:  LOW   2% < Audited  Labs < 5%: MEDIUM   Audited Labs >5%: HIGH   Capacity level to maintain updated knowledge at the state of the art of the security  (State-of –the-art Attack Methods and security requirements )  o Procedures in the Certification Bodies ensuring an updated and shared  knowledge between the evaluation labs of the state-of the-the-art Attack  Methods and security countermeasures  o Scoring System: 1 (low) to 3 (high)  Table 5: Value Rank  Procedures maintaining  an state-of-the-art shared  knowledge in security  Level description  1  Not specific procedures are in place in the Certification Bodies for maintain  an updated knowledge at the state-of-the-art of the security.  The technical specification of security requirements include all needed  knowledge for conducting the evaluation.  SDOs as owners of the TSRs,  are in charge of maintaining the state of the art of the security requirement  by periodical updates of the International Standards in the basis of the  certification scheme  2  The state of the art in the security requirements for target of the  certification is maintained by the Certification Body based in public  sources of information, such as newspapers, public vulnerability  databases, etc.  3  The Certification Body include in his organization specific working groups  of technical experts structuring the state-of-the-art security evaluation  knowledge for the evaluation laboratories and the Certification scheme  a) Verification process of the technical knowledge of Laboratories  Procedures in place in the Certification Bodies to verify the technical qualification of the  Laboratories and the evaluators  Scoring System:   1 (low) to 3 (high)  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  33  Value Rank:   LOW: Technical Qualification of the evaluation labs are granted by the general  procedures of ISO 17025. Not specific procedures are in place by the certification body  to verify the technical knowledge of the evaluation labs.   MEDIUM: Evaluation Labs are in charge of the technical qualification of their  evaluators and the evidence of the qualification is sent to the Certification Bodies   HIGH Formal procedures are in place by the Certification Body for auditing the  technical qualification of the laboratories and the evaluators. Technical qualification is  periodically audited by the CB.  2. SCORING SYSTEM  2.1. Quantification system for the qualification criteria  A quantification system shall be defined expressing numerically the different values that the  qualification criteria (parameters) can have.  Quantification system assign a value rank for each one of the different parameters used in this  qualification system. (An example of the scoring rank proposed for each parameter is included  in the previous section in order to facilitate the readability of the text)  2.2. Ponderation system and final score  A ponderation system shall be established defining the individual contribution level of each  parameter addressing the quality objectives of the certification scheme.  Ponderation system is also used as calculation method of total score of the qualification system,  as expressed in the next formula:  𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 =∝∗ 𝑃1 + 𝛽𝑃2 + ⋯ + 𝛾𝑃𝑛  Where α, β,γ, etc. are the ponderation rates and P1... Pn the qualification parameters  The total score will measure the quality level associated to each certification scheme and  indirectly can be used as a measure of the level of assurances and trust that would offer to  consumers and citizens.  For simplification purposes, a simple table can be used for qualifying a certification scheme  instead using the mathematical expression described above.  An example of a table describing a complete scoring system for a certification scheme is shown  below:  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  34  Table 6: Example of scoring system  Component  of the  certification  scheme  Nº  Qualification  parameters  Quantification system  Scoring rank  Assurance level value  (over 500 points)  Technical specification of security requirements  Object of the  certification  1  Accuracy Level  defining the  Scope of the  target  1 (Poor definition) to 5 (Highly  detailed)  (25)  5 per level  2  Use specific  Security  Profile/Protection  Profile for each  single type of  products  YES /NO  (10)  10 / 0  3  Operational  Environment  Consideration  YES / PARTIALLY / NO  (10)  10 / 5 / 0  4  Composition  certification  allowed  YES /NO  (5)  5 / 0  5  Other Schemes  Evidence Re-use  allowed  YES /NO  (5)  5 / 0  Security  Objectives  for the target  6  Definition Level  of the Security  Objectives  1 (Poor definition) to 5 (Highly  detailed)  25  (5 per level)  7  A process is in  place for defining  the Security  objectives of the  target  YES /NO  (10)  10 / 0  8  Security  objectives  consider the  different security  attributes (CIA)  for individual  components /  information used  in the target  YES /NO  (10)  10 / 0  9  Different security  objectives are  defined for  different cases of  use of the target  # NO  # YES  # YES up to 3  # Yes up to 5  (15)  0 / 5 / 10 / 15  STANDARDISATION IN SUPPORT OF THE CYBERSECURITY CERTIFICATION  December 2019  35  10  Security  Objectives are  properly defined  through a risk  assessment  procedure  # NO  # YES  # YES and the risk appetite is clearly  defined, expressing what is covered  and what is not in the security  objectives  # YES and the risk appetite is clearly  defined, for each intended usage  scenario  (25)  0/10/15/ 25  Evaluation  areas  covered by  the TSR  11  Documentation  review  # NO  # Yes.

    "abstract": "The document presents the value of the cybersecurity standardisation efforts for certification, the roles and responsibilities of Standards Developing Organisations (SDOs) in this context, and discusses various ways how standardisation can support efficiently the process of certification schemes creation by following a step by step methodology. The methodology described in this study can be used as guidelines for new certification schemes or standards authors. It will help setting up KPIs, useful for all stakeholders involved in the preparation or operational phase of a certification scheme. The qualification system proposed can be used also to define more precisely the requirements associated with the different assurance levels mentioned in article 52 of the Cybersecurity Act. With regard to standardisation activities, the study proposes a set of recommendations for the Standards Developing Organisations and the prospective authors of certification schemes."

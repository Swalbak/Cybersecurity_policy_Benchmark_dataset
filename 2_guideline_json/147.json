NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines,  including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency  operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security  systems.  This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as  analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is  provided in A-130, Appendix III.  This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies.  It may also be used by  nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution  would be appreciated by NIST.)  Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory  and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority.  Nor  should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the  Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.  There are references in this publication to documents currently under development by NIST in  accordance with responsibilities assigned to NIST under the Federal Information Security Management  Act of 2002.  The methodologies in this document may be used even before the completion of such  companion documents.  Thus, until such time as each document is completed, current requirements,  guidelines, and procedures (where they exist) remain operative.  For planning and transition purposes,  agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new documents by NIST.

The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of electronic  protected health information (EPHI). Although FISMA applies to all federal agencies and  all information types, only a subset of agencies are subject to the HIPAA Security Rule  based on their functions and use of EPHI. All HIPAA covered entities, which include  some federal agencies, must comply with the Security Rule, which specifically focuses  on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the  Security Rule.  The EPHI that a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits  must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses  and/or disclosures.  In general, the requirements, standards, and implementation  specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following covered entities:  • Covered Healthcare Providers—Any provider of medical or other health services, or  supplies, who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with  a transaction for which the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has  adopted a standard.  • Health Plans—Any individual or group plan that provides, or pays the cost of,  medical care, including certain specifically listed governmental programs (e.g., a  health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).  • Healthcare Clearinghouses—A public or private entity that processes another entity’s  healthcare transactions from a standard format to a nonstandard format, or vice versa.  • Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors –A nongovernmental entity that offered  an endorsed discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act. This  fourth category of “covered entity” remained in effect until the drug card program  ended in 2006.  NIST publications, many of which are required for federal agencies, can serve as  voluntary guidelines and best practices for state, local, and tribal governments and the  private sector, and may provide enough depth and breadth to help organizations of many  sizes select the type of implementation that best fits their unique circumstances.  NIST  security standards and guidelines (Federal Information Processing Standards [FIPS],  Special Publications in the 800 series), which can be used to support the requirements of  both HIPAA and FISMA, may be used by organizations to help provide a structured, yet  flexible framework for selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security  controls in information systems.  This Special Publication (SP), which discusses security considerations and resources that  may provide value when implementing the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule,  was written to:  vii  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  viii  • Help to educate readers about information security terms used in the HIPAA  Security Rule and to improve understanding of the meaning of the security  standards set out in the Security Rule;  • Direct readers to helpful information in other NIST publications on individual  topics addressed by the HIPAA Security Rule; and  • Aid readers in understanding the security concepts discussed in the HIPAA  Security Rule.

An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  1. Introduction  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing  standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, used by federal agencies in  providing adequate information security for the protection of agency operations and  assets. Pursuant to this mission, NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has  developed guidelines to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information  technology (IT) planning, implementation, management, and operation.  NIST publishes a wide variety of publications on information security.  These  publications serve as a valuable resource for federal agencies, as well as public,  nonfederal agencies and private organizations, seeking to address existing and new  federal information security requirements.  One such set of federal information security  requirements are the security standards adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human  Services (HHS) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (HIPAA, Public Law 104-191). HIPAA required the Secretary to adopt, among other  standards, security standards for certain health information.  These standards, known as  the HIPAA Security Rule (the Security Rule), were published on February 20, 2003.  In  the preamble to the Security Rule, several NIST publications were cited as potentially  valuable resources for readers with specific questions and concerns about IT security.  Congress enacted the Administrative Simplification (part of Title II) provisions of  HIPAA to, among other things, promote efficiency in the healthcare industry through the  use of standardized electronic transactions, while protecting the privacy and security of  health information.  Pursuant to the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA,  the Secretary of HHS adopted standards relating to:  • Electronic healthcare transactions and code sets;  • Privacy of protected health information;  • Security of electronic protected health information (EPHI); and  • Unique health identifiers.  This Special Publication summarizes the HIPAA security standards and explains some of  the structure and organization of the Security Rule. The publication helps to educate  readers about information security terms used in the HIPAA Security Rule and to  improve understanding of the meaning of the security standards set out in the Security  Rule. It is also designed to direct readers to helpful information in other NIST  publications on individual topics addressed by the HIPAA Security Rule.  Readers can  draw upon these publications for consideration in implementing the Security Rule. This  publication is intended as an aid to understanding security concepts discussed in the  HIPAA Security Rule, and does not supplement, replace, or supersede the HIPAA  Security Rule itself. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  mentioned several NIST publications in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule, CMS  does not require their use in complying with the Security Rule.1  1 The HIPAA Security Rule mentions NIST documents as potentially helpful guidance but not mandatory for  compliance, at 68 Federal Register pages 8346, 8350, 8352, and 8355 (February 20, 2003).  1  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  This document addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other  provisions adopted or raised by the Rule, such as 45 CFR § 164.105.  Figure 1 shows all the components of HIPAA and illustrates that the focus of this  document is on the security provisions of the statute and the regulatory rule.  Figure 1.  HIPAA Components  Readers should refer to the CMS Web site, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HIPAAGenInfo/, for  more detailed information about the passage of HIPAA by Congress, specific provisions  of HIPAA, determination of the entities covered under the law, the complete text of the  HIPAA Security Rule, the deadline for compliance with the Rule, and enforcement  information.  1.1. Purpose and Scope  The purpose of this publication is to help educate readers about the security standards  included in the HIPAA Security Rule.  It provides a brief overview of the HIPAA  Security Rule, directs the reader to additional NIST publications on information security,  and identifies typical activities an agency should consider in implementing an  information security program.  2  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  This publication is intended as an aid to understand security concepts discussed in the  HIPAA Security Rule and does not supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the  Security Rule itself.  Anyone seeking clarifications of the HIPAA Security Rule should  contact the Office of E-Health Standards and Services (OESS) at CMS.  For general  HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the CMS HIPAA Web site at:  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/.  The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66 Revision 1 were  used in preparing this document.  NIST frequently publishes new standards and  guidelines, or updates existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To  remain current with the latest available list of NIST security publications, the reader  should periodically review the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) Web  site at http://csrc.nist.gov.  1.2. Applicability  The guidelines provided in this publication are applicable to all federal information  systems,2 other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in  44 United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 3542.3  The guidelines included in this  publication have been broadly developed from a technical perspective so as to be  complementary to similar guidelines issued by agencies and offices operating or  exercising control over national security systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as  well as private sector organizations composing the critical health infrastructure of the  United States are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.  NIST publications may be useful to any agency seeking to understand the security issues  raised by the HIPAA Security Rule regardless of that agency’s size, structure, or  distribution of security responsibilities.  Specific agency missions, resources, and  organizational structures, however, vary greatly, and agencies’ approaches to  implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge significantly. Federal agencies use  different titles to identify roles that have security-related responsibilities and may also  assign particular responsibilities for implementing information security controls (those  required by HIPAA and others) differently.  NIST SP 800-66 assists all agencies seeking  further information on the security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule,  regardless of the particular structures, methodologies, and approaches used to address its  requirements.  2 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an  executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.  3 A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by  an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—(i) the function, operation, or  use of which: involves intelligence activities, involves cryptographic activities related to national security; involves  command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or  is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine  administrative and business applications, for example, payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management  applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically  authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of  national defense or foreign policy.  Agencies should consult NIST Special Publication 800-59, Guide for Identifying an  Information System as a National Security System, for guidance on determining the status of their information systems.  3  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/ http://csrc.nist.gov/  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of  industry-developed guidelines and/or models.  Organizations that are not required to use  this NIST special publication (by other regulation, law, or requirement) yet choose to use  it, must determine the value of its content for implementing the Security Rule standards  in their environments.  The use of this publication or any other NIST publication does not  ensure or guarantee that an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule.  1.3.

How and Why to Use This Document  Users are encouraged to use this document as a resource that provides concepts and tools  to assist covered entities, including federal agencies, to comply with the HIPAA Security  Rule.  NIST publications, many of which are required for federal agencies, can serve as  guidelines and best practices for state, local, and tribal governments, and the private  sector, and may provide enough depth and breadth to help organizations of many sizes  select the type of implementation that best fits their unique circumstances.  This document can support the compliance efforts of covered entities in many ways,  including:  • Ensuring that each organization is selecting methods and controls which  adequately and appropriately protect EPHI of which they are the steward;  • Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the  size and structure of the entity;  • Providing guidelines on best practices for developing and implementing a Risk  Management Program; and  • Creating appropriate documentation that demonstrates effective compliance with  the HIPAA Security Rule.  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  2. Background  2.1. HIPAA Security Rule  The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of EPHI. Although  FISMA applies to all federal agencies and all information types, only a subset of agencies  is subject to the HIPAA Security Rule based on their functions and use of EPHI. All  HIPAA covered entities, which includes some federal agencies, must comply with the  Security Rule. The Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the Security Rule.  The EPHI that a  covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against  reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures.  In  general, the requirements, standards, and implementation specifications of the Security  Rule apply to the following covered entities:  • Covered Healthcare Providers— Any provider of medical or other health services,  or supplies, who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection  with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard.  • Health Plans— Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of  medical care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid  programs).  • Healthcare Clearinghouses— A public or private entity that processes another  entity’s healthcare transactions from a standard format to a nonstandard format, or  vice versa.  • Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors – A nongovernmental entity that offers  an endorsed discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act.  This section identifies the main goals, explains some of the structure and organization,  and identifies the purpose of the sections of the Security Rule.  2.1.1. Security Rule Goals and Objectives  As required by the “Security standards:  General rules”4 section of the HIPAA Security  Rule, each covered entity must:  • Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI that it creates, receives,  maintains, or transmits;  • Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or  integrity of EPHI; and  • Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are  not permitted by the Privacy Rule.  4 See 45 C.F.R. § 164.306(a).  6  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  In complying with this section of the Security Rule, covered entities must be aware of the  definitions provided for confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304:  • Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or  disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.”  • Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed  in an unauthorized manner.”  • Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon  demand by an authorized person.”  2.1.2. Security Rule Organization  To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar  with the basic security terminology it uses to describe the security standards.  By  understanding the requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it  becomes easier to see which NIST publications may be appropriate reference resources  and where to find more information.  The Security Rule is separated into six main  sections that each include several standards and implementation specifications that a  covered entity must address.5 The six sections are listed below.  • Security standards:  General Rules - includes the general requirements all covered  entities must meet; establishes flexibility of approach; identifies standards and  implementation specifications (both required and addressable); outlines decisions a  covered entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications; and  requires maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate  protection of electronic protected health information.  • Administrative Safeguards - are defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative  actions and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development,  implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected  health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in  relation to the protection of that information.”  • Physical Safeguards - are defined as the “physical measures, policies, and  procedures to protect a covered entity's electronic information systems and related  buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized  intrusion.”  • Technical Safeguards - are defined as the “the technology and the policy and  procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control  access to it.”  5 Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and therefore addressed in this document but  do not have their own modules are Part 160 — General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164  — Security and Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements  (discussed in section 4 of this document), 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards:  General rules (discussed in section 3.1 of this document), and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation  of the security standards.  7  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  • Organizational Requirements - includes standards for business associate contracts  and other arrangements, including memoranda of understanding between a covered  entity and a business associate when both entities are government organizations; and  requirements for group health plans.  • Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements - requires  implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with  the standards, implementation specifications and other requirements of the Security  Rule; maintenance of written (which may be electronic) documentation and/or  records that includes policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required  by the Security Rule; and retention, availability, and update requirements related to  the documentation.  Within the Security Rule sections are standards and implementation specifications.  Each  HIPAA Security Rule standard is required.  A covered entity is required to comply with  all standards of the Security Rule with respect to all EPHI.  Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An implementation  specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach covered entities  can use to meet a particular standard.6  Implementation specifications are either required  or addressable. However, regardless of whether a standard includes implementation  specifications, covered entities must comply with each standard.  • A required implementation specification is similar to a standard, in that a covered  entity must comply with it.  • For addressable implementation specifications, covered entities must perform an  assessment to determine whether the implementation specification is a reasonable and  appropriate safeguard for implementation in the covered entity’s environment.  In  general, after performing the assessment, a covered entity decides if it will implement  the addressable implementation specification; implement an equivalent alternative  measure that allows the entity to comply with the standard; or not implement the  addressable specification or any alternative measures, if equivalent measures are not  reasonable and appropriate within its environment.  Covered entities are required to  document these assessments and all decisions.  For federal agencies, however, all of  the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable implementation specifications will most  likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes,  missions, and resources.  Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a  particular standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation”  standards, compliance with the standard itself is required.  Appendix D of this document provides a crosswalk of the HIPAA Security Rule  standards and implementation specifications to relevant NIST publications and security  controls detailed in NIST SP 800-53.  6 For more information on the required analysis used to determine the manner of implementation of an implementation  specification, see § 164.306(d) of the HIPAA Security Rule (Security standards — General rules: Flexibility of  approach).  8  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  9  For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the CMS HIPAA Web site at  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/.  2.2. NIST and its Role in Information Security  Founded in 1901, NIST is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of  Commerce.  NIST’s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness  by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance  economic security and improve our quality of life.  NIST is composed of several  laboratories that conduct research in a wide variety of physical and engineering sciences.  Lab researchers respond to industry needs for measurement methods, tools, data, and  technology, and collaborate with colleagues in industry, academic institutions, and other  government agencies.  The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component within NIST’s Information  Technology Laboratory (ITL), provides standards and technology to protect information  systems against threats to the confidentiality of information, the integrity of information  and processes, and the availability of information and services in order to build trust and  confidence in IT systems.  CSD develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal  agencies in implementing the requirements of FISMA and in managing cost-effective  security programs to protect their information and information systems.  Table 1  identifies and describes the types of NIST publications.

A Framework for Managing Risk  The HIPAA Security Rule is all about implementing effective risk management to  adequately and effectively protect EPHI.  The assessment, analysis, and management of  risk provides the foundation of a covered entity’s Security Rule compliance efforts,  serving as tools to develop and maintain a covered entity’s strategy to protect the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.  All EPHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity is subject to  the Security Rule.  Covered entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate  security measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the  security of EPHI.  Under the Security Rule, covered entities are required to evaluate risks  and vulnerabilities in their environments and to implement security controls to address  those risks and vulnerabilities.  The selection and specification of security controls can be accomplished as part of an  organization-wide information security program that involves the management of  organizational risk - that is, the risk to information, individuals, and the organization as a  whole.  The management of risk is a key element in the organization's information  security program and provides an effective framework for selecting the appropriate  security controls for an information system - the security controls necessary to protect  individuals and the operations and assets of the organization.  This section describes a process of managing risk to organizational missions and business  functions that arise from the operation and use of information systems by discussing each  phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework7 and providing a mapping of this  framework to complementary requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.  3.1. NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)  The NIST RMF, illustrated in Figure 2, provides the covered entity with a disciplined,  structured, extensible, and repeatable process for achieving risk-based protection related  to the operation and use of information systems and the protection of EPHI.  It represents  an information security life cycle that facilitates continuous monitoring and improvement  in the security state of the information systems within the organization.  The activities that compose the NIST RMF are paramount to an effective information  security program and can be applied to both new and legacy information systems within  the context of a system development life cycle.  A risk-based approach to security control  selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to  applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations.  The flexible nature of the NIST RMF allows other communities of interest (e.g., state,  local, and tribal governments and private sector entities) to use the framework voluntarily  either with the NIST security standards and guidelines or with industry-specific standards  and guidelines.  The RMF provides organizations with the flexibility needed to apply the  right security controls to the right information systems at the right time to adequately  7 NIST Special Publication 800-39, Managing Risk from Information Systems: An Organizational Perspective, (Second  Public Draft), April 2008.  10  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  11  protect the critical and sensitive information, missions, and business functions of the  organization.

The NIST RMF and Links to the Security Rule  The NIST RMF consists of six steps that are paramount to the effective management of  risk resulting from the operation and use of information systems.  Many Security Rule  standards and implementation specifications correspond to the steps of the NIST RMF.  Using these corresponding requirements in an integrated fashion can provide a  methodical, repeatable, risk-based approach for selecting, specifying, and implementing  security controls to adequately protect EPHI.  Table 2 describes each step in the NIST  RMF as well as the related standards and implementation specifications found in the  Security Rule.

This exercise aids in  determining priorities for organizational information  systems and subsequently applying appropriate measures to  adequately protect the organizational missions and business  functions supported by those missions.  The security  controls applied to a particular information system should  be commensurate with the potential impact on  organizational operations and assets, individuals, or other  organizations should there be a loss of confidentiality,  integrity, or availability.  Identify assets and information systems that create, receive,  transmit, or maintain EPHI.  Related Standards and Implementation Specifications:  164.308(a)(1)(i) – Security Management Process  Select Security Controls Security control selection, the second step in the RMF,  employs FIPS 200 and NIST SP 800-53 to identify and  specify appropriate security controls for the information  system.  The selection of security controls for an  organization’s mission/business processes and the  information systems supporting those processes is a risk  mitigation activity.  The security control selection process  consists of three activities:  • Selection of baseline security controls for each  information system from NIST SP 800-53 in  accordance with FIPS 199 impact levels determined  during the security categorization process;  • Application of security control tailoring guidance for  the information systems to allow organizations to  adjust the initial security control baselines with respect  to specific mission and business processes,  Select the standards and required implementation  specifications as the initial security control set.  These  required security controls establish the baseline from which  to assess risk to EPHI.  Once the baseline is established, perform a risk assessment  and analysis to evaluate whether the standards and required  implementation specifications alone are reasonable and  appropriate to provide adequate protection against reasonably  anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity,  or availability of EPHI.  The results of this risk assessment  and analysis will drive the selection of addressable  implementation specifications to adequately supplement the  baseline.  Supplement the initial set of standards and required  implementation specifications (baseline) with addressable  implementation specifications.  The decisions to supplement  12  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule  RMF Phase RMF Step Description Security Rule Link  organizational requirements, and environments of  operations; and  • Supplementation of tailored baseline security controls  with additional controls based on an assessment of risk  and local conditions including specific and credible  threat information, organization-specific security  requirements, cost-benefit analyses, and special  circumstances.  Key to this process is documenting the selection and  specification of security controls.  A documented security  plan provides an overview of the security requirements for  the information systems within the organization and  describes the security controls in place or planned for  meeting those requirements.  Additionally, the security  plans for organizational information systems describe how  individual security controls are implemented within  specific operational environments.  It is important for organizations to document the decisions  taken during the security control selection process,  providing a sound rationale for those decisions.  The  resulting set of security controls along with the supporting  rationale for security control selection decisions and any  information system use restrictions are documented in the  security plans for the information system.  This provides a  clear description of the risk mitigation deemed necessary in  order to adequately ensure mission accomplishment and  success of business functions potentially impacted by the  operation and use of the systems.  the security control baseline should be based on an  assessment of risk and local conditions including  organization-specific security requirements, specific threat  information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances.  The agreed-upon set of security controls will consist of the  standards, required implementation specifications, and the  risk-based selection of addressable implementation  specifications.  Each covered entity must document the security controls  determined to be reasonable and appropriate, including  analysis, decisions, and rationale for decisions made to refine  or adjust the security controls  Related Standards and Implementation Specifications:  164.308(a)(1)(i) – Security Management Process  164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) – Risk Analysis  164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) – Risk Management  164.316(b)(1) – Documentation  164.316(b)(2)(ii) – Updates  Implement Security Controls Security control implementation, the third step in the RMF,  employs enterprise architectures, the System Development  Lifecycle (SDLC), and various NIST publications to guide  the implementation of security controls in organizational  information systems.

Monitor and assess selected security controls in the  information system on a continuous basis including  documenting changes to the system, conducting security  impact analyses of the changes, and reporting the system  security status to appropriate organizational officials on a  regular basis.

Considerations when Applying the HIPAA Security Rule  In this section, security measures from NIST publications that are relevant to each section of the  Security Rule are presented.  Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format.  The following tables, organized by HIPAA Security Rule standard, are designed to initiate the  thought process for implementing the requirements of the Security Rule.  These tables highlight  information a covered entity may wish to consider when implementing the Security Rule; they  are not meant to be prescriptive.  The tables may also not be considered all-inclusive of the  information available in NIST publications.  In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the  following information:  • Key Activities - The Key Activities column suggests, for each HIPAA Security Rule  standard, actions that are usually associated with the security function or functions suggested  by that standard.  Some of these key activities are also the implementation specifications for  that particular standard.  Each key activity that is also an implementation specification has  been identified as such in the table (in italics in the Description section of the table), along  with a note as to whether the implementation specification is required or addressable. Other  key activities would normally be performed as part of one or more of the related  implementation specifications under the standard, but are listed separately for clarity of  presentation. Where such a relationship exists, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.  Other key activities are not implementation specifications.  These activities are not  specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is in  no way meant to expand upon the intent or requirements of the Security Rule.  Many of these  activities, however, are usually included in a robust security process, and many will be  required of federal entities under other federal laws, regulations, or procedures that may or  may not be discussed within this document.  The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation  specifications, both required and addressable.  Seven of the standards include all the  necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation  specifications.8  However, as noted earlier in this document, even if there are no  implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned Security  Responsibility and Evaluation, compliance with the standard itself is still required.  The key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be many additional  activities an organization will need to consider, specific to its own operations, which are not  included in the key activities of the tables.  Each entity will need to identify what activities  beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its environment, implement  those activities, and document them.  8 Standards that do not contain implementation specifications—that “themselves also serve as the implementation specification,”  as stated in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule—are those described in Sections 4.2 (HIPAA Standard: Assigned Security  Responsibility); 4.8 (HIPAA Standard: Evaluation); 4.11 (HIPAA Standard: Workstation Use); 4.12 (HIPAA Standard:  Workstation Security), 4.15 (HIPAA Standard: Audit Controls); 4.17 (HIPAA Standard: Person or Entity Authentication); and  4.21 (HIPAA Standard: Policies and Procedures).  15  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule  16  The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised by  the HIPAA Security Rule.  For more detailed information about the key activities, consult  one or more NIST publications referenced for the subject HIPAA standard.  • Description - The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation about  the key activities.  The descriptions include types of activities an organization may pursue in  addressing a specific security function. These are abbreviated explanations designed to help  get an organization started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule.  The first description  bullet of each key activity that is also an implementation specification includes the Security  Rule implementation specification text in italics. When relationships exist between  description bullets and other Security Rule standards or implementation specifications, it is  indicated in an accompanying footnote.  • Sample Questions - The Sample Questions column includes some questions to determine  whether or not the elements described have actually been considered or completed.  These  sample questions are not exhaustive but merely indicative of relevant questions that could be  asked.  Affirmative answers to these questions do not imply that an organization is meeting  all of the requirements of the HIPAA security standards.  Negative answers to these  questions should prompt the covered entity to consider whether it needs to take further action  in order to comply with the standards.  In fact, it is expected that many organizations with  existing information security infrastructure already in place will have considered most of the  Sample Questions.  The questions an organization asks in assessing and developing its  security program should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity.  This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational  Requirements, in detail as they do not set out general security principles.  HIPAA covered  entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further  guidance.

Additionally, this catalog crosswalks, or maps,  those Security Rule standards and implementation specifications to NIST publications  relevant to each Security Rule standard, and to applicable security controls detailed in  NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.  Readers may draw upon these NIST publications and security controls for consideration  in implementing the Security Rule.  The catalog is organized according to the categorization of standards within each of the  safeguards sections in the Security Rule.  Table 3 provides an overview of the catalog  content.  Table 3. Overview of Catalog Content  Column Headers Description  Section of HIPAA Security Rule  Indicates the regulatory citation to the appropriate section of the  Security Rule where the standard and implementation  specification can be found.  Standards Lists the Security Rule Standards.  Implementation Specifications  Lists the implementation specifications associated with the  standard, if any exist, and designates the specification as  required or addressable.  (R = Required, A = Addressable)  NIST SP 800-53 Security Controls  Mapping  Provides a listing of NIST SP 800-53 security controls that may  provide value when implementing the particular standards and  implementation specifications.  For full security control  specifications, refer to NIST SP 800-53, which can be found  online at http://csrc.nist.gov.  NIST Publications Crosswalk  Provides a listing of NIST publications that support each  particular standard.  Publications are listed by publication  number.  For the full publication title, refer to Appendix C:  References within this document, or to the Guide to NIST  Information Security Documents located on the NIST Computer  Security Resource Center (CSRC) Web site at  http://csrc.nist.gov.  The mapping of SP 800-53 security controls to Security Rule standards and  implementation specifications is of particular importance because it allows for the  traceability of legislative and regulatory directives, such as HIPAA and FISMA, to  underlying technical security configurations.  This mapping can also enable standards- based measurement and monitoring of technical security safeguards and computer  security configurations; facilitate compliance management by automating portions of  D-1  http://csrc.nist.gov/ http://csrc.nist.gov/  D-2  compliance demonstration and reporting; and reduce the chance of misinterpretation  between auditors and operations teams.  To accomplish this automation, NIST has defined, and maintains, the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP),121 a suite of selected and integrated open standards that  enable standards-based communication of vulnerability data, customizing and managing  configuration baselines for various IT products, assessing information systems and  reporting compliance status, using standard measures to weigh and aggregate potential  vulnerability impact, and remediating identified vulnerabilities.  121 More information on the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is available on the National Vulnerability  Web site, http://nvd.nist.gov.  http://nvd.nist.gov/  Table 4.

PL-3  NIST SP 800-18  NIST SP 800-53  NIST SP 800-53A  Appendix E: Risk Assessment Guidelines  This appendix incorporates risk assessment concepts and processes described in NIST SP  800-30 Revision 1, Effective Use of Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk, the  NIST Risk Management Framework, and the HIPAA Security Series: Basics of Risk  Analysis and Risk Management. It is intended to assist covered entities in identifying and  mitigating risks to acceptable levels.  The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where EPHI could be disclosed  without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed.  This information is then used to make risk management decisions on whether the  HIPAA-required implementation specifications are sufficient or what additional  addressable implementation specifications are needed to reduce risk to an acceptable  level.  Key Terms Defined  When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be defined and clearly  understood.  This section defines important terms associated with risk assessment and  management.  • Risk is the potential impact that a threat can have on the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability on EPHI by exploiting a vulnerability.  • Threats are anything that can have a negative impact on EPHI.  Threats are:  o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent); or  o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error).  • Threat sources are:  o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados);  o Human (e.g., intentional such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware  authors; unintentional such as data entry error, accidental deletions); or  o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazmat contamination,  environmental pollution).  • Vulnerabilities are a flaw or weakness in a system security procedure, design,  implementation, or control that could be intentionally or unintentionally exercised  by a threat.  • Impact is a negative quantitative and/or qualitative assessment of a vulnerability  being exercised on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.  It can be easy to confuse vulnerabilities and threats.  An organization may be vulnerable  to damage from power spikes.  The threats that could exploit this vulnerability may be  overloaded circuits, faulty building wiring, dirty street power, or too much load on the  local grid.  It is important to separate these two terms in order to assist in proper security  control selection.  In this example, security controls could range from installing UPS  systems, additional fuse boxes, or standby generators, or rewiring the office.  These  E-1  additional security controls may help to mitigate the vulnerability but not necessarily for  each threat.  HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements  Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires covered entities to:  Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct  security violations.  The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation  specifications.  Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk  management.  1. Risk Analysis (R123) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough  assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the  covered entity.  2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures  sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level  to comply with Section 164.306(a).  How to Conduct the Risk Assessment:  Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies.  There is no  single methodology that will work for all organizations and all situations.  The following  steps represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment program, and provide an  example of the risk assessment methodology described in NIST SP 800-30.  It is  expected that these steps will be customized to most effectively identify risk for an  organization based on its own uniqueness.  Even though these items are listed as steps,  they are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted.  Some steps can be  conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.  1. Scope the Assessment.  The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of  the effort, resulting in a general characterization of the information system, its  operating environment, and its boundary.  To do this, it is necessary to identify  where EPHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.  The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a  covered entity’s location as well as a logical boundary covering the media  containing EPHI, regardless of its location.  Ensure that the risk assessment scope  takes into consideration the remote work force and telecommuters, and removable  media and portable computing devices (e.g., laptops, removable media, and  backup media).  2. Gather Information.  During this step, the covered entity should identify:  • The conditions under which EPHI is created, received, maintained,  processed, or transmitted by the covered entity; and  123 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.  E-2  • The security controls currently being used to protect the EPHI.  This step is essential to ensure that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly  identified.  For example, an invalidated belief that a policy is being followed can  miss a potential vulnerability, and not knowing about portable media containing  EPHI can miss a threat to that environment.  The level of effort needed to gather  the necessary information depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and the  size of the covered entity.  3. Identify Realistic Threats.  Often performed simultaneously with step 4, Identify  Potential Vulnerabilities, the goal of this step is to identify the potential threat  sources and compile a threat statement listing potential threat-sources that are  applicable to the covered entity and its operating environment.  The listing of  threat sources should include realistic and probable human and natural incidents  that can have a negative impact on an organizations ability to protect EPHI.  Threats can be easily identified by examining the environments where EPHI is  being used.  Many external sources can be used for threat identification.  Internet searches,  vendor information, insurance data, and crime statistics are all viable sources of  threat data.  Examples of some common threat sources are listed in Table 5 below.  Table 5. Common Threat Sources  Type Examples  Natural Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical  storms, and other such events  Human Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings,  such as unintentional acts (inadvertent data entry) or deliberate  actions (network-based attacks, malicious software upload, and  unauthorized access to confidential information)  Environmental Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak  4. Identify Potential Vulnerabilities.  Often performed simultaneously with step 3,  Identify Realistic Threats, the goal of this step is to develop a list of  vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be exploited by potential threat  sources.  This list should focus on realistic technical and nontechnical areas where  EPHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly modified, or  made unavailable when needed.  Covered entities should use internal and external sources to identify potential  vulnerabilities.  Internal sources may include previous risk assessments,  vulnerability scan and system security test results, and audit reports.  External  sources may include Internet searches, vendor information, insurance data, and  vulnerability databases such as the National Vulnerability Database  (http://nvd.nist.gov).  At the end of this appendix, a suggested (but not all- inclusive) source list is provided that organizations may wish to use to help in  vulnerability identification.  E-3  http://nvd.nist.gov/  5. Assess Current Security Controls. Often performed simultaneously with step 2,  Gather Information, the purpose of this step is to determine if the implemented or  planned security controls will minimize or eliminate risks to EPHI.  A thorough  understanding of the actual security controls in place for a covered entity will  reduce the list of vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability, of a threat  attacking (intentionally or unintentionally) EPHI.  Covered entities should evaluate technical and nontechnical security controls at  all places where EPHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.  This evaluation should determine whether the security measures implemented or  planned are adequate to protect EPHI, and whether those measures required by  the Security Rule are in place, configured, and used properly.  The  appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the  structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity.  6. Determine the Likelihood and the Impact of a Threat Exercising a  Vulnerability.  The next major step in measuring the level of risk is to determine  the likelihood and the adverse impact resulting from a threat successfully  exploiting a vulnerability.  This information can be obtained from existing  organizational documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality  assessments.  A business impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels  associated with the compromise of an organization’s information assets based on  a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the sensitivity and criticality of those  assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and prioritizes the sensitive and  critical organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems,  services, and related technology assets) that support the organization’s critical  missions.  If these organizational documents do not exist, the system and data sensitivity can  be determined based on the level of protection required to maintain the EPHI’s  confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The adverse impact of a security event  can be described in terms of loss or degradation of any, or a combination of any,  of the following three security objectives: integrity, availability, and  confidentiality.  Table 6 provides a brief description of each security objective  and the consequence (or impact) of its not being met.  Table 6.  Security Objectives and Impacts  Security Objective Impacts  Loss of Confidentiality System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of  information from unauthorized disclosure. The impact of  unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can range  from the jeopardizing of national security to the disclosure of  Privacy Act data. Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional  disclosure could result in loss of public confidence,  embarrassment, or legal action against the organization.  E-4  Security Objective Impacts  Loss of Integrity System and data integrity refers to the requirement that  information be protected from improper modification. Integrity  is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or IT system  by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system or  data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the  contaminated system or corrupted data could result in  inaccuracy, fraud, or erroneous decisions. Also, violation of  integrity may be the first step in a successful attack against  system availability or confidentiality. For all these reasons, loss  of integrity reduces the assurance of an IT system.  Loss of Availability If a mission-critical IT system is unavailable to its end users, the  organization’s mission may be affected. Loss of system  functionality and operational effectiveness, for example, may  result in loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users’  performance of their functions in supporting the organization’s  mission.  Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue,  the cost of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems  caused by a successful threat action.  Other impacts, such as the loss of public  confidence, the loss of credibility, or damage to an organization’s interest, cannot  be measured in specific units but can be qualified or described in terms of high,  medium, and low impacts.  Qualitative and quantitative methods can be used to  measure the impact of a threat occurring  7. Determine the Level of Risk.  The purpose of this step is to assess the level of  risk to the IT system.  The determination of risk takes into account the  information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps.  The  level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the likelihood of  threat occurrence and resulting impact of threat occurrence.  The risk-level  determination may be performed by assigning a risk level based on the average of  the assigned likelihood and impact levels.  A risk-level matrix, such as the sample  depicted in Table 7, can be used to assist in determining risk levels.  Table 7.  Sample Risk-Level Matrix  Impact  Threat Likelihood  Low Moderate High  High Low Moderate High  Moderate Low Moderate Moderate  Low Low Low Low  E-5  8. Recommend Security Controls.  During this step, security controls that could  mitigate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization’s operations, are  recommended.  The goal of the recommended controls is to reduce the level of  risk to the IT system and its data to an acceptable level.  Security control  recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the  recommended security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.  It should be noted that not all possible recommended security controls can be  implemented to reduce loss.  To determine which ones are required and  appropriate for a specific organization, a cost-benefit analysis should be  conducted for the proposed recommended controls, to demonstrate that the costs  of implementing the controls can be justified by the reduction in the level of risk.  In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and  feasibility of introducing the recommended security controls into the operating  environment.  9. Document the Risk Assessment Results.  Once the risk assessment has been completed (threat sources and vulnerabilities  identified, risks assessed, and security controls recommended), the results of each  step in the risk assessment should be documented.  NIST SP 800-30 provides a  sample risk assessment report outline that may prove useful to covered entities.  Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management  The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization’s risk  management strategy.  In the context of the HIPAA Security Rule, the security control  baseline, which consists of the standards and required implementation specifications,  should be viewed as the foundation or starting point in the selection of adequate security  controls necessary to protect EPHI.  In many cases, additional security controls or control  enhancements will be needed to protect EPHI or to satisfy the requirements of applicable  laws, policies, standards, or regulations.  The risk assessment provides important inputs to determine the sufficiency of the security  control baseline.  The risk assessment results, coupled with the security control baseline,  should be used to identify which addressable implementation specifications should be  implemented to adequately mitigate identified risks.  Risk Assessment Resources  The following resources may provide useful information to assist covered entities in  performing risk assessment, analysis, and management activities, and demonstrate  compliance with the Security Management Process standard and related implementation  specifications:  • HIPAA Security Series,  Basics of Risk Analysis and Risk Management, 6/2005:  rev. 3/2007;  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/Downloads/BasicsofRiskAnalysisan dRiskManagement.pdf  E-6  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/Downloads/BasicsofRiskAnalysisandRiskManagement.pdf http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/Downloads/BasicsofRiskAnalysisandRiskManagement.pdf  E-7  • NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems;  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf  • Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Infrastructure Protection Plan;  http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/editorial_0827.shtm  • NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD); http://nvd.nist.gov/  • US-CERT; http://www.us-cert.gov/index.html  • Carnegie Mellon CERT Coordination Center; http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/editorial_0827.shtm http://nvd.nist.gov/ http://www.us-cert.gov/index.html http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/  Appendix F: Contingency Planning Guidelines  Information technology (IT) and automated information systems are vital elements in  most business processes. Because these IT resources are so essential to an organization’s  success, it is critical that the services provided by these systems are able to operate  effectively without excessive interruption. Contingency planning supports this  requirement by establishing thorough plans and procedures and technical measures that  can enable a system to be recovered quickly and effectively following a service  disruption or disaster.  Interim measures may include the relocation of IT systems and  operations to an alternate site, the recovery of IT functions using alternate equipment, or  the performance of IT functions using manual methods.  IT systems are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, ranging from mild (e.g., short-term  power outage, disk drive failure) to severe (e.g., equipment destruction, fire).  Vulnerabilities may be minimized or eliminated through technical, management, or  operational solutions as part of the organization’s risk management effort.  However, it is  virtually impossible to completely eliminate all risks.  Contingency planning is designed  to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability by focusing efficient and  effective recovery solutions.  Within the context of HIPAA, the goal of contingency planning is to adequately protect  EPHI during a contingency event, and to ensure that organizations have their EPHI  available when it is needed.  This appendix, Contingency Planning Guidelines, will identify fundamental planning  principles and practices to help personnel develop and maintain effective information  system contingency plans.  This section will be based on NIST Special Publication 800- 34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems.  Contingency Planning Defined  IT contingency planning refers to a coordinated strategy involving plans, procedures, and  technical measures that enable the recovery of IT systems, operations, and data after a  disruption. Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the approaches to  restore disrupted IT services:  • Restoring IT operations at an alternate location;  • Recovering IT operations using alternate equipment; and  F-1  • Performing some or all of the affected business processes using non-IT (manual)  means (typically acceptable for only short-term disruptions).  Types of Contingency-Related Plans  IT contingency planning represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain and  recover critical IT services following an emergency. IT contingency planning fits into a  much broader emergency preparedness environment that includes organizational and  business process continuity and recovery planning. Ultimately, an organization would use  a suite of plans to properly prepare response, recovery, and continuity activities for  disruptions affecting the organization’s IT systems, business processes, and the facility.  Because there is an inherent relationship between an IT system and the business process  it supports, there should be coordination between each plan during development and  updates to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources neither negate each  other nor duplicate efforts.  Table 8. Types of Contingency Plans  Type of Plan Description Scope  Contingency Plan (CP) Management policy and  procedures designed to maintain or  restore business operations,  including computer operations,  possibly at an alternate location, in  the event of emergencies, system  failures, or disaster.  Addresses IT system disruptions;  not typically business process- focused  Continuity of Operations Plan  (COOP)  A predetermined set of instructions  or procedures that describe how an  organization’s essential functions  will be sustained for up to 30 days  as a result of a disaster event  before returning to normal  operations.  Addresses the subset of an  organization’s missions that are  deemed most critical; not typically  IT-focused  Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) A written plan for processing  critical applications in the event of  a major hardware or software  failure or destruction of facilities.  Limited to major disruptions with  long-term effects; typically IT- focused  HIPAA Contingency Planning Requirements  Standard 164.308(a)(7), Contingency Plan, requires covered entities to:  Establish (and implement as needed) policies and procedures for responding to  an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure,  and natural disaster) that damages systems that contain electronic protected  health information  The Contingency Plan standard includes five implementation specifications.  F-2  1. Data Backup Plan (R) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A): Establish and implement  procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected  health information.  2. Disaster Recovery Plan (R) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B): Establish (and implement as  needed) procedures to restore any loss of data.  3. Emergency Mode Operation Plan (R) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(C): Establish (and  implement as needed) procedures to enable continuation of critical business  processes for protection of the security of electronic protected health information  while operating in emergency mode.  4. Testing and Revision Procedures (A) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(D): Implement  procedures for periodic testing and revision of contingency plans.  5. Applications and Data Criticality Analysis (A) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(E): Assess  the relative criticality of specific applications and data in support of other  contingency plan components.  IT Contingency Planning Process  To develop and maintain an effective IT contingency plan, organizations should consider  using the approach discussed in NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for  Information Technology Systems, which proposes a step-by-step contingency planning  process, and provides an in-depth discussion of technical contingency planning  considerations for specific types of information technology systems. A summary of this  process is detailed below.  1. Develop the Contingency Planning Policy Statement. To be effective and to  ensure that personnel fully understand the agency’s contingency planning  requirements, the contingency plan must be based on a clearly defined policy  supported by organizational leadership.  The contingency planning policy  statement should define the organization’s overall contingency objectives and  establish the organizational framework and responsibilities for IT contingency  planning.  Key policy elements include:  • Roles and responsibilities  • Scope as applies to the type(s) of platform(s) and organization functions  subject to contingency planning  • Resource requirements  • Training requirements  • Exercise and testing, and plan maintenance schedules  • Frequency of backups and storage of backup media.  2. Conduct the Business Impact Analysis (BIA).  The BIA is a key step in the  contingency planning process.  The BIA enables the organization to fully  characterize information system requirements, processes, and interdependencies  and use this information to determine contingency requirements and priorities.  F-3  The purpose of the BIA is to correlate specific system components with the  critical services that they provide and, based on that information, to characterize  the consequences of a disruption to the system components. Key steps include  identifying critical IT resources, disruption impacts and allowable outage times,  and developing recovery priorities.  Results from the BIA should be appropriately  incorporated into the analysis and strategy development efforts for the  organization’s other continuity and recovery plans, including disaster recovery  and emergency mode operations plans.  3. Identify Preventive Controls.  In some cases, the outage impacts identified in  the BIA may be mitigated or eliminated through preventive measures that deter,  detect, and/or reduce impacts to the system.  Where feasible and cost-effective,  preventive methods are preferable to actions that may be necessary to recover the  system after a disruption.  Preventive controls should be documented in the  contingency plan, and personnel associated with the system should be trained on  how and when to use the controls.  A variety of preventive controls are available, depending on system type and  configuration; however, some common measures are listed below:  • Appropriately sized uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to provide  short-term backup power to all system components (including  environmental and safety controls)  • Gasoline- or diesel-powered generators to provide long-term backup  power  • Air-conditioning systems with adequate excess capacity to permit failure  of certain components, such as a compressor  • Fire suppression systems  • Fire and smoke detectors  • Water sensors in the computer room ceiling and floor  • Plastic tarps that may be unrolled over IT equipment to protect it from  water damage  • Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital  nonelectronic records  • Emergency master system shutdown switch  • Offsite storage of backup media, nonelectronic records, and system  documentation  • Technical security controls, such as cryptographic key management and  least-privilege access controls  • Frequent scheduled backups.  F-4  4. Develop Recovery Strategies.  Recovery strategies provide a means to restore IT  operations quickly and effectively following a service disruption.  Strategies  should address disruption impacts and allowable outage times identified in the  BIA.  Several alternatives should be considered when developing the strategy,  including cost, allowable outage time, security, and integration with larger  organization-level contingency plans.  The selected recovery strategy should address the potential impacts identified in  the BIA and should be integrated into the system architecture during the design  and implementation phases of the system life cycle.  The strategy should include a combination of methods that complement one  another to provide recovery capability over the full spectrum of incidents, ranging  from minor service disruption to a partial or total loss of primary system  operations requiring operational resumption at another location.  A wide variety  of recovery approaches may be considered; the appropriate choice depends on the  incident, type of system, and its operational requirements, including retention  requirements.  Specific recovery methods may include commercial contracts with  cold, warm, or hot site vendors, mobile sites, mirrored sites, reciprocal  agreements with internal or external organizations, and service-level agreements  (SLAs) with the equipment vendors.  In addition, high-availability technologies  such as Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID), automatic fail-over,  uninterruptible power supply (UPS), mirrored systems, and multisite data  archiving systems should be considered when developing a system recovery  strategy.  5. Develop an IT Contingency Plan.  IT contingency plan development is a critical  step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency planning  program.  The plan contains detailed roles, responsibilities, teams, and procedures  associated with restoring an IT system following a disruption.  The contingency  plan should document technical capabilities designed to support contingency  operations.  Plans need to balance detail with flexibility; usually the more detailed  the plan, the less scalable and versatile the approach.  Following the approach described in NIST SP 800-34, the contingency plan  comprises five main components: Supporting Information, Notification and  Activation, Recovery, Reconstitution, and Plan Appendices. The first and last  components provide essential information to ensure a comprehensive plan. The  Notification and Activation, Recovery, and Reconstitution phases address specific  actions that the organization should take following a system disruption or  emergency.  • The Supporting Information component includes an introduction and  concept of operations section that provides essential background or  contextual information that makes the contingency plan easier to  understand, implement, and maintain. These details aid in understanding  the applicability of the guidance, in making decisions on how to use the  plan, and in providing information on where associated plans and  information outside the scope of the plan may be found.  F-5  • The Notification and Activation Phase defines the initial actions taken  once a system disruption or emergency has been detected or appears to be  imminent.  This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel,  assess system damage, and implement the plan.  At the completion of the  Notification and Activation Phase, recovery staff will be prepared to  perform contingency measures to restore system functions on a temporary  basis.  • The Recovery Phase begins after the contingency plan has been activated,  damage assessment has been completed (if possible), personnel have been  notified, and appropriate teams have been mobilized.  Recovery phase  activities focus on contingency measures to execute temporary IT  processing capabilities, repair damage to the original system, and restore  operational capabilities at the original or new facility. At the completion of  the Recovery Phase, the IT system will be operational and performing the  functions designated in the plan. Depending on the recovery strategies  defined in the plan, these functions could include temporary manual  processing, recovery and operation at an alternate system, or relocation  and recovery at an alternate site. Teams with recovery responsibilities  should understand and be able to perform these recovery strategies well  enough that if the paper plan is unavailable during the initial stages of the  event, they can still perform the necessary activities.  • In the Reconstitution Phase, recovery activities are terminated, and normal  operations are transferred back to the organization’s facility.  If the  original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be  applied to preparing a new facility to support system processing  requirements.  Until the primary system is restored and tested, the  contingency system should continue to be operated. The Reconstitution  Phase should specify teams responsible for restoring or replacing both the  site and the information system.  Contingency Plan Appendices should provide key details not contained in the  main body of the plan.  The appendices should reflect the specific technical,  operational, and management contingency requirements of the information system  and the larger organization.  Appendices can include, but are not limited to,  contact information for contingency planning team personnel; vendor contact  information, including offsite storage and alternate site points of contact; standard  operating procedures and checklists for system recovery or processes; equipment  and system requirements lists of the hardware, software, firmware, and other  resources required to support system operations; vendor agreements, reciprocal  agreements with other organizations, and other vital records; description of, and  directions to, the alternate site; and the BIA.  Plans should be formatted to provide quick and clear direction in the event those  personnel unfamiliar with the plan or the systems are called on to perform  recovery operations.  Plans should be clear, concise, and easy to implement in an  emergency.  Where possible, checklists and step-by-step procedures should be  F-6  used.  A concise and well-formatted plan reduces the likelihood of creating an  overly complex or confusing plan.  6. Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises.  Plan testing is a critical element of a  viable contingency capability.  Testing enables plan deficiencies to be identified  and addressed. Testing also helps evaluate the ability of the recovery staff to  implement the plan quickly and effectively. Each IT contingency plan element  should be tested to confirm the accuracy of individual recovery procedures and  the overall effectiveness of the plan. The following areas should be addressed in a  contingency test:  • System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media  • Coordination among recovery teams  • Internal and external connectivity  • System performance using alternate equipment  • Restoration of normal operations  • Notification procedures.  Training for personnel with contingency plan responsibilities should complement  testing. Training should be provided at least annually; new hires with plan  responsibilities should receive training shortly after they are hired.  Ultimately,  contingency plan personnel should be trained to the extent that that they are able  to execute their respective recovery procedures without aid of the actual  document. This is an important goal in the event that paper or electronic versions  of the plan are unavailable for the first few hours resulting from the extent of the  disaster.  Recovery personnel should be trained on the following plan elements:  • Purpose of the plan  • Cross-team coordination and communication  • Reporting procedures  • Security requirements  • Team-specific processes (Notification/Activation, Recovery, and  Reconstitution Phases)  • Individual responsibilities (Notification/ Activation, Recovery, and  Reconstitution Phases).  7. Maintain the plan. To be effective, the plan must be maintained in a ready state  that accurately reflects system requirements, procedures, organizational structure,  and policies. IT systems undergo frequent changes because of shifting business  needs, technology upgrades, or new internal or external policies. Therefore, it is  essential that the contingency plan be reviewed and updated regularly, as part of  the organization’s change management process, to ensure that new information is  documented and contingency measures are revised if required.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE  This {system name} Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover the {system  name} system following a disruption. The following objectives have been established for  this plan:  • Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan  that consists of the following phases:  − Notification/Activation phase to detect and assess damage and to activate  the plan;  − Recovery phase to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage  done to the original system; and  − Reconstitution phase to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal  operations.  • Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out {system  name} processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal  operations.  • Assign responsibilities to designated {Organization name} personnel and provide  guidance for recovering {system name} during prolonged periods of interruption  to normal operations.  • Ensure coordination with other {Organization name} staff who will participate in  the contingency planning strategies. Ensure coordination with external points of  contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.  1.2 APPLICABILITY  The {system name} Contingency Plan applies to the functions, operations, and resources  necessary to restore and resume {Organization name}’s {system name} operations as it is  installed at its primary location:  {Name, City, State}. The {system name} Contingency  Plan applies to {Organization name} and all other persons associated with {system  name} as identified under Section 2.3, Responsibilities.  G-1  1.3 SCOPE  1.3.1 Planning Principles  Various scenarios were considered to form a basis for the plan, and multiple assumptions  were made. The applicability of the plan is predicated on two key principles:  • The {Organization name}’s facility in {City, State}, is inaccessible; therefore,  {Organization name} is unable to perform {system name} processing for the  organization.  • A valid contract exists with the alternate site that designates that site in {City,  State}, as {Organization name}’s alternate operating facility.  – {Organization name} will use the alternate site building and IT resources to  recover {system name} functionality during an emergency situation that  prevents access to the original facility.  – The designated computer system at the alternate site has been configured to  begin processing {system name} information.  – The alternate site will be used to continue {system name} recovery and  processing throughout the period of disruption, until the return to normal  operations.  1.3.2 Assumptions  Based on these principles, the following assumptions were used when developing the IT  Contingency Plan:  • The {system name} is inoperable at the {Organization name} computer center  and cannot be recovered within {XX} hours.  • Key {system name} personnel have been identified and trained in their  emergency response and recovery roles; they are available to activate the {system  name} Contingency Plan.  • Preventive controls (e.g., generators, environmental controls, waterproof tarps,  sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and fire department assistance) are fully  operational at the time of the contingency event.  • Computer center equipment, including components supporting {system name},  are connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that provides {XX}  minutes/hours of electricity during a power failure.  • {System name} hardware and software at the {Organization name} original site  are unavailable for at least {XX} hours.  • Current backups of the application software and data are intact and available at  the offsite storage facility.  • The equipment, connections, and capabilities required to operate {system name}  are available at the alternate site in {City, State}.  G-2  • Service agreements are maintained with {system name} hardware, software, and  communications providers to support the system recovery.  The {system name} Contingency Plan does not apply to the following situations:  • Overall recovery and continuity of business operations. The Business  Resumption Plan (BRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) are appended  to the plan.  • Emergency evacuation of personnel. The Occupant Evacuation Plan (OEP) is  appended to the plan.  • Any additional constraints should be added to this list.  1.4 REFERENCES/REQUIREMENTS  This {system name} Contingency Plan complies with the {Organization name}’s IT  contingency planning policy as follows:  {Insert organization’s contingency planning policy statement}  The {system name} Contingency Plan also complies with the following policies:  • Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002  • Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 1996  • OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix  III, November 2000  • Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of  Operations, July 1999  • PDD 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, May 1998  • Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The Federal Response Plan  (FRP), April 1999  • {Insert other applicable policies}  1.5 RECORD OF CHANGES  Modifications made to this plan are as follows:  Record of Changes  Page No.  Change Comment Date of Change Signature  2.

Appendix H: Resources for Secure Remote Use and  Access  The HIPAA Security Rule requires all covered entities to protect the EPHI that they use  or disclose to business associates, trading partners, or other entities. New technologies,  such as remote access and removable media technologies, have significantly simplified  the way in which data is transmitted throughout the healthcare industry and created  tremendous opportunities for improvements and greater efficiency in the healthcare  space.  However, these technologies have also increased the risk of loss and unauthorized  use and disclosure of this sensitive information.  Sensitive information that is accessed  by, stored on, or transmitted to or from a remote device needs to be protected so that  malicious parties cannot access or alter it.  An unauthorized release of sensitive  information could damage the trust in an organization, jeopardize its mission, or harm  individuals if their personal information has been released.  In December 2006, CMS issued a HIPAA security guidance document, Remote Use of  and Access to Electronic Protected Health Information, to reinforce some of the ways a  covered entity may protect EPHI when it is accessed or used outside of the organization’s  physical purview.  It sets forth some strategies that may be reasonable and appropriate  under the HIPAA Security Rule, for covered entities to follow (based upon their  individual technological capabilities and operational needs), for offsite use of, or access  to, EPHI.  This guidance also places significant emphasis on the importance of risk  analysis and risk management strategies, policies and procedures, and security awareness  and training on the policies and procedures for safeguarding EPHI during its remote  access, storage, and transmission.  NIST publications on remote access, storage, and transmission security technologies can  be valuable resources to support secure remote use solutions.  These publications seek to  assist organizations in understanding particular technologies and to provide security  considerations and practical, real-world recommendations for implementing and securing  these technologies within an organization.  Special Publication 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing External Devices for Telework  and Remote Access, was developed to help teleworkers secure the external devices they  use for telework, such as personally owned and third-party privately owned desktop and  laptop computers and consumer devices (e.g., cell phones, personal digital assistants).  The document focuses specifically on security for telework involving remote access to  organizations’ nonpublic computing resources by providing:  • Recommendations for securing telework computers’ operating systems and  applications, as well as home networks that the computers use;  • Basic recommendations for securing consumer devices used for telework;  • Advice on protecting the information stored on telework computers and  removable media; and  • Tips on considering the security of a device owned by a third party before  deciding whether it should be used for telework.  H-1  Special Publication 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, assists organizations in understanding  SSL VPN technologies and in designing, implementing, configuring, securing,  monitoring, and maintaining SSL VPN solutions.  This publication intends to help  organizations determine how best to deploy SSL VPNs within their specific network  environments by:  • Describing SSL and how it fits within the context of layered network security;  • Presenting a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation that can  help in achieving successful SSL VPN deployments; and  • Comparing SSL VPN technology with IPsec VPNs and other VPN solutions.  Special Publication 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs, assists organizations in mitigating the  risks associated with the transmission of sensitive information across networks by  providing practical guidelines on implementing security services based on Internet  Protocol Security (IPsec).  This publication intends to help organizations determine how  best to deploy IPsec VPNs within their specific network environments by:  • Discussing the need for, and types of, network layer security services and how  IPsec addresses these services;  • Providing a phased approach to IPsec planning and implementation that can help  in achieving successful IPsec deployments;  • Providing specific recommendations relating to configuring cryptography for  IPsec;  • Using a case-based approach to show how IPsec can be used to solve common  network security issues; and  • Discussing alternatives to IPsec and under what circumstances each may be  appropriate.  Special Publication 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer  Security (TLS), provides guidelines on the selection and implementation of the TLS  protocol while making effective use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)- approved cryptographic algorithms.  TLS provides a mechanism to protect sensitive data  during electronic dissemination across the Internet.  This guideline:  • Describes the placement of security in each layer of the communications protocol  stack, as defined by the OSI Seven Layer Model;  • Provides criteria for developing specific recommendations when selecting,  installing and using transport layer security; and  • Discusses client implementation, server, and operational considerations.  Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User  Devices, assists organizations in understanding storage encryption technologies for end  user devices and in planning, implementing, and maintaining storage encryption  solutions.  The types of end user devices addressed in this document are personal  computers (desktops and laptops), consumer devices (e.g., personal digital assistants,  H-2  H-3  smart phones), and removable storage media (e.g., USB flash drives, memory cards,  external hard drives, writeable CDs and DVDs).  This publication:  • Provides an overview of the basic concepts of storage encryption for end user  devices;  • Provides guidelines on commonly used categories of storage encryption  techniques (i.e., full disk, volume and virtual disk, and file/folder), and explains  the types of protection they provide;  • Discusses important security elements of a storage encryption deployment,  including cryptographic key management and authentication; and  • Examines several use cases which illustrate multiple ways to meet most storage  encryption needs.  Draft Special Publication 800-124, Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security, provides  an overview of cell phone and personal digital assistant (PDA) devices in use today and  offers insights for making informed information technology security decisions regarding  their treatment.  This publication:  • Presents an overview of handheld devices and discusses associated security  threats and technology risks;  • Examines the security concerns associated with handheld devices; and  • Discusses user- and organization-oriented measures and safeguards available for  mitigating the risks and threats.  All NIST publications are accessible on the public Computer Security Resource Center  (CSRC) Web site at http://csrc.nist.gov.  http://csrc.nist.gov/  Appendix I: Telework Security Considerations  Many people telework, which is the ability for an organization’s employees and  contractors to conduct work from locations other than the organization’s facilities.  Teleworkers use various devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, cell phones, and  personal digital assistants (PDAs), to read and send email, access Web sites, review and  edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Most teleworkers use remote access,  which is the ability of an organization’s users to access its nonpublic computing  resources from locations other than the organization’s facilities. Organizations have many  options for providing remote access, including virtual private networks, remote system  control, and individual application access (e.g., Web-based email).  This appendix provides considerations and tips for securing external devices used for  telework and remote access.  More detailed information on this topic is available in NIST  SP 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing External Devices for Telework and Remote  Access.  Before teleworking, users should understand their organization’s policies and  requirements, as well as appropriate ways of protecting the organization’s  information that they may access.  Teleworkers should consult their organization’s policies and requirements to provide  adequate security to protect the organization’s information.  Sensitive information that is  stored on, or sent to or from, external telework devices needs to be protected so that  malicious parties can neither access nor alter it.  An unauthorized release of sensitive  information could damage the public’s trust in an organization, jeopardize the mission of  an organization, or harm individuals if their personal information has been released.  Teleworkers should ensure that all the devices on their wired and wireless home  networks are properly secured, as well as the home networks themselves.  An important part of telework and remote access security is applying security measures  to the personal computers (PCs) and consumer devices using the same wired and wireless  home networks to which the telework device normally connects. If any of these other  devices become infected with malware or are otherwise compromised, they could attack  the telework device or eavesdrop on its communications. Teleworkers should also be  cautious about allowing others to place devices on the teleworkers’ home networks, in  case one of these devices is compromised.  Teleworkers should apply security measures to the home networks to which their  telework devices normally connect. One example of a security measure is using a  broadband router or firewall appliance to prevent computers outside the home network  from initiating communications with telework devices on the home network. Another  example is ensuring that sensitive information transmitted over a wireless home network  is adequately protected through strong encryption.  Teleworkers should consider the security state of a third-party device before using it  for telework.  I-1  Teleworkers often want to perform remote access from third-party devices, such as  checking email from a kiosk computer at a conference. However, teleworkers typically  do not know if such devices have been secured properly or if they have been  compromised. Consequently, a teleworker could use a third-party device infected with  malware that steals information from users (e.g., passwords or email messages). Many  organizations either forbid third-party devices to be used for remote access or permit only  limited use, such as for Web-based email. Teleworkers should consider who is  responsible for securing a third-party device and who can access the device before  deciding whether or not to use it. Whenever possible, teleworkers should not use publicly  accessible third-party devices for telework, and teleworkers should avoid using any third- party devices for performing sensitive functions or accessing sensitive information.  Secure a Telework PC  Teleworkers who use their own desktop or laptop PCs for telework should secure their  operating systems and primary applications.  • Use a combination of security software, such as antivirus and antispyware  software, personal firewalls, spam and Web content filtering, and popup blocking,  to stop most attacks, particularly malware;  • Restrict who can use the PC by having a separate standard user account for each  person, assigning a password to each user account, using the standard user  accounts for daily use, and protecting user sessions from unauthorized physical  access;  • Ensure that updates and patches are regularly applied to the operating system and  primary applications, such as Web browsers, email clients, instant messaging  clients, and security software;  • Disable unneeded networking features on the PC and configure wireless  networking securely;  • Configure primary applications to filter content and stop other activity that is  likely to be malicious;  • Install and use only known and trusted software;  • Configure remote access software based on the organization’s requirements and  recommendations; and  • Maintain the PC’s security on an ongoing basis, such as changing passwords  regularly and checking the status of security software periodically.  Secure consumer devices used for telework, such as cell phones, PDAs, and video  game systems  A wide variety of consumer devices exists, and security features available for these  devices also vary widely. Some devices offer only a few basic features, whereas others  offer sophisticated features similar to those offered by PCs. This does not necessarily  imply that more security features are better; in fact, many devices offer more security  features because the capabilities they provide (e.g., wireless networking, instant  I-2  messaging) make them more susceptible to attack than devices without these capabilities.  General recommendations for securing telework devices are as follows:  • Limit access to the device, such as setting a personal identification number (PIN)  or password and automatically locking a device after an idle period;  • Disable networking capabilities, such as Bluetooth, except when they are needed;  • Use additional security software, such as antivirus software and personal  firewalls, if appropriate;  • Ensure that security updates, if available, are acquired and installed at least  monthly, or more frequently; and  • Configure applications to support security (e.g., blocking activity that is likely to  be malicious).  Secure Information  • Use physical security controls for telework devices and removable media.  For  example, an organization might require that laptops be physically secured using  cable locks when used in hotels, conferences, and other locations where third  parties could easily gain physical access to the devices. Organizations may also  have physical security requirements for papers and other non-computer media that  contain sensitive information and are taken outside the organization’s facilities.  • Encrypt files stored on telework devices and removable media such as CDs and  flash drives. This prevents attackers from readily gaining access to information in  the files. Many options exist for protecting files, including encrypting individual  files or folders, volumes, and hard drives. Generally, using an encryption method  to protect files also requires the use of an authentication mechanism (e.g.,  password) to decrypt the files when needed.  • Ensure that information stored on telework devices is backed up. If something  adverse happens to a device, such as a hardware, software, or power failure or a  natural disaster, the information on the device will be lost unless it has been  backed up to another device or removable media. Some organizations permit  teleworkers to back up their local files to a centralized system (e.g., through VPN  remote access), whereas other organizations recommend that their teleworkers  perform local backups (e.g., burning CDs, copying files onto removable media).  Teleworkers should perform backups, following their organizations’ guidelines,  and verify that the backups are valid and complete.  It is important that backups  on removable media be secured at least as well as the device that they backed up.  For example, if a computer is stored in a locked room, then the media also should  be in a secured location; if a computer stores its data encrypted, then the backups  of that data should also be encrypted.  • Ensure that information is destroyed when it is no longer needed. For example,  the organization’s files should be removed from a computer scheduled to be  retired or from a third-party computer that is temporarily used for remote access.  Some remote access methods perform basic information cleanup, such as clearing  I-3  I-4  Web browser caches that might inadvertently hold sensitive information, but more  extensive cleanup typically requires using a special utility, such as a disk- scrubbing program specifically designed to remove all traces of information from  a device.  Another example of information destruction is shredding telework  papers containing sensitive information once the papers are no longer needed.  • Erase information from missing cell phones and PDAs. If a cell phone or PDA is  lost or stolen, occasionally its contents can be erased remotely. This prevents an  attacker from obtaining any information from the device. The availability of this  service depends on the capabilities of the product and the company providing  network services for the product.  Adequately protect remote access-specific authenticators  • Teleworkers need to ensure that they adequately protect their remote access- specific authenticators, such as passwords, personal identification numbers  (PINs), and hardware tokens. Such authenticators should not be stored with the  telework computer, nor should multiple authenticators be stored with each other  (e.g., a password or PIN should not be written on the back of a hardware token).  Social Engineering  • Teleworkers should be aware of how to handle threats involving social  engineering, which is a general term for attackers trying to trick people into  revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions, such as  downloading and executing files that appear to be benign but are actually  malicious. For example, an attacker might approach a teleworker in a coffee shop  and ask to use the computer for a minute or offer to help the teleworker with using  the computer.  • Teleworkers should be wary of any requests they receive that could lead to a  security breach or to the theft of a telework device.  Handling a Security Breach  • If a teleworker suspects that a security breach (including loss or theft of materials)  has occurred involving a telework device, remote access communications,  removable media, or other telework components, the teleworker should  immediately follow the organization’s policy and procedures for reporting the  possible breach. This is particularly important if any of the affected telework  components contain sensitive information such as EPHI, so that the potential  impact of a security breach is minimized.

NIST is responsible for developing standards and guidelines,  including minimum requirements, for providing adequate information security for all agency  operations and assets, but such standards and guidelines shall not apply to national security  systems.  This guideline is consistent with the requirements of the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, Section 8b(3), Securing Agency Information Systems, as  analyzed in A-130, Appendix IV: Analysis of Key Sections. Supplemental information is  provided in A-130, Appendix III.  This guideline has been prepared for use by federal agencies.  It may also be used by  nongovernmental organizations on a voluntary basis and is not subject to copyright. (Attribution  would be appreciated by NIST.)  Nothing in this document should be taken to contradict standards and guidelines made mandatory  and binding on federal agencies by the Secretary of Commerce under statutory authority.  Nor  should these guidelines be interpreted as altering or superseding the existing authorities of the  Secretary of Commerce, Director of the OMB, or any other federal official.  There are references in this publication to documents currently under development by NIST in  accordance with responsibilities assigned to NIST under the Federal Information Security Management  Act of 2002.  The methodologies in this document may be used even before the completion of such  companion documents.  Thus, until such time as each document is completed, current requirements,  guidelines, and procedures (where they exist) remain operative.  For planning and transition purposes,  agencies may wish to closely follow the development of these new documents by NIST.

The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of electronic  protected health information (EPHI). Although FISMA applies to all federal agencies and  all information types, only a subset of agencies are subject to the HIPAA Security Rule  based on their functions and use of EPHI. All HIPAA covered entities, which include  some federal agencies, must comply with the Security Rule, which specifically focuses  on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the  Security Rule.  The EPHI that a covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits  must be protected against reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses  and/or disclosures.  In general, the requirements, standards, and implementation  specifications of the Security Rule apply to the following covered entities:  • Covered Healthcare Providers—Any provider of medical or other health services, or  supplies, who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection with  a transaction for which the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has  adopted a standard.  • Health Plans—Any individual or group plan that provides, or pays the cost of,  medical care, including certain specifically listed governmental programs (e.g., a  health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid programs).  • Healthcare Clearinghouses—A public or private entity that processes another entity’s  healthcare transactions from a standard format to a nonstandard format, or vice versa.  • Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors –A nongovernmental entity that offered  an endorsed discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act. This  fourth category of “covered entity” remained in effect until the drug card program  ended in 2006.  NIST publications, many of which are required for federal agencies, can serve as  voluntary guidelines and best practices for state, local, and tribal governments and the  private sector, and may provide enough depth and breadth to help organizations of many  sizes select the type of implementation that best fits their unique circumstances.  NIST  security standards and guidelines (Federal Information Processing Standards [FIPS],  Special Publications in the 800 series), which can be used to support the requirements of  both HIPAA and FISMA, may be used by organizations to help provide a structured, yet  flexible framework for selecting, specifying, employing, and evaluating the security  controls in information systems.  This Special Publication (SP), which discusses security considerations and resources that  may provide value when implementing the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule,  was written to:  vii  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  viii  • Help to educate readers about information security terms used in the HIPAA  Security Rule and to improve understanding of the meaning of the security  standards set out in the Security Rule;  • Direct readers to helpful information in other NIST publications on individual  topics addressed by the HIPAA Security Rule; and  • Aid readers in understanding the security concepts discussed in the HIPAA  Security Rule.

An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  1. Introduction  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is responsible for developing  standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements, used by federal agencies in  providing adequate information security for the protection of agency operations and  assets. Pursuant to this mission, NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) has  developed guidelines to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of information  technology (IT) planning, implementation, management, and operation.  NIST publishes a wide variety of publications on information security.  These  publications serve as a valuable resource for federal agencies, as well as public,  nonfederal agencies and private organizations, seeking to address existing and new  federal information security requirements.  One such set of federal information security  requirements are the security standards adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human  Services (HHS) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  (HIPAA, Public Law 104-191). HIPAA required the Secretary to adopt, among other  standards, security standards for certain health information.  These standards, known as  the HIPAA Security Rule (the Security Rule), were published on February 20, 2003.  In  the preamble to the Security Rule, several NIST publications were cited as potentially  valuable resources for readers with specific questions and concerns about IT security.  Congress enacted the Administrative Simplification (part of Title II) provisions of  HIPAA to, among other things, promote efficiency in the healthcare industry through the  use of standardized electronic transactions, while protecting the privacy and security of  health information.  Pursuant to the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA,  the Secretary of HHS adopted standards relating to:  • Electronic healthcare transactions and code sets;  • Privacy of protected health information;  • Security of electronic protected health information (EPHI); and  • Unique health identifiers.  This Special Publication summarizes the HIPAA security standards and explains some of  the structure and organization of the Security Rule. The publication helps to educate  readers about information security terms used in the HIPAA Security Rule and to  improve understanding of the meaning of the security standards set out in the Security  Rule. It is also designed to direct readers to helpful information in other NIST  publications on individual topics addressed by the HIPAA Security Rule.  Readers can  draw upon these publications for consideration in implementing the Security Rule. This  publication is intended as an aid to understanding security concepts discussed in the  HIPAA Security Rule, and does not supplement, replace, or supersede the HIPAA  Security Rule itself. While the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)  mentioned several NIST publications in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule, CMS  does not require their use in complying with the Security Rule.1  1 The HIPAA Security Rule mentions NIST documents as potentially helpful guidance but not mandatory for  compliance, at 68 Federal Register pages 8346, 8350, 8352, and 8355 (February 20, 2003).  1  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  This document addresses only the security standards of the Security Rule and not other  provisions adopted or raised by the Rule, such as 45 CFR § 164.105.  Figure 1 shows all the components of HIPAA and illustrates that the focus of this  document is on the security provisions of the statute and the regulatory rule.  Figure 1.  HIPAA Components  Readers should refer to the CMS Web site, http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HIPAAGenInfo/, for  more detailed information about the passage of HIPAA by Congress, specific provisions  of HIPAA, determination of the entities covered under the law, the complete text of the  HIPAA Security Rule, the deadline for compliance with the Rule, and enforcement  information.  1.1. Purpose and Scope  The purpose of this publication is to help educate readers about the security standards  included in the HIPAA Security Rule.  It provides a brief overview of the HIPAA  Security Rule, directs the reader to additional NIST publications on information security,  and identifies typical activities an agency should consider in implementing an  information security program.  2  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  This publication is intended as an aid to understand security concepts discussed in the  HIPAA Security Rule and does not supplement, replace, modify, or supersede the  Security Rule itself.  Anyone seeking clarifications of the HIPAA Security Rule should  contact the Office of E-Health Standards and Services (OESS) at CMS.  For general  HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the CMS HIPAA Web site at:  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/.  The NIST publications available as of the publication date of SP 800-66 Revision 1 were  used in preparing this document.  NIST frequently publishes new standards and  guidelines, or updates existing publications that may also serve as useful references. To  remain current with the latest available list of NIST security publications, the reader  should periodically review the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) Web  site at http://csrc.nist.gov.  1.2. Applicability  The guidelines provided in this publication are applicable to all federal information  systems,2 other than those systems designated as national security systems as defined in  44 United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 3542.3  The guidelines included in this  publication have been broadly developed from a technical perspective so as to be  complementary to similar guidelines issued by agencies and offices operating or  exercising control over national security systems. State, local, and tribal governments, as  well as private sector organizations composing the critical health infrastructure of the  United States are encouraged to consider using these guidelines, as appropriate.  NIST publications may be useful to any agency seeking to understand the security issues  raised by the HIPAA Security Rule regardless of that agency’s size, structure, or  distribution of security responsibilities.  Specific agency missions, resources, and  organizational structures, however, vary greatly, and agencies’ approaches to  implementing the HIPAA Security Rule may diverge significantly. Federal agencies use  different titles to identify roles that have security-related responsibilities and may also  assign particular responsibilities for implementing information security controls (those  required by HIPAA and others) differently.  NIST SP 800-66 assists all agencies seeking  further information on the security safeguards discussed in the HIPAA Security Rule,  regardless of the particular structures, methodologies, and approaches used to address its  requirements.  2 A federal information system is an information system used or operated by an executive agency, by a contractor of an  executive agency, or by another organization on behalf of an executive agency.  3 A national security system is any information system (including any telecommunications system) used or operated by  an agency or by a contractor of an agency, or other organization on behalf of an agency—(i) the function, operation, or  use of which: involves intelligence activities, involves cryptographic activities related to national security; involves  command and control of military forces; involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or  is critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions (excluding a system that is to be used for routine  administrative and business applications, for example, payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management  applications); or (ii) is protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically  authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of  national defense or foreign policy.  Agencies should consult NIST Special Publication 800-59, Guide for Identifying an  Information System as a National Security System, for guidance on determining the status of their information systems.  3  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/ http://csrc.nist.gov/  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  The preamble of the Security Rule states that HHS does not rate or endorse the use of  industry-developed guidelines and/or models.  Organizations that are not required to use  this NIST special publication (by other regulation, law, or requirement) yet choose to use  it, must determine the value of its content for implementing the Security Rule standards  in their environments.  The use of this publication or any other NIST publication does not  ensure or guarantee that an organization will be compliant with the Security Rule.  1.3.

How and Why to Use This Document  Users are encouraged to use this document as a resource that provides concepts and tools  to assist covered entities, including federal agencies, to comply with the HIPAA Security  Rule.  NIST publications, many of which are required for federal agencies, can serve as  guidelines and best practices for state, local, and tribal governments, and the private  sector, and may provide enough depth and breadth to help organizations of many sizes  select the type of implementation that best fits their unique circumstances.  This document can support the compliance efforts of covered entities in many ways,  including:  • Ensuring that each organization is selecting methods and controls which  adequately and appropriately protect EPHI of which they are the steward;  • Informing the development of compliance strategies that are in concert with the  size and structure of the entity;  • Providing guidelines on best practices for developing and implementing a Risk  Management Program; and  • Creating appropriate documentation that demonstrates effective compliance with  the HIPAA Security Rule.  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  2. Background  2.1. HIPAA Security Rule  The HIPAA Security Rule specifically focuses on the safeguarding of EPHI. Although  FISMA applies to all federal agencies and all information types, only a subset of agencies  is subject to the HIPAA Security Rule based on their functions and use of EPHI. All  HIPAA covered entities, which includes some federal agencies, must comply with the  Security Rule. The Security Rule specifically focuses on protecting the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of EPHI, as defined in the Security Rule.  The EPHI that a  covered entity creates, receives, maintains, or transmits must be protected against  reasonably anticipated threats, hazards, and impermissible uses and/or disclosures.  In  general, the requirements, standards, and implementation specifications of the Security  Rule apply to the following covered entities:  • Covered Healthcare Providers— Any provider of medical or other health services,  or supplies, who transmits any health information in electronic form in connection  with a transaction for which HHS has adopted a standard.  • Health Plans— Any individual or group plan that provides or pays the cost of  medical care (e.g., a health insurance issuer and the Medicare and Medicaid  programs).  • Healthcare Clearinghouses— A public or private entity that processes another  entity’s healthcare transactions from a standard format to a nonstandard format, or  vice versa.  • Medicare Prescription Drug Card Sponsors – A nongovernmental entity that offers  an endorsed discount drug program under the Medicare Modernization Act.  This section identifies the main goals, explains some of the structure and organization,  and identifies the purpose of the sections of the Security Rule.  2.1.1. Security Rule Goals and Objectives  As required by the “Security standards:  General rules”4 section of the HIPAA Security  Rule, each covered entity must:  • Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI that it creates, receives,  maintains, or transmits;  • Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats and hazards to the security or  integrity of EPHI; and  • Protect against reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of such information that are  not permitted by the Privacy Rule.  4 See 45 C.F.R. § 164.306(a).  6  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  In complying with this section of the Security Rule, covered entities must be aware of the  definitions provided for confidentiality, integrity, and availability as given by § 164.304:  • Confidentiality is “the property that data or information is not made available or  disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.”  • Integrity is “the property that data or information have not been altered or destroyed  in an unauthorized manner.”  • Availability is “the property that data or information is accessible and useable upon  demand by an authorized person.”  2.1.2. Security Rule Organization  To understand the requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule, it is helpful to be familiar  with the basic security terminology it uses to describe the security standards.  By  understanding the requirements and the terminology in the HIPAA Security Rule, it  becomes easier to see which NIST publications may be appropriate reference resources  and where to find more information.  The Security Rule is separated into six main  sections that each include several standards and implementation specifications that a  covered entity must address.5 The six sections are listed below.  • Security standards:  General Rules - includes the general requirements all covered  entities must meet; establishes flexibility of approach; identifies standards and  implementation specifications (both required and addressable); outlines decisions a  covered entity must make regarding addressable implementation specifications; and  requires maintenance of security measures to continue reasonable and appropriate  protection of electronic protected health information.  • Administrative Safeguards - are defined in the Security Rule as the “administrative  actions and policies, and procedures to manage the selection, development,  implementation, and maintenance of security measures to protect electronic protected  health information and to manage the conduct of the covered entity's workforce in  relation to the protection of that information.”  • Physical Safeguards - are defined as the “physical measures, policies, and  procedures to protect a covered entity's electronic information systems and related  buildings and equipment, from natural and environmental hazards, and unauthorized  intrusion.”  • Technical Safeguards - are defined as the “the technology and the policy and  procedures for its use that protect electronic protected health information and control  access to it.”  5 Sections of the HIPAA regulations that are included in the Security Rule and therefore addressed in this document but  do not have their own modules are Part 160 — General Administrative Requirements § 160.103, Definitions; Part 164  — Security and Privacy §§ 164.103, Definitions; 164.104, Applicability; 164.105, Organizational requirements  (discussed in section 4 of this document), 164.302 Applicability; 164.304, Definitions; 164.306, Security standards:  General rules (discussed in section 3.1 of this document), and 164.318, Compliance dates for the initial implementation  of the security standards.  7  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  • Organizational Requirements - includes standards for business associate contracts  and other arrangements, including memoranda of understanding between a covered  entity and a business associate when both entities are government organizations; and  requirements for group health plans.  • Policies and Procedures and Documentation Requirements - requires  implementation of reasonable and appropriate policies and procedures to comply with  the standards, implementation specifications and other requirements of the Security  Rule; maintenance of written (which may be electronic) documentation and/or  records that includes policies, procedures, actions, activities, or assessments required  by the Security Rule; and retention, availability, and update requirements related to  the documentation.  Within the Security Rule sections are standards and implementation specifications.  Each  HIPAA Security Rule standard is required.  A covered entity is required to comply with  all standards of the Security Rule with respect to all EPHI.  Many of the standards contain implementation specifications. An implementation  specification is a more detailed description of the method or approach covered entities  can use to meet a particular standard.6  Implementation specifications are either required  or addressable. However, regardless of whether a standard includes implementation  specifications, covered entities must comply with each standard.  • A required implementation specification is similar to a standard, in that a covered  entity must comply with it.  • For addressable implementation specifications, covered entities must perform an  assessment to determine whether the implementation specification is a reasonable and  appropriate safeguard for implementation in the covered entity’s environment.  In  general, after performing the assessment, a covered entity decides if it will implement  the addressable implementation specification; implement an equivalent alternative  measure that allows the entity to comply with the standard; or not implement the  addressable specification or any alternative measures, if equivalent measures are not  reasonable and appropriate within its environment.  Covered entities are required to  document these assessments and all decisions.  For federal agencies, however, all of  the HIPAA Security Rule’s addressable implementation specifications will most  likely be reasonable and appropriate safeguards for implementation, given their sizes,  missions, and resources.  Where there are no implementation specifications identified in the Security Rule for a  particular standard, such as for the “Assigned Security Responsibility” and “Evaluation”  standards, compliance with the standard itself is required.  Appendix D of this document provides a crosswalk of the HIPAA Security Rule  standards and implementation specifications to relevant NIST publications and security  controls detailed in NIST SP 800-53.  6 For more information on the required analysis used to determine the manner of implementation of an implementation  specification, see § 164.306(d) of the HIPAA Security Rule (Security standards — General rules: Flexibility of  approach).  8  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  9  For general HIPAA Security Rule information, visit the CMS HIPAA Web site at  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SecurityStandard/.  2.2. NIST and its Role in Information Security  Founded in 1901, NIST is a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of  Commerce.  NIST’s mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness  by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance  economic security and improve our quality of life.  NIST is composed of several  laboratories that conduct research in a wide variety of physical and engineering sciences.  Lab researchers respond to industry needs for measurement methods, tools, data, and  technology, and collaborate with colleagues in industry, academic institutions, and other  government agencies.  The Computer Security Division (CSD), a component within NIST’s Information  Technology Laboratory (ITL), provides standards and technology to protect information  systems against threats to the confidentiality of information, the integrity of information  and processes, and the availability of information and services in order to build trust and  confidence in IT systems.  CSD develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal  agencies in implementing the requirements of FISMA and in managing cost-effective  security programs to protect their information and information systems.  Table 1  identifies and describes the types of NIST publications.  Table 1: NIST Publication Types  Publication Type Description  Federal Information  Processing Standards  (FIPS)  Developed by NIST in accordance with FISMA.  They are  approved by the Secretary of Commerce and are compulsory and  binding for federal agencies.  Since FISMA requires that federal  agencies comply with these standards, agencies may not waive their  use.  FIPS may be used voluntarily by nonfederal organizations  (e.g., state/local/tribal governments, industry).  Special Publication (SP)  800-series  Reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in  information system security and its collaborative activities with  industry, government, and academia.

A Framework for Managing Risk  The HIPAA Security Rule is all about implementing effective risk management to  adequately and effectively protect EPHI.  The assessment, analysis, and management of  risk provides the foundation of a covered entity’s Security Rule compliance efforts,  serving as tools to develop and maintain a covered entity’s strategy to protect the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.  All EPHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by a covered entity is subject to  the Security Rule.  Covered entities are required to implement reasonable and appropriate  security measures to protect against reasonably anticipated threats or vulnerabilities to the  security of EPHI.  Under the Security Rule, covered entities are required to evaluate risks  and vulnerabilities in their environments and to implement security controls to address  those risks and vulnerabilities.  The selection and specification of security controls can be accomplished as part of an  organization-wide information security program that involves the management of  organizational risk - that is, the risk to information, individuals, and the organization as a  whole.  The management of risk is a key element in the organization's information  security program and provides an effective framework for selecting the appropriate  security controls for an information system - the security controls necessary to protect  individuals and the operations and assets of the organization.  This section describes a process of managing risk to organizational missions and business  functions that arise from the operation and use of information systems by discussing each  phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework7 and providing a mapping of this  framework to complementary requirements of the HIPAA Security Rule.  3.1. NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)  The NIST RMF, illustrated in Figure 2, provides the covered entity with a disciplined,  structured, extensible, and repeatable process for achieving risk-based protection related  to the operation and use of information systems and the protection of EPHI.  It represents  an information security life cycle that facilitates continuous monitoring and improvement  in the security state of the information systems within the organization.  The activities that compose the NIST RMF are paramount to an effective information  security program and can be applied to both new and legacy information systems within  the context of a system development life cycle.  A risk-based approach to security control  selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to  applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations.  The flexible nature of the NIST RMF allows other communities of interest (e.g., state,  local, and tribal governments and private sector entities) to use the framework voluntarily  either with the NIST security standards and guidelines or with industry-specific standards  and guidelines.  The RMF provides organizations with the flexibility needed to apply the  right security controls to the right information systems at the right time to adequately  7 NIST Special Publication 800-39, Managing Risk from Information Systems: An Organizational Perspective, (Second  Public Draft), April 2008.  10  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  Security Rule  11  protect the critical and sensitive information, missions, and business functions of the  organization.

The NIST RMF and Links to the Security Rule  The NIST RMF consists of six steps that are paramount to the effective management of  risk resulting from the operation and use of information systems.  Many Security Rule  standards and implementation specifications correspond to the steps of the NIST RMF.  Using these corresponding requirements in an integrated fashion can provide a  methodical, repeatable, risk-based approach for selecting, specifying, and implementing  security controls to adequately protect EPHI.  Table 2 describes each step in the NIST  RMF as well as the related standards and implementation specifications found in the  Security Rule.

This exercise aids in  determining priorities for organizational information  systems and subsequently applying appropriate measures to  adequately protect the organizational missions and business  functions supported by those missions.  The security  controls applied to a particular information system should  be commensurate with the potential impact on  organizational operations and assets, individuals, or other  organizations should there be a loss of confidentiality,  integrity, or availability.  Identify assets and information systems that create, receive,  transmit, or maintain EPHI.  Related Standards and Implementation Specifications:  164.308(a)(1)(i) – Security Management Process  Select Security Controls Security control selection, the second step in the RMF,  employs FIPS 200 and NIST SP 800-53 to identify and  specify appropriate security controls for the information  system.  The selection of security controls for an  organization’s mission/business processes and the  information systems supporting those processes is a risk  mitigation activity.  The security control selection process  consists of three activities:  • Selection of baseline security controls for each  information system from NIST SP 800-53 in  accordance with FIPS 199 impact levels determined  during the security categorization process;  • Application of security control tailoring guidance for  the information systems to allow organizations to  adjust the initial security control baselines with respect  to specific mission and business processes,  Select the standards and required implementation  specifications as the initial security control set.  These  required security controls establish the baseline from which  to assess risk to EPHI.  Once the baseline is established, perform a risk assessment  and analysis to evaluate whether the standards and required  implementation specifications alone are reasonable and  appropriate to provide adequate protection against reasonably  anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity,  or availability of EPHI.  The results of this risk assessment  and analysis will drive the selection of addressable  implementation specifications to adequately supplement the  baseline.  Supplement the initial set of standards and required  implementation specifications (baseline) with addressable  implementation specifications.  The decisions to supplement  12  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule  RMF Phase RMF Step Description Security Rule Link  organizational requirements, and environments of  operations; and  • Supplementation of tailored baseline security controls  with additional controls based on an assessment of risk  and local conditions including specific and credible  threat information, organization-specific security  requirements, cost-benefit analyses, and special  circumstances.  Key to this process is documenting the selection and  specification of security controls.  A documented security  plan provides an overview of the security requirements for  the information systems within the organization and  describes the security controls in place or planned for  meeting those requirements.  Additionally, the security  plans for organizational information systems describe how  individual security controls are implemented within  specific operational environments.  It is important for organizations to document the decisions  taken during the security control selection process,  providing a sound rationale for those decisions.  The  resulting set of security controls along with the supporting  rationale for security control selection decisions and any  information system use restrictions are documented in the  security plans for the information system.  This provides a  clear description of the risk mitigation deemed necessary in  order to adequately ensure mission accomplishment and  success of business functions potentially impacted by the  operation and use of the systems.  the security control baseline should be based on an  assessment of risk and local conditions including  organization-specific security requirements, specific threat  information, cost-benefit analyses, or special circumstances.  The agreed-upon set of security controls will consist of the  standards, required implementation specifications, and the  risk-based selection of addressable implementation  specifications.  Each covered entity must document the security controls  determined to be reasonable and appropriate, including  analysis, decisions, and rationale for decisions made to refine  or adjust the security controls  Related Standards and Implementation Specifications:  164.308(a)(1)(i) – Security Management Process  164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) – Risk Analysis  164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) – Risk Management  164.316(b)(1) – Documentation  164.316(b)(2)(ii) – Updates  Implement Security Controls Security control implementation, the third step in the RMF,  employs enterprise architectures, the System Development  Lifecycle (SDLC), and various NIST publications to guide  the implementation of security controls in organizational  information systems.

Related Standards and Implementation Specifications:  164.308(a)(1)(ii)(B) – Risk Management  Monitor Security State Threats and vulnerabilities to an operating environment, as  well as safeguards designed to combat them, can change  frequently.  The assessment and evaluation of security  controls on a continuous basis provides oversight and  monitoring of the security controls to ensure that they  continue to operate effectively and as intended.  Monitor and assess selected security controls in the  information system on a continuous basis including  documenting changes to the system, conducting security  impact analyses of the changes, and reporting the system  security status to appropriate organizational officials on a  regular basis.  A covered entity must periodically review and update its  security measures and documentation in response to  environmental and operational changes that affect security of  its EPHI.

Considerations when Applying the HIPAA Security Rule  In this section, security measures from NIST publications that are relevant to each section of the  Security Rule are presented.  Each standard is presented in a consistent tabular format.  The following tables, organized by HIPAA Security Rule standard, are designed to initiate the  thought process for implementing the requirements of the Security Rule.  These tables highlight  information a covered entity may wish to consider when implementing the Security Rule; they  are not meant to be prescriptive.  The tables may also not be considered all-inclusive of the  information available in NIST publications.  In addition to the HIPAA Security Rule standard name and description, each table includes the  following information:  • Key Activities - The Key Activities column suggests, for each HIPAA Security Rule  standard, actions that are usually associated with the security function or functions suggested  by that standard.  Some of these key activities are also the implementation specifications for  that particular standard.  Each key activity that is also an implementation specification has  been identified as such in the table (in italics in the Description section of the table), along  with a note as to whether the implementation specification is required or addressable. Other  key activities would normally be performed as part of one or more of the related  implementation specifications under the standard, but are listed separately for clarity of  presentation. Where such a relationship exists, it is indicated in an accompanying footnote.  Other key activities are not implementation specifications.  These activities are not  specifically discussed or required by the HIPAA Security Rule, and their inclusion here is in  no way meant to expand upon the intent or requirements of the Security Rule.  Many of these  activities, however, are usually included in a robust security process, and many will be  required of federal entities under other federal laws, regulations, or procedures that may or  may not be discussed within this document.  The tables address all HIPAA Security Rule standards and all associated implementation  specifications, both required and addressable.  Seven of the standards include all the  necessary instructions for implementation and have no associated implementation  specifications.8  However, as noted earlier in this document, even if there are no  implementation specifications outlined in the Security Rule, such as with Assigned Security  Responsibility and Evaluation, compliance with the standard itself is still required.  The key activities are illustrative and not all-inclusive. There may be many additional  activities an organization will need to consider, specific to its own operations, which are not  included in the key activities of the tables.  Each entity will need to identify what activities  beyond those listed in the tables are necessary and appropriate in its environment, implement  those activities, and document them.  8 Standards that do not contain implementation specifications—that “themselves also serve as the implementation specification,”  as stated in the preamble to the HIPAA Security Rule—are those described in Sections 4.2 (HIPAA Standard: Assigned Security  Responsibility); 4.8 (HIPAA Standard: Evaluation); 4.11 (HIPAA Standard: Workstation Use); 4.12 (HIPAA Standard:  Workstation Security), 4.15 (HIPAA Standard: Audit Controls); 4.17 (HIPAA Standard: Person or Entity Authentication); and  4.21 (HIPAA Standard: Policies and Procedures).  15  An Introductory Resource Guide for Implementing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule  16  The tables are meant to serve as only a general introduction to the security topics raised by  the HIPAA Security Rule.  For more detailed information about the key activities, consult  one or more NIST publications referenced for the subject HIPAA standard.  • Description - The Description column in each table includes an expanded explanation about  the key activities.  The descriptions include types of activities an organization may pursue in  addressing a specific security function. These are abbreviated explanations designed to help  get an organization started in addressing the HIPAA Security Rule.  The first description  bullet of each key activity that is also an implementation specification includes the Security  Rule implementation specification text in italics. When relationships exist between  description bullets and other Security Rule standards or implementation specifications, it is  indicated in an accompanying footnote.  • Sample Questions - The Sample Questions column includes some questions to determine  whether or not the elements described have actually been considered or completed.  These  sample questions are not exhaustive but merely indicative of relevant questions that could be  asked.  Affirmative answers to these questions do not imply that an organization is meeting  all of the requirements of the HIPAA security standards.  Negative answers to these  questions should prompt the covered entity to consider whether it needs to take further action  in order to comply with the standards.  In fact, it is expected that many organizations with  existing information security infrastructure already in place will have considered most of the  Sample Questions.  The questions an organization asks in assessing and developing its  security program should be tailored to fit the unique circumstances of each entity.  This document does not discuss Section 164.105 of the HIPAA Security Rule, Organizational  Requirements, in detail as they do not set out general security principles.  HIPAA covered  entities are encouraged to review this section of the HIPAA Security Rule in full and seek further  guidance.

Additionally, this catalog crosswalks, or maps,  those Security Rule standards and implementation specifications to NIST publications  relevant to each Security Rule standard, and to applicable security controls detailed in  NIST SP 800-53, Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems.  Readers may draw upon these NIST publications and security controls for consideration  in implementing the Security Rule.  The catalog is organized according to the categorization of standards within each of the  safeguards sections in the Security Rule.  Table 3 provides an overview of the catalog  content.  Table 3. Overview of Catalog Content  Column Headers Description  Section of HIPAA Security Rule  Indicates the regulatory citation to the appropriate section of the  Security Rule where the standard and implementation  specification can be found.  Standards Lists the Security Rule Standards.  Implementation Specifications  Lists the implementation specifications associated with the  standard, if any exist, and designates the specification as  required or addressable.  (R = Required, A = Addressable)  NIST SP 800-53 Security Controls  Mapping  Provides a listing of NIST SP 800-53 security controls that may  provide value when implementing the particular standards and  implementation specifications.  For full security control  specifications, refer to NIST SP 800-53, which can be found  online at http://csrc.nist.gov.  NIST Publications Crosswalk  Provides a listing of NIST publications that support each  particular standard.  Publications are listed by publication  number.  For the full publication title, refer to Appendix C:  References within this document, or to the Guide to NIST  Information Security Documents located on the NIST Computer  Security Resource Center (CSRC) Web site at  http://csrc.nist.gov.  The mapping of SP 800-53 security controls to Security Rule standards and  implementation specifications is of particular importance because it allows for the  traceability of legislative and regulatory directives, such as HIPAA and FISMA, to  underlying technical security configurations.  This mapping can also enable standards- based measurement and monitoring of technical security safeguards and computer  security configurations; facilitate compliance management by automating portions of  D-1  http://csrc.nist.gov/ http://csrc.nist.gov/  D-2  compliance demonstration and reporting; and reduce the chance of misinterpretation  between auditors and operations teams.  To accomplish this automation, NIST has defined, and maintains, the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP),121 a suite of selected and integrated open standards that  enable standards-based communication of vulnerability data, customizing and managing  configuration baselines for various IT products, assessing information systems and  reporting compliance status, using standard measures to weigh and aggregate potential  vulnerability impact, and remediating identified vulnerabilities.  121 More information on the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is available on the National Vulnerability  Web site, http://nvd.nist.gov.  http://nvd.nist.gov/  Table 4.

PL-3  NIST SP 800-18  NIST SP 800-53  NIST SP 800-53A  Appendix E: Risk Assessment Guidelines  This appendix incorporates risk assessment concepts and processes described in NIST SP  800-30 Revision 1, Effective Use of Risk Assessments in Managing Enterprise Risk, the  NIST Risk Management Framework, and the HIPAA Security Series: Basics of Risk  Analysis and Risk Management. It is intended to assist covered entities in identifying and  mitigating risks to acceptable levels.  The purpose of a risk assessment is to identify conditions where EPHI could be disclosed  without proper authorization, improperly modified, or made unavailable when needed.  This information is then used to make risk management decisions on whether the  HIPAA-required implementation specifications are sufficient or what additional  addressable implementation specifications are needed to reduce risk to an acceptable  level.  Key Terms Defined  When talking about risk, it is important that terminology be defined and clearly  understood.  This section defines important terms associated with risk assessment and  management.  • Risk is the potential impact that a threat can have on the confidentiality, integrity,  and availability on EPHI by exploiting a vulnerability.  • Threats are anything that can have a negative impact on EPHI.  Threats are:  o Intentional (e.g., malicious intent); or  o Unintentional (e.g., misconfigured server, data entry error).  • Threat sources are:  o Natural (e.g., floods, earthquakes, storms, tornados);  o Human (e.g., intentional such as identity thieves, hackers, spyware  authors; unintentional such as data entry error, accidental deletions); or  o Environmental (e.g., power surges and spikes, hazmat contamination,  environmental pollution).  • Vulnerabilities are a flaw or weakness in a system security procedure, design,  implementation, or control that could be intentionally or unintentionally exercised  by a threat.  • Impact is a negative quantitative and/or qualitative assessment of a vulnerability  being exercised on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of EPHI.  It can be easy to confuse vulnerabilities and threats.  An organization may be vulnerable  to damage from power spikes.  The threats that could exploit this vulnerability may be  overloaded circuits, faulty building wiring, dirty street power, or too much load on the  local grid.  It is important to separate these two terms in order to assist in proper security  control selection.  In this example, security controls could range from installing UPS  systems, additional fuse boxes, or standby generators, or rewiring the office.  These  E-1  additional security controls may help to mitigate the vulnerability but not necessarily for  each threat.  HIPAA Risk Assessment Requirements  Standard 164.308(a)(1)(i), Security Management Process, requires covered entities to:  Implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct  security violations.  The Security Management Process standard includes four required implementation  specifications.  Two of these specifications deal directly with risk analysis and risk  management.  1. Risk Analysis (R123) – 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A): Conduct an accurate and thorough  assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information held by the  covered entity.  2. Risk Management (R) – 163.308(a)(1)(ii)(B): Implement security measures  sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level  to comply with Section 164.306(a).  How to Conduct the Risk Assessment:  Risk assessments can be conducted using many different methodologies.  There is no  single methodology that will work for all organizations and all situations.  The following  steps represent key elements in a comprehensive risk assessment program, and provide an  example of the risk assessment methodology described in NIST SP 800-30.  It is  expected that these steps will be customized to most effectively identify risk for an  organization based on its own uniqueness.  Even though these items are listed as steps,  they are not prescriptive in the order that they should be conducted.  Some steps can be  conducted simultaneously rather than sequentially.  1. Scope the Assessment.  The first step in assessing risk is to define the scope of  the effort, resulting in a general characterization of the information system, its  operating environment, and its boundary.  To do this, it is necessary to identify  where EPHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.  The scope of a risk assessment should include both the physical boundaries of a  covered entity’s location as well as a logical boundary covering the media  containing EPHI, regardless of its location.  Ensure that the risk assessment scope  takes into consideration the remote work force and telecommuters, and removable  media and portable computing devices (e.g., laptops, removable media, and  backup media).  2. Gather Information.  During this step, the covered entity should identify:  • The conditions under which EPHI is created, received, maintained,  processed, or transmitted by the covered entity; and  123 “R” indicates a required implementation specification.  E-2  • The security controls currently being used to protect the EPHI.  This step is essential to ensure that vulnerabilities and threats are correctly  identified.  For example, an invalidated belief that a policy is being followed can  miss a potential vulnerability, and not knowing about portable media containing  EPHI can miss a threat to that environment.  The level of effort needed to gather  the necessary information depends heavily on the scope of the assessment and the  size of the covered entity.  3. Identify Realistic Threats.  Often performed simultaneously with step 4, Identify  Potential Vulnerabilities, the goal of this step is to identify the potential threat  sources and compile a threat statement listing potential threat-sources that are  applicable to the covered entity and its operating environment.  The listing of  threat sources should include realistic and probable human and natural incidents  that can have a negative impact on an organizations ability to protect EPHI.  Threats can be easily identified by examining the environments where EPHI is  being used.  Many external sources can be used for threat identification.  Internet searches,  vendor information, insurance data, and crime statistics are all viable sources of  threat data.  Examples of some common threat sources are listed in Table 5 below.  Table 5. Common Threat Sources  Type Examples  Natural Floods, earthquakes, tornados, landslides, avalanches, electrical  storms, and other such events  Human Events that are either enabled by or caused by human beings,  such as unintentional acts (inadvertent data entry) or deliberate  actions (network-based attacks, malicious software upload, and  unauthorized access to confidential information)  Environmental Long-term power failure, pollution, chemicals, liquid leak  4. Identify Potential Vulnerabilities.  Often performed simultaneously with step 3,  Identify Realistic Threats, the goal of this step is to develop a list of  vulnerabilities (flaws or weaknesses) that could be exploited by potential threat  sources.  This list should focus on realistic technical and nontechnical areas where  EPHI can be disclosed without proper authorization, improperly modified, or  made unavailable when needed.  Covered entities should use internal and external sources to identify potential  vulnerabilities.  Internal sources may include previous risk assessments,  vulnerability scan and system security test results, and audit reports.  External  sources may include Internet searches, vendor information, insurance data, and  vulnerability databases such as the National Vulnerability Database  (http://nvd.nist.gov).  At the end of this appendix, a suggested (but not all- inclusive) source list is provided that organizations may wish to use to help in  vulnerability identification.  E-3  http://nvd.nist.gov/  5. Assess Current Security Controls. Often performed simultaneously with step 2,  Gather Information, the purpose of this step is to determine if the implemented or  planned security controls will minimize or eliminate risks to EPHI.  A thorough  understanding of the actual security controls in place for a covered entity will  reduce the list of vulnerabilities, as well as the realistic probability, of a threat  attacking (intentionally or unintentionally) EPHI.  Covered entities should evaluate technical and nontechnical security controls at  all places where EPHI is created, received, maintained, processed, or transmitted.  This evaluation should determine whether the security measures implemented or  planned are adequate to protect EPHI, and whether those measures required by  the Security Rule are in place, configured, and used properly.  The  appropriateness and adequacy of security measures may vary depending on the  structure, size, and geographical dispersion of the covered entity.  6. Determine the Likelihood and the Impact of a Threat Exercising a  Vulnerability.  The next major step in measuring the level of risk is to determine  the likelihood and the adverse impact resulting from a threat successfully  exploiting a vulnerability.  This information can be obtained from existing  organizational documentation, such as business impact and asset criticality  assessments.  A business impact assessment prioritizes the impact levels  associated with the compromise of an organization’s information assets based on  a qualitative or quantitative assessment of the sensitivity and criticality of those  assets. An asset criticality assessment identifies and prioritizes the sensitive and  critical organization information assets (e.g., hardware, software, systems,  services, and related technology assets) that support the organization’s critical  missions.  If these organizational documents do not exist, the system and data sensitivity can  be determined based on the level of protection required to maintain the EPHI’s  confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The adverse impact of a security event  can be described in terms of loss or degradation of any, or a combination of any,  of the following three security objectives: integrity, availability, and  confidentiality.  Table 6 provides a brief description of each security objective  and the consequence (or impact) of its not being met.  Table 6.  Security Objectives and Impacts  Security Objective Impacts  Loss of Confidentiality System and data confidentiality refers to the protection of  information from unauthorized disclosure. The impact of  unauthorized disclosure of confidential information can range  from the jeopardizing of national security to the disclosure of  Privacy Act data. Unauthorized, unanticipated, or unintentional  disclosure could result in loss of public confidence,  embarrassment, or legal action against the organization.  E-4  Security Objective Impacts  Loss of Integrity System and data integrity refers to the requirement that  information be protected from improper modification. Integrity  is lost if unauthorized changes are made to the data or IT system  by either intentional or accidental acts. If the loss of system or  data integrity is not corrected, continued use of the  contaminated system or corrupted data could result in  inaccuracy, fraud, or erroneous decisions. Also, violation of  integrity may be the first step in a successful attack against  system availability or confidentiality. For all these reasons, loss  of integrity reduces the assurance of an IT system.  Loss of Availability If a mission-critical IT system is unavailable to its end users, the  organization’s mission may be affected. Loss of system  functionality and operational effectiveness, for example, may  result in loss of productive time, thus impeding the end users’  performance of their functions in supporting the organization’s  mission.  Some tangible impacts can be measured quantitatively in terms of lost revenue,  the cost of repairing the system, or the level of effort required to correct problems  caused by a successful threat action.  Other impacts, such as the loss of public  confidence, the loss of credibility, or damage to an organization’s interest, cannot  be measured in specific units but can be qualified or described in terms of high,  medium, and low impacts.  Qualitative and quantitative methods can be used to  measure the impact of a threat occurring  7. Determine the Level of Risk.  The purpose of this step is to assess the level of  risk to the IT system.  The determination of risk takes into account the  information gathered and determinations made during the previous steps.  The  level of risk is determined by analyzing the values assigned to the likelihood of  threat occurrence and resulting impact of threat occurrence.  The risk-level  determination may be performed by assigning a risk level based on the average of  the assigned likelihood and impact levels.  A risk-level matrix, such as the sample  depicted in Table 7, can be used to assist in determining risk levels.  Table 7.  Sample Risk-Level Matrix  Impact  Threat Likelihood  Low Moderate High  High Low Moderate High  Moderate Low Moderate Moderate  Low Low Low Low  E-5  8. Recommend Security Controls.  During this step, security controls that could  mitigate the identified risks, as appropriate to the organization’s operations, are  recommended.  The goal of the recommended controls is to reduce the level of  risk to the IT system and its data to an acceptable level.  Security control  recommendations provide input to the risk mitigation process, during which the  recommended security controls are evaluated, prioritized, and implemented.  It should be noted that not all possible recommended security controls can be  implemented to reduce loss.  To determine which ones are required and  appropriate for a specific organization, a cost-benefit analysis should be  conducted for the proposed recommended controls, to demonstrate that the costs  of implementing the controls can be justified by the reduction in the level of risk.  In addition to cost, organizations should consider the operational impact and  feasibility of introducing the recommended security controls into the operating  environment.  9. Document the Risk Assessment Results.  Once the risk assessment has been completed (threat sources and vulnerabilities  identified, risks assessed, and security controls recommended), the results of each  step in the risk assessment should be documented.  NIST SP 800-30 provides a  sample risk assessment report outline that may prove useful to covered entities.  Risk Assessment Results Affect Risk Management  The results of a risk assessment play a significant role in executing an organization’s risk  management strategy.  In the context of the HIPAA Security Rule, the security control  baseline, which consists of the standards and required implementation specifications,  should be viewed as the foundation or starting point in the selection of adequate security  controls necessary to protect EPHI.  In many cases, additional security controls or control  enhancements will be needed to protect EPHI or to satisfy the requirements of applicable  laws, policies, standards, or regulations.  The risk assessment provides important inputs to determine the sufficiency of the security  control baseline.  The risk assessment results, coupled with the security control baseline,  should be used to identify which addressable implementation specifications should be  implemented to adequately mitigate identified risks.  Risk Assessment Resources  The following resources may provide useful information to assist covered entities in  performing risk assessment, analysis, and management activities, and demonstrate  compliance with the Security Management Process standard and related implementation  specifications:  • HIPAA Security Series,  Basics of Risk Analysis and Risk Management, 6/2005:  rev. 3/2007;  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/Downloads/BasicsofRiskAnalysisan dRiskManagement.pdf  E-6  http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/Downloads/BasicsofRiskAnalysisandRiskManagement.pdf http://www.cms.hhs.gov/EducationMaterials/Downloads/BasicsofRiskAnalysisandRiskManagement.pdf  E-7  • NIST SP 800-30, Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems;  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf  • Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Infrastructure Protection Plan;  http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/editorial_0827.shtm  • NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD); http://nvd.nist.gov/  • US-CERT; http://www.us-cert.gov/index.html  • Carnegie Mellon CERT Coordination Center; http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf http://www.dhs.gov/xprevprot/programs/editorial_0827.shtm http://nvd.nist.gov/ http://www.us-cert.gov/index.html http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/  Appendix F: Contingency Planning Guidelines  Information technology (IT) and automated information systems are vital elements in  most business processes. Because these IT resources are so essential to an organization’s  success, it is critical that the services provided by these systems are able to operate  effectively without excessive interruption. Contingency planning supports this  requirement by establishing thorough plans and procedures and technical measures that  can enable a system to be recovered quickly and effectively following a service  disruption or disaster.  Interim measures may include the relocation of IT systems and  operations to an alternate site, the recovery of IT functions using alternate equipment, or  the performance of IT functions using manual methods.  IT systems are vulnerable to a variety of disruptions, ranging from mild (e.g., short-term  power outage, disk drive failure) to severe (e.g., equipment destruction, fire).  Vulnerabilities may be minimized or eliminated through technical, management, or  operational solutions as part of the organization’s risk management effort.  However, it is  virtually impossible to completely eliminate all risks.  Contingency planning is designed  to mitigate the risk of system and service unavailability by focusing efficient and  effective recovery solutions.  Within the context of HIPAA, the goal of contingency planning is to adequately protect  EPHI during a contingency event, and to ensure that organizations have their EPHI  available when it is needed.  This appendix, Contingency Planning Guidelines, will identify fundamental planning  principles and practices to help personnel develop and maintain effective information  system contingency plans.  This section will be based on NIST Special Publication 800- 34, Contingency Planning Guide for Information Technology Systems.  Contingency Planning Defined  IT contingency planning refers to a coordinated strategy involving plans, procedures, and  technical measures that enable the recovery of IT systems, operations, and data after a  disruption. Contingency planning generally includes one or more of the approaches to  restore disrupted IT services:  • Restoring IT operations at an alternate location;  • Recovering IT operations using alternate equipment; and  F-1  • Performing some or all of the affected business processes using non-IT (manual)  means (typically acceptable for only short-term disruptions).  Types of Contingency-Related Plans  IT contingency planning represents a broad scope of activities designed to sustain and  recover critical IT services following an emergency. IT contingency planning fits into a  much broader emergency preparedness environment that includes organizational and  business process continuity and recovery planning. Ultimately, an organization would use  a suite of plans to properly prepare response, recovery, and continuity activities for  disruptions affecting the organization’s IT systems, business processes, and the facility.  Because there is an inherent relationship between an IT system and the business process  it supports, there should be coordination between each plan during development and  updates to ensure that recovery strategies and supporting resources neither negate each  other nor duplicate efforts.  Table 8. Types of Contingency Plans  Type of Plan Description Scope  Contingency Plan (CP) Management policy and  procedures designed to maintain or  restore business operations,  including computer operations,  possibly at an alternate location, in  the event of emergencies, system  failures, or disaster.  Addresses IT system disruptions;  not typically business process- focused  Continuity of Operations Plan  (COOP)  A predetermined set of instructions  or procedures that describe how an  organization’s essential functions  will be sustained for up to 30 days  as a result of a disaster event  before returning to normal  operations.

Limited to major disruptions with  long-term effects; typically IT- focused  HIPAA Contingency Planning Requirements  Standard 164.308(a)(7), Contingency Plan, requires covered entities to:  Establish (and implement as needed) policies and procedures for responding to  an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure,  and natural disaster) that damages systems that contain electronic protected  health information  The Contingency Plan standard includes five implementation specifications.  F-2  1. Data Backup Plan (R) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(A): Establish and implement  procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of electronic protected  health information.  2. Disaster Recovery Plan (R) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(B): Establish (and implement as  needed) procedures to restore any loss of data.  3. Emergency Mode Operation Plan (R) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(C): Establish (and  implement as needed) procedures to enable continuation of critical business  processes for protection of the security of electronic protected health information  while operating in emergency mode.  4. Testing and Revision Procedures (A) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(D): Implement  procedures for periodic testing and revision of contingency plans.  5. Applications and Data Criticality Analysis (A) – 164.308(a)(7)(ii)(E): Assess  the relative criticality of specific applications and data in support of other  contingency plan components.  IT Contingency Planning Process  To develop and maintain an effective IT contingency plan, organizations should consider  using the approach discussed in NIST SP 800-34, Contingency Planning Guide for  Information Technology Systems, which proposes a step-by-step contingency planning  process, and provides an in-depth discussion of technical contingency planning  considerations for specific types of information technology systems. A summary of this  process is detailed below.  1. Develop the Contingency Planning Policy Statement. To be effective and to  ensure that personnel fully understand the agency’s contingency planning  requirements, the contingency plan must be based on a clearly defined policy  supported by organizational leadership.  The contingency planning policy  statement should define the organization’s overall contingency objectives and  establish the organizational framework and responsibilities for IT contingency  planning.  Key policy elements include:  • Roles and responsibilities  • Scope as applies to the type(s) of platform(s) and organization functions  subject to contingency planning  • Resource requirements  • Training requirements  • Exercise and testing, and plan maintenance schedules  • Frequency of backups and storage of backup media.  2. Conduct the Business Impact Analysis (BIA).  The BIA is a key step in the  contingency planning process.  The BIA enables the organization to fully  characterize information system requirements, processes, and interdependencies  and use this information to determine contingency requirements and priorities.  F-3  The purpose of the BIA is to correlate specific system components with the  critical services that they provide and, based on that information, to characterize  the consequences of a disruption to the system components. Key steps include  identifying critical IT resources, disruption impacts and allowable outage times,  and developing recovery priorities.  Results from the BIA should be appropriately  incorporated into the analysis and strategy development efforts for the  organization’s other continuity and recovery plans, including disaster recovery  and emergency mode operations plans.  3. Identify Preventive Controls.  In some cases, the outage impacts identified in  the BIA may be mitigated or eliminated through preventive measures that deter,  detect, and/or reduce impacts to the system.  Where feasible and cost-effective,  preventive methods are preferable to actions that may be necessary to recover the  system after a disruption.  Preventive controls should be documented in the  contingency plan, and personnel associated with the system should be trained on  how and when to use the controls.  A variety of preventive controls are available, depending on system type and  configuration; however, some common measures are listed below:  • Appropriately sized uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to provide  short-term backup power to all system components (including  environmental and safety controls)  • Gasoline- or diesel-powered generators to provide long-term backup  power  • Air-conditioning systems with adequate excess capacity to permit failure  of certain components, such as a compressor  • Fire suppression systems  • Fire and smoke detectors  • Water sensors in the computer room ceiling and floor  • Plastic tarps that may be unrolled over IT equipment to protect it from  water damage  • Heat-resistant and waterproof containers for backup media and vital  nonelectronic records  • Emergency master system shutdown switch  • Offsite storage of backup media, nonelectronic records, and system  documentation  • Technical security controls, such as cryptographic key management and  least-privilege access controls  • Frequent scheduled backups.  F-4  4. Develop Recovery Strategies.  Recovery strategies provide a means to restore IT  operations quickly and effectively following a service disruption.  Strategies  should address disruption impacts and allowable outage times identified in the  BIA.  Several alternatives should be considered when developing the strategy,  including cost, allowable outage time, security, and integration with larger  organization-level contingency plans.  The selected recovery strategy should address the potential impacts identified in  the BIA and should be integrated into the system architecture during the design  and implementation phases of the system life cycle.  The strategy should include a combination of methods that complement one  another to provide recovery capability over the full spectrum of incidents, ranging  from minor service disruption to a partial or total loss of primary system  operations requiring operational resumption at another location.  A wide variety  of recovery approaches may be considered; the appropriate choice depends on the  incident, type of system, and its operational requirements, including retention  requirements.  Specific recovery methods may include commercial contracts with  cold, warm, or hot site vendors, mobile sites, mirrored sites, reciprocal  agreements with internal or external organizations, and service-level agreements  (SLAs) with the equipment vendors.  In addition, high-availability technologies  such as Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID), automatic fail-over,  uninterruptible power supply (UPS), mirrored systems, and multisite data  archiving systems should be considered when developing a system recovery  strategy.  5. Develop an IT Contingency Plan.  IT contingency plan development is a critical  step in the process of implementing a comprehensive contingency planning  program.  The plan contains detailed roles, responsibilities, teams, and procedures  associated with restoring an IT system following a disruption.  The contingency  plan should document technical capabilities designed to support contingency  operations.  Plans need to balance detail with flexibility; usually the more detailed  the plan, the less scalable and versatile the approach.  Following the approach described in NIST SP 800-34, the contingency plan  comprises five main components: Supporting Information, Notification and  Activation, Recovery, Reconstitution, and Plan Appendices. The first and last  components provide essential information to ensure a comprehensive plan. The  Notification and Activation, Recovery, and Reconstitution phases address specific  actions that the organization should take following a system disruption or  emergency.  • The Supporting Information component includes an introduction and  concept of operations section that provides essential background or  contextual information that makes the contingency plan easier to  understand, implement, and maintain. These details aid in understanding  the applicability of the guidance, in making decisions on how to use the  plan, and in providing information on where associated plans and  information outside the scope of the plan may be found.  F-5  • The Notification and Activation Phase defines the initial actions taken  once a system disruption or emergency has been detected or appears to be  imminent.  This phase includes activities to notify recovery personnel,  assess system damage, and implement the plan.  At the completion of the  Notification and Activation Phase, recovery staff will be prepared to  perform contingency measures to restore system functions on a temporary  basis.  • The Recovery Phase begins after the contingency plan has been activated,  damage assessment has been completed (if possible), personnel have been  notified, and appropriate teams have been mobilized.  Recovery phase  activities focus on contingency measures to execute temporary IT  processing capabilities, repair damage to the original system, and restore  operational capabilities at the original or new facility. At the completion of  the Recovery Phase, the IT system will be operational and performing the  functions designated in the plan. Depending on the recovery strategies  defined in the plan, these functions could include temporary manual  processing, recovery and operation at an alternate system, or relocation  and recovery at an alternate site. Teams with recovery responsibilities  should understand and be able to perform these recovery strategies well  enough that if the paper plan is unavailable during the initial stages of the  event, they can still perform the necessary activities.  • In the Reconstitution Phase, recovery activities are terminated, and normal  operations are transferred back to the organization’s facility.  If the  original facility is unrecoverable, the activities in this phase can also be  applied to preparing a new facility to support system processing  requirements.  Until the primary system is restored and tested, the  contingency system should continue to be operated. The Reconstitution  Phase should specify teams responsible for restoring or replacing both the  site and the information system.  Contingency Plan Appendices should provide key details not contained in the  main body of the plan.  The appendices should reflect the specific technical,  operational, and management contingency requirements of the information system  and the larger organization.  Appendices can include, but are not limited to,  contact information for contingency planning team personnel; vendor contact  information, including offsite storage and alternate site points of contact; standard  operating procedures and checklists for system recovery or processes; equipment  and system requirements lists of the hardware, software, firmware, and other  resources required to support system operations; vendor agreements, reciprocal  agreements with other organizations, and other vital records; description of, and  directions to, the alternate site; and the BIA.  Plans should be formatted to provide quick and clear direction in the event those  personnel unfamiliar with the plan or the systems are called on to perform  recovery operations.  Plans should be clear, concise, and easy to implement in an  emergency.  Where possible, checklists and step-by-step procedures should be  F-6  used.  A concise and well-formatted plan reduces the likelihood of creating an  overly complex or confusing plan.  6. Plan Testing, Training, and Exercises.  Plan testing is a critical element of a  viable contingency capability.  Testing enables plan deficiencies to be identified  and addressed. Testing also helps evaluate the ability of the recovery staff to  implement the plan quickly and effectively. Each IT contingency plan element  should be tested to confirm the accuracy of individual recovery procedures and  the overall effectiveness of the plan. The following areas should be addressed in a  contingency test:  • System recovery on an alternate platform from backup media  • Coordination among recovery teams  • Internal and external connectivity  • System performance using alternate equipment  • Restoration of normal operations  • Notification procedures.  Training for personnel with contingency plan responsibilities should complement  testing. Training should be provided at least annually; new hires with plan  responsibilities should receive training shortly after they are hired.  Ultimately,  contingency plan personnel should be trained to the extent that that they are able  to execute their respective recovery procedures without aid of the actual  document. This is an important goal in the event that paper or electronic versions  of the plan are unavailable for the first few hours resulting from the extent of the  disaster.  Recovery personnel should be trained on the following plan elements:  • Purpose of the plan  • Cross-team coordination and communication  • Reporting procedures  • Security requirements  • Team-specific processes (Notification/Activation, Recovery, and  Reconstitution Phases)  • Individual responsibilities (Notification/ Activation, Recovery, and  Reconstitution Phases).  7. Maintain the plan. To be effective, the plan must be maintained in a ready state  that accurately reflects system requirements, procedures, organizational structure,  and policies. IT systems undergo frequent changes because of shifting business  needs, technology upgrades, or new internal or external policies. Therefore, it is  essential that the contingency plan be reviewed and updated regularly, as part of  the organization’s change management process, to ensure that new information is  documented and contingency measures are revised if required.

INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE  This {system name} Contingency Plan establishes procedures to recover the {system  name} system following a disruption. The following objectives have been established for  this plan:  • Maximize the effectiveness of contingency operations through an established plan  that consists of the following phases:  − Notification/Activation phase to detect and assess damage and to activate  the plan;  − Recovery phase to restore temporary IT operations and recover damage  done to the original system; and  − Reconstitution phase to restore IT system processing capabilities to normal  operations.  • Identify the activities, resources, and procedures needed to carry out {system  name} processing requirements during prolonged interruptions to normal  operations.  • Assign responsibilities to designated {Organization name} personnel and provide  guidance for recovering {system name} during prolonged periods of interruption  to normal operations.  • Ensure coordination with other {Organization name} staff who will participate in  the contingency planning strategies. Ensure coordination with external points of  contact and vendors who will participate in the contingency planning strategies.  1.2 APPLICABILITY  The {system name} Contingency Plan applies to the functions, operations, and resources  necessary to restore and resume {Organization name}’s {system name} operations as it is  installed at its primary location:  {Name, City, State}. The {system name} Contingency  Plan applies to {Organization name} and all other persons associated with {system  name} as identified under Section 2.3, Responsibilities.  G-1  1.3 SCOPE  1.3.1 Planning Principles  Various scenarios were considered to form a basis for the plan, and multiple assumptions  were made. The applicability of the plan is predicated on two key principles:  • The {Organization name}’s facility in {City, State}, is inaccessible; therefore,  {Organization name} is unable to perform {system name} processing for the  organization.  • A valid contract exists with the alternate site that designates that site in {City,  State}, as {Organization name}’s alternate operating facility.  – {Organization name} will use the alternate site building and IT resources to  recover {system name} functionality during an emergency situation that  prevents access to the original facility.  – The designated computer system at the alternate site has been configured to  begin processing {system name} information.  – The alternate site will be used to continue {system name} recovery and  processing throughout the period of disruption, until the return to normal  operations.  1.3.2 Assumptions  Based on these principles, the following assumptions were used when developing the IT  Contingency Plan:  • The {system name} is inoperable at the {Organization name} computer center  and cannot be recovered within {XX} hours.  • Key {system name} personnel have been identified and trained in their  emergency response and recovery roles; they are available to activate the {system  name} Contingency Plan.  • Preventive controls (e.g., generators, environmental controls, waterproof tarps,  sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers, and fire department assistance) are fully  operational at the time of the contingency event.  • Computer center equipment, including components supporting {system name},  are connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) that provides {XX}  minutes/hours of electricity during a power failure.  • {System name} hardware and software at the {Organization name} original site  are unavailable for at least {XX} hours.  • Current backups of the application software and data are intact and available at  the offsite storage facility.  • The equipment, connections, and capabilities required to operate {system name}  are available at the alternate site in {City, State}.  G-2  • Service agreements are maintained with {system name} hardware, software, and  communications providers to support the system recovery.  The {system name} Contingency Plan does not apply to the following situations:  • Overall recovery and continuity of business operations. The Business  Resumption Plan (BRP) and Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) are appended  to the plan.  • Emergency evacuation of personnel. The Occupant Evacuation Plan (OEP) is  appended to the plan.  • Any additional constraints should be added to this list.  1.4 REFERENCES/REQUIREMENTS  This {system name} Contingency Plan complies with the {Organization name}’s IT  contingency planning policy as follows:  {Insert organization’s contingency planning policy statement}  The {system name} Contingency Plan also complies with the following policies:  • Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002  • Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 1996  • OMB Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, Appendix  III, November 2000  • Federal Preparedness Circular (FPC) 65, Federal Executive Branch Continuity of  Operations, July 1999  • PDD 63, Critical Infrastructure Protection, May 1998  • Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The Federal Response Plan  (FRP), April 1999  • {Insert other applicable policies}  1.5 RECORD OF CHANGES  Modifications made to this plan are as follows:  Record of Changes  Page No.  Change Comment Date of Change Signature  2.

Appendix H: Resources for Secure Remote Use and  Access  The HIPAA Security Rule requires all covered entities to protect the EPHI that they use  or disclose to business associates, trading partners, or other entities. New technologies,  such as remote access and removable media technologies, have significantly simplified  the way in which data is transmitted throughout the healthcare industry and created  tremendous opportunities for improvements and greater efficiency in the healthcare  space.  However, these technologies have also increased the risk of loss and unauthorized  use and disclosure of this sensitive information.  Sensitive information that is accessed  by, stored on, or transmitted to or from a remote device needs to be protected so that  malicious parties cannot access or alter it.  An unauthorized release of sensitive  information could damage the trust in an organization, jeopardize its mission, or harm  individuals if their personal information has been released.  In December 2006, CMS issued a HIPAA security guidance document, Remote Use of  and Access to Electronic Protected Health Information, to reinforce some of the ways a  covered entity may protect EPHI when it is accessed or used outside of the organization’s  physical purview.  It sets forth some strategies that may be reasonable and appropriate  under the HIPAA Security Rule, for covered entities to follow (based upon their  individual technological capabilities and operational needs), for offsite use of, or access  to, EPHI.  This guidance also places significant emphasis on the importance of risk  analysis and risk management strategies, policies and procedures, and security awareness  and training on the policies and procedures for safeguarding EPHI during its remote  access, storage, and transmission.  NIST publications on remote access, storage, and transmission security technologies can  be valuable resources to support secure remote use solutions.  These publications seek to  assist organizations in understanding particular technologies and to provide security  considerations and practical, real-world recommendations for implementing and securing  these technologies within an organization.  Special Publication 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing External Devices for Telework  and Remote Access, was developed to help teleworkers secure the external devices they  use for telework, such as personally owned and third-party privately owned desktop and  laptop computers and consumer devices (e.g., cell phones, personal digital assistants).  The document focuses specifically on security for telework involving remote access to  organizations’ nonpublic computing resources by providing:  • Recommendations for securing telework computers’ operating systems and  applications, as well as home networks that the computers use;  • Basic recommendations for securing consumer devices used for telework;  • Advice on protecting the information stored on telework computers and  removable media; and  • Tips on considering the security of a device owned by a third party before  deciding whether it should be used for telework.  H-1  Special Publication 800-113, Guide to SSL VPNs, assists organizations in understanding  SSL VPN technologies and in designing, implementing, configuring, securing,  monitoring, and maintaining SSL VPN solutions.  This publication intends to help  organizations determine how best to deploy SSL VPNs within their specific network  environments by:  • Describing SSL and how it fits within the context of layered network security;  • Presenting a phased approach to SSL VPN planning and implementation that can  help in achieving successful SSL VPN deployments; and  • Comparing SSL VPN technology with IPsec VPNs and other VPN solutions.  Special Publication 800-77, Guide to IPsec VPNs, assists organizations in mitigating the  risks associated with the transmission of sensitive information across networks by  providing practical guidelines on implementing security services based on Internet  Protocol Security (IPsec).  This publication intends to help organizations determine how  best to deploy IPsec VPNs within their specific network environments by:  • Discussing the need for, and types of, network layer security services and how  IPsec addresses these services;  • Providing a phased approach to IPsec planning and implementation that can help  in achieving successful IPsec deployments;  • Providing specific recommendations relating to configuring cryptography for  IPsec;  • Using a case-based approach to show how IPsec can be used to solve common  network security issues; and  • Discussing alternatives to IPsec and under what circumstances each may be  appropriate.  Special Publication 800-52, Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Transport Layer  Security (TLS), provides guidelines on the selection and implementation of the TLS  protocol while making effective use of Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)- approved cryptographic algorithms.  TLS provides a mechanism to protect sensitive data  during electronic dissemination across the Internet.  This guideline:  • Describes the placement of security in each layer of the communications protocol  stack, as defined by the OSI Seven Layer Model;  • Provides criteria for developing specific recommendations when selecting,  installing and using transport layer security; and  • Discusses client implementation, server, and operational considerations.  Special Publication 800-111, Guide to Storage Encryption Technologies for End User  Devices, assists organizations in understanding storage encryption technologies for end  user devices and in planning, implementing, and maintaining storage encryption  solutions.  The types of end user devices addressed in this document are personal  computers (desktops and laptops), consumer devices (e.g., personal digital assistants,  H-2  H-3  smart phones), and removable storage media (e.g., USB flash drives, memory cards,  external hard drives, writeable CDs and DVDs).  This publication:  • Provides an overview of the basic concepts of storage encryption for end user  devices;  • Provides guidelines on commonly used categories of storage encryption  techniques (i.e., full disk, volume and virtual disk, and file/folder), and explains  the types of protection they provide;  • Discusses important security elements of a storage encryption deployment,  including cryptographic key management and authentication; and  • Examines several use cases which illustrate multiple ways to meet most storage  encryption needs.  Draft Special Publication 800-124, Guidelines on Cell Phone and PDA Security, provides  an overview of cell phone and personal digital assistant (PDA) devices in use today and  offers insights for making informed information technology security decisions regarding  their treatment.  This publication:  • Presents an overview of handheld devices and discusses associated security  threats and technology risks;  • Examines the security concerns associated with handheld devices; and  • Discusses user- and organization-oriented measures and safeguards available for  mitigating the risks and threats.  All NIST publications are accessible on the public Computer Security Resource Center  (CSRC) Web site at http://csrc.nist.gov.  http://csrc.nist.gov/  Appendix I: Telework Security Considerations  Many people telework, which is the ability for an organization’s employees and  contractors to conduct work from locations other than the organization’s facilities.  Teleworkers use various devices, such as desktop and laptop computers, cell phones, and  personal digital assistants (PDAs), to read and send email, access Web sites, review and  edit documents, and perform many other tasks. Most teleworkers use remote access,  which is the ability of an organization’s users to access its nonpublic computing  resources from locations other than the organization’s facilities. Organizations have many  options for providing remote access, including virtual private networks, remote system  control, and individual application access (e.g., Web-based email).  This appendix provides considerations and tips for securing external devices used for  telework and remote access.  More detailed information on this topic is available in NIST  SP 800-114, User’s Guide to Securing External Devices for Telework and Remote  Access.  Before teleworking, users should understand their organization’s policies and  requirements, as well as appropriate ways of protecting the organization’s  information that they may access.  Teleworkers should consult their organization’s policies and requirements to provide  adequate security to protect the organization’s information.  Sensitive information that is  stored on, or sent to or from, external telework devices needs to be protected so that  malicious parties can neither access nor alter it.  An unauthorized release of sensitive  information could damage the public’s trust in an organization, jeopardize the mission of  an organization, or harm individuals if their personal information has been released.  Teleworkers should ensure that all the devices on their wired and wireless home  networks are properly secured, as well as the home networks themselves.  An important part of telework and remote access security is applying security measures  to the personal computers (PCs) and consumer devices using the same wired and wireless  home networks to which the telework device normally connects. If any of these other  devices become infected with malware or are otherwise compromised, they could attack  the telework device or eavesdrop on its communications. Teleworkers should also be  cautious about allowing others to place devices on the teleworkers’ home networks, in  case one of these devices is compromised.  Teleworkers should apply security measures to the home networks to which their  telework devices normally connect. One example of a security measure is using a  broadband router or firewall appliance to prevent computers outside the home network  from initiating communications with telework devices on the home network. Another  example is ensuring that sensitive information transmitted over a wireless home network  is adequately protected through strong encryption.  Teleworkers should consider the security state of a third-party device before using it  for telework.  I-1  Teleworkers often want to perform remote access from third-party devices, such as  checking email from a kiosk computer at a conference. However, teleworkers typically  do not know if such devices have been secured properly or if they have been  compromised. Consequently, a teleworker could use a third-party device infected with  malware that steals information from users (e.g., passwords or email messages). Many  organizations either forbid third-party devices to be used for remote access or permit only  limited use, such as for Web-based email. Teleworkers should consider who is  responsible for securing a third-party device and who can access the device before  deciding whether or not to use it. Whenever possible, teleworkers should not use publicly  accessible third-party devices for telework, and teleworkers should avoid using any third- party devices for performing sensitive functions or accessing sensitive information.  Secure a Telework PC  Teleworkers who use their own desktop or laptop PCs for telework should secure their  operating systems and primary applications.  • Use a combination of security software, such as antivirus and antispyware  software, personal firewalls, spam and Web content filtering, and popup blocking,  to stop most attacks, particularly malware;  • Restrict who can use the PC by having a separate standard user account for each  person, assigning a password to each user account, using the standard user  accounts for daily use, and protecting user sessions from unauthorized physical  access;  • Ensure that updates and patches are regularly applied to the operating system and  primary applications, such as Web browsers, email clients, instant messaging  clients, and security software;  • Disable unneeded networking features on the PC and configure wireless  networking securely;  • Configure primary applications to filter content and stop other activity that is  likely to be malicious;  • Install and use only known and trusted software;  • Configure remote access software based on the organization’s requirements and  recommendations; and  • Maintain the PC’s security on an ongoing basis, such as changing passwords  regularly and checking the status of security software periodically.  Secure consumer devices used for telework, such as cell phones, PDAs, and video  game systems  A wide variety of consumer devices exists, and security features available for these  devices also vary widely. Some devices offer only a few basic features, whereas others  offer sophisticated features similar to those offered by PCs. This does not necessarily  imply that more security features are better; in fact, many devices offer more security  features because the capabilities they provide (e.g., wireless networking, instant  I-2  messaging) make them more susceptible to attack than devices without these capabilities.  General recommendations for securing telework devices are as follows:  • Limit access to the device, such as setting a personal identification number (PIN)  or password and automatically locking a device after an idle period;  • Disable networking capabilities, such as Bluetooth, except when they are needed;  • Use additional security software, such as antivirus software and personal  firewalls, if appropriate;  • Ensure that security updates, if available, are acquired and installed at least  monthly, or more frequently; and  • Configure applications to support security (e.g., blocking activity that is likely to  be malicious).  Secure Information  • Use physical security controls for telework devices and removable media.  For  example, an organization might require that laptops be physically secured using  cable locks when used in hotels, conferences, and other locations where third  parties could easily gain physical access to the devices. Organizations may also  have physical security requirements for papers and other non-computer media that  contain sensitive information and are taken outside the organization’s facilities.  • Encrypt files stored on telework devices and removable media such as CDs and  flash drives. This prevents attackers from readily gaining access to information in  the files. Many options exist for protecting files, including encrypting individual  files or folders, volumes, and hard drives. Generally, using an encryption method  to protect files also requires the use of an authentication mechanism (e.g.,  password) to decrypt the files when needed.  • Ensure that information stored on telework devices is backed up. If something  adverse happens to a device, such as a hardware, software, or power failure or a  natural disaster, the information on the device will be lost unless it has been  backed up to another device or removable media. Some organizations permit  teleworkers to back up their local files to a centralized system (e.g., through VPN  remote access), whereas other organizations recommend that their teleworkers  perform local backups (e.g., burning CDs, copying files onto removable media).  Teleworkers should perform backups, following their organizations’ guidelines,  and verify that the backups are valid and complete.  It is important that backups  on removable media be secured at least as well as the device that they backed up.  For example, if a computer is stored in a locked room, then the media also should  be in a secured location; if a computer stores its data encrypted, then the backups  of that data should also be encrypted.  • Ensure that information is destroyed when it is no longer needed. For example,  the organization’s files should be removed from a computer scheduled to be  retired or from a third-party computer that is temporarily used for remote access.  Some remote access methods perform basic information cleanup, such as clearing  I-3  I-4  Web browser caches that might inadvertently hold sensitive information, but more  extensive cleanup typically requires using a special utility, such as a disk- scrubbing program specifically designed to remove all traces of information from  a device.  Another example of information destruction is shredding telework  papers containing sensitive information once the papers are no longer needed.  • Erase information from missing cell phones and PDAs. If a cell phone or PDA is  lost or stolen, occasionally its contents can be erased remotely. This prevents an  attacker from obtaining any information from the device. The availability of this  service depends on the capabilities of the product and the company providing  network services for the product.  Adequately protect remote access-specific authenticators  • Teleworkers need to ensure that they adequately protect their remote access- specific authenticators, such as passwords, personal identification numbers  (PINs), and hardware tokens. Such authenticators should not be stored with the  telework computer, nor should multiple authenticators be stored with each other  (e.g., a password or PIN should not be written on the back of a hardware token).  Social Engineering  • Teleworkers should be aware of how to handle threats involving social  engineering, which is a general term for attackers trying to trick people into  revealing sensitive information or performing certain actions, such as  downloading and executing files that appear to be benign but are actually  malicious. For example, an attacker might approach a teleworker in a coffee shop  and ask to use the computer for a minute or offer to help the teleworker with using  the computer.  • Teleworkers should be wary of any requests they receive that could lead to a  security breach or to the theft of a telework device.  Handling a Security Breach  • If a teleworker suspects that a security breach (including loss or theft of materials)  has occurred involving a telework device, remote access communications,  removable media, or other telework components, the teleworker should  immediately follow the organization’s policy and procedures for reporting the  possible breach. This is particularly important if any of the affected telework  components contain sensitive information such as EPHI, so that the potential  impact of a security breach is minimized.

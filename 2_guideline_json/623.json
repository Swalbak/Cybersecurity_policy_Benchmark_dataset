By bringing communities together,  ENISA successfully contributed to strengthening  Europe’s preparedness and response capabilities  to cyber incidents.  Simultaneously, the digitalisation of our economy and  society has drastically increased, as demonstrated  during the COVID-19 crisis when a collective and  massive turn to remote IT solutions was essential to  keep many activities going. This crisis outlined how much  cyber attackers take advantage of our dependency on  these technologies. It also revealed how the cyber threat  landscape has broadened from targeted attacks to  new forms of massive threats to millions of businesses  and citizens including a rising number of sophisticated  ransomware incidents. The rapid development  of digital products and services, from Cloud and  videoconferencing to 5G and A.I., also brought new  challenges to uncover and address.  With its permanent mandate and enhanced tasks and  capabilities, ENISA is, more than ever, meant to play  a leading role in helping the EU and its Member States  keep up with these challenges, while a new era dawns  for cybersecurity in Europe.  To do so, ENISA will work towards anticipating relevant  trends, pull and share state-of-the-art expertise  and knowledge for all. It will support the European  Commission and the Member States in helping  public and private actors and citizens to prevent and  manage risks associated with cyber incidents. With  the implementation of the cybersecurity certification  framework, ENISA will contribute to a paradigm shift  by improving the level of security of digital solutions  deployed in Europe. In doing so, it will increase the  ability of all to choose and trust. The Agency will also  actively support the European cybersecurity operational  community in closely cooperating and preparing to  respond together when the next large-scale cyber  incident hits Europe.  As ENISA takes up its new role, openness, agility and  reliability will be key drivers in its daily operations,  while working closer with the Member States and the  European Commission in aligning approaches. ENISA will  also strive to improve its environmental impact in the  context of the ongoing climate crisis and to be a socially  responsible and inclusive working environment.  This Strategy document, developed through the  engagement of all of ENISA’s staff, the members of  its Management Board and its Advisory Group in  a collaborative and inclusive process, sets the clear  objectives that will drive ENISA’s work in the coming  years to meet the many challenges ahead.  On behalf of the Management Board  Jean-Baptiste Demaison Chair of the Management Board  Krzysztof Silicki  Deputy Chair of the Management Board  FOREWORD  3  VISION A trusted and cyber  secure Europe  MISSION The mission of the European Union Agency for  Cybersecurity (ENISA) is to achieve a high common  level of cybersecurity across the Union in cooperation  with the wider community. It does this through acting  as a centre of expertise on cybersecurity, collecting  and providing independent, high quality technical  advice and assistance to Member States and EU bodies  on cybersecurity. It contributes to developing and  implementing the Union’s cyber policies.  Our aim is to strengthen trust in the connected  economy, boost resilience and trust of the  Union’s infrastructure and services and keep our society  and citizens digitally secure. We aspire to be an agile,  environmentally and socially responsible organisation  focused on people.  VALUES Community Mind-Set  ENISA works with communities, respecting their  competencies and expertise, and fosters synergies and  trust to best achieve its mission.  Excellence  ENISA aims for state-of-the-art expertise in its work,  upholds the highest quality standards of operation  and evaluates its performance to strive for continuous  improvement through innovation and foresight.  Integrity/ethics  ENISA upholds ethical principles and EU relevant rules  and obligations in its services and working environment  ensuring fairness and inclusiveness.  Respect  ENISA respects fundamental European rights and values  covering all its services and working environment, as  well as the expectations of its stakeholders.  Responsibility  ENISA assumes responsibility thus ensuring integration  of the social and environmental dimensions into  practices and procedures.  Transparency  ENISA adopts procedures, structures and processes  that are open, factual and independent, thus limiting  bias, ambiguity, fraud and obscurity.  4  Empowering  Communities  Cybersecurity  Policy  Operational  Cooperation  Capacity  Building  Trusted  Solutions  Foresight  Knowledge  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES  5  SO1 Strategic objective  SO1 Context Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. Europe strives for a cross sectoral, all-inclusive cooperation  framework. ENISA plays a key role in stimulating active cooperation between the cybersecurity  stakeholders in Member States and the EU institutions and agencies. It strives to ensure  complementarity of common efforts, by adding value to the stakeholders, exploring synergies and  effectively using limited cybersecurity expertise and resources. Communities should be empowered  to scale up the cybersecurity model.  What we want to achieve  An EU-wide, state of the art body of knowledge on cybersecurity concepts and practices, that  builds cooperation amongst key actors in cybersecurity, promotes lessons learned, EU expertise  and creates new synergies.  An empowered cyber ecosystem encompassing Member States authorities, EU institutions,  agencies and bodies, associations, research centres and universities, industry, private actors and  citizens, who all play their role in making Europe cyber secure;  EMPOWERED AND  ENGAGED COMMUNITIES  ACROSS THE CYBERSECURITY  ECOSYSTEM  7  SO2 Strategic objective  Context Cybersecurity is the cornerstone of digital transformation and the need for it permeates all sectors,  therefore it needs to be considered across a broad range of policy fields and initiatives. Cybersecurity  must not be restricted to a specialist community of technical cyber experts. Cybersecurity must  therefore be embedded across all domains of EU policy. Avoiding fragmentation and the need for a  coherent approach while taking into account the specificities of each sector is essential.  What we want to achieve  Proactive advice and support to all relevant EU-level actors bringing in the cybersecurity  dimension in policy development lifecycle through viable and targeted technical guidelines;  Cybersecurity risk management frameworks that are in place across all sectors and followed  throughout the cybersecurity policy lifecycle.  CYBERSECURITY  AS AN INTEGRAL PART  OF EU POLICIES  9  SO3 Strategic objective  Context The benefits of the European digital economy and society can only be fully attained under the  premise of cybersecurity. Cyber-attacks know no borders. All layers of society can be impacted and  the Union needs to be ready to respond to massive (large scale and cross-border) cyber-attacks and  cyber crisis. Cross-border interdependencies have highlighted the need for effective cooperation  between Member States and the EU institutions for faster response and proper coordination of  efforts at all levels (strategic, operational, technical and communications).  What we want to achieve  Continuous cross-border and cross layer support to cooperation between Member States as  well as with EU institutions. In particular in view of potential large scale incidents and crises,  support the scaling up of technical operational, political and strategic cooperation amongst key  operational actors to enable timely response, information sharing, situational awareness and  crises communication across the Union;  Comprehensive and rapid technical handling upon request of the Member States to facilitate  technical and operational needs in incident and crises management.  EFFECTIVE COOPERATION  AMONGST OPERATIONAL ACTORS  WITHIN THE UNION IN CASE OF  MASSIVE CYBER INCIDENTS  11  SO4 Strategic objective  Context The frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks is rising speedily, while at the same time the use of  ICT infrastructures and technologies by individuals, organisations, and industries is increasing rapidly.  The needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences exceeds the supply. The EU has to invest  in building competences and talents in cybersecurity at all levels, from the non-expert to the highly  skilled professional. The investments should focus not only on increasing the cybersecurity skillset in  the Member States but also on making sure that the different operational communities possess the  appropriate capacity to deal with the cyber threat landscape.  What we want to achieve  Aligned cybersecurity competencies, professional experience and education structures to meet  the constantly increasing needs for cybersecurity knowledge and competences in the EU;  An elevated base-level of cybersecurity awareness and competences across the EU while  mainstreaming cyber into new disciplines;  Well prepared and tested capabilities with the appropriate capacity to deal with the evolving  threat environment across the EU.  CUTTING-EDGE COMPETENCES  AND CAPABILITIES IN  CYBERSECURITY ACROSS  THE UNION  13  SO5 Strategic objective  Context Digital products and services bring benefits as well as risks, and these risks must be identified and  mitigated. In the process of evaluating security of digital solutions and ensuring their trustworthiness,  it is essential to adopt a common approach, with the goal to strike a balance between societal,  market, economic and cybersecurity needs. A neutral entity acting in a transparent manner will  increase customer trust on digital solutions and the wider digital environment.  What we want to achieve  Cyber secure digital environment across the EU, where citizens can trust ICT products, services  and processes through the deployment of certification schemes in key technological areas;  HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST  IN SECURE DIGITAL  SOLUTIONS  15  SO6 Strategic objective  Context Numerous new technologies, still in their infancy or close to mainstream adoption, would benefit  from the use of foresight methods. Through a structured process enabling dialogue among  stakeholders, decision- and policy-makers would be able to define early mitigation strategies that  improve the EU resilience to cybersecurity threats and find solutions to address emerging challenges.  What we want to achieve  Understanding emerging trends and patterns using foresight and future scenarios that  contribute to mitigating our stakeholder’s cyber challenges;  Early assessment of challenges and risks from the adoption of and adaptation to the emerging  future options, while collaborating with stakeholders on appropriate mitigation strategies.  FORESIGHT ON  EMERGING AND  FUTURE CYBERSECURITY  CHALLENGES  17  SO7 Strategic objective  Context The energy that fuels the mill of cybersecurity is information and knowledge. For cybersecurity  professionals to be efficient at tackling our objectives, to work in a constantly moving environment –  in terms of digital developments as well as with regard to actors – to face the challenges of our time,  we need a continuous process of collecting, organising, summarising, analysing, communicating,  and maintaining cybersecurity information and knowledge. All phases are essential to ensure that  information and knowledge is shared and expanded within the EU cybersecurity ecosystem.  What we want to achieve  Shared information and knowledge management for the EU cybersecurity ecosystem in  an accessible, customised, timely and applicable form, with appropriate methodology,  infrastructures and tools, coupled and quality assurance methods to achieve continuous  improvement of services.  EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE  CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION  AND KNOWLEDGE  MANAGEMENT FOR EUROPE  19  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency  dedicated to achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.  Established in 2004 and strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European  Union Agency for Cybersecurity contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the  trustworthiness of ICT products, services and processes with cybersecurity  certification schemes, cooperates with Member States and EU bodies, and helps  Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow.

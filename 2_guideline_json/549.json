For this reason, vendors should  ensure that these two features follow smart grid devices for their whole life cycle; from the design to  the decommission phase. Certification is not only a means to provide assurance to the smart gird users  that security and privacy have been taken into account but also to create trust to the entire smart grid  supply chain.  This report provides insight on security certification of smart grids. It contains information about  several certification approaches; it describes the specific European situation, discusses the advantages  and challenges and provides recommendations to involved stakeholders towards a more harmonised  European smart grid security certification practices framework.  The report describes the need for harmonised European smart grid certification practices which cover  the complete smart grid supply chain, and are supported by a European platform based on M/490  SGAM1 (Smart Grid Architecture Model) and the concept of smart grid chain of trust. Part of this report  is the analysis of the available security certification schemes for smart grids and the approaches used  in Europe. This way we have generated an overview that depicts which certification schemes can be  used to create this chain of trust. During this analysis it came up that there is not a single, existing,  scheme that can cover the entire chain of trust, and that not all parts of the chain can be completely  covered for every smart grid use-case. Additionally, it appeared that there are multiple initiatives in  different Member States that take different approaches to achieve the same goal. For this reason, we  use the common denominator of the features of the different existing certification standards in order  to introduce a certification meta-scheme for the smart grids in Europe.  The major gaps and challenges of a European smart grid certification scheme revolve around the  fragmentation and different approaches in Member States, as well as the lack of EU guidance by a  trusted oversight body. At this moment it will be difficult to create a security certification scheme that  1 SGAM is an abbreviation for the Smart Grid Architecture Model proposed by M/490 standardisation initiative,  and is widely accepted as the common reference model architecture for smart grids not only at European but  also at international level.

This approach  allows for the national specific approaches and requirements, while providing possibilities to adopt  European based requirements to facilitate harmonisation, and benefit from joined standardisation  efforts.  Taking into account the needs, as expressed in various referenced resources, we also outline the  properties of the ‘ideal’ smart gird cyber security apparatus. To achieve this ‘ideal’ situation a set of  recommendations is addressed to the main stakeholders; the Commission, the certification bodies,  the Member States and the private sector. The most outstanding recommendations are:  Harmonised EU smart grid security certification practices  More harmonised and coordinated EU smart grid certification practices will act as an umbrella and  should contain elementary properties that national schemes need to have. European accreditation  bodies will be used for confirmation of national schemes. This will ensure that there is not a single  certifying authority, and the process remains impartial. Next to this, private sector will help in keeping  up with the latest technology specific requirements and guidance consolidated by technical  committees. The committees should amend the slow moving standards with detailed protection  profiles or security requirements. Updates in national schemes should be announced so that they can  be incorporated in national profiles. This way the maturity of the national schemes can evolve over  time.  The Commission together with the Member States should promote certification by allowing for  commercial advantages for the private sector when following practices which lead to more  harmonisation across Europe (e.g. criteria for E.U procurement activities). The certification practices  should provide European guidance, facilitate national legislation and be actively promoted as a means  for more harmonization.  National implementation of specific smart grid use cases based on a chain of trust  Each Member State should be able to map its preferred national standard/scheme to the EU platform  and refer to this national standard for details. They should also be able to amend or expand on the  European security requirements to provide the flexibility to incorporate national specific  requirements. The national profiles should be created by national groups, but could be based on the  published schemes of other Member States. The national profiles can contain the national specific  technical requirements regarding the needed security features related to the applicable use cases  used in that Member State. Additionally they should contain test procedures for the national specific  requirements, and define the required testing levels for the national use cases aligned with the  international SG-IS2  framework risk levels.  Oversight  It is recommended to create a EU steering committee with oversight competences on smart grid  certification, the definition of pan European security requirements’ and the development of national  schemes. It should be responsible for centralised storage and the publication of smart grid certificates  and adopted schemes, to facilitate clarity on what is certified and how. It should provide  implementation guidance and recommendations based on the most recent best practices and  informative standards.  The EU steering committee will have only a coordination role and act as an advisor to the certification  bodies, making sure the latest threats are reflected in the security requirements definition process.  2 This framework is described at the M/490 SGCG Smart Grid Information Security deliverable.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  vi  To this end, this committee will take feedback from the private sector, and lessons learned during the  certification processes of other nationalities.  The steering committee should create and maintain a landing page with specific explanations for all  stakeholders about smart grid security certification concepts, their place in the chain of trust and how  to implement a smart grid certification chain of trust on a specific smart grid use case.

Where in the ‘old’ grids  automation was owned by the grid operator itself and took place on a dedicated network, in a smart  grid environment multi entities are connected together. Those entities own cables, solar panels, wind  turbines, biomass plants and so on, and they all need IT connections to exchange data with each other  to ensure the right decisions are made from an individual economic and technical perspective. While  the equipment has evolved to facilitate the data exchange with more intelligent and automated or  remote controlled devices, the practices regarding manufacturing and maintenance of devices are still  similar to the ones that were on a dedicated network. This created a gap, where the level of security  did not grow together with the increased automation and interconnections of the grid.  For this reason, cyber security certification of the smart grid has gained popularity as a means to  further enhance the security that these complex systems already offer to their users. The need to  foster the development of security certification schemes for product and organisational security was  one of the key findings of ENISA’s 2012 report on “Smart grid security: Recommendations for Europe  and Member States”. In this document, ENISA recommends:  Certification in smart grid cyber security therefore also delivers a competitive advantage for both  suppliers and service providers.  1.2 Policy context  The recently published Cyber Security Strategy of the European Union3 clearly identifies the shared  responsibility of all stakeholders and the need for all actors to protect themselves in the context of  growing dependency on information and communications technologies. The need to develop  industrial and technical resources for cyber security is mentioned among the strategic priorities and  actions, and in this context:  3 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN(2013) 1 final,  avaialable at: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  “By raising the level of security and mitigating risk, accreditation and certification  schemes would increase end consumers’ confidence in smart grid services and  systems and accelerate their acceptance. Moreover, certified service providers  can be easily compared allowing for marketing strategies….’’  ‘’A prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk  management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly  establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes  in the EU and internationally. The Commission will promote the adoption of  coherent approaches among the Member States to avoid disparities causing  locational disadvantages for businesses.’’  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  2  The abovementioned excerpt from the EU Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with the findings of the  workshop organised by ENISA in 2012 where the experts clearly expressed the need for more  harmonised smart grid certification practices as a means to lower the costs of certification and break  down the trade barriers.  1.3 Scope  The objective of this document is to provide technical advice, recommendations and good practices  for security certification for smart grids. Strategy, architecture guidelines and framework alternatives  are presented as recommendations which set the basis for the smart grid certification requirements.  This document does not solve all the political and legal issues related to implementing such smart grid  security certification obligations. Good practices of existing certification schemes and regulations in  the smart grid environment are presented as potential guidelines. The problem definition and the  need for certification point out in chapter 2, form the basis for this document.  Data protection is of the utmost importance for the smart grid4. Security certification is considered as  one of the measures which contributes to a safer and, as a result, a more secure processing  environment of personal data in the smart grid. Many security requirements described in existing  security certification standards are considered to be relevant to the existing data protection  framework. However, there are many data protection requirements (i.e. consent of the data subject,  the purpose definition, proportionality of collected data etc.) and tools (i.e. privacy by design, data  protection impact assessment (DPIA), best available techniques (BATs), privacy seals, notifications of  the processing to and audits by the national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and data breach  notifications) which are less or not relevant to existing security certification standards.  1.4 Target audience  The target audience of this document is the European Commission and Member States (MSs)  interested in open issues regarding security certification in smart grid environments. This document  aims to:   Create a common basis on which smart grid security certification can be structured   Inform the related industry community (IT security engineers, ICS engineers and operators,  national Information Security offices/agencies)   Provide an interface between policy makers and technology specialists regarding smart grid  security certification.  The stakeholders related to the findings and recommendations in this document are:   Certification and accreditation organizations   Regulators and policy makers   Smart grid operators   Standardisation Bodies (e.g. ETSI, NIST, IEC, ISO, etc.)   Security solutions providers   Smart grid manufacturers   Academia, R&D   Public bodies in the Member States involved in smart grid cyber security.  4 Commission Recommendation on preparations for the roll-out of smart metering systems (2012/148/EU),  available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012H0148&from=EN  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  3  1.5 Structure of this document  The document consists out of six main sections explaining in subsequent order:  1. Introduction  2. The need for smart grid certification  3. Standards and certification schemes  4. A chain of trust for the smart grid  5. Gaps and challenges  6. Recommendations  Please see “Annex A: Definitions” for a short list of definitions used throughout this document.  1.6 Method  The team has intiatilly performed a desktop reseach with the objective to identify both the need for  more converged smart grid certification approaches in Europe and the properties of an ‘ideal’  certification scheme. Then, they took stock of the existing security certification approaches in order  to identify, analyse and then compare security standards, good practices and schemes that could be  used in order to define the properties of a smart grid certification meta scheme. They analysed  the  results of the research and the outcome of the analysis delivered:   Identification of gaps between the existing schemes and the ‘ideal’ one.   Identification of gaps between different certification standards.   Challenges involved in further harmonising the existing smart grid security approaches in  Europe.   Recommendations on how to improve the existing European smart grid certification  apparatus.  Both the result of the research and the draft report were validated by the Smart Infrastructures  Security Experts Community (SISEC)5 and a number of selected ICT and smart grid certification experts.  Based on the comments received by the experts a second draft was prepared then and this new  document presented in a thematic workshop organised by ENISA 6. For the workshop, ENISA has  invited experts from different stakeholder categories to assess the quality of the findings and debate  the proposed good practices and recommendations. The final report is the outcome of the second  round of consultation with the experts.  5 ENISA’s Smart Infrastructures (cyber) Security Experts Community (SISEC) includes cyber security experts from  national cyber security authorities, energy and ICT industries, and possibly also selected non-EU partners. SISEC  has the mission to support the overall goal to achieve a higher maturity in cyber security for the critical  infrastructure of the European Union in order to increase the robustness and availability of critical infrastructure  against cyber security threats.  6 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2014/certification-of-cyber-security- skills-of-ics-scada-experts-and-smart-grid-components  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  4  2 The need for smart grid certification  This chapter describes what specific key drivers have been identified to support the need  for a more  organised and harmonised European framework for smart grid certification practices, and why such a  framework helps to create a chain of trust to the product (energy) delivered by the smart grid. The  general need for certification in the area of smart grids has been addressed in previous ENISA  documents, such as the report on Protecting Industrial Control Systems - Recommendations for  Europe and Member States, 2011 and the minutes from the joint ENISA/EC workshop on the  certification of smart grid components (2012)7. This report can be considered as a follow up to the  findings and recommendations illustrated in these documents.  2.1 State of play  The following list of items summarises the current situation around smart grid component security  certification as reflected during the ENISA workshop:   Price: Current certification schemes are considered rather expensive. Several reasons have  been reported for this; fragmented national policies, lack of resources, the need for  repeatability and consistency of the results and the large number of components involved in  the smart grid supply chain.   Lack of a uniform approach: Stakeholders are facing a fragmented situation where different  initiatives regarding the cyber security of smart grids are been developed.   Long life cycle: The certification process takes some time which usually is more than the time  needed for new vulnerabilities to appear in the cyberspace.   Legal framework: There are only a few legal texts concerning security in smart grids and this  is leaving enough space for grey zones and/or interpretations.   Common Criteria:  o is the predominant certification scheme in the market.  o it will be unrealistic to have a Common Criteria certificate for the whole smart grid  supply chain.  o to be applied in the smart grid environment, it should be extended to include specific  protection profiles for the smart grid, similar to those related to the smart card  industry, where a joint interpretation library was developed.   Environment of certification: One additional topic mentioned by some experts is that  certification of products is done in laboratories which are independent of the operational  environment. A product can be certified but that does not necessarily mean that when it is  implemented in the system, it is configured correctly, that it functions properly, and that it  does not affect the performance of the entire network.   Training: There is no national or European wide specialised training course on Industrial  Control Systems and smart grid security to educate experts on security certification matters.  2.2 Market drivers  The drivers behind certification vary widely. Security certification has historically originated from  governmental agencies to ensure a level of trust in their equipment and supply chain (e.g. FIPS140-2,  ISO 15408). However, industry partners have also taken it upon themselves to create certain  certification schemes, such as the vendor focussed UCAIug which created the IEC 61850 certification  7  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  5  standard that can be also applied to the smart grid industry. Here, it was recognised by several vendors  that it would be mutually beneficial to create a common and impartial understanding of how devices  operating in an electrical substation should interact.  In some cases, insurance companies and banks can also drive certification as a means to secure  investments made, and minimise the risk of monetary or other types (e.g. reputational) of loss due to  the use of substandard quality or security by their customers.  Recognition by key stakeholders is the most important aspect for a successful certification scheme.  Without the recognition and endorsement of key stakeholders, a certification scheme holds little  value, and any cost incurred by the certification process becomes difficult to justify.  Therefore, some schemes such as Common Criteria adopt a chain of trust, and facilitate an  infrastructure where Member States are able to officially recognise each other’s certificates. A  different solution is to have an international users group issuing the certificate, however this can be  difficult for smart grid security, as the government is a significant stakeholder and therefore it will  probably need a more formalised accreditation process to accept any type of certificate.  2.2.1 How certification works (success stories)  There are numerous success stories where a properly implemented scheme has developed into a  successful and mature standard that is recognised by the relevant stakeholders. A good example of  this is the Common Criteria framework in the smart-card industry, where it is widely accepted.  Another success story is the implementation of NERC-CIP in US, as it helped evolve cyber security in  US, and ensures that all critical infrastructures have taken a minimal set of precautions to protect their  assets.  2.2.2 And how it does not work (failure stories)  Unfortunately the successful schemes have sometimes also caused a compliance culture, where asset  owners first try to ensure that a minimum set of critical assets is defined, to keep cost low. The  mandatory audit trails are seen as the cumbersome creation of paperwork, without much attention  for the processes that should have generated it in the first place.  Another pitfall is illustrated by a security standard in the Netherlands, where the security  requirements were made too general, and the insurance premiums  appear to be cheaper than actual  compliance to the standard.  Some SCADA standards encountered criticism because the promised interoperability seemed not to  be provided by the certification scheme. This issue had more to do with how the scheme was  advertised than a flaw in the scheme itself. But it should be clear that the critique the standard  encountered did not improve the endorsement by the stakeholders.  Some schemes allow a vendor to write its own requirements to seek certification against, and this can  provide a biased image. For example, several companies have certified their products against the  scheme, but the usability of the certified configuration is said to be very limited.  Additionally depending on the scheme and requirements, certification can be a rather lengthy and  costly process, (a process costing several hundreds of thousands euros and taking a year is not  uncommon) and can therefore cause small players to be forced out of the market. That being said,  some schemes do allow a lower security level, which is also much faster and cheaper to certify. But  this will mean that the level of certified security will also be severely affected. Another reason for  increased cost of certification is that there is no consensus on the certification method between  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  6  Member States. Without consensus on the method used, certification efforts have to be repeated  multiple times with different methods for different Member States.  2.3  Stakeholder needs  The European Union, as well as previous studies done by ENISA and ESMIG (European Smart Metering  Industry Group) backed up by stakeholders; provide statements regarding the recognition of a need  for a pan European smart grid certification. Below is a summary of the various statements:  1. Solve trust issues between EU stakeholders regarding the smart grid  2. Create a common reference model for smart grid security in EU  3. Establish the basis for a minimum set of auditable controls for smart grids across Europe  4. Define an agreed method for the level of security for different criticality aspects of the grid  5. Establish a harmonised approach in the EU for smart grid component, system, and operational  security to increase trust  6. Provide EU guidance for a harmonized approach that facilitates national legislation  7. Promote public and private interaction within the EU on smart grid security  8. Improve the maturity level of security in the EU smart grid  9. Establish shared responsibility in risk mitigation amongst EU stakeholders  10. Lower costs of smart grid certification in the EU  11. Address the life cycle of a European smart grid  Below follows a description of each statement with a reference to the source the statement is based  upon.  Solve trust issues between EU stakeholders regarding the smart grid8  This relates to the different national regulations and the fragmented nature of the smart grid which  makes responsibility and accountability unclear. Additionally, because of the multidisciplinary nature  of smart grid systems, the supply chain of the used components and systems is quite wide, not  transparent and complex. This can cause trust issues within the EU stakeholders because they cannot  oversee all related risks anymore.  Create a common reference model for smart grid security in EU  The European market is becoming more mature. Member states are considering to specify their own  security requirements and develop their own certification schemes to qualify their products. This  could create fragmentation of the market if these activities are not developed in a coordinated  manner. The development of these schemes is mainly originating from certification authorities.  However, there is neither a protection profile covering the whole smart grid chain nor a certification  scheme at a European level yet. The development of one reference model to harmonise the European  market is therefore needed.7  ESMIG expressed the intention to reach a multi-stakeholder, European wide approach to identify  (technological and economic) security and privacy risks emerging with the deployment and operations  of a smart metering system. This was done in order to draw appropriate requirements and  countermeasures for smart meter/grid use cases from asset owners.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid- threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  7  Establish the basis for a minimum set of auditable controls for smart grids across Europe  There is a need for a European set of requirements that can be used for reinforcing the cyber security  of the smart grid.9, 10 This is important to create a level of security that has a common baseline across  Europe, and facilitates as a common interface for the interaction regarding cyber security between  Member States.  Define an agreed method for the level of security for different criticality aspects of the grid  Some stakeholders have identified that the smart grid, as a whole, contains a wide range of  components. Having all these components certified is perhaps not feasible, and it is not a good  indication of the security of the whole smart grid. There is a need to assess the criticality of the various  smart grid parts and apply various security assurance techniques based on that criticality. For example,  a smart grid component that is in a more exposed environment could in some cases have a larger  impact on the security of the grid. It would therefore, in that case, be beneficial to focus more on  these critical components that could have a large impact, then to spend the same amount of time and  money on components that have a much lower impact on the security of the grid.  Probably the components of the critical infrastructure cannot be certified using the same method as  traditional IT systems. Also a certified component does not imply a secure component, since all the  risks cannot be taken into consideration. The challenge in the smart grid context is facing  vulnerabilities and threats which are growing faster and faster due to the complexity of the system  and the large number of interdependencies amongst its components. Certification is one method that  can mitigate risks for the smart grid environment.11 Care should be taken with such a certification  approach that flexibility is maintained, and to allow for a risk level based on system criticality since  the level of criticality of a system can differ per stakeholder and per Member State.  Establish a harmonised approach in the EU for smart grid component, system, and operational  security to increase trust  During previous interviews and surveys with stakeholders, it emerged that a significant portion of  stakeholders expressed their doubts about the trustworthiness of the smart grid. This is backed up by  previous ENISA reports, where in one of the key findings of the ENISA's 2012 report on “Smart grid  security: Recommendations for Europe and Member States”, ENISA recommends that:  “Recommendation 6: Promote the development of security certification schemes for products and  organisational security: By raising the level of security and mitigating risks, accreditation and  certification schemes would increase end-consumers’ confidence in smart grid services and systems  and accelerate their acceptance. Moreover, certified service providers can be easily compared allowing  for marketing strategies....\"12  “Regarding the scope of the certification, some stakeholders noted that the certification of  components is important.

However, mandatory standards that contain controls for the overall  organization are not defined yet. A certification scheme for the whole grid, not only for the  components, is needed. The security of the smart grids should be developed taking into consideration  the balance between the risk and the services provided by the energy industry.”13  ESMIG also suggests that a scheme that supports IT systems and components in the smart metering  domain is desirable; “This contributes to ensure interoperability and a commonly implemented  certification scheme for Products and Systems in smart metering as initial Smart Grid deployments”  Provide EU guidance for a harmonized approach that facilitates national legislation  A harmonized smart grid approach is needed that includes economies of different scales and sizes,  can support any potential market model, and facilitates legislation on EU-Level.  Promote public and private interaction within the EU on smart grid security  It is seen as important to ensure that any adopted scheme will promote interaction between public  and private parties in the EU, to ensure wide support for a scheme, and to facilitate a scheme that is  not a burden on the parties involved.14  Improve the maturity level of security in the EU smart grid  The approach to security in the EU varies between Member States. The European market starts to  become more mature. Member States are considering to develop their own certification schemes to  qualify their systems. This could create fragmentation of the market if these activities do not develop  in a coordinated manner.  Last year, ENISA organized a workshop on the certification of smart grid components. During this  event, the experts had the opportunity to discuss the challenges of the existing security certification  approaches that apply to the smart grids. One of the key findings of this workshop was that there is  recognition for a need for improvement regarding the existing certification schemes in the EU.15  Establish shared responsibility in risk mitigation amongst EU stakeholders  The recently published Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union clearly identifies the shared  responsibility of all stakeholders, and the need for all actors, to protect themselves in the context of  growing dependency on information and communications technologies. The need to develop  industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity is mentioned among the strategic priorities and  actions, and in this context: \"A prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk  management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU- wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally. The Commission  will promote the adoption of coherent approaches among the Member States to avoid disparities  causing locational disadvantages for businesses.\"16  13  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  14Recommendation 2: Foster the creation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) entity to coordinate smart grid  cyber security initiatives - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure- and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/ENISA-smart-grid-security- recommendations/at_download/fullReport  15  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  16  European Commission, 2013.

Having a  different certification approach and different requirements per country will be more costly in respect  to compliance as opposed to a European approach. As a product or system would have to undergo  recertification for each individual Member State. Therefore there is a need for a harmonized approach  that can potentially lower the cost of certification by making them exchangeable between Member  States.  Address the life cycle of an European smart grid  Certification should focus on the whole life-cycle not only on the product itself: Starting from product  development process, implementation and deployment of the systems and the operational process.18  Additionally, a certification scheme will need to incorporate the different types of certification that  apply to the product lifecycle, as product development certification, product certification and  operation certification are not subject to the same type of certification.  2.4  Desired properties of an ‘ideal’ certification scheme  Based on the observed market drivers, success stories and the stakeholder needs as addressed in  relevant smart grid security certification documents, the team has identified a set of properties which  an ‘ideal’ smart grid certification framework will need to have. Following is the description of these  properties.19 The numbering matches the numbering of the needs described in section 2.3:  1. It provides a holistic approach to ensure trust in the supply chain of the smart grid. This way, it  will provide clarity on what responsibility lies where.  2. It uses a common EU smart grid security reference model like SG-AM that is widely accepted by  European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) and Certification Bodies (CBs). There is confidence  amongst the stakeholders that M/490 is a promising initiative towards market harmonization and  interoperability.  3. It has a common baseline set of requirements described in profiles that are recognized by all  participating EU Member States, making acceptance in one Member State possibly also valid in  another. However, it must provide the Member States with the flexibility to define their own  security requirements on top of the commonly agreed European ones.  4. It uses internationally equivelant security and risk levels aligned with the levels defined in an  approach recognized by the EU members such as the M/490 SG-IS framework.  5. It includes support for components, systems and operation, so that there is one framework to  describe the security for a complete smart grid system.  6. It includes conformity testing, functional testing and interoperability testing. Depending on the  risk of nonconformity, it can be decided to perform first, second and third  party assessments.  However, in practice, only third party certification is seen as trustworthy for most cyber security  schemes.  17 1.

It facilitates public and private interaction, for example by including Technical Committee  subgroups, and having a framework coordinator as an interface between public and private bodies  8. It should not be EU mandated, but a framework providing EU guidance for implementation, and  supporting national legislation. Other discussions have suggested an EU mandated scheme, but it  will be difficult to create consensus about this.  9. It should improve the maturity of smart grid security in the EU, using initiatives that align with  smart grids such as M/490 and provide guidance for proper security measures.  10. It has a harmonized approach which eliminates the barriers and silos created by fragmented  markets. A harmonized approach is considered a major contributor to lowering the cost of  certification. The shared responsibility and the risk based approach help to contain the costs as  well.  11. It addresses patch management problems and it should include a maintenance scheme for a  product or system life cycle.  During stakeholder discussions20 about smart grid certification, there has been focus on the desired  properties of a future certification framework; the following are some of the additional desired  characteristics of this framework:  Operational in a reasonable time  It is important to promote a framework that can be implemented in the current environment, and  does not rely on future developments. This is because smart grid systems are being built already, and  to add security later on will be more costly and difficult. On top of this, the framework should be based  on existing standards and operational (e.g. SOGIS) platforms.  Take into account new and existing technologies  Certain smart grid functionalities have requirements that are not covered yet by the existing  technologies, the framework should cover new technologies as soon as they become available.  Additionally, security is a fast evolving field that needs constant updating to the latest types of threats.  Therefore a successful framework needs to be flexible enough to keep up to date with the latest  threads.  Self-certification tools  A good approach to decrease the certification process efforts in terms of cost and time is providing  vendors with self-certification tools which could be used by vendors in a pre-certified process or during  the  development phase and also give the possibility to vendors to select for a wide range of  laboratories where their products will be certified. These aspects could speed-up the process and  encourage vendors to follow certification schemes.  In line with the standardization efforts  Any certification initiative should be in line with the current EU standardization efforts, such as the  initiatives ESMIG is taking in respect to smart meter security. Although different implementations for  particular requirements could be useful for stimulating the competition, security relies also on  interoperability. Therefore a successful framework should promote alignment with existing  standardization efforts like M/490.  20  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  11  Room for special national requirements  A scheme should be EU based, but also leaves room for special national requirements. This is  necessary to accommodate the approach and legislation in different Member State, which influences  the technical decision making, and therefore also has impact on the level of risk and type of  requirements specified. A successful framework will have to accommodate national requirements,  and make it easy to adopt by Member States by taking into account the current national initiatives.  Not a single certifying authority  It is important not to have a single certifying authority, to ensure no monopoly is created on  certification, and multiple players are able to provide certification services.  Coordination  A single framework coordinator should keep oversight on issued certificates and the performance of  the certifying bodies to ensure quality is maintained, and not negatively affected by race-to-bottom  type scenario’s that can occur in a competitive market.  Transparency  The framework should offer centralised storage of smart grid security certificates to facilitate clarity  on what is certified and how. This way it is transparent for all stakeholders on what certificates are  issued and where and how the chain of trust is built in specific cases.  Motivating and beneficial for the implementer  A successful framework should motivate implementers complying with the applicable certification  schemes. Having an economic incentive can positively influence the adoption of a scheme. For  example, inclusion of a scheme as a knock-off criterion for smart grid equipment tenders can motivate  adoption.  Allow for legacy grid systems to exist side by side with smart grid systems, without compromising  security  A successful framework should make sure that it allows current grids to exist, as it will be impossible  to migrate all systems at once. Based on a risk analysis, it can be assessed per case if they can also be  part of a smart grid certification effort.  Partial certification  There have been discussions about the possibility for a partial certification to support legacy systems  and to facilitate the cases where it will be impossible to certify all components in a system. Although  this approach is understandable, it will create an inconsistent view of smart grid certification, and will  therefore undermine trust if not handled correctly.  Instead a framework should provide clarity on what the scope of a certificate is, and how it creates  the chain of trust, so it is evident what parts are covered or not, and why certification can still apply  for the use-case at hand.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  12  3 Standards and certification schemes  A desktop study has been performed to create an inventory of available information on cyber security  certification standards that are applicable to the smart grid domain. From a list of initiatives, good  practices, standards and schemes, only the items that were in line with the needs described in chapter  2 have been selected. The selection criteria included answering the following questions;  1. Is it a standard that is actually applicable to smart grid devices/systems (Meaning that standards  regarding general IT, or person certification are out of scope?21  2. Is it a standard that applies to cyber security (meaning that safety and physical security is out of  scope)?  3. Is it a standard that can support certification, audits and/or legislation (meaning that good  practices and informative standards were excluded, as they cannot form the basis for  certification)?  4. Is it a standard that is used in the EU (meaning that standards not used in EU were excluded, as  there is apparently no support from EU Member States)?  5. Is the standard supported by public and private bodies (meaning biased or vendor based schemes  were excluded)?  6. Is the standard superseded or incorporated by another applicable standard?  These criteria might be used in order to shape a European smart grid certification meta scheme which  acts as an umbrella to all existing certification standards that are relevant to smart grid security. The  reader, can get a detailed description of these criteria in annex G “Scheme mapping”. Answering these  questions yielded a list of available standards that are applicable to the smart grid domain22:  Before going into more details concerning the available standards and schemes, we need to clarify the  relationship between these two concepts: the process of certification is usually referred as  certification scheme. This process uses a set of standards. As a result we can consider, that the  standard is part or a subset of the certification scheme.  3.1 List of standards and schemes  ISO 9001  ISO 9001 is used as proof that an organisation works according to defined procedures to ensure  quality. The security certification of a smart grid is a means to improve security, and is therefore also  related to quality in the organisation. Although ISO 9001 is not a specific smart grid or security  standard, its system to ensure quality within an organisation is a good starting point for connecting  more cyber security and smart grid specific certifications. Therefore it can be used as an overall  umbrella for attaching more specific certifications, and provides context to the position of the smart  grid system in the organisation.  ISO/IEC 27001 & ISO/IEC27019  ISO/IEC 27001 is used for the certification of information security. It can be used to certify that there  are appropriate high level policies and procedures in the organisation for developing, producing,  building or operating smart grid systems and/or components. There is also IEC/ISO 27019:2013, which  21 It should be noted here that person certification is deemed out of scope for this document, as it focusses  specifically on systems, and person certification is being addressed by another ENISA project. General IT is out  of scope to ensure that the differentiating properties of smart grid systems are specifically addressed.  22 The reader might notice that some ‘schemes’ are referenced amongst the standards. This has to do with the  fact that these ‘schemes’ are variations of well known standards.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  13  provides guiding principles, based on ISO/IEC 27002, for information security management applied to  process control systems as used in the energy utility industry, but this standard does only provides  guiding principles, and no certifiable requirements.  IASME  IASME is a lighter version of ISO/IEC 27001 that is developed by CESG in the UK. It can be used for  small and medium sized organisations in the UK that need to address information security, but where  ISO/IEC 27001 is too complex and resource intensive to implement.  IEC 62443  IEC 62443 is a standard that is based on the ISA.99 standard and focusses on functional security.  ”Functional security” means that it will describe the functionality the system or component needs to  possess, but does not address the technical implementation. It can be used to describe the functional  security properties of a smart grid system.  It provides certification of industrial control systems (IEC 62443 part 3.3) and components (IEC62443;  Part 4.2, is currently still in draft, so not certifiable yet)23 there is however an initiative started in the  IECEE24 to extend certification for industrial components to IEC62443 in late 2015. The IECEE scheme  does not however explain anything on how to address security certification specific details, and is  mainly focused on mutual recognition and assessing tests performed at manufacturer side25.  ISO/IEC 15408 Common Criteria (C.C.)  ISO/IEC 15408 is commonly called ”Common Criteria” and sometimes abbreviated to “C.C.“ It is a  framework in which computer system users can specify their security functional- and assurance  requirements, vendors can then implement and/or make claims about the security attributes of their  products, and security evaluation laboratories can evaluate the products to determine if they actually  meet the claims.26 It can be used in the smart grid to verify if a product meets the claims regarding the  technical implementation of those security functions.  CPA  CPA is a UK based approach for gaining confidence in the security of commercial products. It is  intended to complement or sometimes replace other approaches such as Common Criteria. CPA is  currently only used in the United Kingdom.  CSPN  CSPN is a French scheme defined by ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes  d’information) that aims to provide a first-level security certification for IT security products. Its scope  is similar to the vulnerability analysis performed within Common Criteria. Its goal is to provide first  relevant results in a less complex way then Common Criteria but without guarantee of completeness.  ISO/IEC 19790  ISO/IEC 19790, is a certification standard for security requirements for cryptographic modules (similar  to NIST FIPS 140-2). It is used to validate whether the cryptographic core of any security product is  23 https://www.isa.org/pdfs/autowest/phinneydone/  24  http://www.iecee.org/cbscheme/cbfunct.pdf  25 - http://www.iecee.org/ppt_presentations/iecee-peer-assessment.zip  26 ENISA Protecting Industrial Control Systems - Annex III. ICS Security Related Standards, Guidelines and Policy  Documents [Deliverable – 2011-12-09], available for download from the ENISA website;  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems/annex-iii/at_download/fullReport  https://www.isa.org/pdfs/autowest/phinneydone/  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  14  properly implementing technical details in accordance to the design and specification requirements  laid out in the standard itself.  A more extensive description of each of these standards is provided in ”Annex B: Schemes applicable  to the smart grid domain”, and a full list of all the evaluated standards and Schemes is shown in Annex  C: This annex also shows the reason why a particular scheme or standard was excluded.  Each certification standard has some specific properties that are applicable to a specific field of  application. Below are the certification standards divided into the application fields, and described  what specific properties are related to that field.  3.2  Meta-scheme  There is no uniform method available for putting together different certification schemes. There is a  standard called ISO 17067 (Annex F: ISO/IEC 17067 - fundamentals of product certification and  guidelines for product certification schemes) that provides properties for product certification  schemes. But this is not a good base for mapping exercises, as it does not address the differentiating  properties like practical implementation, and market reception of a standard or scheme. Therefore a  different method has been used to map the schemes. The method used is based on a textual analysis  of the information publicly available for each scheme, amended by the practical knowledge of the  team about the schemes. Additionally, the ENISA research for cloud computing certification has  performed similar research regarding cloud computing schemes, 27  and SM-CG has provided a  document comparing some of the schemes found28 that has been used for input as well.  To be able to map the different schemes, an analysis has been made regarding the available schemes  by comparing the following properties:  Administrative details   Name   Type   Group/initiative/organisation   Related documents  Geographic relevance   Geographic relevance: Worldwide, European, Subgroup of European Member States, and  National.  Current maintenance and activity of the program working group   Status: draft/final, version 1,2,3?   Publication date: how actual is it, is it ongoing?  Program scope definition   Description:   Target audience:   Addressed Industry:   Technical relevance of the methodology   Product testing   The heaviness of the program   Resources needed,   Certification delay  27 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  28 SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach - part II; Annual report 2013  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  15   Maintenance scheme definition for the program  National and international accreditation body recognition   Recognition by accreditation bodies (ISO, IEC, other?) National and international;   Definition of CB accreditation criteria  Ability to evolve to a European certification scheme, from the current situation  Program stakeholder trust   Public private participation   Information provision to stakeholders   Use of proven methods and maintaining skills   Defining security measures for the premises of developers / OAM actors  Market drivers for the program   Economics: The scheme includes measures to limit the cost and/or workload and/or  duration of evaluation  The complete set of properties can define a meta-scheme, and it is part of the framework one can use  to position and define the available certification and standards and schemes. The meta-scheme details  regarding each examined certification standard is listed in “Annex D.2 List of schemes”.  3.3 Qualitative analysis of examined certification standards  There are several types of certification standards and schemes which are categorised according to the  following certifications:   Operation certification   System (functional) certification   Development certification   Component certification  The following sections provide the general descriptions and main differences amongst these  standards. Please see ”Annex D: Scheme mapping” for a more detailed table with descriptions and  comparisons.  3.3.1 Operation certification scheme  Operation certification revolves around the certification of the operation of a process according to a  defined standard. It is not uncommon for a company to be certified for operation, as it is commonly  used to enforce trust in the operating capabilities of a certain company.  Examined operational certifications are:   ISO 9001   ISO/IEC 27001   IASME  The following unique and differentiating properties apply to operation certification:   It focusses on a management system or management of a process   The certification is based on documentation and audits as proof for operating according to a  certain standard.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  16  3.3.1.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  ISO 9001 provides an auditing and certification possibility about properly documenting what processes  are implemented. ISO/ IEC 27001 seems to be an international standard that is widely recognised in  Europe. IASME provides a good example of a light version, but is only available as an UK based scheme.  3.3.2 System certification scheme  System certification revolves around the certification of a complete (smart grid) system, including the  system hardware components, software configuration and related procedures according to a defined  standard.  It is in practice difficult to maintain system certification, due to the fluent nature of a smart grid  system, and static nature of certification. As a system usually is not a static entity, there will be changes  and additions made during its lifetime. Certification relies usually on the fact that a certain snapshot  of a system is made, and a certificate issued will apply to that specific snapshot. Any change to the  system (good or bad) will invalidate the certification. Making the certification a potential cumbersome  and costly task, that can discourage improvements.  Examples of system certification are: IEC-62443-3-3 (SSA)  IEC62443-3-3 provides a good overview of what aspects can be addressed in system certification.  Properties observed in system certification:   Components are integrated into a  single system.   May consist of multiple Security  Zones.   The certification is based on a  complete system, including  components, configuration,  procedures and people. A  combination of certified  components, people and  procedures is used to create a  chain of trust.  3.3.2.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  There is a certification scheme for IEC 62443-3-3 called ISASecure. However, there is no certification  body in Europe that supports it at this moment. Regarding smart grid systems, no other formal security  certification schemes have been identified.  3.3.3 Development certification scheme  Development certification schemes are characterised by the certification of a process. The goal is to  provide proof that the method used to develop a certain smart grid system, -product or -component  is in line with standards.  There are multiple schemes that focus on development certification, or include it as an aspect.  Especially in the field of cyber security, there is recognition for development certification as a means  of providing trust in a certain product.  Examples are:  Figure 1  - IEC 62443-3-3  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  17   ISO9001   IEC62443-2-4 (Installation and maintenance requirements for industrial automation control  systems suppliers, no certification available yet, since it is still in development)   IEC62443-4-1 (ISASecure certification of product development requirements)29   CPA addresses criteria regarding secure development   CC addresses criteria regarding secure development   CSPN addresses a few criteria regarding secure development  Properties observed in development certifications:   Development certification is a process certification that applies to how a product is created   It revolves around using certified people, and certified tools to create a chain of trust30   The validation is done with process, documentation and code audits.  3.3.3.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  ISO9001 is a high level assurance standard that a company can use to seek adherence to a documented  high level of quality. This quality standard can be used for developers of systems to prove they develop  code according to documented procedures. Standards such as IEC 62443-2-4 and IEC62443-4-1 can be  followed to prove suppliers also meet certain security requirements when developing a device or  system, but the standards are in draft, so no formal certification is possible.  Additionally Common  Criteria and CPA contain aspects that address the development environment of products as well, but  the level of detail differs per standard and/or security level. Finally, Common Criteria does not address  the certification of people.  3.3.4 Component certification scheme  Component certification revolves around the certification of a single component or product, and it is  focussed on the certification of a component or product according to a defined standard or set of  requirements. The examined component certification standards are:   IEC62443-4-2 (ISASecure certification, security requirements for industrial automation control  system components).   ISO/IEC 15408 C.C.   CPA   CSPN   ISO/IEC 19790  Properties observed in component certification are:   Available from a single supplier   Supported by a single supplier   Can be identified by a product name and version  3.3.4.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  CPA and CSPN are national schemes for the UK and France that can be applied. IEC 19790 is only  applicable for cryptographic modules, but is also useful for guidance on testing and product  requirements. C.C. covers most aspects of CPA and CSPN. C.C. is international recognised and  extendable but is a framework, and therefore depends on specific protection profiles for a specific  29http://www.isasecure.org/PDFs/Articles-and-Technical-Paper- Folder/ISASecure_AssetOwnerViewpoint_Oct2013_v05.aspx  30 Although this holds true only for a part of the schemes above mentioned  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  18  type of product, and a security level (Evaluated Assurance Level, EAL, please see “Annex B.1 Common  Criteria (CC)” ) for more detail. SM-CG provided a more extensive analysis on component certification  for the smart meter 31 . IEC 62443-4-2 provides security requirements for industrial control  components, but currently there is no official certification scheme associated with this standard, as it  is still in draft form. ISASecure is a certification scheme for IEC 62443-3-3. However, there is no  certification body in Europe that supports it at the time of writing this report. There is however an  initiative started in the IECEE to extend certification for industrial components to IEC62443 in late  2015. But this scheme will initially focus on components.  3.4 How are schemes currently applied in the EU?  This section gives an overview of the implementation status of smart grid certifications across Europe.  Then the key findings will be presented as a means of identifying what could be used as a base towards  a more harmonised smart grid security certification practices framework.  The descriptions regarding the smart meter certifications have been taken from the SM-CG research  performed in 2013. 32  Other descriptions have been based on online sources, observations and  minutes of meetings of standardization meetings of several standards (i.e. IEC 62351) that were  attended by the authors’ team.  3.4.1 Germany  The German Ministry of Economy (BMWi) has mandated the Federal Agency for Security in  Information technology (BSI) to develop a protection profile for smart meter Gateways. The protection  profile is based on Common Criteria. The level of security has been defined EAL4+, which is similar to  EAL level 4; methodically designed tested and reviewed, but augmented with vulnerability analysis  requirements with more stringent conditions.  Besides this component certification, the energy companies in Germany have to be compliant with  IEC/ISO 27001 by the end of 2015.  3.4.2 United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom the Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) has defined Security  Requirements and an end-to-end security architecture.33  The Security requirements are needed for the Commercial Product Assurance (CPA), a certification  that is mandatory for all smart metering products in the UK. CESG (Communications-Electronics  Security Group) provides smart metering security profiles according to the CPA scheme called ”smart  metering security characteristics”.34 The production of these profiles has been coordinated by the  DECC with input by a cross-industry working group.  The UK government also promotes Cyber Essentials35. Cyber Essentials is a UK government scheme  encouraging organizations to follow good practices in information security. It includes an assurance  framework aligned with ISO27001 and IASME, and a simple set of security controls to protect IT. It  was launched in 2014 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.  31 SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach – part II;  Annual report  2013  32 source: SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach - part II; Annual report 2013.  33 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65685/7339-exp-doc- support-smets1.pdf  34 https://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/Product-Assurance/CPA/Pages/Security-Characteristics.aspx  35 http://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/cyber-essentials/Pages/cyber-essentials.aspx  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65685/7339-exp-doc-support-smets1.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65685/7339-exp-doc-support-smets1.pdf https://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/Product-Assurance/CPA/Pages/Security-Characteristics.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  19  3.4.3 France  France is considering a certification scheme called CSPN (Certification de Sécurité de Premier Niveau),  that is based on Common Criteria. The scheme is used for meters and data concentrator security  certification. France is considering smart grids as specific Industrial Control Systems. A law was passed  in December 201336 which allows the French Prime Minister to enforce legal requirements in order to  increase the security level of critical infrastructures. The decrees related to this law are currently being  drafted and should be published by the end of 2014. This will apply to smart grids as well as other  critical infrastructures. ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information) has also  published a framework for classifying Industrial Control Systems and a set of technical and  organisational rules applicable to Industrial Control Systems.  3.4.4 Other Member States and EFTA countries  The Dutch national organisation of DSO’s ”Netbeheer Nederland”, has developed the Dutch Smart  Meter Requirements (DSMR). Although security and privacy were not the primary focus of the initial  specification, additional security and privacy requirements have been included to the updated DSMR.  The Netherlands is considering developing a protection profile based on Common Criteria. They  expressed their interest to collaborate on a European level.  Norway and Sweden have the intention to develop a protection profile based on Common Criteria.  SERTIT (Sertifiseringsmyndigheten for IT-sikkerhet) is currently representing Norway as a member of  the international community called “Arrangement on the Recognition of the Common Criteria  Certificates in the field of Information Technology Security (CCRA)”.Several EU Member States and  EFTA countrieshave indicated to prefer a European wide harmonized security approach, but will define  their own level of security. Additionally, Norway is also a member of the SOG-IS agreement.  In the industry, ISO 27001 is internationally recognized, and common in Europe.37 Other standards  mentioned in the energy industry are ISO27002 and IEC 62443 but no formal legislation or guidance  is provided.  3.4.5 European cooperation for Accreditation (EA)  EA has been appointed by the European Commission to manage the accreditation infrastructure  within the EU, EFTA (European Free Trade Association) and Candidate countries. It is a non-profit  association responsible for defining, harmonising and building consistency in accreditation within the  European region, with the aim of reducing barriers to trade, and contributing to protecting health,  safety and the environment. EA ensures that national accreditation bodies operate in accordance with  the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.  36 http://www.defense.gouv.fr/portail-defense/enjeux2/politique-de-defense/la-loi-de-programmation- militaire-lpm-2014-2019/la-loi-de-programmation-militaire-lpm-2014-2019  37  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm?certificate=ISO/IEC%2027001&  countrycode=AF#standardpick  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm?certificate=ISO/  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  20  Figure 2 - EA scheme  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  21  3.4.6 SOG-IS  The SOG-IS (Senior Officers Group for Information Systems) is a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA)  between the participants. The participants agree that IT products and protection profiles which earn  a certificate can be procured or used without the need for further evaluation. It seeks to provide  grounds for confidence in the reliability of the judgements on which the original certificate was based,  by requiring that a Certification Body (CB) issuing Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria  (ITSEC), or Common Criteria (CC) certificates, should meet high and consistent standards.  The objectives for signing an MRA are:38   Objective 1: Facilitating trade exchanges; The potential advantages for economic players who  wish to benefit from these agreements are as follows:  o To make the regulatory process easier for introducing products on the importing  country’s market as far as the conformity assessment against the technical regulations  of the importing country is performed before shipment (a reduction in the expense  and time required to obtain product compliance with the importing country’s  technical guidelines, non-duplication of audits and inspections). Third-party  conformity assessment of European products intended for export is conducted by one  of the European bodies designated for this purpose (and vice versa).  o Greater legal security and enhanced predictability in trade (fewer inspections  conducted by authorities of the importing country in the exporting country).   Objective 2 : a tool for deregulation; For products subject to third party conformity  assessment procedures, mutual recognition agreements are clearly meaningless unless:  o Conformity assessment bodies (CABs) have been set up with the necessary authority  and technical competence to perform this work and are allowed to also perform on  the basis of the third country’s technical regulations;  o The regulatory authorities decide to recognise the results of conformity assessment  procedures issued by CABs located in the other party’s territory.   Objective 3: a step for regulatory convergence; According to the European Commission,  mutual recognition agreements may have an educational impact: enhanced understanding of  the technical regulations of the other contracting party and the experience gained in  implementing these regulations in the context of the MRA agreement may be factors that  could contribute to greater mutual understanding of each contracting party to the others’  certification scheme details.  However, the usefulness is also limited due to:   The recognition and acceptance by each of the Participants that this Agreement does not  create any substantive or procedural rights, liabilities or obligations that could be invoked by  persons who are not signatories to this Agreement.   The recognition and acceptance by each of the Participants that this Agreement has no  binding effect in national, international or European Union Law.  38  Source: MUTUAL RECOGNITION AGREEMENTS THEIR ROLE TODAY AND TOMORROW - a  presentation on the role of mutual recognition agreements made at the Workshop on Standardization  and Conformity Assessment Matters in the Transition Economies  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  22  Please see “Annex H: SOG-IS” for more details.  3.5 Key findings  In Europe, only a few Member States (Germany, UK and the Netherlands) have developed specific  security requirements for smart grid equipment. These initiatives have been developed in order to  meet specific national smart grid needs and diverse national energy law requirements. As a result,  there is diversity in the specifications for security requirements.  The shortage of security requirements and initiatives might be due to the fact that there is not a clear  view of the amount of publicly known cyber incidents39. Due to the unspecified number of incidents,  there is no direct recognition of the necessity to improve cyber security from a corporate point of  view. This lack of recognition is caused by the fact that private companies will not admit they had a  cyber-related incident as this might damage their reputation. Additionally, cyber incidents are not  easy to identify after the fact, as the systems often are too damaged or do not store enough data for  effective forensic research to be carried out.  The identified smart grid security requirements focus on Home Area Network (HAN) and Grid-End  applications. This is mostly due to the fact that, at the moment, the key driver behind the development  of the smart gird, is the roll-out of the smart meters which are devices oriented to service end user  needs . Based on the desktop research, the team couldn’t identify security requirements for other  than the HAN parts of the smart grid (e.g. substation automation and protection, EMS, DMS etc.) in  European Member States.  Furthermore, the production process of these profiles varies among Member States; in Germany the  profile has been developed by a public Authority (BSI) while in Netherlands the private sector has the  leading role. This might have an impact on the acceptance level of the profile by the industry due to  different degrees of private sector involvement in the security requirements’ making process.  Although there are organisations supporting European wide certification such as EA and SOG-IS, there  is no legislation enforcing a particular scheme.40 Common Criteria have nevertheless been adopted in  almost every country, although they are sometimes amended or replaced by other national schemes  to support specific national needs. In some but not all European Member States there is some form  of public-private participation regarding security certification for the energy industry. This situation  also illustrates the difference in attitude among EU Member States, where some feel the need to  instate legislation before EU mandates, while other Member States prefer to use the guidance of the  EU to decide what scheme to adopt.  There is currently no harmonisation, there are different methods, schemes and different levels of  security defined per Member State, but there is some synergy in the adopted schemes primarily based  on the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) concept. There have been national initiatives to improve  cyber security for the smart grid by adopting a certain certification approach.  39  Examples of root causes for such cyber incidents might include: human errors, system failures, natural  phenomena, malicious actions and third party  40 Germany is going to mandate ISO27001 in 2015.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  23  4 A Chain of trust for the smart grid  4.1 The supply chain view of the smart grid  To be able to create trust regarding the security of the smart grid, it is necessary that the stakeholders  are confident in the aspects deemed relevant. Certification is a formal means to create confidence,  and thus trust in the relevant aspects, by means of a standardised validation process.  A typical supply chain as described in the needs (see 2.3) that can be applied to the smart grid domain  is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3 - Typical supply chain  It is important to note that a single certification scheme spanning across the entire smart grid supply  chain is quite complex, and requires a lot of actors to work together. As such, a large scheme is usually  too complex, in practice it is split up into separate schemes that are specific for the separate steps in  the chain. To be able to trust this supply chain, certification can then be used to create a chain of trust.  By ensuring that each step in the supply chain follows certain security rules, a trusted environment  can be created, where it can be assumed that a system is being operated in a secure manner. However,  if a step in the chain is compromised, it can cause a security breach, that could affect the rest of the  chain as well.  Figure 4 shows a mapping of security certification on the smart grid supply chain.  Figure 4 – Supply chain certification  This chain can only be trusted if the certification scheme used for the certification itself is also trusted  by the stakeholders.  The trust in a certification scheme or lack thereof, is a common issue and there  are multiple solutions to solve this. On a national level, trust in a scheme is commonly created by  following guidelines such as ISO/IEC 17067 that is used for product certification schemes. (For a  detailed explanation of ISO 17067 please see “Annex F: ISO/IEC 17067 - fundamentals of product  certification and guidelines for product certification schemes)”. This allows for the certification body  that applies the scheme to receive formal accreditation by a nationally recognised accreditation  organisation. Such a national organisation is subsequently recognised by an international forum of  accreditation organisations, therefore effectively creating trust in the certification scheme. A similar  hierarchy is depicted in Error! Reference source not found..  The process describing the details regarding accreditation, certification, related organisations and  their interactions are detailed in “Annex E: Description of accreditation and certification”.  4.2 Analysis of the smart grid chain of trust  This section provides a definition and reference model of a chain of trust for the smart grid. Then it  explains how the smart grid can be mapped on existing security certification standards and practices  using this chain of trust. Additionally it describes how a risk based analysis can define the level of  security of a smart grid, and how a smart grid certification scheme can be validated.  development production product system operation  development  certification  production  certification  product  certification  system  certification  operation  certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  24  4.2.1 Certification and the chain of trust  ”Figure 5 - Smart grid chain of trust” is a depiction of the complete supply chain for a system in a smart  grid environment41 based on the analysis of the smart grid stakeholders involved in development,  production, integration and operation, and the model outlined by the standard IEC 62443 (please see  B.6 IEC62443 for details on this standard and its relevance to the chain of trust concept).  Figure 5 - Smart grid chain of trust  According to this model certification takes place at three levels:  1. Smart grid operator certification.  2. Smart grid system integration certification  3. Smart grid component certification,  A smart grid may suffer from complexity in respect to system design, which makes it different to  standard ICT components as far as certification is concerned. A smart grid is geographically spread  over a large area and there are multiple interconnections on different parts of the system. A smart  grid can communicate with a Home Automation Network (HAN), Decentralised Energy Resources  (DER) or an energy trading system. These interconnection can occur on numerous parts of the system,  and exchange low or high level data with parties that can have different levels of trust. These  interactions should not affect the chain of trust, and this is theoretically feasible as long as guidelines  and best practices for third party interconnections are respected and implemented in line with NIST  IR 7628 and ISO27002.  41 It should be noted that such a system does not encompass the complete European smart grid, but will be a  system that is a part of it. The system described here has a system responsible, and will interact with other smart  grid systems on different abstraction levels.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  25  Cyber threats evolve over time. Vulnerabilities in hardware and software  and new attack factors are  a reason of daily concern. There is need for continuous certification maintenance to stay up to date  with the latest known attack factors. This need is recognised by the stakeholders (see 2.3) and the  certification lifecycle will need to be taken into account when looking at what should be certified.  “Figure 5 - Smart grid chain of trust” includes the lifecycle by taking into account component and  system maintenance in the form of the block ‘continuous certification maintenance’. Maintenance is  commonly reviewed by equipment vendors who supply patches, and smart grid system users, who  apply patches and expand on the system. System integration does not commonly include a  maintenance scheme, as it is normally applied as a project with a discrete deliverable (e.g. deliver a  working system x at date y). Therefore continuous certification maintenance for system integrators is  left out of this figure.  4.2.2 Adoption of SG-AM for a chain of trust model  The SG-AM Framework and reference model aims at offering support for the design of use cases for  smart grids. Support takes place by following an architectural approach which allows for a  representation of interoperability viewpoints in a technology neutral manner for both current smart  grid implementations and the implementations of the smart grid rolled out in the near future.  The SG-AM model can be applied for individual and interacting entities across the smart grid domain,  and provides insight on how a stacked layer of security, can provide a layered approach for smart grid  security. It relates back to the defence in depth strategy, where secure components (component  layer), secure communication between components (communication layer), and a secured  information and function layer, provide a layered model of smart grid cyber security. It also provides  insight where security standards possibly overlap or complement each other.  It can be concluded that SG-AM meets the requirements for different certification standards for smart  grids. Existing certification schemes address the issue of certification of smart gird chain elements (see  Figure 6) separately.”Figure 6 - chain of trust model” shows an interpretation of the SG-AM model  combined with the earlier introduced chain of trust (Figure 5) that can be used to map different  standards and schemes suitable for smart grid security certification.  A chain of certificates which covers all aspects depicted in Figure 5 (e.g. vendor development,  production and product security combined with secure system development, and secure operation)  supports the enhancement of trust for the whole smart grid supply chain.  The level of security that is covered by the individual certificates can then be related to the place of  the certificate in the value chain and the SG-AM model, and the role it will fulfil within the smart grid  chain. This means that the model below can be used to give insight into dependencies, how certificates  relate to each other in the smart grid, and provide a means to assess the impact of the security level  used in a specific part.  It can also be used to provide insight into how security should be mapped on a specific SG-AM use  case. For example, when a SG-AM use case is created for a smart meter chain, the SG-AM use case  model can help in mapping the types of certification required to build a chain of trust within the smart  meter SG-AM use-case. This approach provides a way to relate an SG-AM model based use case to  specific certification schemes, and provides context to the coverage of an, existing or to appear, smart  grid related certification scheme.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  26  Figure 6 - chain of trust model  The model in Figure 6 is a graphical representation of how the described chain of trust could be applied  to an SG-AM use case. This image seems to imply that the complete chain should be applied for each  layer, for a complete security certified smart grid, but the SG-AM model was not intended to describe  a complete smart grid prototype, but provides a method to create a common reference model for a  smart grid use case. Only after such a SG-AM use case is defined the suggested chain of trust model  described in figure 5 can be applied for each layer in the use case.  It should also be recognized that the model does not imply that the SG-AM use case and its related  layers are in an one-to-one relation with the layers of the chain of trust model. It is merely a graphical  representation that demonstrates the different levels where different certification schemes can  reside; these layers are not meant to be fully aligned with the layers used in the SG-AM model.  4.2.3 Security requirements  Having defined the reference model, the next step towards more harmonised smart grid security  certification practices is to define the security requirements of European wide technical communities  (e.g. EURELECTRIC, ESMIG). There are only three42  identified sets of security requirements in the  European market. The definition of these requirements is beyond the scope of this document, but  42 Germany, the Netherlands and UK, see section 3.5  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  27  could be based on profiles like the Common Criteria protection profiles or the CPA Security  Characteristic.  4.2.4 Definition of risk levels aligned with the SG-IS framework methodology  To be able to minimize the cost of certification, one can take into account the criticality of the  component subject to certification. This way, the proper level of depth and thoroughness of  evaluation can be determined.  A risk-based approach can help to focus certification efforts on smart  grid use cases, and therefore provide insight into the appropriate level of security. Additionally, a  European approach for the level of security will facilitate in a common reference model for all Member  States. This section will describe an approach of how the M/490 SG-IS framework can help to answer  the question ”what to certify?”.  In 2012 the Smart Grid Information Security (SG-IS) working group of the Smart Grid Coordination  Group (SG-CG) provided a methodology to help define security requirements through a Use Case  based approach. The SG-IS toolbox provides Smart Grid Use Case stakeholders an easy and pragmatic  way to identify their security needs and identify gaps in use case recommended standards to deploy  security requirements as needed. In 2014 this is renamed to the SG-IS framework. The use case model  utilized by SG-IS is based on the SG-AM framework, and is therefore usable to perform risk  assessments on SG-AM use cases. Therefore it is a useful methodology to align with when defining the  risk levels within the chain of trust.  The SG-IS framework describes in detail how to assess use cases, lists the relevant assets categories  and identifies a model for determining the Risk Impact Level (RIL) of specific information assets in a  use case. The following picture summarizes how the methodology is intended to be applied.  Figure 7: Methodology for security requirements definition  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  28  Using the SG-IS methodology can help to focus certification efforts on the smart grid use case with the  highest risk impact level.  4.2.4.1 Risk impact levels  The Risk Impact is established by analysing how incidents related to a particular information asset  affect the process where it is involved. Different incidents produce different impacts, so the highest  impact identified in all the possible scenarios determines the Risk impact level for the analysed  information asset. The result is expressed in a scale from 1 to 5 where level 1 is the lowest possible  and 5 the highest risk impact level.  4.2.4.2 Risk Impact Categories  Security incidents against information assets affect their involved processes in different ways. The SG- IS Impact Analysis methodology identifies six different types of affectation or categories. Categories  should be evaluated independently using the scale defined above (from 1 to 5).  There are six categories that are evaluated in this process to identify the risk impact produced by  security incidents. Two of these categories are subdivided in subcategories. More categories and/or  subcategories could be added at this level in order to get a deeper and more specific risk impact  analysis in smart grids. The figure below shows the described categories criteria and its risk impact  levels:  The SG-IS Framework provides a way to identify security requirements for specific Use Cases and SG  assets. Then the asset owner can determine the level of security for his asset, based on the  methodology proposed and the risk appetite, by using the SG-IS framework.  As both the SG-AM model and the SG-IS framework are recognized by Member States as an accepted  approach for describing the smart grid and the relevant risk levels, they provide a good basis for a  European framework which contributes to more harmonised smart grid security certification  practices.  Combining the two (SG-AM and SG-IS), one can build a chain of trust for a specific national use case,  as well as the level of security needed for this use case. This way a Member State can describe its own  use case and perform a risk assessment, both based on an accepted EU methodology.

The next step is then to define how the level of security for each part of the chain of trust is to be  evaluated. For this, existing certification schemes can be selected on national level. Based on the  national use cases stakeholders can take decisions regarding scheme implementation, specific  requirements, and validation activities.  4.3  Conformity assessment and its relation to testing  To be able to certify the security of the smart grid, asset owners will need to provide proof that security  requirements set by the technical committees are met. Such proof is usually generated by assessing  (or testing) the conformance to this set of security requirements. In this respect conformity  certification, conformity assessment and testing are commonly used interchangeably. To understand  what certification is, and how it relates to terms such as conformity assessment and testing, this  section explains their relation. For a more in depth view, please see Annex G: Conformity assessment  and testing. Additionally, ISO provides a comprehensive overview online:  http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf.  Conformity assessment can be undertaken by the supplier of a product or service, its purchaser and  other parties who might have an interest such as insurance companies and regulatory authorities. It  is convenient when talking about conformity assessment to refer to the parties as follows:   First party (1st party) – the person or organization that provides the object which is being  assessed;   Second party (2nd party) – a person or organization that has a user interest in the object;   Third party (3rd party) – a person or body that is independent of the person or organization  that provides the object, and of user interests in the object.  A 1st party conformity assessment is perceived as less trustworthy then a 3rd party assessment.  Therefore, in relation to the risk that nonconformity poses, a choice is made to what parties are  allowed to perform the assessment. An SG-IS framework aligned approach (described in section 4.2.4  4.2.1) can help to decide the risk for a specific scenario and associated assurance level.  The following items are the most common conformity assessment activities.   Inspection is the examination of a product design, product, process or installation and the  determination of its conformity with specific requirements or general requirements.   Certification by a certification body formally establishes that a product, service, organization  or individual meets the requirements of a standard after evaluation.   Accreditation provides independent attestation of the competence of an individual or an  organization to offer specified conformity assessment services (e.g. testing, inspection or  certification).   Testing is the determination of a product’s characteristics against the requirements of the  standard. Testing can vary from a non-destructive evaluation (e.g. X-ray, electrical, etc.) after  which the product is still fit for use, to a destructive analysis (e.g. chemical, mechanical, etc.)  after which the product is no longer fit for use.  There are different types of aspects that can be focussed on while testing.

The required functionality of the test subject is usually  described in a standard that the assessment refers to when performing the tests.   Interoperability testing: testing to assess the ability of two or more systems to exchange  information and to make mutual use of the information that has been exchanged. 43  With respect to smart grid cyber security, all three aspects play a role. Conformity testing needs to be  performed to ensure that smart grids comply with requirements set by the EU, Member States and  users of smart grid systems.  Functional security testing needs to be performed to support the implementation of cyber security in  the grid, as conformity testing normally does not focus on the validation of security functions that the  device can support. For example, the conformity security requirement is for a device to have access  control, but the functional security requirements can be that access control should work in a specific  manner.  Interoperability testing is an important aspect of conformity assessments of communication  standards. For example, an encryption mechanism needs to be interoperable between smart grid  devices to be useful. If interoperability testing is skipped for an encrypted communication channel,  the system can be conforming to all security requirements, and have been functionally tested, but can  still not be able to use the encrypted channel because the devices are not interoperable.  Penetration testing  A more specific form of testing that is common in security tests is penetration testing. This type of  testing revolves around the exploitation of possible design flaws and weaknesses to compromise the  security of a device. Such tests do not focus on a specific test book, but rely more on the creativity of  the tester, and the time there is available to perform a penetration test. Penetration testing can be  incorporated as part of a functional test, by describing it as a negative test case for a functional  requirement. For example, the validation by the following functional requirement can be tested by a  penetration test; ”the device under test shall not provide means to circumvent the access control  mechanism”. Such a requirement can be validated by a negative test scenario, where the device will  be subjected to a penetration test in an attempt to circumvent the access control mechanism.  A successful smart grid cyber security certification practices framework will need to include all 3 topics,  conformity testing, functional testing and interoperability testing. It should also address penetration  testing as part of the functional tests. Depending on the potential severity of the security risk if a  product is not conform, it can be decided to perform first, second or third party assessments.  However, in practice, only third party certification is seen as trustworthy for most cyber security  schemes.  The different conformity assessment techniques can be combined with the Risk Impact Levels  described in the previous section. This way, it is possible that some certification cost can be decreased  because it is expected that less critical devices might not be subject to certifications but to less  expensive conformity assessments (see annex G for a summary on conformity assessment and  testing).  43  ITU-T Z.450 - Quality aspects of protocol-related Recommendations - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-  T/publications/Pages/structure.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  31  4.4  Description of certification scheme relations loosely based on SG-AM  model  This section describes a loosely based mapping of security certification schemes, related to the chain  of trust model described in section 4.2.1. It is not possible to exactly map the schemes to the SG-AM  model, as it would not provide a picture that does justice to the scope of the different certification  approaches. Therefore the domains in the original SG-AM model have been replaced by stages in the  product lifecycle; development, production, operation and maintenance. The zones in the SG-AM  model have been replaced by the product ownership stages that a product goes through during  production, integration, acceptance and operation. In this way the model should provide guidance  of where to place a certification scheme in the smart grid chain of trust. The layer definitions from the  SG-AM model have been kept intact, and should help to understand the level of abstraction of the  standard.  The following layers are described by the SG-AM model:   Business layer   Function layer   Information layer   Communication layer   Component layer  Below follows a description of each layer generally aligned with the SG-AM model44, and suggested  which of the identified certification schemes can be applied to that layer.  44 SG-AM model described at  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf on page  27  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  32  4.4.1 Business layer  The business layer represents the business view on the information exchange related to smart grids.  SG-AM can be used to map regulatory and economic (market) structures and policies, business  models, business portfolios (products and services) of market parties involved. Also business  capabilities and business processes can be represented in this layer. In this way it supports business  executives in decision making related to (new) business models and specific business projects  (business case) as well as regulators in defining new market models.  On the business layer, the focus of security is around the business- and corporate regulatory  processes. They are high level, and provide controls for management and decision makers that can be  used to steer and implement more detailed procedures and technical requirements.  Figure 9 - business layer  ISO9001  ISO27001  IASME  ISO9001  ISO27001  IASME  ISO9001  ISO27001  IASME  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  33  4.4.2 Functional layer  The functional layer describes functions and services including their relationships from an  architectural viewpoint. The functions are represented independent from actors and physical  implementations in applications, systems and components. The functions are derived by extracting  the use case functionality which is independent from actors.  IEC 62443 provides requirements and guidance for security functions for industrial control systems.  Unfortunately not all parts of the standard provide formal certification schemes. Additionally, the  standard focusses on security requirements and design, but does not go into detailed descriptions of  components and communication protocols. Below is a mapping of the different parts to the trust  chain.  Figure 10 - Functional layer  4.4.3 Information layer  The information layer describes the information that is being used and exchanged between functions,  services and components. It contains information objects and the underlying canonical data models.  These information objects and canonical data models represent the common semantics for functions  and services in order to allow an interoperable information exchange via communication means.  On the information layer there is nothing available for the certification of security. Such certification  would have to focus on securing the information exchange at the technical level. This encompasses  IEC 62443-3-3  IEC 62443-2-4 IEC 62443-2-2  IEC 62443-3-1 IEC 62443-3-2  IEC 62443-4-1 IEC 62443-4-2  IEC 62443-2-3  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  34  such aspects as configuration, data model and database encryption, but it could also address key  generation, installation, distribution and daily handling of sensitive data. Data encryption in devices  on information level is not very common in embedded system, unless it is a smart meter device (where  readings and keys have to be stored secure). On computer systems it is possible, but no certification  scheme is available.  4.4.4 Communication layer  The communication layer seeks to describe protocols and mechanisms for the interoperable exchange  of information between components in the context of the underlying use case, function or service and  related information objects or data models.  There are standards available for secure communication, such as IEC62351 and the DLMS/IEC 62056.  These standards recommend the implementation of communication security measures such as  encryption and authentication. But no certification schemes are available yet to formally test the  security of device communication. Validation can be done for example in part by penetration testing,  or more in depth by validating the communication security requirements. The validation of  communication security requirements does not proof that all security requirements have been  implemented, but only provides proof that the communication interface comply with the security  requirements defined in the communication standards.  4.4.5 Component layer  The emphasis of the component layer is the physical distribution of all participating components in  the smart grid context. This includes system actors, applications, power system equipment (typically  located at process and field level), protection and tele-control devices, network infrastructure (wired  / wireless communication connections, routers, switches, servers) and any kind of computers.  Component layer security focusses on security of the components used in the smart grid. It addresses  the security of the individual components, focussed on hardware, software, and the functions the  devices should support. Although most standards listed here will also take into account the higher  level requirements, they have been listed here, as they are applied and validated from a single  device/product and/or system perspective. The technical validation of communication between  systems, secure information handling and secure system management is out of scope.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  35  Figure 11 - Component layer  There is currently not one certification scheme that can cover all aspects of the smart grid. And there  is also no combination of schemes that can be used to cover everything, as the communication and  information layers do not have certification schemes that formally focus on these aspects.  But this does not need to be a major issue, as the practical implementations of the smart grid also do  not cover every aspect of the SG-AM model. Additionally, several schemes mentioned can actually  cover the parts described, if they are amended in line with profiles or standards and requirements in  force.  Another important observation is that some standards like parts of IEC 62443 are not published yet,  so they cannot serve as a basis for certification. Also there are currently no interoperability tests or  certification schemes available for secure smart grid communication standards such as IEC 62351.

There is currently no established model for a smart grid chain of trust in the EU. It will be a  challenge to create consensus about a chain of trust model. Although the concept is known, it has  not been specifically adopted by any Member State in the context of smart grid certification. A  chain of trust seems not to be explicitly mentioned in any complete certification approach. Only  partial chains for the smart grid are supported for shared risk mitigation. It will be a challenge to  ensure that responsibility of risk mitigation is properly assigned to the responsible party, as the  interconnected nature of the grid makes it sometimes difficult to identify the accountable party  in relation with a specific action.  2. A common reference model like SG-AM for smart grid security the is in line with SOG-IS is only  available for components and operational parts; this however is not harmonized within nor  adopted by all Member States. There is no scheme for the complete EU smart grid. Due to the  large number and fragmented nature of the smart grid stakeholders, it will be a challenge to create  consensus regarding a common reference model.  3. There is no common baseline set of security requirements that can be recognized by all  participating EU Member States. Only three Member States45 have defined their own protection  profiles. These requirements are different per country, they do not focus on the whole grid but  on specific parts of it (i.e. smart meters), based on different standards and adopted by technical  committees (TCs). It will be difficult to create a common baseline, as multiple Member States  adopted widely different approaches, and have different requirements and levels of security  related to smart grids.  4. At European level equivelant security and risk levels are provided by the M/490 SG-IS framework  but this is not formally recognized as an EU wide standard level for smart grid security. Recognizing  the M/490 SG-IS framework should be feasible, as it has been regarded by several Member States  as a good reference model.  5. There are certification schemes for components and operation, but there is none for systems  certification in Europe. There is no scheme that includes all aspects and enables a pan European  approach. It will be a challenge to create a single scheme that includes all aspects of smart grid  certification, as there are gaps and overlaps in the schemes that apply to a specific topic (please  see chapter 4.2 for a detailed analysis).  6. Depending on the scheme and type of testing, procedures and methodologies are available, but  detailed procedures are fragmented and not readily available for all smart grid aspects. Some  certification schemes can overcome this by defining the test cases on a per-case basis.  7. Some schemes facilitate public and private interaction by including Technical Committee  subgroups that could be useful on an EU level, but only for product certification. There is no EU  body to facilitate public-private interaction. It will be a challenge to find an existing group of  experts that can form a technical committee and having enough commitment to produce a  workable scheme.  45 Germany, the Netherlands and UK, see section 3.5  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  37  8. There is not a single scheme that can provide EU guidance for implementation, and supporting  national legislation. There are some schemes that have been mandated by certain Member States  that could also be applied at an EU level. There is no EU body to provide guidance for a scheme  implementation and keeping the scheme up to date. It will be a challenge to raise the maturity  level of all the Member States, as the amount of effort that is put in smart grid security differs per  Member State (please see section 3.4 for the detailed analysis).  9. There is no alignment with smart grid definitions such as M/490 and only guidance for proper  security measures on a national level that differ per Member State. As there is currently no  harmonization, it will take considerable effort to create a harmonized approach that has  consensus, but still complies with the desired scheme. Such an approach is necessary to facilitate  the growth to a scheme that is geared towards service EU Member States’ needs.  10. There are barriers and silos created by fragmented markets. There is no harmonized approach  causing higher costs for certification per Member State. There are similarities among countries  that can be used to create consensus, and a combination of schemes could be acceptable on an  EU level, assisting in a lower cost. It will be a challenge to keep cost to a minimum while still  providing security, as security is a topic that penetrates all aspects of a system, and therefore has  to be widely implemented without directly providing a clear justification of the necessary cost and  effort.  11. Some schemes include a maintenance scheme, but no harmonized approach or EU interface is  available for all aspects of the smart grid. Additionally, there could be gaps with respect to life  cycle coverage when they are analysed in more detail. It will be a challenge to create a harmonized  maintenance and life cycle scheme. The available schemes do include one, but they do not relate  to one another.  5.2 Gaps and challenges related to the desired properties  The analysis also includes the gaps regarding the additional properties of the desired scheme, as  outlined hereunder:  Operational in a reasonable time  There are various scheme components available to support a single pan EU framework that can be  rendered operational within a reasonable time frame. The organisation to maintain such a framework  and harmonise the schemes related to smart grid security needs to be further analysed and appointed.  Additionally, some of the standards such as IEC 62443 are still largely in draft stage and therefore in  the current state they are not necessarily usable for certification. To become operational will be  challenging in terms of consensus building and in creating all the background information to make the  entire stakeholder group understand what and how to follow. Additionally, it will be difficult to get all  standards published that are relevant, but currently still in draft such as IEC62443.  Recommendations based on accepted good practices  There are plenty of recommendations, but there needs to be a selected subset of them that is  coherent and will be advertised as a single package for smart grid security in the EU. There are multiple  standards that cover the same topics, but they sometimes address them on different abstraction level.  It will be a challenge to create one set of recommendations with the right level of abstraction that  does not overlap.  Easy to be adopted by the Member States  As the schemes adopted by different Member States vary, a gap lies in the utilisation of one  harmonised scheme to make it easy to adopt. As several Member States have already taken steps in  utilizing a specific scheme, it will be a challenge to create consensus regarding the adoption of one  single approach, if that means stopping the national approach, and redoing certain activities.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  38  Take into account new and existing technologies  Standards development is progressing slower than the evolution of security challenges. Therefore it is  necessary to keep the level of a standard high to maintain its relevance in time. Technical  subcommittees are then able to fill in the currently relevant security details by means of specifications.  A good example of this approach is seen with the protection profile used in Common Criteria; Annex  B.1 Common Criteria (CC). However, in the current situation the standards and schemes such as  common criteria are present, but the smart grid specific protection profiles (with the exception of the  smart gateway profile defined by BSI) and security use cases addressing the chain of trust are not  available. It will be a challenge and a constant effort to create an environment where the baseline of  security requirements grows with the technological advancements.  Self-certification tools  No pre-certification self-assessment tools have been identified during this analysis. It will be a  challenge to provide self-certification tools because it is difficult to assess beforehand what smart grid  use cases will be implemented, and to what level of detail a toolbox can assist in the implementation  of the use case.  In line with the standardization efforts  The identified certification approaches are aligned with existing standards, used in the Member States,  but there is currently no EU initiative for accomplishing this alignment for the whole smart grid supply  chain. As already mentioned in chapter 4, the smart grid chain of trust involves several standards for  the different smart grid layers. Alignment with several standards might be a challenge because of  possible overlaps amongst standards and of different approaches in meeting the specified security  requirements.  Not a single certifying authority  A single certifying authority should not be a problem while using ISO/IEC organizational frameworks  including IAF, ILAC (please see ”Annex E: Description of accreditation and certification” for an  explanation) and national accreditation bodies. Not having a single scheme framework has  advantages, but a growing number of certification bodies will also cause more administrative  overhead and less control over the quality of the certification bodies and the evaluations they  perform. It will require periodic audits that will have to be paid by one or more of the stakeholders.  Central certification storage  A centralized storage or public site for accessing smart grid certificates is not available. In the case of  Common Criteria, it is maintained by the scheme itself. In the case of an EU based approach, it should  logically be maintained by the EU smart grid security framework owner. Central storage needs to be  maintained and updated to be useful. This cost money that will have to be paid in some form or  another.  Partial certification  There are approaches that result in partial certification, by allowing the choice of what requirements  will be complied to. This however reduces the amount of trust in the scheme in those particular cases  (e.g. common criteria allows for the certification of a specific product configuration to a subset of  requirements).46 It will be a challenge to avoid trust issues regarding partial certification such as it  46 http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2003/03/01/Windows-and-Common-Criteria.aspx  http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2003/03/01/Windows-and-Common-Criteria.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  39  being perceived as a paper exercise. For example, the different levels below Common Criteria EAL4  are more paper exercises then real security tests.  This report also identifies additional challenges which can be found in “Annex I: Additional identified  challenges”.  To summarise, there are numerous gaps and challenges that have been identified during the desktop  exercise performed. Probably the most important one is that there is no single approach that covers  all aspects of smart grid security certification. And even a combination of all schemes could leave gaps  if they are not carefully combined. Additionally there are varying approaches and requirements in  each Member State, and no coordination or harmonisation at European level.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  40  6 Recommendations  This chapter provides an overview of all the recommendations based on the standard analysis, the  current situation in the EU Member States, the desired situation and the gaps and challenges. The  smart grid security certification recommendations refer to most of the challenges described above.  Recommendation 1: Appoint a EU steering committee 47  to coordinate smart grid certification  activities  The European Commission should invite relevant stakeholders from both the public and private sector  and mandate a EU steering committee with the aim to coordinate the EU smart gird certification  activities with the following tasks:   Providing oversight of smart grid security certification, security requirements definition,  and coordination with national schemes.   Enhancing the transparency and the trust of the smart grid certification activities by  disseminating information and good practices on smart grid certification and providing  centralised storage and publication of smart grid certificates together with the national  schemes.   Providing guidance and advice to interested parties on implementation of national  schemes.   Keeping the smart grid certification apparatus up to date regarding the latest threats, by  using feedback from both the public and the private sector and lessons learned during the  certification process.  Owner: The EU Commission should take action to request the formation of this steering committee.  Recommendation 2: Provide guidance and a reference model to implement a chain of trust  The EU steering committee should promote the concept of a chain of trust, similar to that described  in chapter 4.2.1 that provides transparency and increases trust in the supply chain of the smart grid.  A national use-case approach that is aligned with the SG-AM common reference model can be used  as the basis for this activity. It should also have a set of common  high level requirements that are  recognized by all participating EU Member States. This common set of requirements can be amended  by more detailed national requirements that address the specific use case details for a Member State  on top of the commonly agreed ones. (Using SG-IS framework described in chapter 4.2.1)  Owner: The EU steering committee should provide guidance on how to implement smart grid security  certification and the chain of trust.  Recommendation 3: Use of the currently available standards and schemes, and accommodating,  better coordinating and harmonising national approaches  It is recommended that any approach to better harmonised security certification practices should be  easy to implement by combining currently available standards described in section 3.1. This will  facilitate the adoption by Member States and leverage the existing standardization efforts. A mapping  exercise might take place in order to map and position different standards. This activity might take  into account the properties described in section 3.2 together with the smart grid chain of trust.  Owner: The EU steering committee should perform a mapping exercise amongst available standards  and schemes used in the EU.  47 A voluntary committee is recommended.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  41  Recommendation 3a: The steering committee should advise the Member States on how to  map their preferred standard/scheme to theSG-AM  Chapter 4.4 provides a mapping  of security certification schemes, related to the chain of trust  model, to the SG-AM.  Owner: The EU steering committee should undertake to provide guidance and advice to  Member States on how to implement the smart grid security certification framework.  Recommendation 4: Promote international recognition of schemes  Existing recognition agreements like SOG-IS (see section 3.4.6) should be utilised to create  international requirements, and an international framework for certification.  Owner: The EU steering committee should ensure that certification schemes used, can operate at  international level.  Recommendation 4a: Align with European accreditation bodies  Each Member State should use the European accreditation bodies to recogniseits national  scheme according to the EU reference model and use agreements like SOG-IS MRA for  recognition of security certification bodies. This will ensure there is not a single certifying  authority, and the process remains impartial (see annexes E and H).  Owner: The Member States should use certification schemes that are recognised by European  accreditation bodies. This should also be a requirement of the framework.  Recommendation 5: Promote validation that is commensurate with the risk appetite involved in  each use case.  Conformity testing, functional testing and Interoperability testing can be used to provide assurance  that specific security requirements are met. Depending on the potential criticality of the security risk,  in case of non conformance with requirements, it can be decided to perform first, second or third  party assessments. However, in practice, only third party certification is seen as trustworthy for most  cyber security schemes and is therefore recommended. Controls should talso ake into account the  size of the certified entity and its capability to carry out background checks; it should also be in line  with the risk assessment results.  Owner: The EU steering committee should promote a risk based approach to ensure the certification  effort is in line with the risk appetite involved in the in scope use case.  Recommendation 5a: Ensure proper security levels for use cases  The Member States should make sure that the level of security is explicit for each certificate.  The matching of security certificate levels to a use case should be facilitated by the EU  steering committee.  Owner: The Member States should perform a risk assessment to ensure that national use  case risk levels are clear, and the technical committees should match the proper assessment  levels to each risk level.  Recommendation 6: Facilitate flexibility to update profiles so they can cope with the fast moving  security landscape  In principle, technical committees should develop national profiles covering all possible smart grid use  cases. The profiles can then be updated more frequently than the schemes or standards. Any activity  towards harmonisation should provide enough flexibility for the security requirements in the profiles  to evolve over time and be able to cope with a changing security and threat landscape. Furthermore,  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  42  updates in schemes and profiles should be announced so that they can be incorporated in the other  national profiles. This way the maturity48 of all national schemes can evolve over time.  Owner: The EU working group should ensure the maintenance of the profiles so they keep up to date  with current technology developments and announce updates to the Member States.  Recommendation 7: Use national profiles as detailed specifications of international  standards to cover the specific national use cases and nationally supported test and  certification methods  The national profiles should reflect the national smart grid use cases’ risk. The profile should refer to  standards for details, amend them or expand on them to provide the flexibility to incorporate national  requirements in an international base. The profile should contain test procedures for the national  specific requirements, and provide required testing depth for the national use cases aligned with the  international SG-IS framework risk levels.  Owner: The Member States wanting to implement smart grid security certification will have to create  national profiles containing the details for their national use cases.  Recommendation 8: Use technical committees in collaboration with the European energy  associations to create European profiles  The European Commission should support the definition of European wide security requirements. To  this direction, European Commission should invite the private sector for cutting edge technology  specific requirements and guidance in the form of technical committees, to amend slow moving  standards with detailed European profiles. The profiles should be created by Tecnhical Communities’  subgroups with EU wide scope and in collaboration with smart grid relevant associations (like ESMIG  and EURELECTRIC), but they can be based on the published national initiatives (like the smart  gateway profile and the CPA49 security characteristic).  Owner: The European Commission will have to support expert groups to set up technical committees  to create profiles for the technical details for the national use cases, where other national schemes  or national endorsed international standards can be used as input if needed.  Recommendation 9: Provide official third party certification and self-assessment tools for pre- assessment  The EU steering committee should encourage operational communities to provide tools that will help  the adoption of the framework, and will make it attractive for industry to implement. Additionally, the  national technical committees should assist the industry with pre-assessment tools to facilitate  national compliance.  Owner: The EU working group should encourage the provision of tools in respect to the framework,  while the national technical committees should provide pre-assessment tools for specific schemes.  Recommendation 10: Promote compliance and harmonization as economic advantage and a cost  reduction measure  The European Commission and the Member States should promote commercial advantages for the  private sector (e.g. ease of conformace assessment; lower insurance premiums, brand recognition) to  endorse conformity assessment practices. As already demonstrated, lowering the cost is one of the  48 In this particular context, maturilty reflects the ability of a certification scheme to contain security objectives  which meet the latest cyber security threats.  49 Commercial Product Assurance, see section 3.4.2  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  43  most outstanding needs of the users. Harmonisation is considered as a major contributor to lowering  the cost of certification together with the shared responsibility and risk based approach.  Owner: The European Commission and the Member States should promote the advantages of better  harmonised and coordinated smart grid certification practices.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  44  7 Conclusions  Below is a visualised summary of the key recommendations presented. The figure provides the context  of where the smart grid certificate applies, based on a use case. The certificate needs to indicate what  component, or components are being certificated, and what other certificates are used to obtain a  chain of trust. The interpretation of the figure is provided with an example of an asset owner who  wants to provide a smart grid device (e.g. meter) according to the harmonised security certification  practices presented in this report.  Each device, will, at least, have to comply with the national use case for the Member State it intends  to supply the device to. This does not mean it cannot comply to other Member States’ uses cases, but  for certification for a specific Member State, it will need to focus on that specific use case. The national  specific use case can be described by the SG-AM model. The SG-AM model can then be used as a basis  to create the chain of trust model (As described in section 4.2.1 - Certification and the chain of trust).  This chain of trust model can then be used to identify the needed national requirements profile and  national certification scheme to create the chain of trust for this use case, and will indicate the levels  of security that the asset owner will have to provide aligned with the risk involved as indicated by the  SG-IS framework risk assessment as described in section 4.2.1.  The resulting national scheme will have to be submitted to the EU steering committee for  administration by the technical committee that created the scheme. The national scheme will  normally be created by a national technical committee consisting of stakeholders like the relevant  member state authority(ies), solution providers, user associations and national certification bodies.  They will have to deploy a SG-IS framework aligned methodology on the national use-case, and can  get advice by the overseeing EU steering committee for correct implementation. The developed  national scheme could for example, indicate the need for a certificate for secure development and  production for the creation of a chain of trust on the component level. Depending on if the  manufacturer already has this certificate for the same level or higher than indicated by the risk  assessment, the available certificates can be used as proof for the chain of trust. When all certificates  are obtained, they can be delivered to the EU steering committee for review and publication.  After publication, it is possible to easily assess for any other use case, if the level of security of the  certified meter is sufficient for the usage in the use-case at hand. Provided the evaluated national  profile matches the profile requirements of the use-case. Over time, these national profiles should  move toward international profiles to minimize re-certification efforts due to additional requirements.  Additionally, European technical communities could provide international EU based profiles that could  be the common denominator of the national ones so as to ensure: a) the participation of the Member  State; and b) flexibility of the Member States to define extra national requirements on top of the  European ones.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  45  Figure 12  - Smart grid certification process  The key component towards more harmonised and better collaborated certification practices is a  steering committee that is recognised by the EU which provides a focus point for smart grid security  certification related activities. This body will need to provide the guidance and general approach on  smart grid certification. This approach should be aligned with the SG-AM model, the SG-IS framework  and the currently available initiatives and certification schemes. The body will also provide a central  point for the publication of smart grid security certificates.  Furthermore, it will assist the Member States in creating their national mapping according to the EU  smart grid security certification guidelines, and will ensure that national use cases and schemes are  kept up-to date, and certificates are published. Finally, it will ensure that the national approaches are  mostly based on EU wide profiles, or at least harmonised, as much as possible and common  approaches can eventually migrate from a more national approach to a more common set of EU  requirements that can be endorsed by all Member States. This way the desired situation can be  created where there is a common EU baseline, while national requirements that cannot be  harmonised are still addressed.

To become a  certification body, the organisation needs to be certified by an accreditation body.  Certification Certification refers to the confirmation of certain characteristics of an object, person, or  organization. This confirmation is often, but not always, provided by some form of  external review, education, assessment, or audit.  Certification body A certification body is an organisation which is accredited by an accreditation body. The  organisation has demonstrated their competence, impartiality and performance  capabilities. When applicable, their test labs and calibration laboratories where tested  against international recognised standards.  Common criteria The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (abbreviated as  Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer  security certification.  Declaration of  conformity  A signed declaration to indicate that the product meets the requirements of the  directive(s) which apply to it. For the declaration to be truly meaningful the signatory  should also have the authority to commit the resources required to ensure that the  conformity assessment process is properly completed.  First-party  certification  In first-party certification, an individual or organization providing the goods or services  offers assurances that it meets certain claims  Notified Body A Notified Body, in the European Union, is an organization that has been accredited by  a Member State to assess whether a product meets certain preordained standards.  Second-party  certification  In second-party certification, an association to which the individual or organization  belongs to provides the assurance  Smart grid  environment  The whole environment in which smart grid components are implemented, however this  can be a hybrid system in which legacy SCADA systems are part of  Smart energy system A specific network, dedicated developed as a smart energy system. Old fashioned legacy  system are not part of a smart energy system  Third-party  certification  Third-party certification involves an independent assessment declaring that specified  requirements pertaining to a product, person, process or management system have  been met  Technical committee A group responsible for development and revision of any document or documents  emanating from a Technical Committee project.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  48  Annex B:  Schemes applicable to the smart grid domain  B.1 Common Criteria (CC)  Scope  Common Criteria is an industry-independent / product independent scheme. At present, certified  products belong to a wide array of categories going from access control systems to operating systems  and biometric systems and devices. Common Criteria offer pre-defined evaluation assurance levels  (EAL), corresponding to increasing assurance efforts and vulnerability testing. A certification roughly  consists of two different activities:   Defining and assessing a consistent set of security requirements against a given security  problem   Assessing that a product is compliant with these security requirements.  These two activities are defined in ISO/IEC 15408 (also called Common Criteria for Information  Technology Security Evaluation) and the associated Common Criteria Evaluation Methodology (CEM).  The Common Criteria allow the creation of a Protection Profile (PP) which is a set of security  requirements for a type of product which may support many different implementations. The security  requirements are derived from a set of security objectives that cover the security problem definition  consisting of threats, assumptions and policies.  Common Criteria is used as the basis for a Government driven certification scheme and typically  evaluations are conducted for the use in Federal Government agencies and critical infrastructure.  The Participants of Common Criteria share the following objectives:   To ensure that evaluations of Information Technology (IT) products and protection profiles  are performed to high and consistent standards and are seen to contribute significantly to  confidence in the security of those products and profiles   To ensure that evaluations of Information Technology (IT) products and protection profiles  are performed to high and consistent standards and are seen to contribute significantly to  confidence in the security of those products and profiles;   To improve the availability of evaluated, security-enhanced IT products and protection  profiles;   To eliminate the burden of duplicating evaluations of IT products and protection profiles;   To continuously improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the evaluation and  certification/validation process for IT products and protection profiles.  Organization  The scheme is maintained under and international arrangement and endorsed by a group of national  authorities (Certification Bodies). A Certification body (called CB hereafter) is generally a  governmental agency or bureau of the national defence ministry.  Any Common Criteria evaluation relies on competent and independent licensed laboratories. These  Evaluators (also called laboratories or ITSEF: Information Security Evaluation Facility) are accredited  by a national standardization entity, and licensed or otherwise approved by the national Certification  Body.   In Canada, the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) under Program for the Accreditation of  Laboratories (PALCAN) accredits Common Criteria Evaluation Facilities (CCEF)   In France, the Comité français d'accréditation (COFRAC) accredits Common Criteria evaluation  facilities, commonly called Centre d'évaluation de la sécurité des technologies de  l'information (CESTI). Evaluations are done according to norms and standards specified by the  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  49  Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (ANSSI). ANSSI is also performing  the licencing of the CESTI to attest that they have the appropriate security skills.   In the UK the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) accredits Commercial Evaluation  Facilities (CLEF)   In the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredits Common Criteria Testing Laboratories  (CCTL)   In Germany, the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)   In Spain, the National Cryptologic Center (CCN) accredits Common Criteria Testing  Laboratories operating in the Spanish Scheme. Protection file for smart meter Gateways   The German Ministry of Economy (BMWi) has mandated the Federal Agency for Security in  Information technology (BSI) to develop a protection file for smart meter Gateways. The  protection profile is based on Common Criteria. The use of certified Gateways is mandated  for all smart meters.   The German protection profile creates security on a very high level (CC level EAL 4+). The  problem using this protection profile is that accreditation is not internationally accepted and  the CC Level is higher than other countries accept.   Norway and Sweden accepted Common Criteria as recognised standard for certification.  Evaluation methodology  The Common Criteria consists of the following catalogues:   CC-Part 1: presents the conceptual framework of the methodology and is intended to  developers as well as evaluators.   CC-Part 2: describes a comprehensive series of standardized security (functional)  requirements   CC-Part 3: lists a comprehensive series of standardized security assurance requirements,  which describe how a product should be evaluated.   CEM: which defines the minimum actions to be performed by an evaluator in order to conduct  a CC evaluation  B.2 CPA  Scope  CPA1 (Commercial Product Assurance) is a national GB scheme intended for commercial security  products. CPA is defined and maintained by CESG (Communications Electronic Security Group – the  Certification Body), which directly accredits evaluation laboratories (CPA Test Labs). The scheme aims  at demonstrating compliance to national requirements, while rationalising legacy national schemes  and maintaining the value of previously issued certificates.  CPA covers only specified types of products/features of products, while Common Criteria is industry /  product independent. Examples of products covered by CPA are data sanitation, VPN’s, firewalls …  Other types of products are in progress, such as smartphones or hardware security modules.  CPA offers one assurance level: Foundation Grade. This grade is intended for COTS (Commercial Of- The-Shelf) products used to process information classified as official in the new Government  Classification Policy.  The two other tiers of this classification policy (secret and top-secret) require bespoke equipment to  be evaluated under the CAPS (CESG Assisted Products Service) scheme. CAPS evaluation is performed  by CESG itself, instead of commercial laboratories such as in CPA.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  50  Organization  As mentioned above, CESG is GB Certification Body. It accredits evaluation laboratories and maintains  CPA. Evaluation laboratories are called CPA Test Labs. Such laboratories perform evaluation of  products for foundation grade certifications only. Evaluation laboratories mainly use evidence created  by the developer, but can be led to create specific tests in order to check requirements left untested  by the developer. Furthermore, cryptographic evaluation cannot be performed by the developer; it  must be performed by an independent entity, if not by the evaluation laboratory.  Evaluation methodology  The evaluation methodology relies mainly on Security Characteristics (SCs) and the CPA Build  standard.  The Security Characteristics define the expected security features of the product; they are focused on  functions and are product specific (e.g. specific for data sanitation, VPN’s, firewalls, etc.). Security  Characteristics play a similar role to the Protection Profiles in CC. In the beginning of an evaluation,  the evaluation laboratory refines the applicable Security Characteristics into Tailored Security  Characteristics. Tailored Security Characteristics play a similar role as Security Targets in CC.  The CPA Build Standard defines the assurance requirements for product development and breaks into  twelve high-level requirements addressing four themes:   Configuration Management   Flaw remediation   Testing   Developer security measures  Such requirements are somewhat similar to CC components listed in CC-Part3.  B.3 ISO/IEC 27001  ISO/IEC 27001 specifies the normative requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and  continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS) within the context of the  organization. ISO/IEC 27001 formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring  information security under explicit management control. ISO 27001 provides a framework for  certification. ISO/IEC 27001 is not especially focussed on smart grid, however an (energy) organisation  can be certified to be compliant to this international standard.  ISO/IEC 27002 provides an outline or good practice guide for cybersecurity management. It includes  guidelines for an organisation to obtain certification to the ISO 27001 standard. Once obtained, the  certification lasts three years. Intermediate audits may be carried out during those three years,  depending on the auditing organisation.  System operators in Germany and the UK have to be ISO/IEC 27001 compliant.  B.4 IASME  IASME is a UK-based standard for information assurance at small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). It  provides criteria and certification for small-to-medium business cyber security readiness. It also allows  small to medium business to provide potential and existing customers and clients with an accredited  measurement of the cyber security posture of the enterprise and its protection of personal/business  data.  IASME was established to enable businesses with capitalization of 1.2 billion pounds or less (1.5 billion  Euros; 2 billion US dollars) to achieve an accreditation similar to ISO 27001 but with reduced  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  51  complexity, cost, and administrative overhead (specifically focused on SME in recognition that it is  difficult for small cap businesses to achieve and maintain ISO 27001).  The cost of the certification is progressively graduated based upon the employee population of the  SME (e.g., 10 & fewer, 11 to 25, 26 - 100, 101 - 250 employees); the certification can be based upon a  self-assessment with an IASME questionnaire or by a third-party professional assessor. Some  insurance companies reduce premiums for cyber security related coverage based upon the IASME  certification.  B.5 ISO 9001  ISO 9000 is a series of standards, developed and published by the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), that define, establish, and maintain a quality assurance system for  manufacturing and service industries. The standards are available through national standards bodies.  ISO 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality management systems, including the eight  management principles upon which the family of standards is based. ISO 9001 deals with the  requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standard must fulfil.  ISO9001 provides an auditing possibility, but nothing else, as it is mainly about properly documenting  what actions are performed.  Third-party certification bodies provide independent confirmation that organizations meet the  requirements of ISO 9001. Over a million organizations worldwide are independently certified, making  ISO 9001 one of the most widely used management tools in the world today.  B.6 IEC62443  ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define  procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS).  This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and  control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing  industrial automation and control systems.  These documents were originally referred to as ANSI/ISA-99 or ISA99 standards, as they were created  by the International Society for Automation (ISA) and publicly released as American National  Standards Institute (ANSI) documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the ANSI/ISA-62443  series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the  corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards.  ISA/IEC-62443 is a set of standards and technical reports defining functional requirements and  guidelines for implementing electronically secure ICS implementations. ISA/IEC 62334 focuses on all  ecosystem players and consists out of 13 distinct parts (standards) organized in four categories: (i)  General, (ii) Policies and Procedures, (iii) System, and (iv) Component.  1. The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts,  models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and  security life cycles for IACS.  2. The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects  of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.  3. The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and  requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit  design model.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  52  4. The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development  and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control  product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the  procurement of secure products.  Two parts are currently published and belong to the System category:  3-1 “Security technologies for  IACS” and 3-3 “System security requirements and security levels” defining the Security Levels (SL) 1 to  4 in an ICS environment.  Two parts are published under review: 2-1 “Requirements for an IACS security management system”  is based on ISO/IEC 27001(2) and belongs to the Policies and Procedures category.  1-1 defines the  “Terminology, concepts and models”.  Seven parts are under development and two parts are planned.  B.7 ISO/IEC 19790  Scope  These two standards are the ISO counterpart of the US NIST FIPS 140-2, Security requirements for  cryptographic modules and the derived test requirements. As such, ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759  are applicable to validate whether the cryptographic core of any security product is properly  implementing an approved suite of cryptographic protocols, modes of operation and key sizes, while  protecting this implementation and the critical security parameters, such as keys, in accordance to the  design and specification requirements laid out in the standards. There are four levels of security  defined, and ISO/IEC 19790 contemplates a variety of possible implementations, both software and  hardware.  Figure 13 - IEC 62443 overview  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  53  Organization  Compliance to ISO/IEC 19790 is an open matter, in accordance with the existing European regulations  dealing with product compliance. Since this or an equivalent harmonised standards not referred in  any European Directive, it is not subject to the usual requirements for Certification Bodies to operate  under Notified Bodies, but Certification Bodies for ISO/IEC 19790 are simply subject to accreditation  under the applicable national accreditation entity.  The European co-operation for Accreditation (EA), and more specifically, the EA Multilateral  Agreement (EA MLA) ensure cross-European recognition of ISO/IEC 19790 product compliance  certificates.  Evaluation methodology  ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759 are conformity testing standards, so products are tested for  compliance against the applicable and very specific requirements, leaving out much of the subjectivity  required for security evaluation. The requirements are set in ISO/IEC 19790, and the derived tests are  specified in ISO/IEC 24759.  The conformity testing of the cryptographic protocols demand the existence of a reference  implementation, and a standardized protocol to verify the correctness of the algorithm  implementation, that allows a quick verification process. The requirements that apply to the  cryptographic module need to be re-instantiated by the tester for each product.  The whole process is usually faster and cheaper than an equivalent security evaluation.  B.8 CSPN  Scope  The CSPN is a French scheme defined by ANSSI that aims at providing a first-level security certification  for IT security products. Its scope is similar to Common Criteria, with the following specificities:   The assurance process is simplified   The evaluation is focused on vulnerability analysis   The actors are committed to a given evaluation duration and cost  IT products can currently apply to CSPN if they belong to a specific list of domains (e.g. data deletion,  firewalls, secure communication, etc.). This list is regularly updated to address new needs.  It should be noted that standard CSPN excludes products too complex to be evaluated in an expected  duration and cost and products including non-standard cryptography.  Organization and evaluation methodology  The process is similar to the Common Criteria process. Instead of applying CC security and assurance  requirements (see CC description) the developer uses guidelines described in CSPN. CSPN also has  common features with CPA, especially the domain-specific approach.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  54  Annex C:  Standards and certification schemes  The following articles, standards, schemes, services and organisations have been reviewed in the  research related to Europeans smart grid security certification schemes:  Articles and investigations   ENISA: Protecting industrial control systems, Annex III   ENISA Appropriate security measures for Smart Grids Final   Security_Certification-A_critical_review_2010-10-06-ICSJWG   ahmadi-paper_gil Lpdf - The Need for Security Testing and Conformance Standards in the  smart grid   The Escorts and Viking projects   http://www.isacahouston.org/documents/RedTigerSecurity- NERCCIPandotherframeworks.pdf   CRISALIS - Critical Infrastructure Security Analysis  Security and/or smart grid standards and schemes   M/490-SG-IS   WIB M2784 PCS Vendor Security v2NISTIR 7628   NIST 800-53   NIST 800-115   ISA/IEC62443   IEC61850   IEC60870-5   IEC62351   Common Criteria/IEC 15408 framework   CESG CPA framework   NERC-CIP   ISO27001/2/5/9   DIN SPEC 27009 (2012-04)   US-SCADA Test bed specification from DHS-INL Idaho  Smart grid security services   Wurldtech Achilles certification   ISCI ISASecure EDSA Certification   Exida's Integrity Certification  Current stocktaking lists the following additional sources and initiatives eligible for investigation:   www.syssec-project.eu   ENCS Topsectoren project   BSI group (German)   Sans institute   Digital bond   EPRI organisation   CPNI (UK) best practices   SERTIT, CSEC, UL, Infineon, ERNCIP, NEI   CEN,/CENELEC/ETSI   Smart Grid Coordination Group, WG Smart Grid Information Security   Smart Grid task Force Expert Group 2 Smart Meters coordination Group  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  55   SG-TF EG2, intermediate results of JRC study on privacy seals   CRISALIS,   ENCS,   ESMIG,   NERC-CIP/NIST,   Smart meter DLMS,   Dutch/Belgium IEC60870-5-104 User Group,   Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) International User Group for IEC61850   USEF (Universal Smart Energy Framework) - Smart Energy Collective  Based on the provided model of what needs to be certified (the SG-AM and chain of trust model  described in section “4.2.1 Certification and the chain of trust”) a desktop study has been performed  to create an inventory of available schemes that are applicable to the smart grid domain. From a list  of initiatives, best practices, standards and schemes, only the items that were in line with the needs  described in chapter 2 have been selected. The selection criteria included answering the following  questions;  1. It is a scheme that is actually applicable to smart grid devices? (meaning that standards regarding  general IT, or person certification are out of scope)  2. It is scheme that applies to cyber security? (meaning that safety and physical security is out of  scope)  3. It is a scheme that can support certification, audits and/or legislation? (meaning that best  practices and informative standards were excluded, as they are too vague)  4. Is the scheme is applicable in the EU? (meaning that schemes not used in EU were excluded)  5. Is the scheme supported by public and private bodies (meaning biased or vendor based schemes  were excluded)  6. Is the scheme superseded or incorporated by another applicable scheme?  The following schemes have therefore been excluded;  Standard / scheme Exclusion Reason  1.  Borg  Not applicable for smart grid  2.  TC57 IEC61850/IEC60870/DLMS  Not cyber security  3.

There is a standard called  ISO 17067 (Annex F: ISO/IEC 17067 - fundamentals of product certification and guidelines for product  certification schemes) that provides properties for product certification schemes. But this is not a good  base for a mapping exercise, as it does not address the differentiating properties like practical  implementation, and market reception of a scheme. Therefore a different method has been used to  map the schemes. The method used is based on a textual analysis of the information publicly available  for each scheme, amended by the practical knowledge of the authors’ team about the schemes.  Additionally, the ENISA research for cloud computing certification has performed similar research  regarding cloud computing schemes50, and SM-CG has provided a document comparing some of the  schemes found51 that has been used for input as well.  To be able to compare the different schemes, an analysis has been made regarding the available  schemes by comparing the following properties:  D.1.1 Administrative details  Name:  Type:  Group/initiative/organisation: Group, initiative or organisation responsible for the creation of the  standard, guideline (e.g. ANSI/ISA), or regulatory document.  Related documents: Other identified standards, guidelines, or regulatory documents, not necessarily  related to cyber security, which have a strong relationship with the document being described.  D.1.2 Geographic relevance  Geographic relevance: Worldwide, European, Subgroup of European Member States, and National.  D.1.3 Current maintenance and activity of the program working group  Status: draft/final, version 1,2,3?  Publication date: how actual is it, is it ongoing?  D.1.4 Program scope definition  Description:  Target audience: Specifies which, among the stakeholder types identified in this study  Addressed Industry: All, Generic (ICS in general), SCADA, automation, chemistry, electricity  distribution/transportation, nuclear generation, water, railway transportation, oil and gas  distribution, etc.  Technical relevance of the methodology   The certification bodies facilitate coordination with technical communities to ensure technical  relevance.   The methodology covers generic security functionalities like: “Security audit, logs, events &  alarms”, “Role based access and account management”, “Cryptography and key  management”, etc.   The methodology or recognition agreement defines an assurance continuity process after  product updates.   The methodology supports multiple security/assurance levels.  Product testing   The certification scheme requires that functional testing takes place by and/or is reviewed by  an evaluator. During functional testing, the functions of a product are tested; this includes  50 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  51 SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach - part II; Annual report 2013  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  58  security function testing, test of the user guidance, testing of protection against misuse,  regression testing (re-testing after product changes), etc.   The certification scheme requires evaluators to perform vulnerability testing. Examples of  such tests are penetration testing, reviewing the security architecture, testing vulnerabilities  based on source code, etc. Within this context “partially covered” means that only basic  vulnerability testing is performed without for example penetration testing.  The heaviness of the program   Resources needed,   Certification delay  Maintenance scheme definition for the program   Committing to flaw remediation obligations, delays and information provision to end-users:   The certification scheme requires a procedure for providing information to end-users on  identified flaws and security incidents. Furthermore, it requires that timely action is taken for  flaw remediation.  D.1.5 National and international accreditation body recognition  Recognition by accreditation bodies (ISO, IEC, other?) National and international;   Necessary steps to instate a certification body (national and/or European)   Ability to be used to generate consensus between parties  Definition of CB accreditation criteria   The recognition agreement organization defines requirements for accreditation of individual  Certification Bodies.   The recognition agreement organization defines criteria for periodic assessment of  Certification Bodies’ continued compliance to accreditation requirements.  D.1.6 Ability to evolve to a European certification scheme, from the current situation  Ability to customize and adoption of the program for other applications. The certification scheme  applies to a wider product scope, and is able to grow. Has it been done? What needs to be changed,  are there issues identified?  D.1.7 Program stakeholder trust  Public private participation  Information provision to stakeholders   The recognition agreement organization publishes certificates and provides information on  accredited certification bodies.  Use of proven methods and maintaining skills   The certification scheme demands that configuration management requirements are put in  place. This ensures consistency of a product's performance, functional and physical attributes  with its requirements. An example of such a requirement is “All constituent components that  are used to create the finished product must be uniquely identified.”   The certification scheme requires that third-party tools and components are properly  managed. For example through procedures for acquisition, reception and testing, installation,  patching, etc. of third-party tools.   The certification scheme requires that developers are properly trained on security related  subjects.   The certification scheme demands that sufficient user guidance is being provided to actors  responsible for operation / administration / maintenance of the system.   The certification scheme requires a flaw remediation procedure tracking (amongst others)  product flaws, their effects, corrective measures, etc.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  59   The certification scheme requires a documented lifecycle model (formalization of product  specification design documentation, requirements traceability, etc.) providing for the  necessary quality control over the development and maintenance of the product.  Defining security measures for the premises of developers / OAM actors   The certification scheme demands that developers take measures to secure their premises  (e.g. through access control, human resource security …)   The certification scheme required that user guidance is provided to secure the product during  operation/administration/maintenance.

Through the application of national and  international standards, government, procurers and consumers can have confidence in the calibration  and test results, inspection reports and certifications provided.  Accreditation bodies are established in many countries with the primary purpose of ensuring that  conformity assessment bodies are subject to oversight by an authoritative body.  Accreditation bodies, which have been evaluated by peers as competent, sign arrangements that  enhance the acceptance of products and services across national borders, thereby creating a  framework to support international trade through the removal of technical barriers.  Different countries may use different security standards, best practices and frameworks regarding  Cyber Security. This section provides an overview of the accreditation and certification approach used  in the European Union.  E.1 Existing accreditation bodies  Although this report focusses on the European Union and common practices used in the EU, DNV GL  took international (worldwide) accepted certification approaches in account.  E.1.1 International recognised accreditation Fora  On the uppermost top level of the certification approach you will find the international (world-wide)  organised accreditation fora. The national bodies are all committed to one or more international  forum.  The three most important international accreditation fora are:  1. International Accreditation Forum (IAF, Quebec, Canada)  2. International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC, Rhodes, Australia)  3. European co-operation for Accreditation (EA, Paris, France)  1: IAF Accreditation arrangements are managed by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), in the  fields of management systems, products, services, personnel and other similar programmes of  conformity assessment, and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), in the  field of laboratory and inspection accreditation.  2: The ILAC Arrangement is the culmination of 22 years of intensive work. The ILAC Arrangement  provides significant technical underpinning to international trade. The key to the Arrangement is the  global network of accredited testing and calibration laboratories and inspection bodies that are  assessed and recognised as being competent by ILAC Arrangement signatory accreditation bodies. On  2 November 2000, ILAC's 36 full members, consisting of laboratory accreditation bodies from 28  economies worldwide, signed a mutual recognition arrangement (the ILAC Arrangement) in  Washington DC, to promote the acceptance of technical test and calibration data for exported goods.  The Arrangement came into effect on 31 January 2001 and was extended in October 2012 to include  the accreditation of inspection bodies  3: EA exists to coordinate and lead the European accreditation infrastructure to allow the results of  conformity assessment services in one Member State to be accepted by Regulators and the market  place in another Member State without further examination, for the benefit of the European  community and the global economy.  E.1.2 National accreditation bodies  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  70  To reach the level of certification body, the organisation should be evaluated by a national  accreditation body. The mentioned accreditation bodies below are member of EA, ILAC and IAF.  Some examples of European accreditation bodies are:  1. United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS, Feltham Middlesex, UK)  2. Raad voor Accreditatie (RvA, Utrecht, the Netherlands)  3. Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle GmbH (DAkkS)  The full list of accreditation bodies that are recognized is publicly available at;  http://www.iaf.nu/articles/IAF_MEMBERS_SIGNATORIES/4  UKAS is licensed by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills (BIS) to use and confer the  national accreditation symbols (formerly national accreditation marks) which symbolise Government  recognition of the accreditation process. UKAS accreditation provides an assurance of the  competence, impartiality and integrity of conformity assessment bodies.  With the law on the appointment of the national accreditation body, RvA is appointed as the Dutch  national accreditation body and is entrusted with the operation of accreditation as a public authority  activity.  Accreditation bodies such as UKAS and RvA are national entities responsible for national accreditation  of a certification body. UKAS is member of the EA. RvA is member of EA, ILAC and IAF.  Figure 14 - Certification top down approach  E.2 Internationally recognized certification bodies  On a national level certification bodies are then accredited to issue certificates for certification  schemes they are accredited for. Certification bodies are free to choose their way of working, within  the context of the subject of study.  Certification bodies are, or were in the past, often governmental related organisations. In the EU there  are some widely known organisations working in the field of testing and certifying.   Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, Germany)   TüV (Germany)  International  Accreditation Forums  National Accreditation  Bodies  Certification bodies  Subject of certification  http://www.iaf.nu/articles/IAF_MEMBERS_SIGNATORIES/4  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  71   Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG, UK)   Brightside (London, UK)   DNV GL (Høvik, Norway, DNV GL Energy, Arnhem, the Netherlands)  Figure 15on the next page provides an overview of the accreditation and certification approach in the  European Union.  The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation  (ILAC) oversee the accreditation bodies globally. Accreditation bodies such as UKAS and RvA are  national entities responsible for national accreditation of a certification body. Certification bodies such  as BSI, TuV and CESG are then accredited to issue certificates for certification schemes they are  accredited for. Certification schemes such as common criteria are maintained by a scheme owner.  Figure 15 - Overview of hierarchy in accreditation and certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  72  E.2.1 Certification organisations  Accreditation bodies and certification bodies use international standards to fulfil their jobs. On one  hand this is necessary to understand their way of working, on the other hand using international  standards creates worldwide acceptation for a certificate. A certificate issued in the Netherlands for a  German product will be accepted in France, the UK and even in Australia.  Figure 16on the next page provides a description of how the international structure of accreditation  and certification organisations is shaped for the IEC and ISO standards.  A test or assessment according to a scheme is executed by an independent test laboratory such as  DNV GL, TuV or Brightside, in case of common criteria.  Figure 16 - Overview ISO/IEC certification organisation  Figure 17describes an interaction diagram between different stakeholders during an evaluation. It  should be noted that the evaluation facility evaluates the product, but the certification body issues  the certificate, to ensure integrity of the parties involved.

 v) retention of records by scheme owner and certification bodies.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  75  Table 2 – building a product certification scheme  F.3 Types of schemes  F.3.1 Scheme type 1a - One or more samples of the product are subjected to the determination  activities  In this scheme, one or more samples of the product are subjected to the determination activities. A  certificate of conformity or other statement of conformity (e.g. a letter) is issued for the product type,  the characteristics of which are detailed in the certificate or a document referred to in the certificate.  Subsequent production items are not covered by the certification body’s attestation of conformity.  The samples are representative of subsequent production items which could be referred to by the  manufacturer as being manufactured in accordance with the certified type. The certification body may  grant to the manufacturer the right to use the type certificate or other statement of conformity (e.g.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  76  letter) as a basis for the manufacturer to declare that subsequent production items conform to the  specified requirements.  F.3.2 Scheme type 1b - This scheme type involves the certification of a whole batch of products  This scheme type involves the certification of a whole batch of products, following selection and  determination as specified in the scheme. The proportion to be tested, which can include testing of  all the units in the batch (100% testing), would be based, for example, on the homogeneity of the  items in the batch and the application of a sampling plan, where appropriate. If the outcome of the  determination, review and decision is positive, all items in the batch may be described as certified and  may have a mark of conformity affixed, if that is included in the scheme.  F.3.3 Scheme type 2 - Periodically taking samples of the product from the market  The surveillance part of this scheme involves periodically taking samples of the product from the  market and subjecting them to determination activities to check that items produced subsequent to  the initial attestation fulfil the specified requirements.  While this scheme may identify the impact of the distribution channel on conformity, the resources it  requires can be extensive. Also, when significant nonconformities are found, effective corrective  measures may be limited since the product has already been distributed to the market.  F.3.4 Scheme type 3 - This scheme involves periodically taking samples of the product from the  point of production  The surveillance part of this scheme involves periodically taking samples of the product from the point  of production and subjecting them to determination activities to check that items produced  subsequent to the initial attestation fulfil the specified requirements. The surveillance includes  periodic assessment of the production process. This scheme does not provide any indication of the  impact the distribution channel plays on conformity. When serious nonconformities are found, the  opportunity may exist to resolve them before widespread market distribution occurs.  F.3.5 Scheme type 4 - Periodically taking samples of the product from the point of production, or  from the market, or from both  The surveillance part of this scheme allows for the choice between periodically taking samples of the  product from the point of production, or from the market, or from both, and subjecting them to  determination activities to check that items produced subsequent to the initial attestation fulfil the  specified requirements. The surveillance includes periodic assessment of the production process.  This scheme can both indicate the impact of the distribution channel on conformity and provide a  premarket mechanism to identify and resolve serious nonconformities. Significant duplication of  effort may take place for those products whose conformity is not affected during the distribution  process.  F.3.6 Scheme type 5 - Periodically taking samples of the product either from the point of  production, or from the market, or from both  The surveillance part of this scheme allows for the choice between periodically taking samples of the  product either from the point of production, or from the market, or from both, and subjecting them  to determination activities to check that items produced subsequent to the initial attestation fulfil the  specified requirements. The surveillance includes periodic assessment of the production process, or  audit of the management system, or both. The extent to which the four surveillance activities are  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  77  conducted may be varied for a given situation, as defined in the scheme. If the surveillance includes  audit of the management system, an initial audit of the management system will be needed.  F.3.7 Scheme type 6 - This scheme is mainly applicable to certification of services and processes  This scheme is mainly applicable to certification of services and processes. Although services are  considered as being generally intangible, the determination activities are not limited to the evaluation  of intangible elements (e.g. effectiveness of an organization’s procedures, delays and responsiveness  of the management). In some situations, the tangible elements of a service can support the evidence  of conformity indicated by the assessment of processes, resources and controls involved. For example,  inspection of the cleanliness of vehicles for the quality of public transportation. As far as processes  are concerned, the situation is very similar. For example, the determination activities for welding  processes can include testing and inspection of samples of the resultant welds, if applicable. For both  services and processes, the surveillance part of this scheme should include periodic audits of the  management system and periodic assessment of the service or process.  F.4 Scheme owner responsibilities  1. The scheme owner should be a legal entity.  NOTE: A governmental scheme owner is deemed to be a legal entity on the basis of its  governmental status.  2. The scheme owner should be able to take on full responsibility for the objectives, the content  and the integrity of the scheme.  3. The scheme owner should maintain the scheme and provide guidance when required.  4. The scheme owner should set up a structure for the operation and management of the  scheme.  5. The scheme owner should document the content of the scheme.  6. The scheme owner should ensure that the scheme is developed by persons competent in both  technical and conformity assessment aspects.  7. The scheme owner should make arrangements to protect the confidentiality of information  provided by the parties involved in the scheme.  8. The scheme owner should evaluate and manage the risks/liabilities arising from its activities.  NOTE: evaluating risks does not imply risk assessments in accordance with ISO 31000.  9. The scheme owner should have adequate arrangements (e.g. insurance or reserves) to cover  liabilities arising from its activities. Arrangements should be appropriate e.g. for the range of  activities and schemes undertaken and in the geographic regions in which the scheme  operates.  10. The scheme owner should have the financial stability and resources required for it to fulfil its  role in the operation of the scheme.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  78  Annex G:  Conformity assessment and testing  Certification, conformity assessment and testing are commonly used interchangeably. To understand  what certification is, and how it relates to terms such as conformity assessment and testing, this  chapter explains their relation. For a more in depth view, ISO provides a comprehensive overview  online: http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf.  ISO/IEC 17000 defines conformity assessment as a demonstration that specified requirements relating  to a product, process, system, person, or body are fulfilled. A few points to note:   In line with the terminology of ISO 9000, a service is regarded as a particular form of product   The methods for demonstrating conformity include testing, inspection, suppliers’ declarations  of conformity and certification   Specified  requirements  include those  contained  in  suppliers’  or  purchasers’ specifications,  national, regional or international standards or governmental regulations   Accreditation of conformity assessment bodies is included within the definition of conformity  assessment   The term object of conformity assessment, or sometimes just object, is used in the standard  to refer to “product, process, system, person or body”.  Figure 18 - Conformity assessment quality infrastructure  Conformity assessment is often characterized as part of a quality infrastructure. In addition to testing,  inspection and certification, there are other activities which may fall under the umbrella of conformity  assessment and there has been considerable international debate on whether activities such as  accreditation, production of reference materials and conduct of proficiency testing are conformity  assessment activities. Even within the realm of testing, there has been varying opinion on whether  some forms of diagnostic testing, such as pathology services, fit the formal definition of conformity  assessment. In practical terms, however, all of these various activities are part of the everyday world  http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  79  of conformity assessment and are important elements in broader national or regional quality  infrastructures. Some key components in the definition also have related activities, and subsets. For  example, “certification” includes management systems, product and personnel certification. The  concept of “testing” includes the related activities of calibration and measurement.52  Too often “conformity assessment” is taken to mean certification and nothing else. In fact, conformity  assessment can be undertaken by many people, including the supplier of a product or service, its  purchaser and other parties which might have an interest such as insurance companies and regulatory  authorities. It is convenient when talking about conformity assessment to refer to the parties as  follows:   First party (1st party) – the person or organization that provides the object which is being  assessed   Second party (2nd party) – a person or organization that has a user interest in the object   Third party (3rd party) – a person or body that is independent of the person or organization  that provides the object, and of user interests in the object.  In general, the conformity assessment techniques described in this chapter can be carried out by a  1st, 2nd or 3rd party. But a 1st party conformity assessment is perceived as less trustworthy then a 3rd  party assessment. Therefore, in relation to the risk that nonconformity poses, a choice is made to what  parties are allowed to perform the assessment. The SG-IS framework (described in chapter 4.2.1) can  help to decide the risk for a specific scenario and associated assurance level.  G.1.1 Conformity assessment activities  The following items are the most common conformity assessment activities.  Inspection is the examination of a product design, product, process or installation and the  determination of its conformity with specific requirements or, on the basis of professional judgment,  with general requirements. Inspection is often conducted on consignments, for example import  inspection, to ensure that the whole consignment is equivalent to the product sample tested.  Typical inspection institutions are import inspection agencies and general inspection agencies. These  can be public or private agencies and normally compete in the market place.  Testing is the determination of a product’s characteristics against the requirements of the standard.  Testing can vary from a non-destructive evaluation (e.g. X-ray, ultra sound, pressure testing, electrical,  etc., after which the product is still fit for use) to a to-tally destructive analysis (e.g. chemical,  mechanical, physical, microbiological, etc., or any combination of these), after which the product is no  longer fit for use.  Typical testing institutions are test laboratories, pathology laboratories and environmental  laboratories. These can be public or private laboratories and normally compete in the marketplace.  Certification by a certification body formally establishes, after evaluation,  testing, inspection or  assessment, that a product, service, organization or individual meets the requirements of a standard.  Typical certification institutions are product certification organizations and system certification  organizations. These can be public or private organizations. Competition in the market place is the  norm.  52 http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  80  Accreditation provides independent attestation of the competence of an individual or an organization  to offer specified conformity assessment services (e.g. testing, inspection or certification).The typical  accreditation institution is the national accreditation organization. This is usually a public body with a  defined monopoly. There are a few conflicts of interests that have to be considered when establishing  a quality infrastructure:   The accreditation function cannot be carried out by an organization that also provides  conformity assessment, i.e. inspection, testing and certification   The national standards body may also become the national accreditation body, but then it  may not pro-vide any conformity assessment services   Although fundamental metrology and accreditation is not per se a conflict of interest (as  defined by the BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), ILAC and the IAF) it is  considered close to being one, and hence UNIDO encourages developing countries to avoid  this combination. In particular, a body which accredits calibration laboratories cannot itself  provide calibration services.  G.1.2 Conformity, interoperability and functional testing  There are different types of aspects that can be focussed on while testing. The most common are:   Conformity testing: testing to assess the compliance of the test subject to standardised  requirements.   Functional testing: testing to assess the ability of the test subject to provide the advertised  functionality that is required by the assessment. Functional testing can be part of conformity  testing.   Interoperability testing: testing to assess the ability of two or more systems to exchange  information and to make mutual use of the information that has been exchanged. 53  Interoperability testing can be part of conformity testing.  In respect to smart grid cyber security, all three aspects play a role. Conformity testing needs to be  performed to ensure that smart grids comply with requirements set by the EU and Member States.  Functional security testing needs to be performed to support the implementation of cyber security in  the grid, as conformity testing normally does not focus on the validation of security functions that the  device can support. For example, the conformity security requirement is for a device to have access  control, but the functional security requirements can be that access control should work in a specific  manner. Regarding interoperability testing, it is an important aspect of conformity assessments of  communication standards.  For example, an encryption mechanism needs to be interoperable between smart grid devices to be  useful. If interoperability testing is skipped for an encrypted communication channel, the system can  be conforming to all security requirements, and have been functionally tested, but can still not be able  to use the encrypted channel because the devices are not interoperable.  Penetration testing  A more specific form of testing that is common in security tests is penetration testing. This type of  testing revolves around the exploitation of possible design flaws and weaknesses to compromise the  security of a device. Such tests do not focus on a specific test book, but rely more on the creativity of  the tester, and the time there is available to perform a penetration test. Penetration testing can be  53  ITU-T Z.450 - Quality aspects of protocol-related Recommendations - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-  T/publications/Pages/structure.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  81  incorporated as part of a functional test, by describing it as a negative test case for a functional  requirement. For example, the validation by the following functional requirement can be tested by a  penetration test; ‘the device under test shall not provide means to circumvent the access control  mechanism’. Such a requirement can be validated by a negative test scenario, where the device will  be subjected to a penetration test in an attempt to circumvent the access control mechanism.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  82  Annex H:  SOG-IS  The SOG-IS agreement was introduced in response to the EU Council Decision of March 31st 1992  (92/242/EEC) in the field of security of information systems, and the subsequent Council  recommendation of April 7th (1995/144/EC) on common information technology security evaluation  criteria.  The agreement was updated in January 2010 and the full text can be downloaded in the section  \"Agreement\" of the Web site. Participants in this Agreement are government organisations or  government agencies from Member States of the European Union or EFTA (European Free Trade  Association) countries, representing their Member State or country. As of June 2011, the national  bodies participating in the agreement are:  Austria, Bundeskanzleramt  Finland, FICORA - Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority  France, ANSSI - Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information  Germany, BSI - Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik  Italy, OCSI - Organismo di Certificazione della Sicurezza Informatica  The Netherlands , NLNCSA - Netherlands National Communications Security  Agency, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations  Norway, SERTIT - Norwegian National Security Authority operates the Norwegian  Certification Authority for IT Security  Spain, CCN - Centro Criptológico Nacional, Organismo de Certificación de la  Seguridad de las Tecnologías de la Información  Sweden, FMV - Försvarets Materielverk  United Kingdom, CESG - Communications-Electronics Security Group  Table 3: participating countries  The participants work together to:   Coordinate the standardisation of Common Criteria protection profiles and certification  policies between European Certification Bodies in order to have a common position in the fast  growing international CCRA group   Coordinate the development of protection profiles whenever the European commission  launches a directive that should be implemented in national laws as far as IT-security is  involved  The agreement provides for member nations to participate in two fundamental ways:  1. As certificate consuming participants and  http://www.sogisportal.eu/uk/mra_en.html  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  83  2. As certificate producers  For certificate producing nations there are also two levels of recognition within the agreement:  1. Certificate recognition up to EAL4  2. Certificate recognition at higher levels for defined technical areas when schemes have been  approved by the management committee for this level.  Certification is based on an evaluation conducted by an evaluation lab that:   either has been accredited in its country of origin according to ISO 17025,   or has been established under the laws, statutory instruments, or other official administrative  procedures valid in the concerned country, and licenced by the certification body for Common  Criteria and specific technologies like those covered by the technical domain SOG-IS MRA.  This process helps to assess whether the evaluation lab has the necessary skills to perform  appropriate vulnerability analysis.  Proofs of competency between SOG-IS MRA members are called shadowing and voluntary periodic  assessments (VPA) per technical domain. After an initial shadowing, VPAs take place on a regular  basis for no longer than five years, and they are performed by two or more SOG-IS MRA members.  Formally, the prerequisites for certification bodies to join the SOG-IS MRA are equivalent to the  requirements laid down in 765/2008/EC. The VPA reliably demonstrates that a certification body  permanently is able to retain its competency in processes, procedures and technologies, and  therefore that its certificates remain up-to-date with the evolving cyber threat landscape.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  84  Annex I:  Additional identified challenges  Usage of immature standards  As the standard analysis showed (please see chapter 4.4.5), not all standards have been published,  and it is not possible to base a certification framework on an unpublished standard. Also, any newly  published standard suffers from mistakes that can cause confusion and unclarity regarding  implementation and compliancy. We could imagine a mechanism like the “demonstrable  conformance” in Common Criteria, which enables the national CBs to adapt a new protection profile  whenever it included some mistakes.  In state legislation  It will be a challenge to instate legislation, as it requires the endorsement of multiple stakeholders.  This could be solved by discussing with national bodies, if they could accept to bypass some  verifications on their EAL4+ smart metering gateway, in case the gateway was certified by another CB  on some specific security functions.  Balance of cost/effort and threat  It will be a challenge to balance the cost of certification against the threat, as they are not directly  linked, and therefore a device that needs to be cheap, can also require the most stringent security  requirements (such as is the case with the smart meter). Cost/benefit is especially bad for low threat  certifications (because there is an incompressible set of assurance activities). As smart grid face very  sophisticated threats, the balance may be relatively good, but this requires a thorough analysis in the  future.  Avoid compliancy cultures  It will be a challenge to prevent the scenario that only obtaining the paper certificate counts  (compliancy) and no effort is put in actually securing the system. The scheme will have to safeguard  against this by the enforcement of certain controls that reward a security based approach above a  compliancy based one.  Acceptance of a specific scheme  Any particular scheme could be met with resistance from a particular European Member State, if it  already has a similar scheme in place, and is unwilling to discard the already developed and active  scheme. However, well-though certification schemes such as Common Criteria imply that vulnerability  testing will be performed by independent labs.  Acceptance by stakeholders  A scheme will need to be accepted by the Member States, and international agreements need to be  made to accept certificates from other countries, if such systems are not in place yet.  I.1 Challenges identified in ENISA stakeholder discussions  Based on previous stakeholder discussions, the following additional challenges were identified   Need for a specific risk assessment methodology   Necessary to train and raise awareness among operators, manufacturers and consumers   Security efforts should not only focus on smart meters but also on substation automation,  micro grids, SCADA, telecommunication networks, etc.   Security initiatives: duplicity of topics, lack of visibility, same experts in all initiatives.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  85   Security addressed more as an overlay than as part of the design phase   Need for a coordinating entity on ICS-SCADA and smart grid cyber security and privacy  initiatives  I.2 Common pitfalls  Below are common pitfalls as listed by NIST54 that apply to certification schemes, and are relevant for  a smart grid security scheme:  1. Use of Certification as a Substitute for Improving Quality of the Product and the Manufacturing  Process  As Deming55 has pointed out, quality must be designed into the product and assured through an  effective and efficient manufacturing process. Certification and other types of conformity assessment  processes can provide information on whether the desired end result has been achieved. Since  certification usually this occurs late in the manufacturing process, it does not improve the quality of  the products.  2. Use of Inappropriate Product Standards  Standards, which cover all essential characteristics of the product necessary to ensure a given level of  quality or safety, may not be available or may not be selected for use in a certification program. The  introduction of new technology and new products may also be inhibited if there is no provision for  handling products which fall outside the scope of the standard. Standards may also contain  specifications that are unnecessary and not based on well documented research or information.  3. Lack of Adequate Test Methods  Test methods may not adequately measure all essential product characteristics included in the  certification program in a cost-effective manner. In addition, sampling requirements may not be  sufficient to ensure that the certified products adequately represent the entire production line.  4. Lack of Technical and Financial Competency on the Part of the Certifier  The certifier may lack the necessary technical competence and resources to properly use and maintain  the test equipment and to conduct the certification process. The organization may not have developed  adequate written documentation on the certification requirements and procedures or may not have  kept adequate records on the results. In addition, the certifier might also have biases which  compromise the integrity of the results.  5. Public Misperception Regarding Legal Responsibility for a Certified Product  Legal responsibility for the quality and/or safety of the product generally rests with the manufacturer,  despite frequent public misperception that the third party certifier is responsible.  6. Lack of an Adequate Appeals System  Disagreements may occasionally arise among parties participating in a certification program. Some  programs do not have an adequate and impartial appeals mechanism to handle disagreements that  cannot otherwise be resolved.  54 Source: http://gsi.nist.gov/global/index.cfm/L1-5/L2-45/A-204  55 Deming circle; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA  http://gsi.nist.gov/global/index.cfm/L1-5/L2-45/A-204  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  86  7. Lack of Knowledge on the Part of Users of the Certification Scheme  Buyers who rely on a certification and who are not adequately informed as to the purpose, scope, and  technical limitations of the resulting certification may be misled as to the meaning and degree of  confidence that can be placed in the certification mark or certificate of conformity.  8. Lack of Adequate Surveillance and Enforcement  Without an adequate process to ensure that any misuse of the certification mark or certificate of  conformity is dealt with efficiently and effectively, the mark's integrity may be compromised.  Certification programs should take steps to ensure that certified products that are subsequently found  not to conform are either recalled from the marketplace or have their marks or certificates of  conformity removed.  9. Incompatibilities among National Certification Schemes  As noted above, national certification schemes for the same product or group of products can differ  significantly in the standards used and product characteristics that are assessed, the sampling process  and the test methods used, and other program aspects. Such differences have the potential to create  barriers to trade.

For this reason, vendors should  ensure that these two features follow smart grid devices for their whole life cycle; from the design to  the decommission phase. Certification is not only a means to provide assurance to the smart gird users  that security and privacy have been taken into account but also to create trust to the entire smart grid  supply chain.  This report provides insight on security certification of smart grids. It contains information about  several certification approaches; it describes the specific European situation, discusses the advantages  and challenges and provides recommendations to involved stakeholders towards a more harmonised  European smart grid security certification practices framework.  The report describes the need for harmonised European smart grid certification practices which cover  the complete smart grid supply chain, and are supported by a European platform based on M/490  SGAM1 (Smart Grid Architecture Model) and the concept of smart grid chain of trust. Part of this report  is the analysis of the available security certification schemes for smart grids and the approaches used  in Europe. This way we have generated an overview that depicts which certification schemes can be  used to create this chain of trust. During this analysis it came up that there is not a single, existing,  scheme that can cover the entire chain of trust, and that not all parts of the chain can be completely  covered for every smart grid use-case. Additionally, it appeared that there are multiple initiatives in  different Member States that take different approaches to achieve the same goal. For this reason, we  use the common denominator of the features of the different existing certification standards in order  to introduce a certification meta-scheme for the smart grids in Europe.  The major gaps and challenges of a European smart grid certification scheme revolve around the  fragmentation and different approaches in Member States, as well as the lack of EU guidance by a  trusted oversight body. At this moment it will be difficult to create a security certification scheme that  1 SGAM is an abbreviation for the Smart Grid Architecture Model proposed by M/490 standardisation initiative,  and is widely accepted as the common reference model architecture for smart grids not only at European but  also at international level.

This approach  allows for the national specific approaches and requirements, while providing possibilities to adopt  European based requirements to facilitate harmonisation, and benefit from joined standardisation  efforts.  Taking into account the needs, as expressed in various referenced resources, we also outline the  properties of the ‘ideal’ smart gird cyber security apparatus. To achieve this ‘ideal’ situation a set of  recommendations is addressed to the main stakeholders; the Commission, the certification bodies,  the Member States and the private sector. The most outstanding recommendations are:  Harmonised EU smart grid security certification practices  More harmonised and coordinated EU smart grid certification practices will act as an umbrella and  should contain elementary properties that national schemes need to have. European accreditation  bodies will be used for confirmation of national schemes. This will ensure that there is not a single  certifying authority, and the process remains impartial. Next to this, private sector will help in keeping  up with the latest technology specific requirements and guidance consolidated by technical  committees. The committees should amend the slow moving standards with detailed protection  profiles or security requirements. Updates in national schemes should be announced so that they can  be incorporated in national profiles. This way the maturity of the national schemes can evolve over  time.  The Commission together with the Member States should promote certification by allowing for  commercial advantages for the private sector when following practices which lead to more  harmonisation across Europe (e.g. criteria for E.U procurement activities). The certification practices  should provide European guidance, facilitate national legislation and be actively promoted as a means  for more harmonization.  National implementation of specific smart grid use cases based on a chain of trust  Each Member State should be able to map its preferred national standard/scheme to the EU platform  and refer to this national standard for details. They should also be able to amend or expand on the  European security requirements to provide the flexibility to incorporate national specific  requirements. The national profiles should be created by national groups, but could be based on the  published schemes of other Member States. The national profiles can contain the national specific  technical requirements regarding the needed security features related to the applicable use cases  used in that Member State. Additionally they should contain test procedures for the national specific  requirements, and define the required testing levels for the national use cases aligned with the  international SG-IS2  framework risk levels.  Oversight  It is recommended to create a EU steering committee with oversight competences on smart grid  certification, the definition of pan European security requirements’ and the development of national  schemes. It should be responsible for centralised storage and the publication of smart grid certificates  and adopted schemes, to facilitate clarity on what is certified and how. It should provide  implementation guidance and recommendations based on the most recent best practices and  informative standards.  The EU steering committee will have only a coordination role and act as an advisor to the certification  bodies, making sure the latest threats are reflected in the security requirements definition process.  2 This framework is described at the M/490 SGCG Smart Grid Information Security deliverable.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  vi  To this end, this committee will take feedback from the private sector, and lessons learned during the  certification processes of other nationalities.  The steering committee should create and maintain a landing page with specific explanations for all  stakeholders about smart grid security certification concepts, their place in the chain of trust and how  to implement a smart grid certification chain of trust on a specific smart grid use case.

Where in the ‘old’ grids  automation was owned by the grid operator itself and took place on a dedicated network, in a smart  grid environment multi entities are connected together. Those entities own cables, solar panels, wind  turbines, biomass plants and so on, and they all need IT connections to exchange data with each other  to ensure the right decisions are made from an individual economic and technical perspective. While  the equipment has evolved to facilitate the data exchange with more intelligent and automated or  remote controlled devices, the practices regarding manufacturing and maintenance of devices are still  similar to the ones that were on a dedicated network. This created a gap, where the level of security  did not grow together with the increased automation and interconnections of the grid.  For this reason, cyber security certification of the smart grid has gained popularity as a means to  further enhance the security that these complex systems already offer to their users. The need to  foster the development of security certification schemes for product and organisational security was  one of the key findings of ENISA’s 2012 report on “Smart grid security: Recommendations for Europe  and Member States”. In this document, ENISA recommends:  Certification in smart grid cyber security therefore also delivers a competitive advantage for both  suppliers and service providers.  1.2 Policy context  The recently published Cyber Security Strategy of the European Union3 clearly identifies the shared  responsibility of all stakeholders and the need for all actors to protect themselves in the context of  growing dependency on information and communications technologies. The need to develop  industrial and technical resources for cyber security is mentioned among the strategic priorities and  actions, and in this context:  3 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace, JOIN(2013) 1 final,  avaialable at: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=1667  “By raising the level of security and mitigating risk, accreditation and certification  schemes would increase end consumers’ confidence in smart grid services and  systems and accelerate their acceptance. Moreover, certified service providers  can be easily compared allowing for marketing strategies….’’  ‘’A prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk  management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly  establish voluntary EU-wide certification schemes building on existing schemes  in the EU and internationally. The Commission will promote the adoption of  coherent approaches among the Member States to avoid disparities causing  locational disadvantages for businesses.’’  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  2  The abovementioned excerpt from the EU Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with the findings of the  workshop organised by ENISA in 2012 where the experts clearly expressed the need for more  harmonised smart grid certification practices as a means to lower the costs of certification and break  down the trade barriers.  1.3 Scope  The objective of this document is to provide technical advice, recommendations and good practices  for security certification for smart grids. Strategy, architecture guidelines and framework alternatives  are presented as recommendations which set the basis for the smart grid certification requirements.  This document does not solve all the political and legal issues related to implementing such smart grid  security certification obligations. Good practices of existing certification schemes and regulations in  the smart grid environment are presented as potential guidelines. The problem definition and the  need for certification point out in chapter 2, form the basis for this document.  Data protection is of the utmost importance for the smart grid4. Security certification is considered as  one of the measures which contributes to a safer and, as a result, a more secure processing  environment of personal data in the smart grid. Many security requirements described in existing  security certification standards are considered to be relevant to the existing data protection  framework. However, there are many data protection requirements (i.e. consent of the data subject,  the purpose definition, proportionality of collected data etc.) and tools (i.e. privacy by design, data  protection impact assessment (DPIA), best available techniques (BATs), privacy seals, notifications of  the processing to and audits by the national Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) and data breach  notifications) which are less or not relevant to existing security certification standards.  1.4 Target audience  The target audience of this document is the European Commission and Member States (MSs)  interested in open issues regarding security certification in smart grid environments. This document  aims to:   Create a common basis on which smart grid security certification can be structured   Inform the related industry community (IT security engineers, ICS engineers and operators,  national Information Security offices/agencies)   Provide an interface between policy makers and technology specialists regarding smart grid  security certification.  The stakeholders related to the findings and recommendations in this document are:   Certification and accreditation organizations   Regulators and policy makers   Smart grid operators   Standardisation Bodies (e.g. ETSI, NIST, IEC, ISO, etc.)   Security solutions providers   Smart grid manufacturers   Academia, R&D   Public bodies in the Member States involved in smart grid cyber security.  4 Commission Recommendation on preparations for the roll-out of smart metering systems (2012/148/EU),  available at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012H0148&from=EN  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  3  1.5 Structure of this document  The document consists out of six main sections explaining in subsequent order:  1. Introduction  2. The need for smart grid certification  3. Standards and certification schemes  4. A chain of trust for the smart grid  5. Gaps and challenges  6. Recommendations  Please see “Annex A: Definitions” for a short list of definitions used throughout this document.  1.6 Method  The team has intiatilly performed a desktop reseach with the objective to identify both the need for  more converged smart grid certification approaches in Europe and the properties of an ‘ideal’  certification scheme. Then, they took stock of the existing security certification approaches in order  to identify, analyse and then compare security standards, good practices and schemes that could be  used in order to define the properties of a smart grid certification meta scheme. They analysed  the  results of the research and the outcome of the analysis delivered:   Identification of gaps between the existing schemes and the ‘ideal’ one.   Identification of gaps between different certification standards.   Challenges involved in further harmonising the existing smart grid security approaches in  Europe.   Recommendations on how to improve the existing European smart grid certification  apparatus.  Both the result of the research and the draft report were validated by the Smart Infrastructures  Security Experts Community (SISEC)5 and a number of selected ICT and smart grid certification experts.  Based on the comments received by the experts a second draft was prepared then and this new  document presented in a thematic workshop organised by ENISA 6. For the workshop, ENISA has  invited experts from different stakeholder categories to assess the quality of the findings and debate  the proposed good practices and recommendations. The final report is the outcome of the second  round of consultation with the experts.  5 ENISA’s Smart Infrastructures (cyber) Security Experts Community (SISEC) includes cyber security experts from  national cyber security authorities, energy and ICT industries, and possibly also selected non-EU partners. SISEC  has the mission to support the overall goal to achieve a higher maturity in cyber security for the critical  infrastructure of the European Union in order to increase the robustness and availability of critical infrastructure  against cyber security threats.  6 http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2014/certification-of-cyber-security- skills-of-ics-scada-experts-and-smart-grid-components  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  4  2 The need for smart grid certification  This chapter describes what specific key drivers have been identified to support the need  for a more  organised and harmonised European framework for smart grid certification practices, and why such a  framework helps to create a chain of trust to the product (energy) delivered by the smart grid. The  general need for certification in the area of smart grids has been addressed in previous ENISA  documents, such as the report on Protecting Industrial Control Systems - Recommendations for  Europe and Member States, 2011 and the minutes from the joint ENISA/EC workshop on the  certification of smart grid components (2012)7. This report can be considered as a follow up to the  findings and recommendations illustrated in these documents.  2.1 State of play  The following list of items summarises the current situation around smart grid component security  certification as reflected during the ENISA workshop:   Price: Current certification schemes are considered rather expensive. Several reasons have  been reported for this; fragmented national policies, lack of resources, the need for  repeatability and consistency of the results and the large number of components involved in  the smart grid supply chain.   Lack of a uniform approach: Stakeholders are facing a fragmented situation where different  initiatives regarding the cyber security of smart grids are been developed.   Long life cycle: The certification process takes some time which usually is more than the time  needed for new vulnerabilities to appear in the cyberspace.   Legal framework: There are only a few legal texts concerning security in smart grids and this  is leaving enough space for grey zones and/or interpretations.   Common Criteria:  o is the predominant certification scheme in the market.  o it will be unrealistic to have a Common Criteria certificate for the whole smart grid  supply chain.  o to be applied in the smart grid environment, it should be extended to include specific  protection profiles for the smart grid, similar to those related to the smart card  industry, where a joint interpretation library was developed.   Environment of certification: One additional topic mentioned by some experts is that  certification of products is done in laboratories which are independent of the operational  environment. A product can be certified but that does not necessarily mean that when it is  implemented in the system, it is configured correctly, that it functions properly, and that it  does not affect the performance of the entire network.   Training: There is no national or European wide specialised training course on Industrial  Control Systems and smart grid security to educate experts on security certification matters.  2.2 Market drivers  The drivers behind certification vary widely. Security certification has historically originated from  governmental agencies to ensure a level of trust in their equipment and supply chain (e.g. FIPS140-2,  ISO 15408). However, industry partners have also taken it upon themselves to create certain  certification schemes, such as the vendor focussed UCAIug which created the IEC 61850 certification  7  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  5  standard that can be also applied to the smart grid industry. Here, it was recognised by several vendors  that it would be mutually beneficial to create a common and impartial understanding of how devices  operating in an electrical substation should interact.  In some cases, insurance companies and banks can also drive certification as a means to secure  investments made, and minimise the risk of monetary or other types (e.g. reputational) of loss due to  the use of substandard quality or security by their customers.  Recognition by key stakeholders is the most important aspect for a successful certification scheme.  Without the recognition and endorsement of key stakeholders, a certification scheme holds little  value, and any cost incurred by the certification process becomes difficult to justify.  Therefore, some schemes such as Common Criteria adopt a chain of trust, and facilitate an  infrastructure where Member States are able to officially recognise each other’s certificates. A  different solution is to have an international users group issuing the certificate, however this can be  difficult for smart grid security, as the government is a significant stakeholder and therefore it will  probably need a more formalised accreditation process to accept any type of certificate.  2.2.1 How certification works (success stories)  There are numerous success stories where a properly implemented scheme has developed into a  successful and mature standard that is recognised by the relevant stakeholders. A good example of  this is the Common Criteria framework in the smart-card industry, where it is widely accepted.  Another success story is the implementation of NERC-CIP in US, as it helped evolve cyber security in  US, and ensures that all critical infrastructures have taken a minimal set of precautions to protect their  assets.  2.2.2 And how it does not work (failure stories)  Unfortunately the successful schemes have sometimes also caused a compliance culture, where asset  owners first try to ensure that a minimum set of critical assets is defined, to keep cost low. The  mandatory audit trails are seen as the cumbersome creation of paperwork, without much attention  for the processes that should have generated it in the first place.  Another pitfall is illustrated by a security standard in the Netherlands, where the security  requirements were made too general, and the insurance premiums  appear to be cheaper than actual  compliance to the standard.  Some SCADA standards encountered criticism because the promised interoperability seemed not to  be provided by the certification scheme. This issue had more to do with how the scheme was  advertised than a flaw in the scheme itself. But it should be clear that the critique the standard  encountered did not improve the endorsement by the stakeholders.  Some schemes allow a vendor to write its own requirements to seek certification against, and this can  provide a biased image. For example, several companies have certified their products against the  scheme, but the usability of the certified configuration is said to be very limited.  Additionally depending on the scheme and requirements, certification can be a rather lengthy and  costly process, (a process costing several hundreds of thousands euros and taking a year is not  uncommon) and can therefore cause small players to be forced out of the market. That being said,  some schemes do allow a lower security level, which is also much faster and cheaper to certify. But  this will mean that the level of certified security will also be severely affected. Another reason for  increased cost of certification is that there is no consensus on the certification method between  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  6  Member States. Without consensus on the method used, certification efforts have to be repeated  multiple times with different methods for different Member States.  2.3  Stakeholder needs  The European Union, as well as previous studies done by ENISA and ESMIG (European Smart Metering  Industry Group) backed up by stakeholders; provide statements regarding the recognition of a need  for a pan European smart grid certification. Below is a summary of the various statements:  1. Solve trust issues between EU stakeholders regarding the smart grid  2. Create a common reference model for smart grid security in EU  3. Establish the basis for a minimum set of auditable controls for smart grids across Europe  4. Define an agreed method for the level of security for different criticality aspects of the grid  5. Establish a harmonised approach in the EU for smart grid component, system, and operational  security to increase trust  6. Provide EU guidance for a harmonized approach that facilitates national legislation  7. Promote public and private interaction within the EU on smart grid security  8. Improve the maturity level of security in the EU smart grid  9. Establish shared responsibility in risk mitigation amongst EU stakeholders  10. Lower costs of smart grid certification in the EU  11. Address the life cycle of a European smart grid  Below follows a description of each statement with a reference to the source the statement is based  upon.  Solve trust issues between EU stakeholders regarding the smart grid8  This relates to the different national regulations and the fragmented nature of the smart grid which  makes responsibility and accountability unclear. Additionally, because of the multidisciplinary nature  of smart grid systems, the supply chain of the used components and systems is quite wide, not  transparent and complex. This can cause trust issues within the EU stakeholders because they cannot  oversee all related risks anymore.  Create a common reference model for smart grid security in EU  The European market is becoming more mature. Member states are considering to specify their own  security requirements and develop their own certification schemes to qualify their products. This  could create fragmentation of the market if these activities are not developed in a coordinated  manner. The development of these schemes is mainly originating from certification authorities.  However, there is neither a protection profile covering the whole smart grid chain nor a certification  scheme at a European level yet. The development of one reference model to harmonise the European  market is therefore needed.7  ESMIG expressed the intention to reach a multi-stakeholder, European wide approach to identify  (technological and economic) security and privacy risks emerging with the deployment and operations  of a smart metering system. This was done in order to draw appropriate requirements and  countermeasures for smart meter/grid use cases from asset owners.  8 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid- threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/risk-management/evolving-threat-environment/sgtl/smart-grid-threat-landscape-and-good-practice-guide  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  7  Establish the basis for a minimum set of auditable controls for smart grids across Europe  There is a need for a European set of requirements that can be used for reinforcing the cyber security  of the smart grid.9, 10 This is important to create a level of security that has a common baseline across  Europe, and facilitates as a common interface for the interaction regarding cyber security between  Member States.  Define an agreed method for the level of security for different criticality aspects of the grid  Some stakeholders have identified that the smart grid, as a whole, contains a wide range of  components. Having all these components certified is perhaps not feasible, and it is not a good  indication of the security of the whole smart grid. There is a need to assess the criticality of the various  smart grid parts and apply various security assurance techniques based on that criticality. For example,  a smart grid component that is in a more exposed environment could in some cases have a larger  impact on the security of the grid. It would therefore, in that case, be beneficial to focus more on  these critical components that could have a large impact, then to spend the same amount of time and  money on components that have a much lower impact on the security of the grid.  Probably the components of the critical infrastructure cannot be certified using the same method as  traditional IT systems. Also a certified component does not imply a secure component, since all the  risks cannot be taken into consideration. The challenge in the smart grid context is facing  vulnerabilities and threats which are growing faster and faster due to the complexity of the system  and the large number of interdependencies amongst its components. Certification is one method that  can mitigate risks for the smart grid environment.11 Care should be taken with such a certification  approach that flexibility is maintained, and to allow for a risk level based on system criticality since  the level of criticality of a system can differ per stakeholder and per Member State.  Establish a harmonised approach in the EU for smart grid component, system, and operational  security to increase trust  During previous interviews and surveys with stakeholders, it emerged that a significant portion of  stakeholders expressed their doubts about the trustworthiness of the smart grid. This is backed up by  previous ENISA reports, where in one of the key findings of the ENISA's 2012 report on “Smart grid  security: Recommendations for Europe and Member States”, ENISA recommends that:  “Recommendation 6: Promote the development of security certification schemes for products and  organisational security: By raising the level of security and mitigating risks, accreditation and  certification schemes would increase end-consumers’ confidence in smart grid services and systems  and accelerate their acceptance. Moreover, certified service providers can be easily compared allowing  for marketing strategies....\"12  “Regarding the scope of the certification, some stakeholders noted that the certification of  components is important.

However, mandatory standards that contain controls for the overall  organization are not defined yet. A certification scheme for the whole grid, not only for the  components, is needed. The security of the smart grids should be developed taking into consideration  the balance between the risk and the services provided by the energy industry.”13  ESMIG also suggests that a scheme that supports IT systems and components in the smart metering  domain is desirable; “This contributes to ensure interoperability and a commonly implemented  certification scheme for Products and Systems in smart metering as initial Smart Grid deployments”  Provide EU guidance for a harmonized approach that facilitates national legislation  A harmonized smart grid approach is needed that includes economies of different scales and sizes,  can support any potential market model, and facilitates legislation on EU-Level.  Promote public and private interaction within the EU on smart grid security  It is seen as important to ensure that any adopted scheme will promote interaction between public  and private parties in the EU, to ensure wide support for a scheme, and to facilitate a scheme that is  not a burden on the parties involved.14  Improve the maturity level of security in the EU smart grid  The approach to security in the EU varies between Member States. The European market starts to  become more mature. Member States are considering to develop their own certification schemes to  qualify their systems. This could create fragmentation of the market if these activities do not develop  in a coordinated manner.  Last year, ENISA organized a workshop on the certification of smart grid components. During this  event, the experts had the opportunity to discuss the challenges of the existing security certification  approaches that apply to the smart grids. One of the key findings of this workshop was that there is  recognition for a need for improvement regarding the existing certification schemes in the EU.15  Establish shared responsibility in risk mitigation amongst EU stakeholders  The recently published Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union clearly identifies the shared  responsibility of all stakeholders, and the need for all actors, to protect themselves in the context of  growing dependency on information and communications technologies. The need to develop  industrial and technical resources for cybersecurity is mentioned among the strategic priorities and  actions, and in this context: \"A prime focus should be to create incentives to carry out appropriate risk  management and adopt security standards and solutions, as well as possibly establish voluntary EU- wide certification schemes building on existing schemes in the EU and internationally. The Commission  will promote the adoption of coherent approaches among the Member States to avoid disparities  causing locational disadvantages for businesses.\"16  13  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  14Recommendation 2: Foster the creation of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) entity to coordinate smart grid  cyber security initiatives - http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure- and-services/smart-grids-and-smart-metering/ENISA-smart-grid-security- recommendations/at_download/fullReport  15  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  16  European Commission, 2013.

Having a  different certification approach and different requirements per country will be more costly in respect  to compliance as opposed to a European approach. As a product or system would have to undergo  recertification for each individual Member State. Therefore there is a need for a harmonized approach  that can potentially lower the cost of certification by making them exchangeable between Member  States.  Address the life cycle of an European smart grid  Certification should focus on the whole life-cycle not only on the product itself: Starting from product  development process, implementation and deployment of the systems and the operational process.18  Additionally, a certification scheme will need to incorporate the different types of certification that  apply to the product lifecycle, as product development certification, product certification and  operation certification are not subject to the same type of certification.  2.4  Desired properties of an ‘ideal’ certification scheme  Based on the observed market drivers, success stories and the stakeholder needs as addressed in  relevant smart grid security certification documents, the team has identified a set of properties which  an ‘ideal’ smart grid certification framework will need to have. Following is the description of these  properties.19 The numbering matches the numbering of the needs described in section 2.3:  1. It provides a holistic approach to ensure trust in the supply chain of the smart grid. This way, it  will provide clarity on what responsibility lies where.  2. It uses a common EU smart grid security reference model like SG-AM that is widely accepted by  European Standardisation Organisations (ESOs) and Certification Bodies (CBs). There is confidence  amongst the stakeholders that M/490 is a promising initiative towards market harmonization and  interoperability.  3. It has a common baseline set of requirements described in profiles that are recognized by all  participating EU Member States, making acceptance in one Member State possibly also valid in  another. However, it must provide the Member States with the flexibility to define their own  security requirements on top of the commonly agreed European ones.  4. It uses internationally equivelant security and risk levels aligned with the levels defined in an  approach recognized by the EU members such as the M/490 SG-IS framework.  5. It includes support for components, systems and operation, so that there is one framework to  describe the security for a complete smart grid system.  6. It includes conformity testing, functional testing and interoperability testing. Depending on the  risk of nonconformity, it can be decided to perform first, second and third  party assessments.  However, in practice, only third party certification is seen as trustworthy for most cyber security  schemes.  17 1.

It facilitates public and private interaction, for example by including Technical Committee  subgroups, and having a framework coordinator as an interface between public and private bodies  8. It should not be EU mandated, but a framework providing EU guidance for implementation, and  supporting national legislation. Other discussions have suggested an EU mandated scheme, but it  will be difficult to create consensus about this.  9. It should improve the maturity of smart grid security in the EU, using initiatives that align with  smart grids such as M/490 and provide guidance for proper security measures.  10. It has a harmonized approach which eliminates the barriers and silos created by fragmented  markets. A harmonized approach is considered a major contributor to lowering the cost of  certification. The shared responsibility and the risk based approach help to contain the costs as  well.  11. It addresses patch management problems and it should include a maintenance scheme for a  product or system life cycle.  During stakeholder discussions20 about smart grid certification, there has been focus on the desired  properties of a future certification framework; the following are some of the additional desired  characteristics of this framework:  Operational in a reasonable time  It is important to promote a framework that can be implemented in the current environment, and  does not rely on future developments. This is because smart grid systems are being built already, and  to add security later on will be more costly and difficult. On top of this, the framework should be based  on existing standards and operational (e.g. SOGIS) platforms.  Take into account new and existing technologies  Certain smart grid functionalities have requirements that are not covered yet by the existing  technologies, the framework should cover new technologies as soon as they become available.  Additionally, security is a fast evolving field that needs constant updating to the latest types of threats.  Therefore a successful framework needs to be flexible enough to keep up to date with the latest  threads.  Self-certification tools  A good approach to decrease the certification process efforts in terms of cost and time is providing  vendors with self-certification tools which could be used by vendors in a pre-certified process or during  the  development phase and also give the possibility to vendors to select for a wide range of  laboratories where their products will be certified. These aspects could speed-up the process and  encourage vendors to follow certification schemes.  In line with the standardization efforts  Any certification initiative should be in line with the current EU standardization efforts, such as the  initiatives ESMIG is taking in respect to smart meter security. Although different implementations for  particular requirements could be useful for stimulating the competition, security relies also on  interoperability. Therefore a successful framework should promote alignment with existing  standardization efforts like M/490.  20  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification- components/workshop-minutes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/workshops-1/2012/smart-grid-certification-components/workshop-minutes  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  11  Room for special national requirements  A scheme should be EU based, but also leaves room for special national requirements. This is  necessary to accommodate the approach and legislation in different Member State, which influences  the technical decision making, and therefore also has impact on the level of risk and type of  requirements specified. A successful framework will have to accommodate national requirements,  and make it easy to adopt by Member States by taking into account the current national initiatives.  Not a single certifying authority  It is important not to have a single certifying authority, to ensure no monopoly is created on  certification, and multiple players are able to provide certification services.  Coordination  A single framework coordinator should keep oversight on issued certificates and the performance of  the certifying bodies to ensure quality is maintained, and not negatively affected by race-to-bottom  type scenario’s that can occur in a competitive market.  Transparency  The framework should offer centralised storage of smart grid security certificates to facilitate clarity  on what is certified and how. This way it is transparent for all stakeholders on what certificates are  issued and where and how the chain of trust is built in specific cases.  Motivating and beneficial for the implementer  A successful framework should motivate implementers complying with the applicable certification  schemes. Having an economic incentive can positively influence the adoption of a scheme. For  example, inclusion of a scheme as a knock-off criterion for smart grid equipment tenders can motivate  adoption.  Allow for legacy grid systems to exist side by side with smart grid systems, without compromising  security  A successful framework should make sure that it allows current grids to exist, as it will be impossible  to migrate all systems at once. Based on a risk analysis, it can be assessed per case if they can also be  part of a smart grid certification effort.  Partial certification  There have been discussions about the possibility for a partial certification to support legacy systems  and to facilitate the cases where it will be impossible to certify all components in a system. Although  this approach is understandable, it will create an inconsistent view of smart grid certification, and will  therefore undermine trust if not handled correctly.  Instead a framework should provide clarity on what the scope of a certificate is, and how it creates  the chain of trust, so it is evident what parts are covered or not, and why certification can still apply  for the use-case at hand.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  12  3 Standards and certification schemes  A desktop study has been performed to create an inventory of available information on cyber security  certification standards that are applicable to the smart grid domain. From a list of initiatives, good  practices, standards and schemes, only the items that were in line with the needs described in chapter  2 have been selected. The selection criteria included answering the following questions;  1. Is it a standard that is actually applicable to smart grid devices/systems (Meaning that standards  regarding general IT, or person certification are out of scope?21  2. Is it a standard that applies to cyber security (meaning that safety and physical security is out of  scope)?  3. Is it a standard that can support certification, audits and/or legislation (meaning that good  practices and informative standards were excluded, as they cannot form the basis for  certification)?  4. Is it a standard that is used in the EU (meaning that standards not used in EU were excluded, as  there is apparently no support from EU Member States)?  5. Is the standard supported by public and private bodies (meaning biased or vendor based schemes  were excluded)?  6. Is the standard superseded or incorporated by another applicable standard?  These criteria might be used in order to shape a European smart grid certification meta scheme which  acts as an umbrella to all existing certification standards that are relevant to smart grid security. The  reader, can get a detailed description of these criteria in annex G “Scheme mapping”. Answering these  questions yielded a list of available standards that are applicable to the smart grid domain22:  Before going into more details concerning the available standards and schemes, we need to clarify the  relationship between these two concepts: the process of certification is usually referred as  certification scheme. This process uses a set of standards. As a result we can consider, that the  standard is part or a subset of the certification scheme.  3.1 List of standards and schemes  ISO 9001  ISO 9001 is used as proof that an organisation works according to defined procedures to ensure  quality. The security certification of a smart grid is a means to improve security, and is therefore also  related to quality in the organisation. Although ISO 9001 is not a specific smart grid or security  standard, its system to ensure quality within an organisation is a good starting point for connecting  more cyber security and smart grid specific certifications. Therefore it can be used as an overall  umbrella for attaching more specific certifications, and provides context to the position of the smart  grid system in the organisation.  ISO/IEC 27001 & ISO/IEC27019  ISO/IEC 27001 is used for the certification of information security. It can be used to certify that there  are appropriate high level policies and procedures in the organisation for developing, producing,  building or operating smart grid systems and/or components. There is also IEC/ISO 27019:2013, which  21 It should be noted here that person certification is deemed out of scope for this document, as it focusses  specifically on systems, and person certification is being addressed by another ENISA project. General IT is out  of scope to ensure that the differentiating properties of smart grid systems are specifically addressed.  22 The reader might notice that some ‘schemes’ are referenced amongst the standards. This has to do with the  fact that these ‘schemes’ are variations of well known standards.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  13  provides guiding principles, based on ISO/IEC 27002, for information security management applied to  process control systems as used in the energy utility industry, but this standard does only provides  guiding principles, and no certifiable requirements.  IASME  IASME is a lighter version of ISO/IEC 27001 that is developed by CESG in the UK. It can be used for  small and medium sized organisations in the UK that need to address information security, but where  ISO/IEC 27001 is too complex and resource intensive to implement.  IEC 62443  IEC 62443 is a standard that is based on the ISA.99 standard and focusses on functional security.  ”Functional security” means that it will describe the functionality the system or component needs to  possess, but does not address the technical implementation. It can be used to describe the functional  security properties of a smart grid system.  It provides certification of industrial control systems (IEC 62443 part 3.3) and components (IEC62443;  Part 4.2, is currently still in draft, so not certifiable yet)23 there is however an initiative started in the  IECEE24 to extend certification for industrial components to IEC62443 in late 2015. The IECEE scheme  does not however explain anything on how to address security certification specific details, and is  mainly focused on mutual recognition and assessing tests performed at manufacturer side25.  ISO/IEC 15408 Common Criteria (C.C.)  ISO/IEC 15408 is commonly called ”Common Criteria” and sometimes abbreviated to “C.C.“ It is a  framework in which computer system users can specify their security functional- and assurance  requirements, vendors can then implement and/or make claims about the security attributes of their  products, and security evaluation laboratories can evaluate the products to determine if they actually  meet the claims.26 It can be used in the smart grid to verify if a product meets the claims regarding the  technical implementation of those security functions.  CPA  CPA is a UK based approach for gaining confidence in the security of commercial products. It is  intended to complement or sometimes replace other approaches such as Common Criteria. CPA is  currently only used in the United Kingdom.  CSPN  CSPN is a French scheme defined by ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes  d’information) that aims to provide a first-level security certification for IT security products. Its scope  is similar to the vulnerability analysis performed within Common Criteria. Its goal is to provide first  relevant results in a less complex way then Common Criteria but without guarantee of completeness.  ISO/IEC 19790  ISO/IEC 19790, is a certification standard for security requirements for cryptographic modules (similar  to NIST FIPS 140-2). It is used to validate whether the cryptographic core of any security product is  23 https://www.isa.org/pdfs/autowest/phinneydone/  24  http://www.iecee.org/cbscheme/cbfunct.pdf  25 - http://www.iecee.org/ppt_presentations/iecee-peer-assessment.zip  26 ENISA Protecting Industrial Control Systems - Annex III. ICS Security Related Standards, Guidelines and Policy  Documents [Deliverable – 2011-12-09], available for download from the ENISA website;  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/Resilience-and-CIIP/critical-infrastructure-and-services/scada- industrial-control-systems/annex-iii/at_download/fullReport  https://www.isa.org/pdfs/autowest/phinneydone/  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  14  properly implementing technical details in accordance to the design and specification requirements  laid out in the standard itself.  A more extensive description of each of these standards is provided in ”Annex B: Schemes applicable  to the smart grid domain”, and a full list of all the evaluated standards and Schemes is shown in Annex  C: This annex also shows the reason why a particular scheme or standard was excluded.  Each certification standard has some specific properties that are applicable to a specific field of  application. Below are the certification standards divided into the application fields, and described  what specific properties are related to that field.  3.2  Meta-scheme  There is no uniform method available for putting together different certification schemes. There is a  standard called ISO 17067 (Annex F: ISO/IEC 17067 - fundamentals of product certification and  guidelines for product certification schemes) that provides properties for product certification  schemes. But this is not a good base for mapping exercises, as it does not address the differentiating  properties like practical implementation, and market reception of a standard or scheme. Therefore a  different method has been used to map the schemes. The method used is based on a textual analysis  of the information publicly available for each scheme, amended by the practical knowledge of the  team about the schemes. Additionally, the ENISA research for cloud computing certification has  performed similar research regarding cloud computing schemes, 27  and SM-CG has provided a  document comparing some of the schemes found28 that has been used for input as well.  To be able to map the different schemes, an analysis has been made regarding the available schemes  by comparing the following properties:  Administrative details   Name   Type   Group/initiative/organisation   Related documents  Geographic relevance   Geographic relevance: Worldwide, European, Subgroup of European Member States, and  National.  Current maintenance and activity of the program working group   Status: draft/final, version 1,2,3?   Publication date: how actual is it, is it ongoing?  Program scope definition   Description:   Target audience:   Addressed Industry:   Technical relevance of the methodology   Product testing   The heaviness of the program   Resources needed,   Certification delay  27 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  28 SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach - part II; Annual report 2013  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  15   Maintenance scheme definition for the program  National and international accreditation body recognition   Recognition by accreditation bodies (ISO, IEC, other?) National and international;   Definition of CB accreditation criteria  Ability to evolve to a European certification scheme, from the current situation  Program stakeholder trust   Public private participation   Information provision to stakeholders   Use of proven methods and maintaining skills   Defining security measures for the premises of developers / OAM actors  Market drivers for the program   Economics: The scheme includes measures to limit the cost and/or workload and/or  duration of evaluation  The complete set of properties can define a meta-scheme, and it is part of the framework one can use  to position and define the available certification and standards and schemes. The meta-scheme details  regarding each examined certification standard is listed in “Annex D.2 List of schemes”.  3.3 Qualitative analysis of examined certification standards  There are several types of certification standards and schemes which are categorised according to the  following certifications:   Operation certification   System (functional) certification   Development certification   Component certification  The following sections provide the general descriptions and main differences amongst these  standards. Please see ”Annex D: Scheme mapping” for a more detailed table with descriptions and  comparisons.  3.3.1 Operation certification scheme  Operation certification revolves around the certification of the operation of a process according to a  defined standard. It is not uncommon for a company to be certified for operation, as it is commonly  used to enforce trust in the operating capabilities of a certain company.  Examined operational certifications are:   ISO 9001   ISO/IEC 27001   IASME  The following unique and differentiating properties apply to operation certification:   It focusses on a management system or management of a process   The certification is based on documentation and audits as proof for operating according to a  certain standard.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  16  3.3.1.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  ISO 9001 provides an auditing and certification possibility about properly documenting what processes  are implemented. ISO/ IEC 27001 seems to be an international standard that is widely recognised in  Europe. IASME provides a good example of a light version, but is only available as an UK based scheme.  3.3.2 System certification scheme  System certification revolves around the certification of a complete (smart grid) system, including the  system hardware components, software configuration and related procedures according to a defined  standard.  It is in practice difficult to maintain system certification, due to the fluent nature of a smart grid  system, and static nature of certification. As a system usually is not a static entity, there will be changes  and additions made during its lifetime. Certification relies usually on the fact that a certain snapshot  of a system is made, and a certificate issued will apply to that specific snapshot. Any change to the  system (good or bad) will invalidate the certification. Making the certification a potential cumbersome  and costly task, that can discourage improvements.  Examples of system certification are: IEC-62443-3-3 (SSA)  IEC62443-3-3 provides a good overview of what aspects can be addressed in system certification.  Properties observed in system certification:   Components are integrated into a  single system.   May consist of multiple Security  Zones.   The certification is based on a  complete system, including  components, configuration,  procedures and people. A  combination of certified  components, people and  procedures is used to create a  chain of trust.  3.3.2.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  There is a certification scheme for IEC 62443-3-3 called ISASecure. However, there is no certification  body in Europe that supports it at this moment. Regarding smart grid systems, no other formal security  certification schemes have been identified.  3.3.3 Development certification scheme  Development certification schemes are characterised by the certification of a process. The goal is to  provide proof that the method used to develop a certain smart grid system, -product or -component  is in line with standards.  There are multiple schemes that focus on development certification, or include it as an aspect.  Especially in the field of cyber security, there is recognition for development certification as a means  of providing trust in a certain product.  Examples are:  Figure 1  - IEC 62443-3-3  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  17   ISO9001   IEC62443-2-4 (Installation and maintenance requirements for industrial automation control  systems suppliers, no certification available yet, since it is still in development)   IEC62443-4-1 (ISASecure certification of product development requirements)29   CPA addresses criteria regarding secure development   CC addresses criteria regarding secure development   CSPN addresses a few criteria regarding secure development  Properties observed in development certifications:   Development certification is a process certification that applies to how a product is created   It revolves around using certified people, and certified tools to create a chain of trust30   The validation is done with process, documentation and code audits.  3.3.3.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  ISO9001 is a high level assurance standard that a company can use to seek adherence to a documented  high level of quality. This quality standard can be used for developers of systems to prove they develop  code according to documented procedures. Standards such as IEC 62443-2-4 and IEC62443-4-1 can be  followed to prove suppliers also meet certain security requirements when developing a device or  system, but the standards are in draft, so no formal certification is possible.  Additionally Common  Criteria and CPA contain aspects that address the development environment of products as well, but  the level of detail differs per standard and/or security level. Finally, Common Criteria does not address  the certification of people.  3.3.4 Component certification scheme  Component certification revolves around the certification of a single component or product, and it is  focussed on the certification of a component or product according to a defined standard or set of  requirements. The examined component certification standards are:   IEC62443-4-2 (ISASecure certification, security requirements for industrial automation control  system components).   ISO/IEC 15408 C.C.   CPA   CSPN   ISO/IEC 19790  Properties observed in component certification are:   Available from a single supplier   Supported by a single supplier   Can be identified by a product name and version  3.3.4.1 Qualitative analysis conclusion  CPA and CSPN are national schemes for the UK and France that can be applied. IEC 19790 is only  applicable for cryptographic modules, but is also useful for guidance on testing and product  requirements. C.C. covers most aspects of CPA and CSPN. C.C. is international recognised and  extendable but is a framework, and therefore depends on specific protection profiles for a specific  29http://www.isasecure.org/PDFs/Articles-and-Technical-Paper- Folder/ISASecure_AssetOwnerViewpoint_Oct2013_v05.aspx  30 Although this holds true only for a part of the schemes above mentioned  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  18  type of product, and a security level (Evaluated Assurance Level, EAL, please see “Annex B.1 Common  Criteria (CC)” ) for more detail. SM-CG provided a more extensive analysis on component certification  for the smart meter 31 . IEC 62443-4-2 provides security requirements for industrial control  components, but currently there is no official certification scheme associated with this standard, as it  is still in draft form. ISASecure is a certification scheme for IEC 62443-3-3. However, there is no  certification body in Europe that supports it at the time of writing this report. There is however an  initiative started in the IECEE to extend certification for industrial components to IEC62443 in late  2015. But this scheme will initially focus on components.  3.4 How are schemes currently applied in the EU?  This section gives an overview of the implementation status of smart grid certifications across Europe.  Then the key findings will be presented as a means of identifying what could be used as a base towards  a more harmonised smart grid security certification practices framework.  The descriptions regarding the smart meter certifications have been taken from the SM-CG research  performed in 2013. 32  Other descriptions have been based on online sources, observations and  minutes of meetings of standardization meetings of several standards (i.e. IEC 62351) that were  attended by the authors’ team.  3.4.1 Germany  The German Ministry of Economy (BMWi) has mandated the Federal Agency for Security in  Information technology (BSI) to develop a protection profile for smart meter Gateways. The protection  profile is based on Common Criteria. The level of security has been defined EAL4+, which is similar to  EAL level 4; methodically designed tested and reviewed, but augmented with vulnerability analysis  requirements with more stringent conditions.  Besides this component certification, the energy companies in Germany have to be compliant with  IEC/ISO 27001 by the end of 2015.  3.4.2 United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom the Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC) has defined Security  Requirements and an end-to-end security architecture.33  The Security requirements are needed for the Commercial Product Assurance (CPA), a certification  that is mandatory for all smart metering products in the UK. CESG (Communications-Electronics  Security Group) provides smart metering security profiles according to the CPA scheme called ”smart  metering security characteristics”.34 The production of these profiles has been coordinated by the  DECC with input by a cross-industry working group.  The UK government also promotes Cyber Essentials35. Cyber Essentials is a UK government scheme  encouraging organizations to follow good practices in information security. It includes an assurance  framework aligned with ISO27001 and IASME, and a simple set of security controls to protect IT. It  was launched in 2014 by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.  31 SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach – part II;  Annual report  2013  32 source: SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach - part II; Annual report 2013.  33 https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65685/7339-exp-doc- support-smets1.pdf  34 https://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/Product-Assurance/CPA/Pages/Security-Characteristics.aspx  35 http://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/cyber-essentials/Pages/cyber-essentials.aspx  https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65685/7339-exp-doc-support-smets1.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65685/7339-exp-doc-support-smets1.pdf https://www.cesg.gov.uk/servicecatalogue/Product-Assurance/CPA/Pages/Security-Characteristics.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  19  3.4.3 France  France is considering a certification scheme called CSPN (Certification de Sécurité de Premier Niveau),  that is based on Common Criteria. The scheme is used for meters and data concentrator security  certification. France is considering smart grids as specific Industrial Control Systems. A law was passed  in December 201336 which allows the French Prime Minister to enforce legal requirements in order to  increase the security level of critical infrastructures. The decrees related to this law are currently being  drafted and should be published by the end of 2014. This will apply to smart grids as well as other  critical infrastructures. ANSSI (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information) has also  published a framework for classifying Industrial Control Systems and a set of technical and  organisational rules applicable to Industrial Control Systems.  3.4.4 Other Member States and EFTA countries  The Dutch national organisation of DSO’s ”Netbeheer Nederland”, has developed the Dutch Smart  Meter Requirements (DSMR). Although security and privacy were not the primary focus of the initial  specification, additional security and privacy requirements have been included to the updated DSMR.  The Netherlands is considering developing a protection profile based on Common Criteria. They  expressed their interest to collaborate on a European level.  Norway and Sweden have the intention to develop a protection profile based on Common Criteria.  SERTIT (Sertifiseringsmyndigheten for IT-sikkerhet) is currently representing Norway as a member of  the international community called “Arrangement on the Recognition of the Common Criteria  Certificates in the field of Information Technology Security (CCRA)”.Several EU Member States and  EFTA countrieshave indicated to prefer a European wide harmonized security approach, but will define  their own level of security. Additionally, Norway is also a member of the SOG-IS agreement.  In the industry, ISO 27001 is internationally recognized, and common in Europe.37 Other standards  mentioned in the energy industry are ISO27002 and IEC 62443 but no formal legislation or guidance  is provided.  3.4.5 European cooperation for Accreditation (EA)  EA has been appointed by the European Commission to manage the accreditation infrastructure  within the EU, EFTA (European Free Trade Association) and Candidate countries. It is a non-profit  association responsible for defining, harmonising and building consistency in accreditation within the  European region, with the aim of reducing barriers to trade, and contributing to protecting health,  safety and the environment. EA ensures that national accreditation bodies operate in accordance with  the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.  36 http://www.defense.gouv.fr/portail-defense/enjeux2/politique-de-defense/la-loi-de-programmation- militaire-lpm-2014-2019/la-loi-de-programmation-militaire-lpm-2014-2019  37  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm?certificate=ISO/IEC%2027001&  countrycode=AF#standardpick  http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/certification/iso-survey.htm?certificate=ISO/  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  20  Figure 2 - EA scheme  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  21  3.4.6 SOG-IS  The SOG-IS (Senior Officers Group for Information Systems) is a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA)  between the participants. The participants agree that IT products and protection profiles which earn  a certificate can be procured or used without the need for further evaluation. It seeks to provide  grounds for confidence in the reliability of the judgements on which the original certificate was based,  by requiring that a Certification Body (CB) issuing Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria  (ITSEC), or Common Criteria (CC) certificates, should meet high and consistent standards.  The objectives for signing an MRA are:38   Objective 1: Facilitating trade exchanges; The potential advantages for economic players who  wish to benefit from these agreements are as follows:  o To make the regulatory process easier for introducing products on the importing  country’s market as far as the conformity assessment against the technical regulations  of the importing country is performed before shipment (a reduction in the expense  and time required to obtain product compliance with the importing country’s  technical guidelines, non-duplication of audits and inspections). Third-party  conformity assessment of European products intended for export is conducted by one  of the European bodies designated for this purpose (and vice versa).  o Greater legal security and enhanced predictability in trade (fewer inspections  conducted by authorities of the importing country in the exporting country).   Objective 2 : a tool for deregulation; For products subject to third party conformity  assessment procedures, mutual recognition agreements are clearly meaningless unless:  o Conformity assessment bodies (CABs) have been set up with the necessary authority  and technical competence to perform this work and are allowed to also perform on  the basis of the third country’s technical regulations;  o The regulatory authorities decide to recognise the results of conformity assessment  procedures issued by CABs located in the other party’s territory.   Objective 3: a step for regulatory convergence; According to the European Commission,  mutual recognition agreements may have an educational impact: enhanced understanding of  the technical regulations of the other contracting party and the experience gained in  implementing these regulations in the context of the MRA agreement may be factors that  could contribute to greater mutual understanding of each contracting party to the others’  certification scheme details.  However, the usefulness is also limited due to:   The recognition and acceptance by each of the Participants that this Agreement does not  create any substantive or procedural rights, liabilities or obligations that could be invoked by  persons who are not signatories to this Agreement.   The recognition and acceptance by each of the Participants that this Agreement has no  binding effect in national, international or European Union Law.  38  Source: MUTUAL RECOGNITION AGREEMENTS THEIR ROLE TODAY AND TOMORROW - a  presentation on the role of mutual recognition agreements made at the Workshop on Standardization  and Conformity Assessment Matters in the Transition Economies  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  22  Please see “Annex H: SOG-IS” for more details.  3.5 Key findings  In Europe, only a few Member States (Germany, UK and the Netherlands) have developed specific  security requirements for smart grid equipment. These initiatives have been developed in order to  meet specific national smart grid needs and diverse national energy law requirements. As a result,  there is diversity in the specifications for security requirements.  The shortage of security requirements and initiatives might be due to the fact that there is not a clear  view of the amount of publicly known cyber incidents39. Due to the unspecified number of incidents,  there is no direct recognition of the necessity to improve cyber security from a corporate point of  view. This lack of recognition is caused by the fact that private companies will not admit they had a  cyber-related incident as this might damage their reputation. Additionally, cyber incidents are not  easy to identify after the fact, as the systems often are too damaged or do not store enough data for  effective forensic research to be carried out.  The identified smart grid security requirements focus on Home Area Network (HAN) and Grid-End  applications. This is mostly due to the fact that, at the moment, the key driver behind the development  of the smart gird, is the roll-out of the smart meters which are devices oriented to service end user  needs . Based on the desktop research, the team couldn’t identify security requirements for other  than the HAN parts of the smart grid (e.g. substation automation and protection, EMS, DMS etc.) in  European Member States.  Furthermore, the production process of these profiles varies among Member States; in Germany the  profile has been developed by a public Authority (BSI) while in Netherlands the private sector has the  leading role. This might have an impact on the acceptance level of the profile by the industry due to  different degrees of private sector involvement in the security requirements’ making process.  Although there are organisations supporting European wide certification such as EA and SOG-IS, there  is no legislation enforcing a particular scheme.40 Common Criteria have nevertheless been adopted in  almost every country, although they are sometimes amended or replaced by other national schemes  to support specific national needs. In some but not all European Member States there is some form  of public-private participation regarding security certification for the energy industry. This situation  also illustrates the difference in attitude among EU Member States, where some feel the need to  instate legislation before EU mandates, while other Member States prefer to use the guidance of the  EU to decide what scheme to adopt.  There is currently no harmonisation, there are different methods, schemes and different levels of  security defined per Member State, but there is some synergy in the adopted schemes primarily based  on the Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) concept. There have been national initiatives to improve  cyber security for the smart grid by adopting a certain certification approach.  39  Examples of root causes for such cyber incidents might include: human errors, system failures, natural  phenomena, malicious actions and third party  40 Germany is going to mandate ISO27001 in 2015.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  23  4 A Chain of trust for the smart grid  4.1 The supply chain view of the smart grid  To be able to create trust regarding the security of the smart grid, it is necessary that the stakeholders  are confident in the aspects deemed relevant. Certification is a formal means to create confidence,  and thus trust in the relevant aspects, by means of a standardised validation process.  A typical supply chain as described in the needs (see 2.3) that can be applied to the smart grid domain  is shown in Figure 3.  Figure 3 - Typical supply chain  It is important to note that a single certification scheme spanning across the entire smart grid supply  chain is quite complex, and requires a lot of actors to work together. As such, a large scheme is usually  too complex, in practice it is split up into separate schemes that are specific for the separate steps in  the chain. To be able to trust this supply chain, certification can then be used to create a chain of trust.  By ensuring that each step in the supply chain follows certain security rules, a trusted environment  can be created, where it can be assumed that a system is being operated in a secure manner. However,  if a step in the chain is compromised, it can cause a security breach, that could affect the rest of the  chain as well.  Figure 4 shows a mapping of security certification on the smart grid supply chain.  Figure 4 – Supply chain certification  This chain can only be trusted if the certification scheme used for the certification itself is also trusted  by the stakeholders.  The trust in a certification scheme or lack thereof, is a common issue and there  are multiple solutions to solve this. On a national level, trust in a scheme is commonly created by  following guidelines such as ISO/IEC 17067 that is used for product certification schemes. (For a  detailed explanation of ISO 17067 please see “Annex F: ISO/IEC 17067 - fundamentals of product  certification and guidelines for product certification schemes)”. This allows for the certification body  that applies the scheme to receive formal accreditation by a nationally recognised accreditation  organisation. Such a national organisation is subsequently recognised by an international forum of  accreditation organisations, therefore effectively creating trust in the certification scheme. A similar  hierarchy is depicted in Error! Reference source not found..  The process describing the details regarding accreditation, certification, related organisations and  their interactions are detailed in “Annex E: Description of accreditation and certification”.  4.2 Analysis of the smart grid chain of trust  This section provides a definition and reference model of a chain of trust for the smart grid. Then it  explains how the smart grid can be mapped on existing security certification standards and practices  using this chain of trust. Additionally it describes how a risk based analysis can define the level of  security of a smart grid, and how a smart grid certification scheme can be validated.  development production product system operation  development  certification  production  certification  product  certification  system  certification  operation  certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  24  4.2.1 Certification and the chain of trust  ”Figure 5 - Smart grid chain of trust” is a depiction of the complete supply chain for a system in a smart  grid environment41 based on the analysis of the smart grid stakeholders involved in development,  production, integration and operation, and the model outlined by the standard IEC 62443 (please see  B.6 IEC62443 for details on this standard and its relevance to the chain of trust concept).  Figure 5 - Smart grid chain of trust  According to this model certification takes place at three levels:  1. Smart grid operator certification.  2. Smart grid system integration certification  3. Smart grid component certification,  A smart grid may suffer from complexity in respect to system design, which makes it different to  standard ICT components as far as certification is concerned. A smart grid is geographically spread  over a large area and there are multiple interconnections on different parts of the system. A smart  grid can communicate with a Home Automation Network (HAN), Decentralised Energy Resources  (DER) or an energy trading system. These interconnection can occur on numerous parts of the system,  and exchange low or high level data with parties that can have different levels of trust. These  interactions should not affect the chain of trust, and this is theoretically feasible as long as guidelines  and best practices for third party interconnections are respected and implemented in line with NIST  IR 7628 and ISO27002.  41 It should be noted that such a system does not encompass the complete European smart grid, but will be a  system that is a part of it. The system described here has a system responsible, and will interact with other smart  grid systems on different abstraction levels.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  25  Cyber threats evolve over time. Vulnerabilities in hardware and software  and new attack factors are  a reason of daily concern. There is need for continuous certification maintenance to stay up to date  with the latest known attack factors. This need is recognised by the stakeholders (see 2.3) and the  certification lifecycle will need to be taken into account when looking at what should be certified.  “Figure 5 - Smart grid chain of trust” includes the lifecycle by taking into account component and  system maintenance in the form of the block ‘continuous certification maintenance’. Maintenance is  commonly reviewed by equipment vendors who supply patches, and smart grid system users, who  apply patches and expand on the system. System integration does not commonly include a  maintenance scheme, as it is normally applied as a project with a discrete deliverable (e.g. deliver a  working system x at date y). Therefore continuous certification maintenance for system integrators is  left out of this figure.  4.2.2 Adoption of SG-AM for a chain of trust model  The SG-AM Framework and reference model aims at offering support for the design of use cases for  smart grids. Support takes place by following an architectural approach which allows for a  representation of interoperability viewpoints in a technology neutral manner for both current smart  grid implementations and the implementations of the smart grid rolled out in the near future.  The SG-AM model can be applied for individual and interacting entities across the smart grid domain,  and provides insight on how a stacked layer of security, can provide a layered approach for smart grid  security. It relates back to the defence in depth strategy, where secure components (component  layer), secure communication between components (communication layer), and a secured  information and function layer, provide a layered model of smart grid cyber security. It also provides  insight where security standards possibly overlap or complement each other.  It can be concluded that SG-AM meets the requirements for different certification standards for smart  grids. Existing certification schemes address the issue of certification of smart gird chain elements (see  Figure 6) separately.”Figure 6 - chain of trust model” shows an interpretation of the SG-AM model  combined with the earlier introduced chain of trust (Figure 5) that can be used to map different  standards and schemes suitable for smart grid security certification.  A chain of certificates which covers all aspects depicted in Figure 5 (e.g. vendor development,  production and product security combined with secure system development, and secure operation)  supports the enhancement of trust for the whole smart grid supply chain.  The level of security that is covered by the individual certificates can then be related to the place of  the certificate in the value chain and the SG-AM model, and the role it will fulfil within the smart grid  chain. This means that the model below can be used to give insight into dependencies, how certificates  relate to each other in the smart grid, and provide a means to assess the impact of the security level  used in a specific part.  It can also be used to provide insight into how security should be mapped on a specific SG-AM use  case. For example, when a SG-AM use case is created for a smart meter chain, the SG-AM use case  model can help in mapping the types of certification required to build a chain of trust within the smart  meter SG-AM use-case. This approach provides a way to relate an SG-AM model based use case to  specific certification schemes, and provides context to the coverage of an, existing or to appear, smart  grid related certification scheme.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  26  Figure 6 - chain of trust model  The model in Figure 6 is a graphical representation of how the described chain of trust could be applied  to an SG-AM use case. This image seems to imply that the complete chain should be applied for each  layer, for a complete security certified smart grid, but the SG-AM model was not intended to describe  a complete smart grid prototype, but provides a method to create a common reference model for a  smart grid use case. Only after such a SG-AM use case is defined the suggested chain of trust model  described in figure 5 can be applied for each layer in the use case.  It should also be recognized that the model does not imply that the SG-AM use case and its related  layers are in an one-to-one relation with the layers of the chain of trust model. It is merely a graphical  representation that demonstrates the different levels where different certification schemes can  reside; these layers are not meant to be fully aligned with the layers used in the SG-AM model.  4.2.3 Security requirements  Having defined the reference model, the next step towards more harmonised smart grid security  certification practices is to define the security requirements of European wide technical communities  (e.g. EURELECTRIC, ESMIG). There are only three42  identified sets of security requirements in the  European market. The definition of these requirements is beyond the scope of this document, but  42 Germany, the Netherlands and UK, see section 3.5  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  27  could be based on profiles like the Common Criteria protection profiles or the CPA Security  Characteristic.  4.2.4 Definition of risk levels aligned with the SG-IS framework methodology  To be able to minimize the cost of certification, one can take into account the criticality of the  component subject to certification. This way, the proper level of depth and thoroughness of  evaluation can be determined.  A risk-based approach can help to focus certification efforts on smart  grid use cases, and therefore provide insight into the appropriate level of security. Additionally, a  European approach for the level of security will facilitate in a common reference model for all Member  States. This section will describe an approach of how the M/490 SG-IS framework can help to answer  the question ”what to certify?”.  In 2012 the Smart Grid Information Security (SG-IS) working group of the Smart Grid Coordination  Group (SG-CG) provided a methodology to help define security requirements through a Use Case  based approach. The SG-IS toolbox provides Smart Grid Use Case stakeholders an easy and pragmatic  way to identify their security needs and identify gaps in use case recommended standards to deploy  security requirements as needed. In 2014 this is renamed to the SG-IS framework. The use case model  utilized by SG-IS is based on the SG-AM framework, and is therefore usable to perform risk  assessments on SG-AM use cases. Therefore it is a useful methodology to align with when defining the  risk levels within the chain of trust.  The SG-IS framework describes in detail how to assess use cases, lists the relevant assets categories  and identifies a model for determining the Risk Impact Level (RIL) of specific information assets in a  use case. The following picture summarizes how the methodology is intended to be applied.  Figure 7: Methodology for security requirements definition  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  28  Using the SG-IS methodology can help to focus certification efforts on the smart grid use case with the  highest risk impact level.  4.2.4.1 Risk impact levels  The Risk Impact is established by analysing how incidents related to a particular information asset  affect the process where it is involved. Different incidents produce different impacts, so the highest  impact identified in all the possible scenarios determines the Risk impact level for the analysed  information asset. The result is expressed in a scale from 1 to 5 where level 1 is the lowest possible  and 5 the highest risk impact level.  4.2.4.2 Risk Impact Categories  Security incidents against information assets affect their involved processes in different ways. The SG- IS Impact Analysis methodology identifies six different types of affectation or categories. Categories  should be evaluated independently using the scale defined above (from 1 to 5).  There are six categories that are evaluated in this process to identify the risk impact produced by  security incidents. Two of these categories are subdivided in subcategories. More categories and/or  subcategories could be added at this level in order to get a deeper and more specific risk impact  analysis in smart grids. The figure below shows the described categories criteria and its risk impact  levels:  The SG-IS Framework provides a way to identify security requirements for specific Use Cases and SG  assets. Then the asset owner can determine the level of security for his asset, based on the  methodology proposed and the risk appetite, by using the SG-IS framework.  As both the SG-AM model and the SG-IS framework are recognized by Member States as an accepted  approach for describing the smart grid and the relevant risk levels, they provide a good basis for a  European framework which contributes to more harmonised smart grid security certification  practices.  Combining the two (SG-AM and SG-IS), one can build a chain of trust for a specific national use case,  as well as the level of security needed for this use case. This way a Member State can describe its own  use case and perform a risk assessment, both based on an accepted EU methodology.

The next step is then to define how the level of security for each part of the chain of trust is to be  evaluated. For this, existing certification schemes can be selected on national level. Based on the  national use cases stakeholders can take decisions regarding scheme implementation, specific  requirements, and validation activities.  4.3  Conformity assessment and its relation to testing  To be able to certify the security of the smart grid, asset owners will need to provide proof that security  requirements set by the technical committees are met. Such proof is usually generated by assessing  (or testing) the conformance to this set of security requirements. In this respect conformity  certification, conformity assessment and testing are commonly used interchangeably. To understand  what certification is, and how it relates to terms such as conformity assessment and testing, this  section explains their relation. For a more in depth view, please see Annex G: Conformity assessment  and testing. Additionally, ISO provides a comprehensive overview online:  http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf.  Conformity assessment can be undertaken by the supplier of a product or service, its purchaser and  other parties who might have an interest such as insurance companies and regulatory authorities. It  is convenient when talking about conformity assessment to refer to the parties as follows:   First party (1st party) – the person or organization that provides the object which is being  assessed;   Second party (2nd party) – a person or organization that has a user interest in the object;   Third party (3rd party) – a person or body that is independent of the person or organization  that provides the object, and of user interests in the object.  A 1st party conformity assessment is perceived as less trustworthy then a 3rd party assessment.  Therefore, in relation to the risk that nonconformity poses, a choice is made to what parties are  allowed to perform the assessment. An SG-IS framework aligned approach (described in section 4.2.4  4.2.1) can help to decide the risk for a specific scenario and associated assurance level.  The following items are the most common conformity assessment activities.   Inspection is the examination of a product design, product, process or installation and the  determination of its conformity with specific requirements or general requirements.   Certification by a certification body formally establishes that a product, service, organization  or individual meets the requirements of a standard after evaluation.   Accreditation provides independent attestation of the competence of an individual or an  organization to offer specified conformity assessment services (e.g. testing, inspection or  certification).   Testing is the determination of a product’s characteristics against the requirements of the  standard. Testing can vary from a non-destructive evaluation (e.g. X-ray, electrical, etc.) after  which the product is still fit for use, to a destructive analysis (e.g. chemical, mechanical, etc.)  after which the product is no longer fit for use.  There are different types of aspects that can be focussed on while testing.

The required functionality of the test subject is usually  described in a standard that the assessment refers to when performing the tests.   Interoperability testing: testing to assess the ability of two or more systems to exchange  information and to make mutual use of the information that has been exchanged. 43  With respect to smart grid cyber security, all three aspects play a role. Conformity testing needs to be  performed to ensure that smart grids comply with requirements set by the EU, Member States and  users of smart grid systems.  Functional security testing needs to be performed to support the implementation of cyber security in  the grid, as conformity testing normally does not focus on the validation of security functions that the  device can support. For example, the conformity security requirement is for a device to have access  control, but the functional security requirements can be that access control should work in a specific  manner.  Interoperability testing is an important aspect of conformity assessments of communication  standards. For example, an encryption mechanism needs to be interoperable between smart grid  devices to be useful. If interoperability testing is skipped for an encrypted communication channel,  the system can be conforming to all security requirements, and have been functionally tested, but can  still not be able to use the encrypted channel because the devices are not interoperable.  Penetration testing  A more specific form of testing that is common in security tests is penetration testing. This type of  testing revolves around the exploitation of possible design flaws and weaknesses to compromise the  security of a device. Such tests do not focus on a specific test book, but rely more on the creativity of  the tester, and the time there is available to perform a penetration test. Penetration testing can be  incorporated as part of a functional test, by describing it as a negative test case for a functional  requirement. For example, the validation by the following functional requirement can be tested by a  penetration test; ”the device under test shall not provide means to circumvent the access control  mechanism”. Such a requirement can be validated by a negative test scenario, where the device will  be subjected to a penetration test in an attempt to circumvent the access control mechanism.  A successful smart grid cyber security certification practices framework will need to include all 3 topics,  conformity testing, functional testing and interoperability testing. It should also address penetration  testing as part of the functional tests. Depending on the potential severity of the security risk if a  product is not conform, it can be decided to perform first, second or third party assessments.  However, in practice, only third party certification is seen as trustworthy for most cyber security  schemes.  The different conformity assessment techniques can be combined with the Risk Impact Levels  described in the previous section. This way, it is possible that some certification cost can be decreased  because it is expected that less critical devices might not be subject to certifications but to less  expensive conformity assessments (see annex G for a summary on conformity assessment and  testing).  43  ITU-T Z.450 - Quality aspects of protocol-related Recommendations - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-  T/publications/Pages/structure.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  31  4.4  Description of certification scheme relations loosely based on SG-AM  model  This section describes a loosely based mapping of security certification schemes, related to the chain  of trust model described in section 4.2.1. It is not possible to exactly map the schemes to the SG-AM  model, as it would not provide a picture that does justice to the scope of the different certification  approaches. Therefore the domains in the original SG-AM model have been replaced by stages in the  product lifecycle; development, production, operation and maintenance. The zones in the SG-AM  model have been replaced by the product ownership stages that a product goes through during  production, integration, acceptance and operation. In this way the model should provide guidance  of where to place a certification scheme in the smart grid chain of trust. The layer definitions from the  SG-AM model have been kept intact, and should help to understand the level of abstraction of the  standard.  The following layers are described by the SG-AM model:   Business layer   Function layer   Information layer   Communication layer   Component layer  Below follows a description of each layer generally aligned with the SG-AM model44, and suggested  which of the identified certification schemes can be applied to that layer.  44 SG-AM model described at  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf on page  27  http://ec.europa.eu/energy/gas_electricity/smartgrids/doc/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  32  4.4.1 Business layer  The business layer represents the business view on the information exchange related to smart grids.  SG-AM can be used to map regulatory and economic (market) structures and policies, business  models, business portfolios (products and services) of market parties involved. Also business  capabilities and business processes can be represented in this layer. In this way it supports business  executives in decision making related to (new) business models and specific business projects  (business case) as well as regulators in defining new market models.  On the business layer, the focus of security is around the business- and corporate regulatory  processes. They are high level, and provide controls for management and decision makers that can be  used to steer and implement more detailed procedures and technical requirements.  Figure 9 - business layer  ISO9001  ISO27001  IASME  ISO9001  ISO27001  IASME  ISO9001  ISO27001  IASME  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  33  4.4.2 Functional layer  The functional layer describes functions and services including their relationships from an  architectural viewpoint. The functions are represented independent from actors and physical  implementations in applications, systems and components. The functions are derived by extracting  the use case functionality which is independent from actors.  IEC 62443 provides requirements and guidance for security functions for industrial control systems.  Unfortunately not all parts of the standard provide formal certification schemes. Additionally, the  standard focusses on security requirements and design, but does not go into detailed descriptions of  components and communication protocols. Below is a mapping of the different parts to the trust  chain.  Figure 10 - Functional layer  4.4.3 Information layer  The information layer describes the information that is being used and exchanged between functions,  services and components. It contains information objects and the underlying canonical data models.  These information objects and canonical data models represent the common semantics for functions  and services in order to allow an interoperable information exchange via communication means.  On the information layer there is nothing available for the certification of security. Such certification  would have to focus on securing the information exchange at the technical level. This encompasses  IEC 62443-3-3  IEC 62443-2-4 IEC 62443-2-2  IEC 62443-3-1 IEC 62443-3-2  IEC 62443-4-1 IEC 62443-4-2  IEC 62443-2-3  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  34  such aspects as configuration, data model and database encryption, but it could also address key  generation, installation, distribution and daily handling of sensitive data. Data encryption in devices  on information level is not very common in embedded system, unless it is a smart meter device (where  readings and keys have to be stored secure). On computer systems it is possible, but no certification  scheme is available.  4.4.4 Communication layer  The communication layer seeks to describe protocols and mechanisms for the interoperable exchange  of information between components in the context of the underlying use case, function or service and  related information objects or data models.  There are standards available for secure communication, such as IEC62351 and the DLMS/IEC 62056.  These standards recommend the implementation of communication security measures such as  encryption and authentication. But no certification schemes are available yet to formally test the  security of device communication. Validation can be done for example in part by penetration testing,  or more in depth by validating the communication security requirements. The validation of  communication security requirements does not proof that all security requirements have been  implemented, but only provides proof that the communication interface comply with the security  requirements defined in the communication standards.  4.4.5 Component layer  The emphasis of the component layer is the physical distribution of all participating components in  the smart grid context. This includes system actors, applications, power system equipment (typically  located at process and field level), protection and tele-control devices, network infrastructure (wired  / wireless communication connections, routers, switches, servers) and any kind of computers.  Component layer security focusses on security of the components used in the smart grid. It addresses  the security of the individual components, focussed on hardware, software, and the functions the  devices should support. Although most standards listed here will also take into account the higher  level requirements, they have been listed here, as they are applied and validated from a single  device/product and/or system perspective. The technical validation of communication between  systems, secure information handling and secure system management is out of scope.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  35  Figure 11 - Component layer  There is currently not one certification scheme that can cover all aspects of the smart grid. And there  is also no combination of schemes that can be used to cover everything, as the communication and  information layers do not have certification schemes that formally focus on these aspects.  But this does not need to be a major issue, as the practical implementations of the smart grid also do  not cover every aspect of the SG-AM model. Additionally, several schemes mentioned can actually  cover the parts described, if they are amended in line with profiles or standards and requirements in  force.  Another important observation is that some standards like parts of IEC 62443 are not published yet,  so they cannot serve as a basis for certification. Also there are currently no interoperability tests or  certification schemes available for secure smart grid communication standards such as IEC 62351.

There is currently no established model for a smart grid chain of trust in the EU. It will be a  challenge to create consensus about a chain of trust model. Although the concept is known, it has  not been specifically adopted by any Member State in the context of smart grid certification. A  chain of trust seems not to be explicitly mentioned in any complete certification approach. Only  partial chains for the smart grid are supported for shared risk mitigation. It will be a challenge to  ensure that responsibility of risk mitigation is properly assigned to the responsible party, as the  interconnected nature of the grid makes it sometimes difficult to identify the accountable party  in relation with a specific action.  2. A common reference model like SG-AM for smart grid security the is in line with SOG-IS is only  available for components and operational parts; this however is not harmonized within nor  adopted by all Member States. There is no scheme for the complete EU smart grid. Due to the  large number and fragmented nature of the smart grid stakeholders, it will be a challenge to create  consensus regarding a common reference model.  3. There is no common baseline set of security requirements that can be recognized by all  participating EU Member States. Only three Member States45 have defined their own protection  profiles. These requirements are different per country, they do not focus on the whole grid but  on specific parts of it (i.e. smart meters), based on different standards and adopted by technical  committees (TCs). It will be difficult to create a common baseline, as multiple Member States  adopted widely different approaches, and have different requirements and levels of security  related to smart grids.  4. At European level equivelant security and risk levels are provided by the M/490 SG-IS framework  but this is not formally recognized as an EU wide standard level for smart grid security. Recognizing  the M/490 SG-IS framework should be feasible, as it has been regarded by several Member States  as a good reference model.  5. There are certification schemes for components and operation, but there is none for systems  certification in Europe. There is no scheme that includes all aspects and enables a pan European  approach. It will be a challenge to create a single scheme that includes all aspects of smart grid  certification, as there are gaps and overlaps in the schemes that apply to a specific topic (please  see chapter 4.2 for a detailed analysis).  6. Depending on the scheme and type of testing, procedures and methodologies are available, but  detailed procedures are fragmented and not readily available for all smart grid aspects. Some  certification schemes can overcome this by defining the test cases on a per-case basis.  7. Some schemes facilitate public and private interaction by including Technical Committee  subgroups that could be useful on an EU level, but only for product certification. There is no EU  body to facilitate public-private interaction. It will be a challenge to find an existing group of  experts that can form a technical committee and having enough commitment to produce a  workable scheme.  45 Germany, the Netherlands and UK, see section 3.5  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  37  8. There is not a single scheme that can provide EU guidance for implementation, and supporting  national legislation. There are some schemes that have been mandated by certain Member States  that could also be applied at an EU level. There is no EU body to provide guidance for a scheme  implementation and keeping the scheme up to date. It will be a challenge to raise the maturity  level of all the Member States, as the amount of effort that is put in smart grid security differs per  Member State (please see section 3.4 for the detailed analysis).  9. There is no alignment with smart grid definitions such as M/490 and only guidance for proper  security measures on a national level that differ per Member State. As there is currently no  harmonization, it will take considerable effort to create a harmonized approach that has  consensus, but still complies with the desired scheme. Such an approach is necessary to facilitate  the growth to a scheme that is geared towards service EU Member States’ needs.  10. There are barriers and silos created by fragmented markets. There is no harmonized approach  causing higher costs for certification per Member State. There are similarities among countries  that can be used to create consensus, and a combination of schemes could be acceptable on an  EU level, assisting in a lower cost. It will be a challenge to keep cost to a minimum while still  providing security, as security is a topic that penetrates all aspects of a system, and therefore has  to be widely implemented without directly providing a clear justification of the necessary cost and  effort.  11. Some schemes include a maintenance scheme, but no harmonized approach or EU interface is  available for all aspects of the smart grid. Additionally, there could be gaps with respect to life  cycle coverage when they are analysed in more detail. It will be a challenge to create a harmonized  maintenance and life cycle scheme. The available schemes do include one, but they do not relate  to one another.  5.2 Gaps and challenges related to the desired properties  The analysis also includes the gaps regarding the additional properties of the desired scheme, as  outlined hereunder:  Operational in a reasonable time  There are various scheme components available to support a single pan EU framework that can be  rendered operational within a reasonable time frame. The organisation to maintain such a framework  and harmonise the schemes related to smart grid security needs to be further analysed and appointed.  Additionally, some of the standards such as IEC 62443 are still largely in draft stage and therefore in  the current state they are not necessarily usable for certification. To become operational will be  challenging in terms of consensus building and in creating all the background information to make the  entire stakeholder group understand what and how to follow. Additionally, it will be difficult to get all  standards published that are relevant, but currently still in draft such as IEC62443.  Recommendations based on accepted good practices  There are plenty of recommendations, but there needs to be a selected subset of them that is  coherent and will be advertised as a single package for smart grid security in the EU. There are multiple  standards that cover the same topics, but they sometimes address them on different abstraction level.  It will be a challenge to create one set of recommendations with the right level of abstraction that  does not overlap.  Easy to be adopted by the Member States  As the schemes adopted by different Member States vary, a gap lies in the utilisation of one  harmonised scheme to make it easy to adopt. As several Member States have already taken steps in  utilizing a specific scheme, it will be a challenge to create consensus regarding the adoption of one  single approach, if that means stopping the national approach, and redoing certain activities.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  38  Take into account new and existing technologies  Standards development is progressing slower than the evolution of security challenges. Therefore it is  necessary to keep the level of a standard high to maintain its relevance in time. Technical  subcommittees are then able to fill in the currently relevant security details by means of specifications.  A good example of this approach is seen with the protection profile used in Common Criteria; Annex  B.1 Common Criteria (CC). However, in the current situation the standards and schemes such as  common criteria are present, but the smart grid specific protection profiles (with the exception of the  smart gateway profile defined by BSI) and security use cases addressing the chain of trust are not  available. It will be a challenge and a constant effort to create an environment where the baseline of  security requirements grows with the technological advancements.  Self-certification tools  No pre-certification self-assessment tools have been identified during this analysis. It will be a  challenge to provide self-certification tools because it is difficult to assess beforehand what smart grid  use cases will be implemented, and to what level of detail a toolbox can assist in the implementation  of the use case.  In line with the standardization efforts  The identified certification approaches are aligned with existing standards, used in the Member States,  but there is currently no EU initiative for accomplishing this alignment for the whole smart grid supply  chain. As already mentioned in chapter 4, the smart grid chain of trust involves several standards for  the different smart grid layers. Alignment with several standards might be a challenge because of  possible overlaps amongst standards and of different approaches in meeting the specified security  requirements.  Not a single certifying authority  A single certifying authority should not be a problem while using ISO/IEC organizational frameworks  including IAF, ILAC (please see ”Annex E: Description of accreditation and certification” for an  explanation) and national accreditation bodies. Not having a single scheme framework has  advantages, but a growing number of certification bodies will also cause more administrative  overhead and less control over the quality of the certification bodies and the evaluations they  perform. It will require periodic audits that will have to be paid by one or more of the stakeholders.  Central certification storage  A centralized storage or public site for accessing smart grid certificates is not available. In the case of  Common Criteria, it is maintained by the scheme itself. In the case of an EU based approach, it should  logically be maintained by the EU smart grid security framework owner. Central storage needs to be  maintained and updated to be useful. This cost money that will have to be paid in some form or  another.  Partial certification  There are approaches that result in partial certification, by allowing the choice of what requirements  will be complied to. This however reduces the amount of trust in the scheme in those particular cases  (e.g. common criteria allows for the certification of a specific product configuration to a subset of  requirements).46 It will be a challenge to avoid trust issues regarding partial certification such as it  46 http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2003/03/01/Windows-and-Common-Criteria.aspx  http://redmondmag.com/Articles/2003/03/01/Windows-and-Common-Criteria.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  39  being perceived as a paper exercise. For example, the different levels below Common Criteria EAL4  are more paper exercises then real security tests.  This report also identifies additional challenges which can be found in “Annex I: Additional identified  challenges”.  To summarise, there are numerous gaps and challenges that have been identified during the desktop  exercise performed. Probably the most important one is that there is no single approach that covers  all aspects of smart grid security certification. And even a combination of all schemes could leave gaps  if they are not carefully combined. Additionally there are varying approaches and requirements in  each Member State, and no coordination or harmonisation at European level.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  40  6 Recommendations  This chapter provides an overview of all the recommendations based on the standard analysis, the  current situation in the EU Member States, the desired situation and the gaps and challenges. The  smart grid security certification recommendations refer to most of the challenges described above.  Recommendation 1: Appoint a EU steering committee 47  to coordinate smart grid certification  activities  The European Commission should invite relevant stakeholders from both the public and private sector  and mandate a EU steering committee with the aim to coordinate the EU smart gird certification  activities with the following tasks:   Providing oversight of smart grid security certification, security requirements definition,  and coordination with national schemes.   Enhancing the transparency and the trust of the smart grid certification activities by  disseminating information and good practices on smart grid certification and providing  centralised storage and publication of smart grid certificates together with the national  schemes.   Providing guidance and advice to interested parties on implementation of national  schemes.   Keeping the smart grid certification apparatus up to date regarding the latest threats, by  using feedback from both the public and the private sector and lessons learned during the  certification process.  Owner: The EU Commission should take action to request the formation of this steering committee.  Recommendation 2: Provide guidance and a reference model to implement a chain of trust  The EU steering committee should promote the concept of a chain of trust, similar to that described  in chapter 4.2.1 that provides transparency and increases trust in the supply chain of the smart grid.  A national use-case approach that is aligned with the SG-AM common reference model can be used  as the basis for this activity. It should also have a set of common  high level requirements that are  recognized by all participating EU Member States. This common set of requirements can be amended  by more detailed national requirements that address the specific use case details for a Member State  on top of the commonly agreed ones. (Using SG-IS framework described in chapter 4.2.1)  Owner: The EU steering committee should provide guidance on how to implement smart grid security  certification and the chain of trust.  Recommendation 3: Use of the currently available standards and schemes, and accommodating,  better coordinating and harmonising national approaches  It is recommended that any approach to better harmonised security certification practices should be  easy to implement by combining currently available standards described in section 3.1. This will  facilitate the adoption by Member States and leverage the existing standardization efforts. A mapping  exercise might take place in order to map and position different standards. This activity might take  into account the properties described in section 3.2 together with the smart grid chain of trust.  Owner: The EU steering committee should perform a mapping exercise amongst available standards  and schemes used in the EU.  47 A voluntary committee is recommended.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  41  Recommendation 3a: The steering committee should advise the Member States on how to  map their preferred standard/scheme to theSG-AM  Chapter 4.4 provides a mapping  of security certification schemes, related to the chain of trust  model, to the SG-AM.  Owner: The EU steering committee should undertake to provide guidance and advice to  Member States on how to implement the smart grid security certification framework.  Recommendation 4: Promote international recognition of schemes  Existing recognition agreements like SOG-IS (see section 3.4.6) should be utilised to create  international requirements, and an international framework for certification.  Owner: The EU steering committee should ensure that certification schemes used, can operate at  international level.  Recommendation 4a: Align with European accreditation bodies  Each Member State should use the European accreditation bodies to recogniseits national  scheme according to the EU reference model and use agreements like SOG-IS MRA for  recognition of security certification bodies. This will ensure there is not a single certifying  authority, and the process remains impartial (see annexes E and H).  Owner: The Member States should use certification schemes that are recognised by European  accreditation bodies. This should also be a requirement of the framework.  Recommendation 5: Promote validation that is commensurate with the risk appetite involved in  each use case.  Conformity testing, functional testing and Interoperability testing can be used to provide assurance  that specific security requirements are met. Depending on the potential criticality of the security risk,  in case of non conformance with requirements, it can be decided to perform first, second or third  party assessments. However, in practice, only third party certification is seen as trustworthy for most  cyber security schemes and is therefore recommended. Controls should talso ake into account the  size of the certified entity and its capability to carry out background checks; it should also be in line  with the risk assessment results.  Owner: The EU steering committee should promote a risk based approach to ensure the certification  effort is in line with the risk appetite involved in the in scope use case.  Recommendation 5a: Ensure proper security levels for use cases  The Member States should make sure that the level of security is explicit for each certificate.  The matching of security certificate levels to a use case should be facilitated by the EU  steering committee.  Owner: The Member States should perform a risk assessment to ensure that national use  case risk levels are clear, and the technical committees should match the proper assessment  levels to each risk level.  Recommendation 6: Facilitate flexibility to update profiles so they can cope with the fast moving  security landscape  In principle, technical committees should develop national profiles covering all possible smart grid use  cases. The profiles can then be updated more frequently than the schemes or standards. Any activity  towards harmonisation should provide enough flexibility for the security requirements in the profiles  to evolve over time and be able to cope with a changing security and threat landscape. Furthermore,  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  42  updates in schemes and profiles should be announced so that they can be incorporated in the other  national profiles. This way the maturity48 of all national schemes can evolve over time.  Owner: The EU working group should ensure the maintenance of the profiles so they keep up to date  with current technology developments and announce updates to the Member States.  Recommendation 7: Use national profiles as detailed specifications of international  standards to cover the specific national use cases and nationally supported test and  certification methods  The national profiles should reflect the national smart grid use cases’ risk. The profile should refer to  standards for details, amend them or expand on them to provide the flexibility to incorporate national  requirements in an international base. The profile should contain test procedures for the national  specific requirements, and provide required testing depth for the national use cases aligned with the  international SG-IS framework risk levels.  Owner: The Member States wanting to implement smart grid security certification will have to create  national profiles containing the details for their national use cases.  Recommendation 8: Use technical committees in collaboration with the European energy  associations to create European profiles  The European Commission should support the definition of European wide security requirements. To  this direction, European Commission should invite the private sector for cutting edge technology  specific requirements and guidance in the form of technical committees, to amend slow moving  standards with detailed European profiles. The profiles should be created by Tecnhical Communities’  subgroups with EU wide scope and in collaboration with smart grid relevant associations (like ESMIG  and EURELECTRIC), but they can be based on the published national initiatives (like the smart  gateway profile and the CPA49 security characteristic).  Owner: The European Commission will have to support expert groups to set up technical committees  to create profiles for the technical details for the national use cases, where other national schemes  or national endorsed international standards can be used as input if needed.  Recommendation 9: Provide official third party certification and self-assessment tools for pre- assessment  The EU steering committee should encourage operational communities to provide tools that will help  the adoption of the framework, and will make it attractive for industry to implement. Additionally, the  national technical committees should assist the industry with pre-assessment tools to facilitate  national compliance.  Owner: The EU working group should encourage the provision of tools in respect to the framework,  while the national technical committees should provide pre-assessment tools for specific schemes.  Recommendation 10: Promote compliance and harmonization as economic advantage and a cost  reduction measure  The European Commission and the Member States should promote commercial advantages for the  private sector (e.g. ease of conformace assessment; lower insurance premiums, brand recognition) to  endorse conformity assessment practices. As already demonstrated, lowering the cost is one of the  48 In this particular context, maturilty reflects the ability of a certification scheme to contain security objectives  which meet the latest cyber security threats.  49 Commercial Product Assurance, see section 3.4.2  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  43  most outstanding needs of the users. Harmonisation is considered as a major contributor to lowering  the cost of certification together with the shared responsibility and risk based approach.  Owner: The European Commission and the Member States should promote the advantages of better  harmonised and coordinated smart grid certification practices.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  44  7 Conclusions  Below is a visualised summary of the key recommendations presented. The figure provides the context  of where the smart grid certificate applies, based on a use case. The certificate needs to indicate what  component, or components are being certificated, and what other certificates are used to obtain a  chain of trust. The interpretation of the figure is provided with an example of an asset owner who  wants to provide a smart grid device (e.g. meter) according to the harmonised security certification  practices presented in this report.  Each device, will, at least, have to comply with the national use case for the Member State it intends  to supply the device to. This does not mean it cannot comply to other Member States’ uses cases, but  for certification for a specific Member State, it will need to focus on that specific use case. The national  specific use case can be described by the SG-AM model. The SG-AM model can then be used as a basis  to create the chain of trust model (As described in section 4.2.1 - Certification and the chain of trust).  This chain of trust model can then be used to identify the needed national requirements profile and  national certification scheme to create the chain of trust for this use case, and will indicate the levels  of security that the asset owner will have to provide aligned with the risk involved as indicated by the  SG-IS framework risk assessment as described in section 4.2.1.  The resulting national scheme will have to be submitted to the EU steering committee for  administration by the technical committee that created the scheme. The national scheme will  normally be created by a national technical committee consisting of stakeholders like the relevant  member state authority(ies), solution providers, user associations and national certification bodies.  They will have to deploy a SG-IS framework aligned methodology on the national use-case, and can  get advice by the overseeing EU steering committee for correct implementation. The developed  national scheme could for example, indicate the need for a certificate for secure development and  production for the creation of a chain of trust on the component level. Depending on if the  manufacturer already has this certificate for the same level or higher than indicated by the risk  assessment, the available certificates can be used as proof for the chain of trust. When all certificates  are obtained, they can be delivered to the EU steering committee for review and publication.  After publication, it is possible to easily assess for any other use case, if the level of security of the  certified meter is sufficient for the usage in the use-case at hand. Provided the evaluated national  profile matches the profile requirements of the use-case. Over time, these national profiles should  move toward international profiles to minimize re-certification efforts due to additional requirements.  Additionally, European technical communities could provide international EU based profiles that could  be the common denominator of the national ones so as to ensure: a) the participation of the Member  State; and b) flexibility of the Member States to define extra national requirements on top of the  European ones.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  45  Figure 12  - Smart grid certification process  The key component towards more harmonised and better collaborated certification practices is a  steering committee that is recognised by the EU which provides a focus point for smart grid security  certification related activities. This body will need to provide the guidance and general approach on  smart grid certification. This approach should be aligned with the SG-AM model, the SG-IS framework  and the currently available initiatives and certification schemes. The body will also provide a central  point for the publication of smart grid security certificates.  Furthermore, it will assist the Member States in creating their national mapping according to the EU  smart grid security certification guidelines, and will ensure that national use cases and schemes are  kept up-to date, and certificates are published. Finally, it will ensure that the national approaches are  mostly based on EU wide profiles, or at least harmonised, as much as possible and common  approaches can eventually migrate from a more national approach to a more common set of EU  requirements that can be endorsed by all Member States. This way the desired situation can be  created where there is a common EU baseline, while national requirements that cannot be  harmonised are still addressed.

To become a  certification body, the organisation needs to be certified by an accreditation body.  Certification Certification refers to the confirmation of certain characteristics of an object, person, or  organization. This confirmation is often, but not always, provided by some form of  external review, education, assessment, or audit.  Certification body A certification body is an organisation which is accredited by an accreditation body. The  organisation has demonstrated their competence, impartiality and performance  capabilities. When applicable, their test labs and calibration laboratories where tested  against international recognised standards.  Common criteria The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (abbreviated as  Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for computer  security certification.  Declaration of  conformity  A signed declaration to indicate that the product meets the requirements of the  directive(s) which apply to it. For the declaration to be truly meaningful the signatory  should also have the authority to commit the resources required to ensure that the  conformity assessment process is properly completed.  First-party  certification  In first-party certification, an individual or organization providing the goods or services  offers assurances that it meets certain claims  Notified Body A Notified Body, in the European Union, is an organization that has been accredited by  a Member State to assess whether a product meets certain preordained standards.  Second-party  certification  In second-party certification, an association to which the individual or organization  belongs to provides the assurance  Smart grid  environment  The whole environment in which smart grid components are implemented, however this  can be a hybrid system in which legacy SCADA systems are part of  Smart energy system A specific network, dedicated developed as a smart energy system. Old fashioned legacy  system are not part of a smart energy system  Third-party  certification  Third-party certification involves an independent assessment declaring that specified  requirements pertaining to a product, person, process or management system have  been met  Technical committee A group responsible for development and revision of any document or documents  emanating from a Technical Committee project.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  48  Annex B:  Schemes applicable to the smart grid domain  B.1 Common Criteria (CC)  Scope  Common Criteria is an industry-independent / product independent scheme. At present, certified  products belong to a wide array of categories going from access control systems to operating systems  and biometric systems and devices. Common Criteria offer pre-defined evaluation assurance levels  (EAL), corresponding to increasing assurance efforts and vulnerability testing. A certification roughly  consists of two different activities:   Defining and assessing a consistent set of security requirements against a given security  problem   Assessing that a product is compliant with these security requirements.  These two activities are defined in ISO/IEC 15408 (also called Common Criteria for Information  Technology Security Evaluation) and the associated Common Criteria Evaluation Methodology (CEM).  The Common Criteria allow the creation of a Protection Profile (PP) which is a set of security  requirements for a type of product which may support many different implementations. The security  requirements are derived from a set of security objectives that cover the security problem definition  consisting of threats, assumptions and policies.  Common Criteria is used as the basis for a Government driven certification scheme and typically  evaluations are conducted for the use in Federal Government agencies and critical infrastructure.  The Participants of Common Criteria share the following objectives:   To ensure that evaluations of Information Technology (IT) products and protection profiles  are performed to high and consistent standards and are seen to contribute significantly to  confidence in the security of those products and profiles   To ensure that evaluations of Information Technology (IT) products and protection profiles  are performed to high and consistent standards and are seen to contribute significantly to  confidence in the security of those products and profiles;   To improve the availability of evaluated, security-enhanced IT products and protection  profiles;   To eliminate the burden of duplicating evaluations of IT products and protection profiles;   To continuously improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the evaluation and  certification/validation process for IT products and protection profiles.  Organization  The scheme is maintained under and international arrangement and endorsed by a group of national  authorities (Certification Bodies). A Certification body (called CB hereafter) is generally a  governmental agency or bureau of the national defence ministry.  Any Common Criteria evaluation relies on competent and independent licensed laboratories. These  Evaluators (also called laboratories or ITSEF: Information Security Evaluation Facility) are accredited  by a national standardization entity, and licensed or otherwise approved by the national Certification  Body.   In Canada, the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) under Program for the Accreditation of  Laboratories (PALCAN) accredits Common Criteria Evaluation Facilities (CCEF)   In France, the Comité français d'accréditation (COFRAC) accredits Common Criteria evaluation  facilities, commonly called Centre d'évaluation de la sécurité des technologies de  l'information (CESTI). Evaluations are done according to norms and standards specified by the  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  49  Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information (ANSSI). ANSSI is also performing  the licencing of the CESTI to attest that they have the appropriate security skills.   In the UK the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) accredits Commercial Evaluation  Facilities (CLEF)   In the US, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredits Common Criteria Testing Laboratories  (CCTL)   In Germany, the Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI)   In Spain, the National Cryptologic Center (CCN) accredits Common Criteria Testing  Laboratories operating in the Spanish Scheme. Protection file for smart meter Gateways   The German Ministry of Economy (BMWi) has mandated the Federal Agency for Security in  Information technology (BSI) to develop a protection file for smart meter Gateways. The  protection profile is based on Common Criteria. The use of certified Gateways is mandated  for all smart meters.   The German protection profile creates security on a very high level (CC level EAL 4+). The  problem using this protection profile is that accreditation is not internationally accepted and  the CC Level is higher than other countries accept.   Norway and Sweden accepted Common Criteria as recognised standard for certification.  Evaluation methodology  The Common Criteria consists of the following catalogues:   CC-Part 1: presents the conceptual framework of the methodology and is intended to  developers as well as evaluators.   CC-Part 2: describes a comprehensive series of standardized security (functional)  requirements   CC-Part 3: lists a comprehensive series of standardized security assurance requirements,  which describe how a product should be evaluated.   CEM: which defines the minimum actions to be performed by an evaluator in order to conduct  a CC evaluation  B.2 CPA  Scope  CPA1 (Commercial Product Assurance) is a national GB scheme intended for commercial security  products. CPA is defined and maintained by CESG (Communications Electronic Security Group – the  Certification Body), which directly accredits evaluation laboratories (CPA Test Labs). The scheme aims  at demonstrating compliance to national requirements, while rationalising legacy national schemes  and maintaining the value of previously issued certificates.  CPA covers only specified types of products/features of products, while Common Criteria is industry /  product independent. Examples of products covered by CPA are data sanitation, VPN’s, firewalls …  Other types of products are in progress, such as smartphones or hardware security modules.  CPA offers one assurance level: Foundation Grade. This grade is intended for COTS (Commercial Of- The-Shelf) products used to process information classified as official in the new Government  Classification Policy.  The two other tiers of this classification policy (secret and top-secret) require bespoke equipment to  be evaluated under the CAPS (CESG Assisted Products Service) scheme. CAPS evaluation is performed  by CESG itself, instead of commercial laboratories such as in CPA.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  50  Organization  As mentioned above, CESG is GB Certification Body. It accredits evaluation laboratories and maintains  CPA. Evaluation laboratories are called CPA Test Labs. Such laboratories perform evaluation of  products for foundation grade certifications only. Evaluation laboratories mainly use evidence created  by the developer, but can be led to create specific tests in order to check requirements left untested  by the developer. Furthermore, cryptographic evaluation cannot be performed by the developer; it  must be performed by an independent entity, if not by the evaluation laboratory.  Evaluation methodology  The evaluation methodology relies mainly on Security Characteristics (SCs) and the CPA Build  standard.  The Security Characteristics define the expected security features of the product; they are focused on  functions and are product specific (e.g. specific for data sanitation, VPN’s, firewalls, etc.). Security  Characteristics play a similar role to the Protection Profiles in CC. In the beginning of an evaluation,  the evaluation laboratory refines the applicable Security Characteristics into Tailored Security  Characteristics. Tailored Security Characteristics play a similar role as Security Targets in CC.  The CPA Build Standard defines the assurance requirements for product development and breaks into  twelve high-level requirements addressing four themes:   Configuration Management   Flaw remediation   Testing   Developer security measures  Such requirements are somewhat similar to CC components listed in CC-Part3.  B.3 ISO/IEC 27001  ISO/IEC 27001 specifies the normative requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining and  continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS) within the context of the  organization. ISO/IEC 27001 formally specifies a management system that is intended to bring  information security under explicit management control. ISO 27001 provides a framework for  certification. ISO/IEC 27001 is not especially focussed on smart grid, however an (energy) organisation  can be certified to be compliant to this international standard.  ISO/IEC 27002 provides an outline or good practice guide for cybersecurity management. It includes  guidelines for an organisation to obtain certification to the ISO 27001 standard. Once obtained, the  certification lasts three years. Intermediate audits may be carried out during those three years,  depending on the auditing organisation.  System operators in Germany and the UK have to be ISO/IEC 27001 compliant.  B.4 IASME  IASME is a UK-based standard for information assurance at small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs). It  provides criteria and certification for small-to-medium business cyber security readiness. It also allows  small to medium business to provide potential and existing customers and clients with an accredited  measurement of the cyber security posture of the enterprise and its protection of personal/business  data.  IASME was established to enable businesses with capitalization of 1.2 billion pounds or less (1.5 billion  Euros; 2 billion US dollars) to achieve an accreditation similar to ISO 27001 but with reduced  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  51  complexity, cost, and administrative overhead (specifically focused on SME in recognition that it is  difficult for small cap businesses to achieve and maintain ISO 27001).  The cost of the certification is progressively graduated based upon the employee population of the  SME (e.g., 10 & fewer, 11 to 25, 26 - 100, 101 - 250 employees); the certification can be based upon a  self-assessment with an IASME questionnaire or by a third-party professional assessor. Some  insurance companies reduce premiums for cyber security related coverage based upon the IASME  certification.  B.5 ISO 9001  ISO 9000 is a series of standards, developed and published by the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO), that define, establish, and maintain a quality assurance system for  manufacturing and service industries. The standards are available through national standards bodies.  ISO 9000 deals with the fundamentals of quality management systems, including the eight  management principles upon which the family of standards is based. ISO 9001 deals with the  requirements that organizations wishing to meet the standard must fulfil.  ISO9001 provides an auditing possibility, but nothing else, as it is mainly about properly documenting  what actions are performed.  Third-party certification bodies provide independent confirmation that organizations meet the  requirements of ISO 9001. Over a million organizations worldwide are independently certified, making  ISO 9001 one of the most widely used management tools in the world today.  B.6 IEC62443  ISA/IEC-62443 is a series of standards, technical reports, and related information that define  procedures for implementing electronically secure Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS).  This guidance applies to end-users (i.e. asset owner), system integrators, security practitioners, and  control systems manufacturers responsible for manufacturing, designing, implementing, or managing  industrial automation and control systems.  These documents were originally referred to as ANSI/ISA-99 or ISA99 standards, as they were created  by the International Society for Automation (ISA) and publicly released as American National  Standards Institute (ANSI) documents. In 2010, they were renumbered to be the ANSI/ISA-62443  series. This change was intended to align the ISA and ANSI document numbering with the  corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards.  ISA/IEC-62443 is a set of standards and technical reports defining functional requirements and  guidelines for implementing electronically secure ICS implementations. ISA/IEC 62334 focuses on all  ecosystem players and consists out of 13 distinct parts (standards) organized in four categories: (i)  General, (ii) Policies and Procedures, (iii) System, and (iv) Component.  1. The first (top) category includes common or foundational information such as concepts,  models and terminology. Also included are work products that describe security metrics and  security life cycles for IACS.  2. The second category of work products targets the Asset Owner. These address various aspects  of creating and maintaining an effective IACS security program.  3. The third category includes work products that describe system design guidance and  requirements for the secure integration of control systems. Core in this is the zone and conduit  design model.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  52  4. The fourth category includes work products that describe the specific product development  and technical requirements of control system products. This is primarily intended for control  product vendors, but can be used by integrator and asset owners for to assist in the  procurement of secure products.  Two parts are currently published and belong to the System category:  3-1 “Security technologies for  IACS” and 3-3 “System security requirements and security levels” defining the Security Levels (SL) 1 to  4 in an ICS environment.  Two parts are published under review: 2-1 “Requirements for an IACS security management system”  is based on ISO/IEC 27001(2) and belongs to the Policies and Procedures category.  1-1 defines the  “Terminology, concepts and models”.  Seven parts are under development and two parts are planned.  B.7 ISO/IEC 19790  Scope  These two standards are the ISO counterpart of the US NIST FIPS 140-2, Security requirements for  cryptographic modules and the derived test requirements. As such, ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759  are applicable to validate whether the cryptographic core of any security product is properly  implementing an approved suite of cryptographic protocols, modes of operation and key sizes, while  protecting this implementation and the critical security parameters, such as keys, in accordance to the  design and specification requirements laid out in the standards. There are four levels of security  defined, and ISO/IEC 19790 contemplates a variety of possible implementations, both software and  hardware.  Figure 13 - IEC 62443 overview  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  53  Organization  Compliance to ISO/IEC 19790 is an open matter, in accordance with the existing European regulations  dealing with product compliance. Since this or an equivalent harmonised standards not referred in  any European Directive, it is not subject to the usual requirements for Certification Bodies to operate  under Notified Bodies, but Certification Bodies for ISO/IEC 19790 are simply subject to accreditation  under the applicable national accreditation entity.  The European co-operation for Accreditation (EA), and more specifically, the EA Multilateral  Agreement (EA MLA) ensure cross-European recognition of ISO/IEC 19790 product compliance  certificates.  Evaluation methodology  ISO/IEC 19790 and ISO/IEC 24759 are conformity testing standards, so products are tested for  compliance against the applicable and very specific requirements, leaving out much of the subjectivity  required for security evaluation. The requirements are set in ISO/IEC 19790, and the derived tests are  specified in ISO/IEC 24759.  The conformity testing of the cryptographic protocols demand the existence of a reference  implementation, and a standardized protocol to verify the correctness of the algorithm  implementation, that allows a quick verification process. The requirements that apply to the  cryptographic module need to be re-instantiated by the tester for each product.  The whole process is usually faster and cheaper than an equivalent security evaluation.  B.8 CSPN  Scope  The CSPN is a French scheme defined by ANSSI that aims at providing a first-level security certification  for IT security products. Its scope is similar to Common Criteria, with the following specificities:   The assurance process is simplified   The evaluation is focused on vulnerability analysis   The actors are committed to a given evaluation duration and cost  IT products can currently apply to CSPN if they belong to a specific list of domains (e.g. data deletion,  firewalls, secure communication, etc.). This list is regularly updated to address new needs.  It should be noted that standard CSPN excludes products too complex to be evaluated in an expected  duration and cost and products including non-standard cryptography.  Organization and evaluation methodology  The process is similar to the Common Criteria process. Instead of applying CC security and assurance  requirements (see CC description) the developer uses guidelines described in CSPN. CSPN also has  common features with CPA, especially the domain-specific approach.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  54  Annex C:  Standards and certification schemes  The following articles, standards, schemes, services and organisations have been reviewed in the  research related to Europeans smart grid security certification schemes:  Articles and investigations   ENISA: Protecting industrial control systems, Annex III   ENISA Appropriate security measures for Smart Grids Final   Security_Certification-A_critical_review_2010-10-06-ICSJWG   ahmadi-paper_gil Lpdf - The Need for Security Testing and Conformance Standards in the  smart grid   The Escorts and Viking projects   http://www.isacahouston.org/documents/RedTigerSecurity- NERCCIPandotherframeworks.pdf   CRISALIS - Critical Infrastructure Security Analysis  Security and/or smart grid standards and schemes   M/490-SG-IS   WIB M2784 PCS Vendor Security v2NISTIR 7628   NIST 800-53   NIST 800-115   ISA/IEC62443   IEC61850   IEC60870-5   IEC62351   Common Criteria/IEC 15408 framework   CESG CPA framework   NERC-CIP   ISO27001/2/5/9   DIN SPEC 27009 (2012-04)   US-SCADA Test bed specification from DHS-INL Idaho  Smart grid security services   Wurldtech Achilles certification   ISCI ISASecure EDSA Certification   Exida's Integrity Certification  Current stocktaking lists the following additional sources and initiatives eligible for investigation:   www.syssec-project.eu   ENCS Topsectoren project   BSI group (German)   Sans institute   Digital bond   EPRI organisation   CPNI (UK) best practices   SERTIT, CSEC, UL, Infineon, ERNCIP, NEI   CEN,/CENELEC/ETSI   Smart Grid Coordination Group, WG Smart Grid Information Security   Smart Grid task Force Expert Group 2 Smart Meters coordination Group  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  55   SG-TF EG2, intermediate results of JRC study on privacy seals   CRISALIS,   ENCS,   ESMIG,   NERC-CIP/NIST,   Smart meter DLMS,   Dutch/Belgium IEC60870-5-104 User Group,   Utility Communications Architecture (UCA) International User Group for IEC61850   USEF (Universal Smart Energy Framework) - Smart Energy Collective  Based on the provided model of what needs to be certified (the SG-AM and chain of trust model  described in section “4.2.1 Certification and the chain of trust”) a desktop study has been performed  to create an inventory of available schemes that are applicable to the smart grid domain. From a list  of initiatives, best practices, standards and schemes, only the items that were in line with the needs  described in chapter 2 have been selected. The selection criteria included answering the following  questions;  1. It is a scheme that is actually applicable to smart grid devices? (meaning that standards regarding  general IT, or person certification are out of scope)  2. It is scheme that applies to cyber security? (meaning that safety and physical security is out of  scope)  3. It is a scheme that can support certification, audits and/or legislation? (meaning that best  practices and informative standards were excluded, as they are too vague)  4. Is the scheme is applicable in the EU? (meaning that schemes not used in EU were excluded)  5. Is the scheme supported by public and private bodies (meaning biased or vendor based schemes  were excluded)  6. Is the scheme superseded or incorporated by another applicable scheme?  The following schemes have therefore been excluded;  Standard / scheme Exclusion Reason  1.  Borg  Not applicable for smart grid  2.  TC57 IEC61850/IEC60870/DLMS  Not cyber security  3.

There is a standard called  ISO 17067 (Annex F: ISO/IEC 17067 - fundamentals of product certification and guidelines for product  certification schemes) that provides properties for product certification schemes. But this is not a good  base for a mapping exercise, as it does not address the differentiating properties like practical  implementation, and market reception of a scheme. Therefore a different method has been used to  map the schemes. The method used is based on a textual analysis of the information publicly available  for each scheme, amended by the practical knowledge of the authors’ team about the schemes.  Additionally, the ENISA research for cloud computing certification has performed similar research  regarding cloud computing schemes50, and SM-CG has provided a document comparing some of the  schemes found51 that has been used for input as well.  To be able to compare the different schemes, an analysis has been made regarding the available  schemes by comparing the following properties:  D.1.1 Administrative details  Name:  Type:  Group/initiative/organisation: Group, initiative or organisation responsible for the creation of the  standard, guideline (e.g. ANSI/ISA), or regulatory document.  Related documents: Other identified standards, guidelines, or regulatory documents, not necessarily  related to cyber security, which have a strong relationship with the document being described.  D.1.2 Geographic relevance  Geographic relevance: Worldwide, European, Subgroup of European Member States, and National.  D.1.3 Current maintenance and activity of the program working group  Status: draft/final, version 1,2,3?  Publication date: how actual is it, is it ongoing?  D.1.4 Program scope definition  Description:  Target audience: Specifies which, among the stakeholder types identified in this study  Addressed Industry: All, Generic (ICS in general), SCADA, automation, chemistry, electricity  distribution/transportation, nuclear generation, water, railway transportation, oil and gas  distribution, etc.  Technical relevance of the methodology   The certification bodies facilitate coordination with technical communities to ensure technical  relevance.   The methodology covers generic security functionalities like: “Security audit, logs, events &  alarms”, “Role based access and account management”, “Cryptography and key  management”, etc.   The methodology or recognition agreement defines an assurance continuity process after  product updates.   The methodology supports multiple security/assurance levels.  Product testing   The certification scheme requires that functional testing takes place by and/or is reviewed by  an evaluator. During functional testing, the functions of a product are tested; this includes  50 https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  51 SMCG Smart Meters Co-ordination Group 2 Privacy and Security approach - part II; Annual report 2013  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/cloud-computing-certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  58  security function testing, test of the user guidance, testing of protection against misuse,  regression testing (re-testing after product changes), etc.   The certification scheme requires evaluators to perform vulnerability testing. Examples of  such tests are penetration testing, reviewing the security architecture, testing vulnerabilities  based on source code, etc. Within this context “partially covered” means that only basic  vulnerability testing is performed without for example penetration testing.  The heaviness of the program   Resources needed,   Certification delay  Maintenance scheme definition for the program   Committing to flaw remediation obligations, delays and information provision to end-users:   The certification scheme requires a procedure for providing information to end-users on  identified flaws and security incidents. Furthermore, it requires that timely action is taken for  flaw remediation.  D.1.5 National and international accreditation body recognition  Recognition by accreditation bodies (ISO, IEC, other?) National and international;   Necessary steps to instate a certification body (national and/or European)   Ability to be used to generate consensus between parties  Definition of CB accreditation criteria   The recognition agreement organization defines requirements for accreditation of individual  Certification Bodies.   The recognition agreement organization defines criteria for periodic assessment of  Certification Bodies’ continued compliance to accreditation requirements.  D.1.6 Ability to evolve to a European certification scheme, from the current situation  Ability to customize and adoption of the program for other applications. The certification scheme  applies to a wider product scope, and is able to grow. Has it been done? What needs to be changed,  are there issues identified?  D.1.7 Program stakeholder trust  Public private participation  Information provision to stakeholders   The recognition agreement organization publishes certificates and provides information on  accredited certification bodies.  Use of proven methods and maintaining skills   The certification scheme demands that configuration management requirements are put in  place. This ensures consistency of a product's performance, functional and physical attributes  with its requirements. An example of such a requirement is “All constituent components that  are used to create the finished product must be uniquely identified.”   The certification scheme requires that third-party tools and components are properly  managed. For example through procedures for acquisition, reception and testing, installation,  patching, etc. of third-party tools.   The certification scheme requires that developers are properly trained on security related  subjects.   The certification scheme demands that sufficient user guidance is being provided to actors  responsible for operation / administration / maintenance of the system.   The certification scheme requires a flaw remediation procedure tracking (amongst others)  product flaws, their effects, corrective measures, etc.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  59   The certification scheme requires a documented lifecycle model (formalization of product  specification design documentation, requirements traceability, etc.) providing for the  necessary quality control over the development and maintenance of the product.  Defining security measures for the premises of developers / OAM actors   The certification scheme demands that developers take measures to secure their premises  (e.g. through access control, human resource security …)   The certification scheme required that user guidance is provided to secure the product during  operation/administration/maintenance.

Through the application of national and  international standards, government, procurers and consumers can have confidence in the calibration  and test results, inspection reports and certifications provided.  Accreditation bodies are established in many countries with the primary purpose of ensuring that  conformity assessment bodies are subject to oversight by an authoritative body.  Accreditation bodies, which have been evaluated by peers as competent, sign arrangements that  enhance the acceptance of products and services across national borders, thereby creating a  framework to support international trade through the removal of technical barriers.  Different countries may use different security standards, best practices and frameworks regarding  Cyber Security. This section provides an overview of the accreditation and certification approach used  in the European Union.  E.1 Existing accreditation bodies  Although this report focusses on the European Union and common practices used in the EU, DNV GL  took international (worldwide) accepted certification approaches in account.  E.1.1 International recognised accreditation Fora  On the uppermost top level of the certification approach you will find the international (world-wide)  organised accreditation fora. The national bodies are all committed to one or more international  forum.  The three most important international accreditation fora are:  1. International Accreditation Forum (IAF, Quebec, Canada)  2. International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC, Rhodes, Australia)  3. European co-operation for Accreditation (EA, Paris, France)  1: IAF Accreditation arrangements are managed by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF), in the  fields of management systems, products, services, personnel and other similar programmes of  conformity assessment, and the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), in the  field of laboratory and inspection accreditation.  2: The ILAC Arrangement is the culmination of 22 years of intensive work. The ILAC Arrangement  provides significant technical underpinning to international trade. The key to the Arrangement is the  global network of accredited testing and calibration laboratories and inspection bodies that are  assessed and recognised as being competent by ILAC Arrangement signatory accreditation bodies. On  2 November 2000, ILAC's 36 full members, consisting of laboratory accreditation bodies from 28  economies worldwide, signed a mutual recognition arrangement (the ILAC Arrangement) in  Washington DC, to promote the acceptance of technical test and calibration data for exported goods.  The Arrangement came into effect on 31 January 2001 and was extended in October 2012 to include  the accreditation of inspection bodies  3: EA exists to coordinate and lead the European accreditation infrastructure to allow the results of  conformity assessment services in one Member State to be accepted by Regulators and the market  place in another Member State without further examination, for the benefit of the European  community and the global economy.  E.1.2 National accreditation bodies  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  70  To reach the level of certification body, the organisation should be evaluated by a national  accreditation body. The mentioned accreditation bodies below are member of EA, ILAC and IAF.  Some examples of European accreditation bodies are:  1. United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS, Feltham Middlesex, UK)  2. Raad voor Accreditatie (RvA, Utrecht, the Netherlands)  3. Deutsche Akkreditierungsstelle GmbH (DAkkS)  The full list of accreditation bodies that are recognized is publicly available at;  http://www.iaf.nu/articles/IAF_MEMBERS_SIGNATORIES/4  UKAS is licensed by the Department for Business Innovation & Skills (BIS) to use and confer the  national accreditation symbols (formerly national accreditation marks) which symbolise Government  recognition of the accreditation process. UKAS accreditation provides an assurance of the  competence, impartiality and integrity of conformity assessment bodies.  With the law on the appointment of the national accreditation body, RvA is appointed as the Dutch  national accreditation body and is entrusted with the operation of accreditation as a public authority  activity.  Accreditation bodies such as UKAS and RvA are national entities responsible for national accreditation  of a certification body. UKAS is member of the EA. RvA is member of EA, ILAC and IAF.  Figure 14 - Certification top down approach  E.2 Internationally recognized certification bodies  On a national level certification bodies are then accredited to issue certificates for certification  schemes they are accredited for. Certification bodies are free to choose their way of working, within  the context of the subject of study.  Certification bodies are, or were in the past, often governmental related organisations. In the EU there  are some widely known organisations working in the field of testing and certifying.   Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik (BSI, Germany)   TüV (Germany)  International  Accreditation Forums  National Accreditation  Bodies  Certification bodies  Subject of certification  http://www.iaf.nu/articles/IAF_MEMBERS_SIGNATORIES/4  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  71   Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG, UK)   Brightside (London, UK)   DNV GL (Høvik, Norway, DNV GL Energy, Arnhem, the Netherlands)  Figure 15on the next page provides an overview of the accreditation and certification approach in the  European Union.  The International Accreditation Forum (IAF) and International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation  (ILAC) oversee the accreditation bodies globally. Accreditation bodies such as UKAS and RvA are  national entities responsible for national accreditation of a certification body. Certification bodies such  as BSI, TuV and CESG are then accredited to issue certificates for certification schemes they are  accredited for. Certification schemes such as common criteria are maintained by a scheme owner.  Figure 15 - Overview of hierarchy in accreditation and certification  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  72  E.2.1 Certification organisations  Accreditation bodies and certification bodies use international standards to fulfil their jobs. On one  hand this is necessary to understand their way of working, on the other hand using international  standards creates worldwide acceptation for a certificate. A certificate issued in the Netherlands for a  German product will be accepted in France, the UK and even in Australia.  Figure 16on the next page provides a description of how the international structure of accreditation  and certification organisations is shaped for the IEC and ISO standards.  A test or assessment according to a scheme is executed by an independent test laboratory such as  DNV GL, TuV or Brightside, in case of common criteria.  Figure 16 - Overview ISO/IEC certification organisation  Figure 17describes an interaction diagram between different stakeholders during an evaluation. It  should be noted that the evaluation facility evaluates the product, but the certification body issues  the certificate, to ensure integrity of the parties involved.

 b) the requirements against which the products are evaluated, by reference to standards or  other normative documents; where it is necessary to elaborate upon the requirements to  remove ambiguity, the explanations should be formulated by competent people and should  be made available to all interested parties; NOTE Further guidance on how to formulate  specified requirements is provided in ISO/IEC 17007.  c) the selection of the activities (see Table 2) appropriate to the purpose and the scope of the  scheme;

 v) retention of records by scheme owner and certification bodies.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  75  Table 2 – building a product certification scheme  F.3 Types of schemes  F.3.1 Scheme type 1a - One or more samples of the product are subjected to the determination  activities  In this scheme, one or more samples of the product are subjected to the determination activities. A  certificate of conformity or other statement of conformity (e.g. a letter) is issued for the product type,  the characteristics of which are detailed in the certificate or a document referred to in the certificate.  Subsequent production items are not covered by the certification body’s attestation of conformity.  The samples are representative of subsequent production items which could be referred to by the  manufacturer as being manufactured in accordance with the certified type. The certification body may  grant to the manufacturer the right to use the type certificate or other statement of conformity (e.g.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  76  letter) as a basis for the manufacturer to declare that subsequent production items conform to the  specified requirements.  F.3.2 Scheme type 1b - This scheme type involves the certification of a whole batch of products  This scheme type involves the certification of a whole batch of products, following selection and  determination as specified in the scheme. The proportion to be tested, which can include testing of  all the units in the batch (100% testing), would be based, for example, on the homogeneity of the  items in the batch and the application of a sampling plan, where appropriate. If the outcome of the  determination, review and decision is positive, all items in the batch may be described as certified and  may have a mark of conformity affixed, if that is included in the scheme.  F.3.3 Scheme type 2 - Periodically taking samples of the product from the market  The surveillance part of this scheme involves periodically taking samples of the product from the  market and subjecting them to determination activities to check that items produced subsequent to  the initial attestation fulfil the specified requirements.  While this scheme may identify the impact of the distribution channel on conformity, the resources it  requires can be extensive. Also, when significant nonconformities are found, effective corrective  measures may be limited since the product has already been distributed to the market.  F.3.4 Scheme type 3 - This scheme involves periodically taking samples of the product from the  point of production  The surveillance part of this scheme involves periodically taking samples of the product from the point  of production and subjecting them to determination activities to check that items produced  subsequent to the initial attestation fulfil the specified requirements. The surveillance includes  periodic assessment of the production process. This scheme does not provide any indication of the  impact the distribution channel plays on conformity. When serious nonconformities are found, the  opportunity may exist to resolve them before widespread market distribution occurs.  F.3.5 Scheme type 4 - Periodically taking samples of the product from the point of production, or  from the market, or from both  The surveillance part of this scheme allows for the choice between periodically taking samples of the  product from the point of production, or from the market, or from both, and subjecting them to  determination activities to check that items produced subsequent to the initial attestation fulfil the  specified requirements. The surveillance includes periodic assessment of the production process.  This scheme can both indicate the impact of the distribution channel on conformity and provide a  premarket mechanism to identify and resolve serious nonconformities. Significant duplication of  effort may take place for those products whose conformity is not affected during the distribution  process.  F.3.6 Scheme type 5 - Periodically taking samples of the product either from the point of  production, or from the market, or from both  The surveillance part of this scheme allows for the choice between periodically taking samples of the  product either from the point of production, or from the market, or from both, and subjecting them  to determination activities to check that items produced subsequent to the initial attestation fulfil the  specified requirements. The surveillance includes periodic assessment of the production process, or  audit of the management system, or both. The extent to which the four surveillance activities are  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  77  conducted may be varied for a given situation, as defined in the scheme. If the surveillance includes  audit of the management system, an initial audit of the management system will be needed.  F.3.7 Scheme type 6 - This scheme is mainly applicable to certification of services and processes  This scheme is mainly applicable to certification of services and processes. Although services are  considered as being generally intangible, the determination activities are not limited to the evaluation  of intangible elements (e.g. effectiveness of an organization’s procedures, delays and responsiveness  of the management). In some situations, the tangible elements of a service can support the evidence  of conformity indicated by the assessment of processes, resources and controls involved. For example,  inspection of the cleanliness of vehicles for the quality of public transportation. As far as processes  are concerned, the situation is very similar. For example, the determination activities for welding  processes can include testing and inspection of samples of the resultant welds, if applicable. For both  services and processes, the surveillance part of this scheme should include periodic audits of the  management system and periodic assessment of the service or process.  F.4 Scheme owner responsibilities  1. The scheme owner should be a legal entity.  NOTE: A governmental scheme owner is deemed to be a legal entity on the basis of its  governmental status.  2. The scheme owner should be able to take on full responsibility for the objectives, the content  and the integrity of the scheme.  3. The scheme owner should maintain the scheme and provide guidance when required.  4. The scheme owner should set up a structure for the operation and management of the  scheme.  5. The scheme owner should document the content of the scheme.  6. The scheme owner should ensure that the scheme is developed by persons competent in both  technical and conformity assessment aspects.  7. The scheme owner should make arrangements to protect the confidentiality of information  provided by the parties involved in the scheme.  8. The scheme owner should evaluate and manage the risks/liabilities arising from its activities.  NOTE: evaluating risks does not imply risk assessments in accordance with ISO 31000.  9. The scheme owner should have adequate arrangements (e.g. insurance or reserves) to cover  liabilities arising from its activities. Arrangements should be appropriate e.g. for the range of  activities and schemes undertaken and in the geographic regions in which the scheme  operates.  10. The scheme owner should have the financial stability and resources required for it to fulfil its  role in the operation of the scheme.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  78  Annex G:  Conformity assessment and testing  Certification, conformity assessment and testing are commonly used interchangeably. To understand  what certification is, and how it relates to terms such as conformity assessment and testing, this  chapter explains their relation. For a more in depth view, ISO provides a comprehensive overview  online: http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf.  ISO/IEC 17000 defines conformity assessment as a demonstration that specified requirements relating  to a product, process, system, person, or body are fulfilled. A few points to note:   In line with the terminology of ISO 9000, a service is regarded as a particular form of product   The methods for demonstrating conformity include testing, inspection, suppliers’ declarations  of conformity and certification   Specified  requirements  include those  contained  in  suppliers’  or  purchasers’ specifications,  national, regional or international standards or governmental regulations   Accreditation of conformity assessment bodies is included within the definition of conformity  assessment   The term object of conformity assessment, or sometimes just object, is used in the standard  to refer to “product, process, system, person or body”.  Figure 18 - Conformity assessment quality infrastructure  Conformity assessment is often characterized as part of a quality infrastructure. In addition to testing,  inspection and certification, there are other activities which may fall under the umbrella of conformity  assessment and there has been considerable international debate on whether activities such as  accreditation, production of reference materials and conduct of proficiency testing are conformity  assessment activities. Even within the realm of testing, there has been varying opinion on whether  some forms of diagnostic testing, such as pathology services, fit the formal definition of conformity  assessment. In practical terms, however, all of these various activities are part of the everyday world  http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  79  of conformity assessment and are important elements in broader national or regional quality  infrastructures. Some key components in the definition also have related activities, and subsets. For  example, “certification” includes management systems, product and personnel certification. The  concept of “testing” includes the related activities of calibration and measurement.52  Too often “conformity assessment” is taken to mean certification and nothing else. In fact, conformity  assessment can be undertaken by many people, including the supplier of a product or service, its  purchaser and other parties which might have an interest such as insurance companies and regulatory  authorities. It is convenient when talking about conformity assessment to refer to the parties as  follows:   First party (1st party) – the person or organization that provides the object which is being  assessed   Second party (2nd party) – a person or organization that has a user interest in the object   Third party (3rd party) – a person or body that is independent of the person or organization  that provides the object, and of user interests in the object.  In general, the conformity assessment techniques described in this chapter can be carried out by a  1st, 2nd or 3rd party. But a 1st party conformity assessment is perceived as less trustworthy then a 3rd  party assessment. Therefore, in relation to the risk that nonconformity poses, a choice is made to what  parties are allowed to perform the assessment. The SG-IS framework (described in chapter 4.2.1) can  help to decide the risk for a specific scenario and associated assurance level.  G.1.1 Conformity assessment activities  The following items are the most common conformity assessment activities.  Inspection is the examination of a product design, product, process or installation and the  determination of its conformity with specific requirements or, on the basis of professional judgment,  with general requirements. Inspection is often conducted on consignments, for example import  inspection, to ensure that the whole consignment is equivalent to the product sample tested.  Typical inspection institutions are import inspection agencies and general inspection agencies. These  can be public or private agencies and normally compete in the market place.  Testing is the determination of a product’s characteristics against the requirements of the standard.  Testing can vary from a non-destructive evaluation (e.g. X-ray, ultra sound, pressure testing, electrical,  etc., after which the product is still fit for use) to a to-tally destructive analysis (e.g. chemical,  mechanical, physical, microbiological, etc., or any combination of these), after which the product is no  longer fit for use.  Typical testing institutions are test laboratories, pathology laboratories and environmental  laboratories. These can be public or private laboratories and normally compete in the marketplace.  Certification by a certification body formally establishes, after evaluation,  testing, inspection or  assessment, that a product, service, organization or individual meets the requirements of a standard.  Typical certification institutions are product certification organizations and system certification  organizations. These can be public or private organizations. Competition in the market place is the  norm.  52 http://www.iso.org/iso/casco_building-trust.pdf  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  80  Accreditation provides independent attestation of the competence of an individual or an organization  to offer specified conformity assessment services (e.g. testing, inspection or certification).The typical  accreditation institution is the national accreditation organization. This is usually a public body with a  defined monopoly. There are a few conflicts of interests that have to be considered when establishing  a quality infrastructure:   The accreditation function cannot be carried out by an organization that also provides  conformity assessment, i.e. inspection, testing and certification   The national standards body may also become the national accreditation body, but then it  may not pro-vide any conformity assessment services   Although fundamental metrology and accreditation is not per se a conflict of interest (as  defined by the BIPM (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), ILAC and the IAF) it is  considered close to being one, and hence UNIDO encourages developing countries to avoid  this combination. In particular, a body which accredits calibration laboratories cannot itself  provide calibration services.  G.1.2 Conformity, interoperability and functional testing  There are different types of aspects that can be focussed on while testing. The most common are:   Conformity testing: testing to assess the compliance of the test subject to standardised  requirements.   Functional testing: testing to assess the ability of the test subject to provide the advertised  functionality that is required by the assessment. Functional testing can be part of conformity  testing.   Interoperability testing: testing to assess the ability of two or more systems to exchange  information and to make mutual use of the information that has been exchanged. 53  Interoperability testing can be part of conformity testing.  In respect to smart grid cyber security, all three aspects play a role. Conformity testing needs to be  performed to ensure that smart grids comply with requirements set by the EU and Member States.  Functional security testing needs to be performed to support the implementation of cyber security in  the grid, as conformity testing normally does not focus on the validation of security functions that the  device can support. For example, the conformity security requirement is for a device to have access  control, but the functional security requirements can be that access control should work in a specific  manner. Regarding interoperability testing, it is an important aspect of conformity assessments of  communication standards.  For example, an encryption mechanism needs to be interoperable between smart grid devices to be  useful. If interoperability testing is skipped for an encrypted communication channel, the system can  be conforming to all security requirements, and have been functionally tested, but can still not be able  to use the encrypted channel because the devices are not interoperable.  Penetration testing  A more specific form of testing that is common in security tests is penetration testing. This type of  testing revolves around the exploitation of possible design flaws and weaknesses to compromise the  security of a device. Such tests do not focus on a specific test book, but rely more on the creativity of  the tester, and the time there is available to perform a penetration test. Penetration testing can be  53  ITU-T Z.450 - Quality aspects of protocol-related Recommendations - http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-  T/publications/Pages/structure.aspx  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  81  incorporated as part of a functional test, by describing it as a negative test case for a functional  requirement. For example, the validation by the following functional requirement can be tested by a  penetration test; ‘the device under test shall not provide means to circumvent the access control  mechanism’. Such a requirement can be validated by a negative test scenario, where the device will  be subjected to a penetration test in an attempt to circumvent the access control mechanism.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  82  Annex H:  SOG-IS  The SOG-IS agreement was introduced in response to the EU Council Decision of March 31st 1992  (92/242/EEC) in the field of security of information systems, and the subsequent Council  recommendation of April 7th (1995/144/EC) on common information technology security evaluation  criteria.  The agreement was updated in January 2010 and the full text can be downloaded in the section  \"Agreement\" of the Web site. Participants in this Agreement are government organisations or  government agencies from Member States of the European Union or EFTA (European Free Trade  Association) countries, representing their Member State or country. As of June 2011, the national  bodies participating in the agreement are:  Austria, Bundeskanzleramt  Finland, FICORA - Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority  France, ANSSI - Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Systèmes d'Information  Germany, BSI - Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik  Italy, OCSI - Organismo di Certificazione della Sicurezza Informatica  The Netherlands , NLNCSA - Netherlands National Communications Security  Agency, Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations  Norway, SERTIT - Norwegian National Security Authority operates the Norwegian  Certification Authority for IT Security  Spain, CCN - Centro Criptológico Nacional, Organismo de Certificación de la  Seguridad de las Tecnologías de la Información  Sweden, FMV - Försvarets Materielverk  United Kingdom, CESG - Communications-Electronics Security Group  Table 3: participating countries  The participants work together to:   Coordinate the standardisation of Common Criteria protection profiles and certification  policies between European Certification Bodies in order to have a common position in the fast  growing international CCRA group   Coordinate the development of protection profiles whenever the European commission  launches a directive that should be implemented in national laws as far as IT-security is  involved  The agreement provides for member nations to participate in two fundamental ways:  1. As certificate consuming participants and  http://www.sogisportal.eu/uk/mra_en.html  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  83  2. As certificate producers  For certificate producing nations there are also two levels of recognition within the agreement:  1. Certificate recognition up to EAL4  2. Certificate recognition at higher levels for defined technical areas when schemes have been  approved by the management committee for this level.  Certification is based on an evaluation conducted by an evaluation lab that:   either has been accredited in its country of origin according to ISO 17025,   or has been established under the laws, statutory instruments, or other official administrative  procedures valid in the concerned country, and licenced by the certification body for Common  Criteria and specific technologies like those covered by the technical domain SOG-IS MRA.  This process helps to assess whether the evaluation lab has the necessary skills to perform  appropriate vulnerability analysis.  Proofs of competency between SOG-IS MRA members are called shadowing and voluntary periodic  assessments (VPA) per technical domain. After an initial shadowing, VPAs take place on a regular  basis for no longer than five years, and they are performed by two or more SOG-IS MRA members.  Formally, the prerequisites for certification bodies to join the SOG-IS MRA are equivalent to the  requirements laid down in 765/2008/EC. The VPA reliably demonstrates that a certification body  permanently is able to retain its competency in processes, procedures and technologies, and  therefore that its certificates remain up-to-date with the evolving cyber threat landscape.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  84  Annex I:  Additional identified challenges  Usage of immature standards  As the standard analysis showed (please see chapter 4.4.5), not all standards have been published,  and it is not possible to base a certification framework on an unpublished standard. Also, any newly  published standard suffers from mistakes that can cause confusion and unclarity regarding  implementation and compliancy. We could imagine a mechanism like the “demonstrable  conformance” in Common Criteria, which enables the national CBs to adapt a new protection profile  whenever it included some mistakes.  In state legislation  It will be a challenge to instate legislation, as it requires the endorsement of multiple stakeholders.  This could be solved by discussing with national bodies, if they could accept to bypass some  verifications on their EAL4+ smart metering gateway, in case the gateway was certified by another CB  on some specific security functions.  Balance of cost/effort and threat  It will be a challenge to balance the cost of certification against the threat, as they are not directly  linked, and therefore a device that needs to be cheap, can also require the most stringent security  requirements (such as is the case with the smart meter). Cost/benefit is especially bad for low threat  certifications (because there is an incompressible set of assurance activities). As smart grid face very  sophisticated threats, the balance may be relatively good, but this requires a thorough analysis in the  future.  Avoid compliancy cultures  It will be a challenge to prevent the scenario that only obtaining the paper certificate counts  (compliancy) and no effort is put in actually securing the system. The scheme will have to safeguard  against this by the enforcement of certain controls that reward a security based approach above a  compliancy based one.  Acceptance of a specific scheme  Any particular scheme could be met with resistance from a particular European Member State, if it  already has a similar scheme in place, and is unwilling to discard the already developed and active  scheme. However, well-though certification schemes such as Common Criteria imply that vulnerability  testing will be performed by independent labs.  Acceptance by stakeholders  A scheme will need to be accepted by the Member States, and international agreements need to be  made to accept certificates from other countries, if such systems are not in place yet.  I.1 Challenges identified in ENISA stakeholder discussions  Based on previous stakeholder discussions, the following additional challenges were identified   Need for a specific risk assessment methodology   Necessary to train and raise awareness among operators, manufacturers and consumers   Security efforts should not only focus on smart meters but also on substation automation,  micro grids, SCADA, telecommunication networks, etc.   Security initiatives: duplicity of topics, lack of visibility, same experts in all initiatives.  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  85   Security addressed more as an overlay than as part of the design phase   Need for a coordinating entity on ICS-SCADA and smart grid cyber security and privacy  initiatives  I.2 Common pitfalls  Below are common pitfalls as listed by NIST54 that apply to certification schemes, and are relevant for  a smart grid security scheme:  1. Use of Certification as a Substitute for Improving Quality of the Product and the Manufacturing  Process  As Deming55 has pointed out, quality must be designed into the product and assured through an  effective and efficient manufacturing process. Certification and other types of conformity assessment  processes can provide information on whether the desired end result has been achieved. Since  certification usually this occurs late in the manufacturing process, it does not improve the quality of  the products.  2. Use of Inappropriate Product Standards  Standards, which cover all essential characteristics of the product necessary to ensure a given level of  quality or safety, may not be available or may not be selected for use in a certification program. The  introduction of new technology and new products may also be inhibited if there is no provision for  handling products which fall outside the scope of the standard. Standards may also contain  specifications that are unnecessary and not based on well documented research or information.  3. Lack of Adequate Test Methods  Test methods may not adequately measure all essential product characteristics included in the  certification program in a cost-effective manner. In addition, sampling requirements may not be  sufficient to ensure that the certified products adequately represent the entire production line.  4. Lack of Technical and Financial Competency on the Part of the Certifier  The certifier may lack the necessary technical competence and resources to properly use and maintain  the test equipment and to conduct the certification process. The organization may not have developed  adequate written documentation on the certification requirements and procedures or may not have  kept adequate records on the results. In addition, the certifier might also have biases which  compromise the integrity of the results.  5. Public Misperception Regarding Legal Responsibility for a Certified Product  Legal responsibility for the quality and/or safety of the product generally rests with the manufacturer,  despite frequent public misperception that the third party certifier is responsible.  6. Lack of an Adequate Appeals System  Disagreements may occasionally arise among parties participating in a certification program. Some  programs do not have an adequate and impartial appeals mechanism to handle disagreements that  cannot otherwise be resolved.  54 Source: http://gsi.nist.gov/global/index.cfm/L1-5/L2-45/A-204  55 Deming circle; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA  http://gsi.nist.gov/global/index.cfm/L1-5/L2-45/A-204  Smart grid security certification in Europe  Challenges and recommendations  December 2014  Page  86  7. Lack of Knowledge on the Part of Users of the Certification Scheme  Buyers who rely on a certification and who are not adequately informed as to the purpose, scope, and  technical limitations of the resulting certification may be misled as to the meaning and degree of  confidence that can be placed in the certification mark or certificate of conformity.  8. Lack of Adequate Surveillance and Enforcement  Without an adequate process to ensure that any misuse of the certification mark or certificate of  conformity is dealt with efficiently and effectively, the mark's integrity may be compromised.  Certification programs should take steps to ensure that certified products that are subsequently found  not to conform are either recalled from the marketplace or have their marks or certificates of  conformity removed.  9. Incompatibilities among National Certification Schemes  As noted above, national certification schemes for the same product or group of products can differ  significantly in the standards used and product characteristics that are assessed, the sampling process  and the test methods used, and other program aspects. Such differences have the potential to create  barriers to trade.

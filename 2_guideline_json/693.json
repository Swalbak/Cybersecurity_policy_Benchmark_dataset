It is always a pleasure to speak in front of such a diverse audience. I am pleased to see that experts from  industry, the public sector, academia and defence are gathered here today.  This conference is a great example of the growing realisation that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.  Cybersecurity concerns all citizens and touches all domains.  I am happy to cross paths with Stefanie Frey, who is an expert on ENISA’s Permanent Stakeholders’ Group.  Stephanie is the co-editor of the book we are here to discuss tonight, “Cybersecurity Best Practices”.  The book is an example of a joint effort between the private and public sector, and also includes input  from academia and the cyber defence sector. The book “Cybersecurity Best Practices” is an impressive  collection of articles from researchers and cybersecurity experts about the challenges that they face in  their daily work, the risks and opportunities of cyber, and the resulting best practices that can be  identified.  A few years ago, the words “cyber” and “cyber incidents” were largely unknown to the wider public. Now  cyber incidents are a part of our everyday lives.  The terms cybersecurity, cyber warfare, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber defence are  increasingly referred to in daily conversation by citizens, politicians, and media alike. Some concepts that  have emerged as prominent in the last few years include fake news, cyber ethics, cyber diplomacy and  digital sovereignty.  The ENISA Threat Landscape Report of 2017 highlighted the growth in traditional cyber challenges, where  we have witnessed the increased complexity of cyber incidents, the monetisation of cybercrime such as  through the increasing use of ransomware, as well as cyber espionage, advanced persistent threats and  attacks on critical infrastructure.  Are we prepared to address the challenges arising from increasing and emerging threats and the new  hybrid threat landscape in cyber space?  To name a few, we are witnessing the development and deployment of new technologies such as Robotics  and Artificial Intelligence. From a technical perspective, we have new technologies changing the cyber  landscape.  The Internet of Things/ Internet of people is now being deployed with an estimated 20 Billion devices  expected to be operational by 2020. Industry 4.0, Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing,  and Blockchain technologies are emerging as disruptive technologies and are beginning to affect our daily  lives.  These technologies mark the beginning of a significant societal impact.  Cybersecurity best practices  12th December 2018  03  Europe and its digital single market need to be ready to adapt and reap the benefits of these technologies  in a safe and secure cyber environment. Traditional approaches to security will have to be adapted in  order to cope with these new challenges.  Research indicates that the EU cybersecurity market is growing more slowly than the cybersecurity  markets of other regions.  In 2016, the EU cybersecurity market was estimated at €20.1bn and compared favourably with the  cybersecurity market of other global regions. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the EU market  however is 6%, whereas the average growth rate is around 8%.  We are seeing an increase in the monetisation of cybercrime, crime as a service and targeted attacks.  Targeted attacks, like ransomware, are now listed as top cyber threats in the ENISA Threat Landscape  report of 2017.  Recent data breaches (Mariott/Quora.com) and cyber incidents such as ransomware, and the scale of  these events, are now a matter of public debate. The more we look at this issue, the more we realise that  there is more to be done to adapt to the continuously changing landscape of threats and challenges in  cyber space.  Cooperation and exchange of information  In the majority of the EU Member States, private companies own critical infrastructure and some critical  services are provided by the private sector.  Consequently, a high degree of communication and cooperation between the private and public sectors is  necessary.  For this reason, public-private partnership (PPPs), information sharing and analysis centres (ISACs) and  cybersecurity exercises can be effective tools to assist in managing cyber threats.  ENISA’s efforts in this area include offering incentives and actual recommendations on how to set up and  run PPPs and ISACs. Moreover, ENISA organises cybersecurity exercises every two years. ENISA’s flagship  cybersecurity exercise, “Cyber Europe”, has simulated large-scale cybersecurity incidents.  Furthermore, in 2016, the European Union adopted the NIS Directive. It is the first piece of EU legislation  specifically aimed at improving and promoting cybersecurity at Union level and throughout the EU  Member States. The Directive focuses primarily on the protection of Critical Information Infrastructures  and national essential services.  Among other measures, the NIS Directive requires the EU Member States to adopt and implement  national strategies on the security of network and information systems. ENISA has acquired extensive  knowledge on this topic and has provided an article in the book presented today.  But we do not stop here.  Securing network and information systems in the European Union is essential to keep the online economy  running and to ensure the prosperity of our society.  Cybersecurity best practices  12th December 2018  04  Under this prism, on September of 2017 the Commission adopted a cybersecurity package. The package  builds upon existing instruments and presents new initiatives to further improve EU cyber resilience and  response.  One of the main elements is the Cybersecurity Act Proposal, which includes provisions on a European  Cybersecurity Certification Framework.  The proposed cybersecurity certification framework, which is currently with the co-legislators will aim to  provide EU-wide certification schemes as a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards  and procedures. This will be based on an agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security  properties of a specific ICT-based product, service or process.  The certification framework will ensure that ICT products, services and processes that have been certified  in accordance with such a scheme comply with specified cybersecurity requirements. The resulting  certificate will be recognized in all Member States, making it easier for businesses to trade across borders  and for purchasers to understand the security features of the product or service.  It is evident that businesses across the EU will benefit from the provisions of the Cybersecurity act and the  proposed certification framework in particular.  Firstly, new markets will open up for industry.  Secondly, the harmonised EU wide certification framework will inherently promote the cross-border flow  and exchange of secure ICT products and services. Businesses will be able to work with more  homogeneous systems and should therefore require less resources in dealing with diverse compliance  schemes.  Thirdly, the level of consumer trust will increase the confidence in EU products, services and processes.  Currently, the landscape of security certification of ICT products and services in the EU is quite sparse. This  proposal should greatly increase the level of certification across Europe.  The role of ENISA  Throughout 2018, ENISA has worked alongside the European Commission and Member State authorities to  assist in planning a course of action for the transition to the new EU framework known as Cybersecurity  Act.  Furthermore ENISA has engaged with the industry (e.g. manufacturers, health care, IoT) and conformity  assessment bodies alike to document their priorities and promote the merits of the framework.  ENISA has also further developed its relationship with the standardisation organisations in the EU (CEN  and ETSI) and internationally (IEC) in an effort to provide a solid basis of cooperation that is likely to  support the development of the certification schemes.  Closing Remarks  The EU has an opportunity to become a global leader.  By putting cybersecurity at the forefront of our efforts, the EU has the potential to set the scene and serve  as the yardstick for other markets to compare against by leveraging the collective experience and  expertise of the Member States and European industry.  Cybersecurity best practices  12th December 2018  05  ENISA, since 2004, acts as a centre of expertise dedicated to enhancing network and information security  in the Union and supporting capacity building of Members States.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ideas for initial schemes have already been suggested by the different stakeholders and the Agency is  prepared to define a timeline with the Commission and the European Cybersecurity Certification Group  (ECCG).  Over the past year, ENISA has been working with all its stakeholder communities to prepare them for  contributing to the first schemes and we believe that the majority of these communities are also up-to- speed and ready to contribute.  The Agency has put together a recruitment plan to enable us to grow the certification activity in a  consistent manner and is proactively recruiting for reserve lists so as to have additional skill sets in house  at the earliest moment.  In conclusion, we have established the momentum in our stakeholder communities that is necessary to  ensure an efficient start-up of this activity and are looking forward to a positive outcome from the political  process in order to start.  I believe that acting together we will make Europe a better place.  Thank you for your attention.

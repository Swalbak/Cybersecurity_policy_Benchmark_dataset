These airports are  implementing new smart components to offer travellers a portfolio of services that spans from self or  automatic check-in, baggage & document check, flight booking management and way finding services to  automated border control and security checks.  Smart components can be defined as any networked ICT system that has a data processing capability  ranging from aggregating simple data to extracting insights to support human decisions and/or triggering  an automated response. These components while enhancing the user experience, they also pave the way  for new attack vectors and expose airport assets to a larger attack surface. Therefore, airport decision  makers need to acknowledge the threats emerging from smart components, increase their awareness of  security implications and improve the security of their infrastructure in order to enhance safety for  passengers and all airport stakeholders.  In response to these new emerging threats faced by smart airports, this report provides a guide for airport  decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of Operations) and airport information security  professionals, but also relevant national authorities and agencies that are in charge of cyber-security for  airports. Based on an in depth examination of existing knowledge as well as validation interviews with  subject matter experts, this report highlights the key assets of smart airports. Built on this, a detailed  analysis and threats mapping was conducted with a particular focus on the vulnerabilities of smart  components. With the feedback from airport subject matter experts, a series of attack scenarios was  developed to underline the increased attack surface and challenges when smart components are  integrated in the traditional IT airport systems.  On the basis of this analysis, a number of good practices for securing smart airports is identified in order to  support Information security professionals and airport decision makers in their security efforts and risk  management activities. The goal of this study is to provide airport operators with a start-up kit to enhance  cybersecurity in smart airports. The study additionally identifies gaps on different areas, including:  operational practices and the need to develop clear airport cyber security postures.  As the result of this work a total of eight recommendations for enhancing the security and resilience of  Smart airports in Europe are presented, tailored specifically towards decision makers, airport operators  and industry.  Recommendations for airport decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of Operations) and  airport information security professionals:   Prioritise cyber security for safety   Establish a clear airport cyber security posture and allocate adequate roles and resources   Revise cyber security policies and practices based on good practices monitoring   Implement network-based, holistic risk and threat management policy and processes for cyber  security  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  08  Recommendations for policy-makers   Promote and facilitate the development of common guidelines, standards, metrics, awareness  and knowledge exchange on cyber security for smart airports   Facilitate the development of accreditation and third party auditing for cyber security in Smart  airport  Recommendations for industry representatives   Collaborate with key stakeholders in the development of specific standards for cyber security  products and solutions   Work with airport operators to develop products and/or solutions that are aligned to their cyber  security requirements.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  09  1. Introduction  Objectives and scope of the study  The objective of this study is to improve the security and resilience of smart airports, including air traffic  management for what is relevant to the functioning of smart airports.  This is in order to prevent disruptions  to smart components that could have an impact on the service and safety being delivered to passengers,  while also promoting cost benefits and protecting the environment. The aim is to provide guidance to  airports to help them ensure a seamless, safe and secure passenger experience.1 This is in the context of  ENISA’s role specified in EC Communication “Internet of Things – An Action Plan for Europe” and its support  for the implementation of the Network Information Security Directive. 2  Smart airports introduce new components and functionalities to facilitate the infrastructure-to-passenger  interaction and vice-versa.3 This improvement paves the way for new attack vectors or pathways and  exposes airport assets to a larger attack surface. Therefore, airport decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors  and Head of Operations) and airport information security professionals need to identify new threats  applicable to smart components, increase their awareness of security issues and improve the security of  their infrastructure in order to enhance safety through the most relevant good practices.  In this study smart airports are defined as those airports implementing smart components, which are value- added services built on the top of traditional legacy infrastructures. Such components and services aim to  produce a more seamless, secure and safe passenger experience via digital assistance and automation.4  Figure 1: Airport High Level Representation  1 Please note that privacy is not in scope for this report.  2 See: European Commission, Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic an d Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Internet of Things — An action plan for Europe, COM(2009) 278, Brussels, 18.6.2009; and ENISA,  “ENISA’ s Position on the NIS Directive”, January 2016.  3 Boutin Nicolas, Achim Fechtel, Hean Ho Loh, and Michael Tan, “The Connected Airport: The Time Is Now”, bcg.perspectives, January , 2016.  4 IATA (2015).

The study is also relevant for all organisations that need to ensure the security of  their ‘smart’ integrated solutions and services they offer to airports. In addition, due to the supply chain  characterising smart airports and the dependencies among airport operators, this report can also be of  benefit to companies involved in the airport supply chain, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP)  and Air Traffic Management (ATM) operators, as well as relevant national authorities and agencies that are  in charge of cyber security for airports.  Why cyber security is important for airports  Smart airports were included under the umbrella of smart infrastructures in the ENISA Work Programme  2016.5 The aim was to identify major airports that developed and operated smart services and to take stock  of the security challenges arising from usage of these services. Indeed, there has been an increase in  information security incidents, including both cyber-attacks and ICT dependencies disruptions, experienced  by the aviation sector worldwide, which has been widely reported in the press in recent years. Table 1  provides a timeline of the 2016 information security related incidents in airports, which illustrates their  potential prevalence and impact, and the relevance of this work. A more detailed list is available in the annex.  In this study, ENISA aims to provide good practices and recommendations, for airports as well as relevant  public authorities, which address these challenges.  Table 1: Example of 2016 information security incidents impacting airports operations  DATE COUNTRY DESCRIPTION  August 2016 US  Thousands of air passengers around the world were left stranded after  a power cut forced the US airline Delta to suspend flights.6 The  overnight power failure took place in Atlanta, near Delta's  headquarters, causing computer systems to crash. Airport check-in  systems, passenger advisory screens, the airline's website and  smartphone apps were all affected by the system failure.  July 2016 Vietnam  Attackers successfully attacked Vietnam's two largest airports and the  nation's flag carrier, Vietnam Airlines7. The attackers briefly hijacked  flight information screens and sound systems inside the two airports.  Instead of departure and arrival details, the airports' flight screens and  speakers broadcasted what local media described as anti-Vietnamese  and Philippines slogans, in turn prompting authorities to shut down  both systems.  Vietnam Airlines’ website, meanwhile, was also seized  and transferred to a malicious website abroad, while passenger data  pertaining to an undisclosed number of its frequent flyers was  published online as well. As a result of this attack Vietnamese  authorities will carry out a comprehensive check on Chinese devices  and technology to ensure information security at the Vietnamese  5 ENISA Work Programme, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-work-programme-2016.  6 Delta: Power cut strands thousands of passengers, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37007908.  7 Cyberattack claims multiple airports in Vietnam, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports- vietnam-airli/.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/corporate/enisa-work-programme-2016 http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37007908 http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports-vietnam-airli/ http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports-vietnam-airli/  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  11  airports since it is feared that the Chinese hacker group 1937cn might  be responsible for the attacks.8  July 2016  IT  A third party failure at Rome’s Fiumicino airport caused the shutdown  of the automated passenger check-in system, which in turn caused two  hours’ delays for the passenger checking operation.9 The failure was  related to the Internet provider that the automated passenger check– in at the airport uses for accessing and processing passenger data.  April 2016 UK  After landing, the pilot of a British Airways flight from Geneva reported  a collision with a drone while approaching the London Heathrow  airport on the 17th April.10 The incident highlighted the issues faced  with regard to drones. While the threat of bird strikes has been well  researched, there is still little data about how much damage a drone  could cause to an airplane.11  April 2016 Worldwide  The civil aircraft manufacturer Airbus Group is hit by up to 12 cyber- attacks per year, mostly in the form of ransomware and hostile actions  carried out by state-sponsored attackers.12 Airbus’ chief information  security officer cited an instance of ransomware compromising a  computer, used by an employee offsite, which then (after the  computer was connected to the company's intranet) spread over  Airbus' corporate network, encrypting the contents stored on the hard  drives of several machines.  Methodology  This report was developed using a combination of desktop research as well as information from interviews  with key stakeholders. The goal is to define and cover the entire IT perimeter of smart airports, drawing on  the approach outlined above13 that incorporates assets inside airports, connected assets outside the airport  and dependencies on the airway. The approach taken follows the ENISA methodology developed over the  last three years based on the ENISA threat landscape approach, and involved:   Mapping assets and developing a threat taxonomy that covers possible attacks via desktop research, and  validating and/or identifying further gaps through interviews with security experts working in the field of  airport information security.   Enumerating possible attacks that target or affect smart components in airports.   Developing good practices and three attack scenarios with mitigation actions to provide information on  practical examples of implementation, and validating these with security experts working in the field of  airport information security.   Performing a gap analysis based on desktop research and interviews.  8 Vietnam to inspect use of Chinese technology following cyberattacks on airports , http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use- of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports.  9Aeroporto di Fiumicino, ore di stop e code al check in per un guasto alla connessione,  http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada- 144357812/?ref=HREC1-6.  10 ‘Drone’ hits British Airways plane approaching Heathrow, with no damage caused, http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/04/drone-hits-british- airways-plane-approaching-heathrow-with-no-damage-caused/.  11 'Drone' hits British Airways plane approaching Heathrow Airport , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36067591.  12 How Airbus defends against 12 big cyber attacks each year, http://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks- each-year-418131.  13 Please see Section 1.1. on the objectives and scope of the study.  http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6 http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6 http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/04/drone-hits-british-airways-plane-approaching-heathrow-with-no-damage-caused/ http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/04/drone-hits-british-airways-plane-approaching-heathrow-with-no-damage-caused/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36067591 http://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks-each-year-418131 http://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks-each-year-418131  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  12   Proposing recommendations for future steps in cyber security for airports in Europe.  Initial results from the desktop research were further consolidated with information acquired during the  interview process, specifically in relation to the development of assets, threats, cyber-attack scenarios, good  practices and recommendations. A comparative approach was employed in relation to the threats and assets  in order to identify asset exposure to cyber threats. This was further validated via interviews with asset  owners (i.e. individual airport operators) and a mapping approach was then employed to establish links or  connections between assets, threats, good practices, and gaps with the focus on enhancing cyber security  within the Smart airport perimeter. Finally, the draft report was circulated among circa 20 organisations  across eight countries for additional feedbacks with more than 200 comments integrated into the final  version.

Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  13  2. Key aspects in Smart airport cyber security  Within the context of this study, the “Smart airport” concept has been shaped from the vision for the future  of air travel that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is promoting.14 IATA envisages for the  future “air travels [that] should be simple, smooth and hassle free”.15 Such objectives could be met by means  of offering the travellers a suite of advanced solutions and services that will cover aspects such as self or  automatic check-in, baggage check, document check, flight rebooking, boarding and bag recovery. At the  same time, Smart airports promise to guarantee improved security. Linked to the concept of Smart airport,  IATA introduced the concept of “smart security”, defined as: “a risk-based system that aims to offer a fast  and hassle-free passenger screening experience at airports while strengthening security and improving  operational efficiency.”16 Smart security “envisions a continuous journey from curb to airside [in which]  passengers will proceed through security with minimal inconvenience, with security resources allocated  based on risk, and with airport facilities optimised.”17  The definition of Smart airport that will be used throughout this document refers to airports making use of  networked, data driven response capabilities that, on the one hand, provide travellers with a better and  seamless travel experience and, on the other hand, aim to guarantee higher levels of security for the safety  of the passengers, operators and general public. These networked data driven response capabilities tend  to be referred to as smart components. In the context of this report these smart components are defined  as any integrated Internet of Things (IoT) components to bring added-value services that has a data  processing capability ranging from aggregating simple data to extracting insights to support human  decisions and/or triggering an automated response.  The foreseen increasing reliance on network  technologies (including the Internet) raises, nonetheless, obvious security concerns.18 Devising strategies for  securing smart airports in face of cyber-attacks and ICT dependencies disruptions is one of the objectives of  this study.  Smart components that lie internally and externally to the physical location of the airport are also included  in the scope of this research.  Any single device that is connected to a network of such systems, even those  with minimum or no data processing capabilities, is contained in the airport perimeter overview. As a result,  key functions underpinning network communication systems between aircraft, airports, air traffic control  and other forms of communication are also in scope of the study. This also encompasses providers of  common services and network infrastructures, including passenger and baggage processing technology.  Figure 2 shows which criteria are applied to define the scope of the airport perimeter in the context of this  study, bringing together the physical location of assets and functions related to airport operations, the  ownership structure and assets or functions defined as ‘smart’. This study has endorsed a more  encompassing view of what constitutes the Smart airport perimeter.  This view recognises the importance  of dependencies and interactions among assets and functions related to the overall operation of a Smart  airport rather than the location of ownership of such functions and/or assets. As a result, functions and/or  assets that might not be owned and/or located within the airport but they are important for the overall  14 IATA website, http://www.iata.org  15 IATA (2015).

For instance, this in the case for Air Traffic Management (ATM),  which the majority of airports do not own any more.  Figure 2: Scope of the Smart Airport Perimeter - Criteria  Key stakeholders in Smart airports  The Centre for Air Transportation Systems Research19 in their analysis of airport stakeholders identified two  conceptual stakeholder boundaries with regard to the functions and operations of airports. In most cases,  regional airport authorities operate airports as “public utilities providing infrastructure to service providers  and their supply chain under revenue neutral financial regulate”.20 These public entities work to balance the  interests of all of their stakeholders to build the airport infrastructure, lease space to service providers and  ensure that service providers meet the needs of seamless, safe and secure air travel services to the  passenger. In so doing, two distinct boundaries are generated in the analysis of airport stakeholders:   Airport Organisational Boundary, which depicts the limits of what is controlled or owned by the airport  authority or management. This relates to the design and configuration of airport infrastructure (including  IT infrastructure) and the operational processes and procedures that underpin the efficiency of its own  organisation.  19 Scharr, D., Sherry, L. (2011) Analysis of Airport Stakeholders, Centre for Air Transportation Systems Research, The Volgenau School of Information  Technology and Engineering, http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/pubs/ICNS_Schaar_AirportStakeholders.pdf  20 Ibid.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  15   Airport Service Boundary, which incorporates the airport supply chain and support services that lie  outside direct management control of the airport authority. This includes many IT and support services  that are important to the functioning of the airport, but are mainly operated and maintained by third  party suppliers.  Figure 3 maps the key stakeholders that contribute to the functioning and operation of the Smart airport,  making a distinction between those stakeholders that lie outside the direct boundaries and/or management  of the airport and those that lie within the airport organisational boundary. Based on existing related  literature19, Figure 3 provides the high level grouping of the airport key stakeholders21 , while Table 2  describes each identified stakeholder group and provides additional sub-groups within the main grouping.  Figure 3 Smart Airports: Key Stakeholders  21 For the sake of clarity, figure 3 shows a simplified representation of key stakeholders which emphasises the main interactive actors within a Smart  airport.  Above all for the service boundary reality is somehow more complex and porous since several information and data providers might involve,  for instance in the case of Google Maps with information overlaid/integrated from multiple industry and non-industry sources, providing services  directly to the Passenger.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  16  Table 2: Definition of Airport Stakeholder Groups:  STAKEHOLDER DEFINITION/EXPLANATION  Passengers  Customers of the airport, who travel between the ground and air transportation modes or wait for a  connection between two flights.  International/EU  Organizations  International and EU organisations participate in the airport system by providing international best  practices, regulatory standards for the operation of the airport and the management of international air- space. With regard to Air Traffic Management (ATM), organisations such as EUROCONTROL collect and  distribute flight information and/or plans among national air traffic controls to optimise Air Traffic Flow and  Capacity Management (ATFCM) operations across Europe via the Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU).  National Government  National Government participates in the airport system in two different ways: a) as an operator, focusing  on air traffic control services, transportation systems, security (e.g. baggage handling and screening, and  customs and immigration); b) as a regulator with regulations applying to airport infrastructure and service  providers within airport systems.  Local Government  Local Government is usually responsible for the strategic direction of the airport (in terms of planning  decisions) and for appointing airport management, depending on the ownership structure. It also  represents the views of local communities and contributes to capital investment projects.  Industry/Third-Party  Service Providers  Service providers are private operators that offer services to air carriers and general aviation users. Services  provided might include: 1) Air traffic management (i.e., Air Navigation Service Provider, ANSP), 2) fuel  management; 3) baggage handling and screening; 4) cargo processing services; 5) kiosk devices (e.g. e- Ticketing); 6) Way-finding services; 7) transport systems; 8) IT and Comms services; 9) security services; etc.  Surface Transport  Operators  Surface Transport Operators provide surface access to the airport and include rail services, taxicabs, buses,  private rental cars and the subway/underground, while parking services may be provided both on and off  the airport by the airports organization or private enterprises.  Airport Operators  The airport organisational structure varies and can be comprised of an individual airport or a group of  airports managed by the same organisation e.g. MAG in the UK is a single organisation that operates  Manchester, Stansted, Bournemouth and East Midlands airports.  Airlines  An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines  utilise aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for  codeshare agreements. Generally, airline companies are recognised via an air operating certificate or license  issued by a governmental aviation body.  Airport Suppliers  Airport suppliers have the airport itself as the end-customer and includes various contractor, consulting and  equipment suppliers.  Concessionaires  Airport Concessionaires operate passenger services in terminal buildings and may include food and  beverage services, retail and accommodation.  EU cyber security policy in civil aviation  At the international level the most important legal instrument on civil aviation security is given by Annex 17  to the Chicago Convention , “Security – Safeguarding International Civil Aviation against Acts of Unlawful  Interference” approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Council.22 The primary  objective of such instrument is safeguarding passengers, ground personnel, crew as well as the general  22 Annex 17- Security: Safeguarding International Civil Aviation against Acts of Unlawful Interference,  http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/annex_17_security_safeguarding_international_civil_aviation_against_acts_of_unlawful_interferen ce.htm.  http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/annex_17_security_safeguarding_international_civil_aviation_against_acts_of_unlawful_interference.htm http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/annex_17_security_safeguarding_international_civil_aviation_against_acts_of_unlawful_interference.htm  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  17  public against any acts of unlawful interference. At the European level, EU policy activities in commercial  aviation are undertaken by the European Commission (EC) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)  that was established by EC regulation no 216/2008.23 EU-Lisa, an EU agency responsible for managing and  promoting information and communication technology (ICT) in the area of justice, security and freedom, has  also supported EU cyber security policy related to aviation above all in relation to border security24. Similarly,  Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) has also provided support with studies and technological  developments. 25 The majority of policies at EU level tend to focus on civil aviation in general with some of  them also dealing with cyber security for safety within aviation.  The ones dealing with cyber security also  include concrete actions and outcomes through the use of action plans and/or the setting of specific  objectives. Examples of these plans are:   The European Aviation Safety Plan 2016 – 2020 by EASA26 published in 2015. 27 The plan outlines key  safety actions to address emerging cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in civil aviation. This has  arisen, in part, due to the need for new generation aircraft to have their systems connected to the  ground in real time with new Air Traffic Management (ATM) technologies requiring internet and wireless  connections between the various ground centres and the aircraft. The use and multiplication of network  connections serves to increase the vulnerability of the system as a whole.   The Air Traffic Management Master Plan by SESAR (2015)28 together with a set of solutions tested in  real-life operational conditions with airlines, airports, air navigation service providers and  manufacturers. The plan includes the development of an EU framework for cyber security that  encompasses regulatory, policy and operational functions across multiple stakeholders including the EU,  national and local service providers.  At the EU regulatory level, existing EU Directives and Regulations are categorised as follows, with individual  analysis and refences for these Directives and Regulations provided in Annex 2:   Harmonising rules across the European Community governing the protection of European citizens in  the context of civil aviation, including the protection and processing of passenger data.   Ensuring ATM security and safety in regards to air space security, personal security, computer network  system security and cyber security (e.g. Commission Implementing Regulation,  EU No 1035/2011).   Creating interoperability of Air Traffic Management (ATM) across European Community defined  airspace. In regard to ATM, EU regulators commonly formulate European Airspace Policy,  establish a  legal framework for Member States and ensure that legislation is implemented correctly through  regular inspections and oversight.  23 Their role is to draft implementing rules in all fields pertinent to the level of protection for EU citizens in aviation, to certify and approve products  where EASA has exclusive competence (e.g. airworthiness), to provide support to Member States in the field of air operations and air traffic  management and to promote the use of European and worldwide standards.  24 Smart Borders and eu-LISA, http://www.eulisa.europa.eu/AboutUs/SmartBorders/Pages/default.aspx.  25 SESAR ‘s study on cyber security in ATM, http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/all-news/study-details-rd-roadmap-atm-cyber-security.  26 In a communication from the European Commission in 2015 to the European Parliament, EASA was asked to address cyber-risks in civil aviation in  order to ‘foster security by design and to establish the necessary emergency response capability. As part of its role, EASA will offer support to European  aviation security stakeholders on the prevention and response to information related security incidents by raising cyber security awareness (cyber  security promotion initiatives); advising the EC on aviation cyber security policy/regulatory matters; and—advising the EC, MS or the European  Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell (EACCC) in case of an aviation cyber security crisis.

It is  not unusual that a producer has to produce different versions of the same type of aircraft and/or  equipment depending on the country where it is used. Other regulations lay down procedures for  conducting Commission inspections in the field of air safety standards.   Detailed measures for the implementation of common basic standards on aviation security, in  particular airport security, airport planning requirements, access control and so on.   Rules governing  network information security for critical infrastructures (e.g., Network Information  Security Directive see Annex).  Airport IT architecture and stakeholder interactions  The Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP)29 depicts IT system architectures in airports by organising  four conceptual categories in a layered fashion. All IT systems can be categorised into one of the four layers:   Physical Layer. The cabling and fibre infrastructure that provides the foundation for all IT systems in use  at the airport and is made up of the non-electronic physical components, including copper cabling, fibre  optic, or other components that provide for cross-connection structures.   Networking Layer. Communication systems incorporate the electronic components that send cable or  wireless signals. These systems underpinning the network layer communicate data and information  using the wired physical layer and/or wireless infrastructure. The physical components include routers,  switches, gateways and wireless access points. These IT and Comms systems can be broadly categorised  as Local Area Network (LAN) (wired and wireless), Wide Area Network (WAN) (wired and wireless), and  Virtual Private Networks (VPN).   Service Application Layer. The application layer contains all the systems that support the operations of  the airport. There are numerous smart application systems that have been identified as part of the  Assets MINDMAP30.   Integration Layer. The integration layer allows all applications that are crucial to the operations of the  airport to co-ordinate and share information amongst themselves. It allows systems to be directly linked  together or share a common data or information pool in order to make better informed decisions.  Systems integration is also a key pillar of the Smart airport.  Complex technical infrastructures, such System Wide Information Management (SWIM) and Airport  Operations Plan (AOP), developed by SESAR, would combine several layers in their architecture.31  Figure 4 shows some of the interactions across the different IT layers, key stakeholders and key airport  activities. This indicates that there are several dependencies and collaborations occurring within the airport.  29 ACRP (2012) Information Technology Systems at Airports: A Primer, http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rpt_059.pdf.  30 Please see Figure 6.  31 SESAR Factsheet - Airport Operations Management, http://www.eurocontrol.int/publications/sesar-factsheet-airport-operations-management;  and http://www.sesarju.eu/sesar-solutions/swim.  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rpt_059.pdf http://www.eurocontrol.int/publications/sesar-factsheet-airport-operations-management  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  19  Figure 4: Airport Stakeholders and Interactions  User experience in Smart airports:  the end-to-end passenger journey  Smart airport is seen principally as technology or IT systems that connect the airport and the passenger. This  covers a number of different smart systems that support the end-to-end passenger journey. Cisco (2009)32  provides a detailed map of the end-to-end passenger journey that starts from the home and finishes with  the arrival at the destination: as illustrated in Figure 5, End-To-End Passenger Journey. Their report suggests  that airports, airlines and other stakeholders “can provide a superior passenger experience by taking an  integrated approach to every touchpoint along the passenger journey”.33  Figure 5: End-to-End Passenger Journey (source: CISCO 2009)  32 CISCO, “Smart Airports: Transforming Passenger Experience to Thrive in the New Economy”,  http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/pov/Passenger_Exp_POV_0720aFINAL.pdf.  33 Ibid.  http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/pov/Passenger_Exp_POV_0720aFINAL.pdf  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  20  Indeed, smart technology is perceived as the means towards innovation and the improvement of customer  experience, personalisation of services, targeted information flow (to the right people at the right time) and  interactive services through the use of physical IT infrastructures, such as beacons, sensors, wireless  infrastructure and mobile applications. At a technology level, this could mean automated passenger  announcements or updates linked to data within the Flight Information Display System(FIDS) or the use of  Near Field Communication (NFC) to allow passengers to interact with their choice of travel providers at every  stage of their journey. At a higher level, this indicates a full focus on the end-to-end passenger journey,  involving many interacting services.34 Any activity that automates management of airport business in  relation to the processing of passengers can be defined as a characteristic of the Smart airport, that either  supports the decision-making process through the provision and acquisition of up-to-date data or facilitates  automated processes that reduce manual actions and prevent human error.35  In order to support an end-to-end passenger journey experience, system integration is paramount. This  allows all applications that are crucial to the operations of the airport to co-ordinate and share information  amongst themselves. The concept of SWIM (System-Wide Information Management)36 and Airport  Collaborative Decision Making (CDM)37 cover a complete change in paradigm for how information is  managed and shared across the whole European ATM system.38 This is underpinned by the circularity of  information or data exchange among key stakeholders involved in air traffic navigation, including EU  organisations (i.e., EUROCONTROL Network Manager)39, airport operators (i.e., Airport Operation Centre  and Air Traffic Control), airlines (i.e., Airline Operation Centre and aircraft) and airport providers (i.e., air  navigation service providers, ANSPs). This shows the interdependencies between systems and sub-systems,  which are crucial to managing airspace (reflected by the Single European Sky, SES) and the control and  management of airport operations. This type of systems integration is facilitated by directly linking digital  systems or infrastructure together (through shared services) or by forming a common data or information  pool that is accessible and updated regularly in real-time. The results are common infrastructures that  facilitate collaborative decision-making between a disparate federation of critical infrastructure owners and  operators to ensure the continuity of service at airports, and efficiency in the management of airspace that  extends to service providers beyond the airport.40 Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC, 2015)41 also  discusses system integration among key stakeholders as an important feature of the Smart airport with  collaboration enabled technology implemented across business units and functional silos through the  utilisation of centralised and shared service strategies. The result is a set of information and data systems  that are accessible to key stakeholders  within the airport but also outside service operators and in some  cases, passengers.  34 CISCO has identified several smart service’ categories, focused on the passenger journey, such as transport and parking, the processing of  passengers through the airport and bespoke business to business services.

Physical security  controls and passenger screening have experienced substantial reform and cyber security has become an  increasingly important aspect, as illustrated in Table 1 with the list of recent cyber security related incidents  involving airports. These changes have simultaneously opened up opportunities for improving cyber security  and safety (i.e. proper network integration can improve cyber security, while CDM can also enhance cyber  situation awareness and safety) while increasing security and safety risks. The UK's Centre for the Protection  of National Infrastructure (CPNI) produced a report in 2012 on cyber security in civil aviation42. The report  noted that cyber security is an increasingly important issue. Reasons cited for this increased risk were:   Security is not currently covered by safety management   Aviation is increasingly making use of new and unfamiliar technologies   IT systems are becoming increasingly interconnected; this exposes operators to risks in other people's  systems.  CPNI provides also a concise summary of the cyber security issue in aviation, directly linking cyber security  to safety:  \"Cyber security is an issue because many civil aviation organisations rely on electronic systems for critical  parts of their operations, and for many organisations their electronic systems have safety-critical  functions.\"43  Particular to cyber security, risks constantly change as new threats and vulnerabilities surface along with  ever-changing technology implementations. It is no longer possible to be truly safe without also being  secure. This means that cyber security has a major stake in providing safety.  The challenge is to address  security issues not only to enhance security but also to ensure safety.  ENISA works to develop cyber security  for safety. Safety does not integrate security, and especially cyber security is not well integrated in  organisations. For this reason, ENISA has decided to perform this study with the aim of helping asset owners  and all stakeholders involved to enhance cyber security for the safety of European passengers.  Cyber security in Smart airports  Smart airports have the potential to deliver important improvements in overall security effectiveness,  operational efficiency and passenger experience and safety. When electronic devices are used, for example  to collect and monitor data relating to landside, terminal and airside activities at the airport, and these  systems become connected following a Total Airport Management (TAM) concept44, the airport can benefit  not only from increased passenger safety and greater operational efficiency but also from an embed system  of truly Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM)45, based around real-time information that is shared across  different actors. However, the increased flow of information, data processing and connections among  devices and systems also bring risks that airport operators, policy makers, vendors, airlines and third party  entities engaged in the provision of airport services need to address. These risks include vulnerabilities in  ICT and electronic systems as well as the information and data held and processed by such systems.  Vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actions, but also human errors, system or third party failures  and natural phenomena. The cyber security threats to Smart airports are detailed in the following chapter.  42 CPNI (2012) Cyber-security in Civil Aviation, http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020- cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf.  43 Ibid.  44 Total Airport Management: a Step Beyond Airport Collaborative Decision Making,  https://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/public/standard_page/EEC_News_2006_3_TAM.html.  45 Airport Collaborative Decision Making, http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/airport-collaborative-decision-making-cdm.  http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020-cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020-cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  22  3. Key asset groups and assets  Tackling cyber security starts from asset identification and decomposition46. In this chapter is provided an  overview of the key asset groups and assets to be protected in Smart airports. In the ACRP Guidebook on  Best Practices for Airport Cyber security - Appendix B47, cyber security-relevant airport assets and systems  are listed. Based on ACRP's work and insights from experts, we have identified the following as the key asset  groups in Smart airports: Landside Operations, Airport Administration, Staff Management, Customer  Ancillary Services, Facilities and Maintenance, Passenger Management, Airline/Airside Operations, Safety  and Security, and IT and Comms Systems. Table 3 shows these key asset groups together with their locations  within the airport. It is worth noting that there are some systems that are located across several locations  and also outside the physical perimeter of the airport.48 Specifically, Safety and Security spans multiple  locations within the airport and is identified here as a cross-location asset group. IT & Communication  Systems is also a cross-location asset group, while it also located inside and outside the physical perimeter  of the airport. These are reflected by External IT and Comms, whose ownership and control is exercised by  entities other than the airport authority or operator, and Internal IT and Comms, which are owned and  operated by the airport authority, operator, or by airlines and other third parties within the physical airport  perimeter.  Table 3: Airport Core Asset Groups  46 Many assets could be further decomposed into components and sub-processes, and the categorisation here attempts to strike a balance  between covering key significant categories and relevant detail.  47 Guidebook on Best Practices for Airport Cyber security (ACRP 140, 2015), Appendix B.  48 The scope of the Smart airport perimeter, in the context of cyber security, includes internal assets that are controlled and operated by entities  within the airport and located within the perimeter of the airport, and also external assets that are to a large extent controlled and operated by an  entity other than the airport operator or authority. Most of these external assets reflect the navigation and communication between the aircraft and  the airport itself, through intermediaries that collect and distribute the information to interested parties affected by the flight path and trajectory of  the aircraft.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  23  Smart airport assets  Based on the asset groups identified in Table 3, key smart assets for each of the groups were identified and  validated with experts. Smart assets include both primary and secondary assets as categorised by ISO  2700549. These assets are either owned and operated by the airport authority or outside service providers.  Primary assets are usually the core processes and information that underpin key airport activities. Normally  primary assets include business processes and activities, and information. Accordingly, secondary assets are  defined as those assets upon which the primary elements rely. These assets have vulnerabilities that are  exploitable by cyber security threats aiming to impair the primary assets – processes and information. They  include all types of deployable systems that allow an airport to carry out its primary functions such as  hardware, software, network, personnel, and site.  Figure 6 presents the full MINDMAP of the key  asset groups  and assets of the ‘Smart’ airport as identified  through the expert interviews and desktop research. All assets in the figure are ‘smart’ components and are  important to the functioning of the Smart airport. To further validate the criticality of the assets we present  in Figure 7 their prioritization according to the experts. We have collected their views on the top five most  critical assets, in the sense that they deem them particularly important and representing the top priorities  for cyber security.  Figure 6: Mapping Smart Assets and Asset Groups of the Airport  To facilitate information security professionals in their risk assessment, the complete list of assets is available  as an annex of the present document.  The goal is to give the interested parties an input regarding the  49 It outlines the international standard for managing information security risk that provides a framework for the identification of smart assets (based  on the criteria above) for the Smart airport.

Threat and risk analysis  Emerging challenges in smart airports  The Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP, 2015)50 has identified a trend toward greater  interconnectivity as airports and their stakeholders leverage digital technology to optimise resources and  work together more efficiently. Airports are also becoming increasingly reliant on computer services  delivered via Internet, with some airports allowing passengers and staff to use their own hardware (smart  phones, tablets and computers/laptops) to access airport data, systems and network resources.  A report by the UK Centre for Protection of National Infrastructures (CPNI) identifies the consolidation of IT  systems and Internet-based solutions in civil aviation management and operation as a major reason for  increased vulnerability to malicious cyber security attacks. The report suggests that “Interconnected and  interdependent systems are becoming more prevalent in commercial aviation, increasing the possibility that  different operators inside and outside the airport become exposed to risks caused by security weaknesses  in other people’s systems”.51 Indicatively, SESAR system-wide information management (SWIM)52, once  deployed, will allow all aviation sectors to access the data they require to undertake their role, clear in the  knowledge that it is consistent with the data being used by different actors. However, SWIM was not  designed with mechanisms that integrate cyber security requirements.53  An additional challenge arises from the use of open and unencrypted communication capabilities, such as  communication of routine air traffic commands between air traffic control and the aircraft. This introduces  further vulnerabilities that can cause rise to cyber attacks and subsequently can risk the safety and  performance of civil aviation.  Threat analysis  This Section presents a taxonomy of threats to the cyber security of Smart airports, including mapping to  Smart airport assets.  The threat taxonomy focuses on cyber security aspects with relevance to Smart  airports, many of which also generalise to any IT systems. The taxonomy was developed drawing on findings  from the interviews and desktop research. Previous ENISA reports have also been employed as a basis for  the taxonomy (including ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure 201554,  and ENISA Study of IPT and smart grids in 201655).  A taxonomy of cyber security threats to smart components within the airport perimeter is presented,  followed by the attack vectors and actors involved. The threats are mapped to categories of assets they  50 Airport Co-operative Research Program (2015)  51CPNI (2012) Cyber-security in Civil Aviation, http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020- cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb.  52 “The 2016 SESAR SWIM Global Demo shows that system-wide information management (SWIM) is no longer a concept on paper, but is  progressively becoming a reality that will propel aviation into a new era of global connectivity”, http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/all-news/global- partners-deliver-digitised-and-connected-aviation.  53 To cope with these emerging vulnerabilities enhanced System Monitoring and Control (SMC) and technical supervision become paramount  together with health status checks, predictive capabilities, machine learning and pattern recognition based on operational baselines.

Finally, specific attacks are highlighted against target elements, illustrating the threats to Smart  airport assets.  4.2.1 Threat taxonomy  Figure 8: Threat Taxonomy  Figure 8 illustrates a two-level threat taxonomy, based on root causes, including human errors, system  failures, natural phenomena, third party failures, and malicious actions. Annex 3 includes an expanded  diagram of the taxonomy, which provides a three-level categorisation of malicious attacks.   Malicious actions: Many cyber security threats are the result of malicious actions. Various methods can be  used by those with malicious intent to compromise IT assets or to perform elevation of privilege attacks  (where the attacker ends up with a different level of access). Each of these attacks often leads to risk of  breach of confidentiality, integrity, availability and should be considered in terms of the available attack  vectors for each asset in order to protect the safety and capacity of an airport (discussed in Section 3.2.2).  For the purposes of this report, major technical threats against Smart airports have been summarised into  nine categories:  ◦ Denial of Service: Denial of service (DoS) attacks impact on system availability and can enable well  equipped attackers to disrupt all but the most resilient of systems and networks. Jamming devices can  overshadow various kinds of wireless communications, such as Wi-Fi, and mobile telephony, and ATM  signals. Denial of service poses something of a challenge for network architecture, including Smart  airports where protection against mass DDoS may not be in place. Consequences can include network  outage, security check slow down, passenger delays, cancelled flights, loss of confidence, damages to  reputation, and/or financial damage.  ◦ Exploitation of software vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities may exist in Smart airport systems, including  security issues that the vendors of the IT/smart assets are unaware of, or issues for which a fix has been  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  27  created but not applied to the airport's systems. Any Smart airport systems with an available attack  surface that are not running with all the latest security patches are likely targets, and even systems for  which no security issues are known may be the target of sophisticated attacks7.  ◦ Misuse of authority / authorisation: Attackers may be in possession of credentials and/or authorisation,  and may misuse their privilege. Examples of attacks to gain this level of access include credential theft  via social engineering, such as spear phishing against airport personnel, or simply insider threats. Once  an attacker has gained a privileged level of access and/or holds a legitimate user's credentials (which  can also be the result of software exploitation, network interception attacks, or malware), the attacker  will be in a position to misuse the privileges, and the damage potential on the Smart airport depends on  the level of privilege obtained.  ◦ Network/interception attacks: Attacks can be network-based or focused on interception (including  physical tampering). This includes wiretaps, and physical tampering (including keyloggers, or internal  modification of assets). Depending on the attack surface and controls in place, networks or physical  devices in Smart airports may be the target of tampering or network attacks which could enable  attackers to compromise systems or communications.  ◦ Social attacks: Social engineering attacks manipulate people into divulging information or performing  actions on behalf of the attacker. Social attacks are effective as they circumvent technical and physical  controls. Airport employees who are not adequately security aware and trained on these issues, or who  do not follow procedures can pose a significant risk to airport cyber security; as the attackers may gain  full access to the victims’ accounts, identity, and authorisation12.  ◦ Tampering with airport devices:  This threat is that systems are tampered with in unauthorised ways.  Unauthorised modification includes data at rest, such as writing to central reservation systems (CRS),  passenger name records (PNR), airport administration IT solutions (including enterprise and human  resources management systems), or stored sensor data. The threat of tampering also includes  unauthorised modification of hardware or software, including modification of the behaviour of kiosk  devices (such as insertion of keyloggers or modification of firmware), or any IT and communications  systems. Data deletion or corruption is also another related threat. Tampering can have severe  consequences, as attackers can potentially gain complete control over systems, and can result in  malicious behaviour which can directly lead to breaches in physical safety and have an impact on  accountability and authentication.  ◦ Breach of physical access controls / administrative controls: This threat refers to a failure in the  verification of identity or authorisation. Breaches in authentication includes identity fraud, such as  impersonating a legitimate airport staff member, and breaches of physical access controls or  administrative controls, such as an attacker bypassing an authentication check, thereby gaining access  to a new attack surface (different systems they can interact with).  ◦ Malicious software on IT assets: Malware may become present on end user devices, including  passenger and staff devices, servers, or other smart components, such as sensor nodes or Supervisory  Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Malware can cause severe impact on infrastructure, and  business as the software acts maliciously, misusing its ambient authority on the computer it runs on.  Malware often propagates to systems via social engineering (tricking the user to action): for example,  by sending phishing emails to victims (spear phishing is where the attack is targeted). Malware can also  spread via direct exploitation of software vulnerabilities (not requiring user interaction), or through the  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  28  tampering of devices. 56The degree of harm malware is likely to cause to Smart airports is dependent on  whether the malware is targeted and launched by an advanced attacker, or simply has opportunistically  or automatically infected airport systems, and the motivation of the attacker.  ◦ Physical attacks on airport assets: This threat is that an incident can result in physical damage to assets  or other stakeholders, including passengers or bystanders. This includes explosives, sabotage, and  vandalism. Much of traditional airport security is focussed on physical safety; however, in terms of cyber  security, this also includes physical attacks on airport smart assets (such as theft of damage of airport IT  infrastructure) or control of assets resulting in damage.   Human errors: Another major category of threats are those caused by human error. Administrative IT  personnel or network administrators may make configuration errors that negatively impact operations or  security.  For example, configuration errors can lead to administrator defined secure passwords not being  set on devices before they are deployed. The impact of which can include system downtime, cancelled  flights, or introducing major security weaknesses. Similarly, end users, such as airport personnel, can  inadvertently introduce errors into systems, by entering incorrect information or data. Lost hardware, such  as laptops containing sensitive data or authentication details (passwords, or VPN certificates) can introduce  vulnerability and lead to subsequent attacks. Policies and procedures should be designed to avoid  inappropriate actions that increase risk; however, personnel may inadvertently not correctly follow these  due to insufficient awareness, negligence, or when falling victim to previously mentioned social engineering  attacks.   System failures: Failures and malfunctions also have a cyber security element, as they can impact on the  security posture and operational capacity of the airport. Failures include parts of devices, devices or systems,  disruptions of communication links, disruptions of main supply, disruptions of service providers, disruptions  of the power supply6, failures of hardware, and software bugs.   Natural and social phenomena: Natural and social phenomena, such as earthquakes, extreme weather (  e.g. flood, heavy snow, blizzard, high temperatures, fog, sandstorm ), solar flare, volcano explosion, nuclear  incidents, dangerous chemical incidents, pandemics, social disruptions ( e.g. civil unrest, strikes, military  actions, terrorist attacks, political instability) impacting airport operations, shortage of fuel, and space debris  and meteorites can impact the systems supporting critical business functions, and therefore pose a threat  to cyber security to Smart airports.   Third party failures: Third party service providers play a critical role in Smart airport operations. For  example, Internet-based smart technologies can rely on cloud service providers, Internet service providers,  and utilities (including power). Also, management or maintenance of IT systems may be outsourced to third- party remote maintenance providers. Any service interruptions by external third-party providers impact on  those business functions, e.g. recent incident at the airport of Rome9.  4.2.2 Threat modelling  In order to reason about security, it is helpful to clearly define the threat actors (who the potential attackers  are) and potential attack surfaces (how they can interact). Each of these threat actors have different attack  surfaces available within Smart airports. Threat actors in airports include:57   Insider threats: These are airport staff (any role) with malicious intent. Many staff members have access to  otherwise restricted areas, access to restricted IT systems, direct access to interconnected devices and  56 Blended attacks that use a mix of techniques such as firmware modification, VOIP DoS, HMI attacks ,etc.  could be also Included in this groups.  57ACRP, Guide Book on Best Practices for Airport Cyber Security, 2015.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  29  networks, and may be subject to lower levels of scrutiny. These actors require authorisation to carry out  their duties, yet may misuse their authority and may have more authority than they require. As a  consequence, the attack surface is the largest for these attackers.   Malicious airport passengers and guests: These attackers are physically present within the Smart airport.  They have restricted access to physical areas (unless controls are circumvented).   Remote attackers: These attackers are not physically present within the Smart airport, and include  automated attacks, such as malware, and targeted attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APT). This  limits these actors to remotely available attack vectors (but could also include remotely compromising  legitimate staff or passengers’ devices).   Other causes: Environmental or accidental equipment/software failure can cause security incidents, yet  have no active attacker.  Potential attack surfaces in airports include:   Physical interaction with IT assets: Physically present attackers (insiders or passengers/guests) can directly  interact with devices that they have access to. For example, an attacker can type into Common Use  Passengers Processing System (CUPPS) ticketing kiosks using the provided interface (potentially exploiting  vulnerabilities in the software), or may attempt to insert USB devices, if a port is available, or may physically  tamper with a ticket machine to capture or modify input, or to compromise the underlying computer.  Likewise, a physically present attacker may install a keylogger on a staff PC to capture passwords and other  inputs, or may simply approach a staff PC and begin interacting with it, potentially misusing the authority of  a staff member. This applies to any smart assets the attacker can directly access.   Wireless communication with IT assets: Attackers within range of the wireless technologies (potentially  including remote attackers, depending on the technology), can interact with or receive wireless  communications, including: Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) and other Radio-Frequency  Identification (RFID) based asset tracking systems, Wi-Fi, ground-based line of sight data-links, and Air Traffic  Management (ATM) signals, such as ADS-B.   Wired communication with IT assets: Attackers with wired network communications (including access to  the Internet) can interact with related IT assets including cloud services, and online reservation systems.  Attackers with physical presence may have direct access to network infrastructure (such as routers and  switches, or CAT5 cables that can be tapped), which they can connect to in order to communicate with other  connected smart devices.   Interaction with other staff or passengers: Rather than directly target airport assets, attacks may be  targeted at (or via) other staff or passengers. Reflected attacks (such as CSRF or reflected XSS) and social  engineering attacks can involve fooling or convincing a person to send commands or carry out tasks on their  behalf. Tampering with the environment, by inserting themselves into a position where they can intercept  and modify communications is a typical attack vector: for example, man in the middle, man in the phone, or  man in the browser, or by introducing rogue Wi-Fi access points.   Pivoting attacks between assets: As an attacker compromises a system a new attack surface becomes  available to them. For example, after compromising a publicly facing web server, the attacker may gain  access to an internal network segment and may use the web server to attack the airport intranet local area  network systems and/or disrupt the supply chain. Any smart asset that has the potential to be compromised  is a potential attack vector for any other connected systems. Therefore, compromised systems can have  cascading effects on overall airport cyber security  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  30  In the annex 4 “Asset exposure to cyber threats” the threat exposure of assets is presented. The threats to  airport cyber security apply to broad categories of assets, such as communication networks, servers and  control systems, internal/sensitive information, authentication and access control systems, and end-point  systems (which include PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones and other external installations, such as e- ticketing devices). The next Section gives more detailed examples of specific Smart airport infrastructure  assets that can be targeted by specific attacks.  4.2.3 Sample cyber security attacks  Table 4 illustrates a few samples of threats (previously described Section 4) and how they relate to airport  assets (described in Section 2), in terms of specific target elements and attacks. This list of examples  highlights likely attacks and is based on desktop research and expert interviews.  The good practices section  list the relevant good practices collected in chapter 5 “security good practices”.  Table 4: Sample Cyber security Attacks  ASSET: TARGET ELEMENT THREAT: ATTACKS GOOD PRACTICES  Airport Administration:  Enterprise Management  System  Social attacks: Personnel with access to highly sensitive data,  such as administrator authority to the enterprise  management system, e.g. enterprise resource planning  (ERP) software, are at heightened risk of social engineering  spear phishing attacks. Attackers create realistic and  incentivised scenarios, targeted to employees (such as by  impersonating co-workers). For example, sending a link to a  convincing fake website requesting existing credentials; the  attacker can then leverage those credentials to gain control  of enterprise management systems.  GP01, GP11, GP13, GP14,  GP33,GP34  Airline/Airside  Operations:  ATM navigation  communications  Network / interception attacks: ADS-B ATM and older radio  ATM technologies are typically unauthenticated, meaning  that a well-equipped attacker can broadcast messages or  overshadow existing signals. Similarly, GPS, which aids  navigation and positioning, is vulnerable to untruthful  signals, which can maliciously alter positioning.  GP3, GP10, GP11, GP12, GP26,  GP27, GP28, GP33, GP34, GP41,  GP42, GP43, GP44  Landside Operations:  Airport Landside  Operations Systems  Control Centre  Misuse of authority / authorisation: Personnel with high  levels of access are also high risk insider threats. For  example, personnel misusing their authority in the landside  operations systems control centre could misuse their  authority to send malicious commands to SCADA systems.  GP05, GP09, GP16, GP24, GP29,  GP30, GP31, GP32  Safety and Security /  Passenger Management:  Common Use Passengers  Processing System  (CUPPS) central  reservation system (CRS)  and ticketing kiosks  Tampering with airport devices: Common Use Passengers  Processing System (CUPPS) self-service ticketing kiosks are  located in public spaces, are operated by various airlines,  and are subject to tampering attacks, and software or  authentication errors that can result in boarding passes  incorrectly produced or provided to the incorrect person. If  CUPPS is compromised, central reservation system (CRS) and  passenger name records (PNR) could potentially be affected,  which can cause data leakage or service outage. A  compromised system such as this also grants the attacker  GP02, GP05, GP07, GP08, GP09,  GP10, GP11, GP12, GP13, GP15  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  31  with access to internal networks for further penetration  attacks.  Safety and Security:  Baggage Screening  Systems  Network / interception attacks: Wi-Fi is used extensively in  many airports, from passenger Internet access, to various  business functions. Insecure Wi-Fi networks have been  demonstrated to exist in airports, including insecure  networks for operations such as baggage scanning  systems.58 Attackers can gain access to insecure Wi-Fi  networks (for example, cracking WEP) and begin to interact  with systems on the network, such as launching further  attacks on baggage tracking systems.  GP02, GP04, GP05, GP08, GP10- GP13, GP16-GP25, GP27, GP28,  GP33-GP44  Customer Ancillary  Services:  Point-of-Sales Machines  Malicious software on IT assets: Malware can potentially  infect any device, though malware is often found on end- point systems. Point-of-Sales (POS) systems are often the  target of malware attack, and malware exists that targets  these systems, often resulting in fraudulent transactions.59  When any devices are infected by malware (such as POS in  smart airports) any shared network infrastructure can  enable infected systems to attack and compromise  connected systems, resulting in remote command and  control over critical infrastructure.  GP01-GP06, GP11-GP25, GP27,  GP28, GP33-GP44  IT and Comms:  Passenger Wi-Fi  Network / interception attacks: Attackers can intercept,  modify and replay passenger Wi-Fi signals. Attackers can  create rogue access points, by posing as a legitimate Wi-Fi  networks. On insecure Wi-Fi networks attackers can use  session hijacking attacks to take control of passengers'  online identities or alter booking requests.  GP02, GP04, GP05, GP08, GP10- GP13, GP16-GP25, GP27, GP28,  GP33-GP44  IT and Comms:  Cloud-based data and  application services  Denial of Service: Airports are increasingly dependent on  third party cloud-based IT services, such as office software,  email, and data processing services.60 Online services can be  impacted by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks,  which overwhelm servers with requests resulting in outage  of service. DDoS may cause outage of staff systems, online  reservation systems and other cloud-based services (such as  SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS).  GP01, GP05, GP07, GP08, GP11,  GP13, GP15-GP28, GP32-GP44  Facilities and  Maintenance: SCADA  (Apron)  Exploitation of software vulnerabilities: In recent years many  security vulnerabilities (and attacks) have been discovered in  industrial control systems (ICS) such as Supervisory Control  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Programmable logic  controller (PLC). Airports make extensive use of ICS systems  for controlling baggage handling, airfield lighting control  systems, HVAC, and Apron services.61 ICS is sometimes  GP01, GP05-GP08, GP11, GP14,  GP16-GP25, GP27, GP28, GP33- GP44  58Wireless vulnerability assessment – airport scanning report part II, http://www.mojonetworks.com/fileadmin/pdf/AirTight-Airport-Scan-Results- Part2.pdf.  59 Attacks on point-of-sales systems,  http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/attacks_on_point_of_sale_systems.pdf.  60 Guidebook on Best Practices for Airport Cybersecurity, http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rpt_140.pdf.  61 Cyber security for airports, http://www.ijtte.com/uploads/2013-12-30/5ebd908d-7f47-e96dIJTTE_Vol%203%284%29_2.pdf.  http://www.mojonetworks.com/fileadmin/pdf/AirTight-Airport-Scan-Results-Part2.pdf http://www.mojonetworks.com/fileadmin/pdf/AirTight-Airport-Scan-Results-Part2.pdf http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/attacks_on_point_of_sale_systems.pdf http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rpt_140.pdf http://www.ijtte.com/uploads/2013-12-30/5ebd908d-7f47-e96dIJTTE_Vol%203(4)_2.pdf  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  32  connected directly to the Internet; however, vulnerable ICS  may be attacked even when not connected to the Internet:  via USB, infrared, or connected wired or wireless networks.60  A successful attack typically results in the attacker gaining  full control over the ICS device, and the ability to send  malicious control commands.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  33  5. Attack scenarios  This study has identified three attack scenarios relevant to Smart airports based on current trends emerging  from the desktop research and experts’ insights. Indeed, the final three scenarios were selected based on  the experts’ recommendations taking into account which scenarios were identified by the majority of  experts as the most relevant. These three attack scenarios have been identified by the interviewed experts  as the most important in regards to security and resilience in Smart airports.  The attack scenarios are  presented in the following tables. For each of them, the table indicates: the type of attack; a more detailed  description of the scenario; the domains where those scenarios have been or could be potentially applied;  their likelihood; and the key users and stakeholders that actively take part in each scenario. Additionally,  security parameters are mentioned such as cascading effects, recovery time and efforts, assets involved, and  criticality. Finally, the table proposes which existing good practices could be deployed in each scenario in  order to enhance security and resilience.  The most specific and relevant good practices for the scenario are  listed at the beginning followed by more generic good practices.  The top five most relevant good practices  for the scenario are presented in bold.  Tampering with airport self-serving e-ticketing systems  Self-service check-in systems are operated and shared by various airlines and located in public spaces. Where  such kind of devices are unattended, physical access to these machines from a malicious user and/or attacker  can be an easy task. Self-serving e-ticketing infrastructures are becoming more and more used and shared  by multiple airlines, with third parties also starting to operate the service. This increases the complexity and  connections of the self-serving check-in infrastructure. The majority of these devices run commonly used  operating systems, such as (often obsolete versions of) Windows or Linux and kiosk ticketing software, which  are installed in a custom hard-shell case. These devices usually leverage intranet connectivity in order to  access content on company servers, and provide remote management functionalities.  These devices may  be subject to tampering attacks as they are in public spaces. Furthermore, the tempering attacks can be  assisted or conducted by an insider, for instance an employee of the third- party provider in charge of  operating the service. There are some tactics that insiders are likely to use in the course of preparing or  conducting their attacks; this includes manipulation (access gained by manipulating external staff).  Tampering may involve physically altering the hardware, such as gaining access to the contained PC via  picking a lock on the side of the device or drilling/punching a small hole through the side of the device; or  tampering with the interface between the passenger and the device by installing inconspicuous keyboard,  reader, or screen overlays; or exploiting a software vulnerability. Successful tampering can then result in the  attacker having unauthorised access to the machine and potentially lead to privilege escalation to super user  root/administrator access of this machine. This enables the attacker to change the behaviour of the machine  both in terms of the customer facing actions and the interactions with other connected systems. This can  potentially allow the attacker to: access passenger boarding passes, print arbitrary boarding passes,  invalidate and/or modify existing passenger passes (i.e. via record tampering) and steal sensitive passenger’s  data (i.e., passport or credit card details when these are used to initiate the check-in operation at the kiosk).  Criticality  Disruption of check-in services may create inconvenience to passengers (i.e., longer time for boarding) but  it might also lead to more serious service outage and further security risks involving safety (e.g. it might  assist with the boarding of unknown passengers into the plane).  Likelihood  Based on interviews’ key findings, this was one of the most cited possible attack scenarios. Airline companies  foster strongly the use of e-ticketing systems to speed up the check-in process via automation. This scale of  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  34  popularity, combined with a low level of control of check-in devices within the airport, make them a very  good/likely target for cyber-attacks. Unless these devices are equipped with the latest tamper-proof  technology and/or readers that encrypt data, they are highly prone – given their public locations – to criminal  tampering and are a perfect target for attackers.  Exploiting software bugs as well as systems that are not  often updated are seen by attackers as weak points to acquire access into check-in devices in order, for  instance, to add or modify passengers’ information.  Cascading effects  Once a check-in system is compromised the attacker can pivot from this device to attack connected systems  and databases. Also, in addition to any interruption or black out on the whole system, a threat that arises  here is the alteration of data aiming at whatever act that can compromise the safety of passengers, including  potential terrorist acts. Although the majority of airports use segregated networks, depending on the  effectiveness of the controls, cascading effects have the potential to impact on the entire Common Use  Passenger Processing System (CUPPS).

Often  third party providers will be involved in  managing part of the service (e.g. local area  network). This will require the whole chain to  react to the attack by providing the effort  needed to detect the flaw, and provide the  solution to fix it.   GP 07 – Disable services, close ports, restrict usage of external  devices   GP 10 – Data encryption   GP 01 – Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)   GP 08 – Conduct vulnerability and penetration tests   GP 22 – Conduct risk assessments   GP 06 – Operating systems updates and backups   GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach.   GP 26 – Require that providers of external information system  services comply with airport information security requirements  and/or be certified against relevant standards   GP 17 – Rely on an information security framework and external  audits to assess maturity and demonstrate compliance   GP 23 – Create a risk registry and monitor risk effectively   GP 34 – Provide basic security awareness training to all  information system users   GP 38 – Develop a contingency plan   GP 42 – Provide incident response capabilities for airports   GP 45 – Track and document information system security  incidents  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  35  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  The degree of interconnection among physical devises (in our case the kiosk) and ICT systems as well as among systems  is challenging since it opens up more vectors of attack for connected systems and entry gates to others (see Gap 8).  Another key challenge lies in the effective and efficient monitoring of check-in devices and all their components  (physical, hardware and software) due to the number of devices and spread and size of areas where they are located. In  addition, as underlined in the gap section there is a gap in industry models and guidelines on airport network  architecture, ownership, and remote management (see Gap 3). There are few guidelines and standards specifically  addressing cyber security practices in Smart airports, in particular in relation to the security of shared infrastructures  (software or hardware), which is usually the case for automated e-ticketing devices.  Network attack to the baggage handling  Airports make extensive use of ICS SCADA systems for baggage handling.62 Most ICS advanced systems allow  the centralisation of the baggage handling control and visualisation, display of the relevant data, control of  the site CCTV systems giving the operators all the information required to confidently and remotely make  their control decisions. SCADA are also becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent with  other airport information systems or airside systems, which may introduce additional vectors of attack.  Because of this interconnectivity, ICS SCADA systems are exposed to similar vulnerabilities as computers and  networked devices. Specifically, weak network security (e.g. poorly configured firewalls, interconnected  peer networks, weak authentication features, etc.) often combined with SCADA running old or not  updated/unpatched out-of-date software, allow attackers to open a backdoor and exploit weaknesses in  these systems: for example, a software vulnerability may enable the attacker to gain super user access.  Malware could be uploaded during patching (a key vulnerability) and with the collaboration of compromised  employees (i.e. insider threat). A successful attack on SCADA systems would then facilitate an attack on  physical airport infrastructure. The attacker may send malicious commands, such as halt baggage handling,  or disrupt normal operations of baggage handling.  Criticality  Depending on the severity of the cascading affect this could lead to significant disruption in disembarking  and loading procedures with a consequent serious disruption on the airside operations. Furthermore, similar  to the other scenarios, a further threat and cascading effect that could rise here is related to acts that can  compromise the safety of passengers, including: terrorist acts, such as the combination of a network attack  with the loading of explosives into the luggage in order to attack the aircraft; or the hiding of other illegal  products in the luggage (e.g. drugs).63  Likelihood  In recent years SCADA systems have suffered several cyber-attacks. The increasing interconnection and  interdependency between SCADA systems and other airport assets, together with the lack of security  countermeasures applied to them have opened up vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited.  Cascading effects  Once a malware is uploaded into an ICS SCADA this will disrupt the logic of the real time control system and  its components (e.g. system sensors, reading, etc.)  but also the functions of the dependent infrastructures.  62 ICS SCADA systems are used in airport to monitor and control several physical infrastructures ranging from air-conditioning, power supply  including airfield lighting to apron services (‘finger’ or air bridges).  63A similar attack has occurred at the port of Antwerp.

Due to the interconnection among  systems and possible cascading effects  this could require a significant effort from  several of the stakeholders involved.  Recovery time could be reduced by  prioritising which services should be  recovered first focusing on recovering the  most relevant in the first instance.   GP13 – Integrate shutdown procedure / remote deactivation of  capabilities for assets based on assets   GP 11 – Firewalls, network segmentation and defence in depth   GP 12 – Strong user authentication   GP 03 – Change default administrator credentials of devices   GP 01 – Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)   GP08 – Conduct vulnerability and penetration tests   GP06 – Operating systems updates and backups   GP 16 – Set up an information security management system and  implement international standards   GP 19 – Establish an inventory of the information and information  systems available   GP 22 – Conduct risk assessments   GP 23 – Create a risk register and monitor risk effectively   GP 24 – Perform continuous monitoring of information security   GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach   GP 35 – Provide specialised information security training   GP 38 – Develop a contingency plan   GP 42 – Provide incident response capabilities for airports   GP 43 – Train airport personnel in their incident response roles with  respect to the information system   GP 45 – Track and document information system security incidents  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  One of the key challenges in relation to SCADA is that cyber security good practices and countermeasures commonly applied  to IT infrastructure have not been applied to ICS. Another challenge is related to the increasing interdependence and  connection of SCADA with other airport systems. The degree of interconnections among systems increase the number of  vectors attacks while opening up back doors to connected systems. This increase in complexity and functionality requires an  enhanced approach to cyber security focusing on holistic assessments and planning (see Gap 8). ENISA has released several  guidelines on ICS SCADA security64.  64 ENISA ICS SCADA, http://enisa.europa.eu/scada  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  37  Drone intercept as mobile vehicle for jamming and spoofing aircraft-airport and  traffic control-airline communications  Drones, fitted with electronic devices, can be used to spoof, and jam aircraft-airport and traffic control- airline communications.  Aircrafts use the Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) system to  transmit their positions based on on-board navigational instruments and GPS technology. ADS-B broadcasts  information periodically and its signal can be received by the ground surveillance systems including air traffic  control centres and Approach Control Services, and also by aircraft in the vicinity when appropriately  equipped for receiving and processing this signal. ADS-B is unencrypted and unauthenticated, showing  aircraft ID, altitude, latitude and longitude position, bearing and speed.  ADS-B is used to support surveillance  in ensuring that aircraft are safely separated. Lack of authenticity, and, to a lesser extent, lack of encryption,  facilitate spoofing and/or jamming of communications, allowing a malicious person to inject false data or  disable sending or receiving messages into these real ATM Surveillance communications. Indeed, an attacker  may decide to spoof existing signals on the ADS-B frequencies in order to generate crafted and false ADS-B  messages, containing tampered information (e.g. fake GPS positions but also other fake information  contained in the ADS-B messages), which show aircrafts not existing in the air space on screens of the air  traffic controllers and/or lead to conflicting data between Air Traffic Control (ATC) and cockpit displays. This  may lead to different situational awareness pictures for pilots and ATC, provoke false collision warnings and  thus generate safety issues, while potentially impacting the airport flight management operations.  Criticality  The presence of mitigation actions, focusing on reconciling messages using primary and secondary  transmission sources (i.e. radar), means that criticality is medium.  However, in the case of a successful attack  the criticality should be considered high.  However, it is worth considering that the use of drones, as we see it nowadays, will develop into a possible  weapon (for instance ad hoc communication networks could be used to direct flocks of drones near jet  intakes or drones could be used to pass forbidden liquids or other dangerous materials and products over  the controlled perimeter of the airport). In the present and immediate future, beside any interruption or  disruption of airport flight management operations a threat that arises here is related to acts that can  compromise the safety of passengers, including terrorist acts.  Likelihood  The lack of encryption and authentication features in the ADS-B system together with low technical difficulty  required to perform the attack make the likelihood that an attack might occur high. Indeed, ADS-B equipped  planes are widely used and operating right now since many airlines worldwide have already embraced the  technology. In addition, ADS-B is expected to be mandatory in the United States and in Europe by 2020. This  will make this type of attacks even more likely in the near future. However, due to mitigation measures in  place, the likelihood that this type of attack would be successful should be considered as medium.  Cascading effects  Spoofing attacks on ATM infrastructure can affect the reliability of communications from aircraft to air traffic  control/airport and vice-versa as well as aircraft-to-aircraft communications. This can impair the entire  management of flight operations due to the injection of unreliable data into other information systems that  make use of these flight data.

The response time for the resolution of  the cyber security attack will be  proportional to the time taken from the  ANSP to resolve the situation.  Having the  required technical tools to identify fake  aircrafts may significantly reduce  recovery time and efforts especially in  case of single attacks.   GP 12 – Strong user authentication   GP 01 – Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)65   GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach   GP 35 – Provide specialised information security training   GP 40 – Train airport personnel in their contingency and disaster  recovery roles (specifically for air traffic control personnel)   GP 38 – Develop a contingency plan   GP 39 – Develop a disaster recovery plan   GP 42 – Provide incident response capabilities for airports (including  airlines)   GP 45 – Track and document information system security incidents   GP 37 – Maintain on-going contacts with security groups and  associations  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Communication systems and protocols, especially for legacy Air Navigation Systems, have not been developed with  security in mind since the emphasis was to provide an open and interoperable system and protocol. Interdependence  among systems and the combination of threat vectors resulting from the interdependence is a key challenge for cyber  security (see Gap 8).  In addition, effective legislation could control the production and operation of drones, at least for commonly used  ones, but also, to a certain extent, for military usage.66  There is also a need for more information sharing (see Gap 6) leading to quickly identifying early warning of  vulnerabilities and/or occurring attacks and multi-stakeholder enable security technologies (see Gap 7) that could offer  real-time authentication in a complex and interdependent multi-stakeholder environment.  65 This should also include appropriate procedures at Air Traffic Controller level to facilitate better reaction to such threat detection.  66 The military use of drones might represent the biggest threat in some cases.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  39  Attacks tools and techniques available  This section provides some more detailed examples of some of the tools, techniques and procedures  available to potential attackers. There are already many available hacking tools as well as general purpose  technical tools that an attacker can use in order to compromise airport security both in airside, landside and  terminal operations. One of these technical tools is Software Defined Radio (SDR) which is a radio  communication system that consists of a computer equipped with radio receivers (i.e. antennas, dongles)  and the appropriate software (i.e. SDR software). Antennas, dongles and SDR software can be easily  procured and then used to spoof, intercept and decode or jam any air-to-ground or air-to-air radio frequency  communications, such as ACARS, ADS-B etc. Attackers have also other means to compromise security in  airports by manipulating devices inside the airport, such as barcode scanners, biometric devices, point of  sales devices, self-serving check-in kiosks and SCADA systems where they apply common hacking methods  and techniques.  ACARS messages are transmitted in plaintext even though their content can reveal which aircraft is flying  nearby by decoding the flight number and aircraft registration details. While this information might not seem  as sensitive as the airplane location position that ADS-B messages carry, nonetheless it can provide  meaningful input to potential attackers67. To eavesdrop on ACARS messages, one needs to consider that the  worldwide frequency of ACARS transmissions is at 131.550 MHz. A list of all frequencies of ACARS (primary  and secondary) for Europe, US and other countries is available online68.  An antenna (e.g. a J-Pole antenna)  has to be placed within a specific range nearby an aircraft and ground stations as a radio scanner and it has  to be synchronized to the frequency of ACARS in order to receive these transmissions. Subsequently and  with the help of the dongle (e.g. RTL-SDR dongle) the intercepted transmissions are passed on to the ACARS  decoding software69, to decode and display the digital messages of ACARS. Moreover, online services70 which  are publicly available provide to anyone access to aggregated data from all over the world in order to either  locate aircrafts in real time or access real time ACARS web servers or even search for aircrafts, airlines and  flights through ACARSD search71 without the need of knowledge or any sophisticated cyberattack method.  In the case of ADS-B the process is along the same lines as in ACARS. However, whereas the J-pole antenna  could still be employed, other antennas72 have proven to be more suitable in receiving the vertically  polarized signal of ADS-B (it transmits at 1030 MHz for interrogation and 1090 MHz for replies). The Collinear  Coax Antenna is considered as the most suitable73 one for high quality reception of ADS-B signals. Subject to  the signal having been intercepted, software tools74 can decode ADS-B transmissions in a very effective  manner providing among other information the geolocation of all aircrafts in the range. A recent proof of  concept75 shows how easy it is to develop a homemade aircraft radar to collect the geolocation coming from  the ADS-B messages of nearby aircrafts. Another proof of concept76, has demonstrated the possibility to  mount replay attacks and to inject false data into an aircraft’s real ADS-B air-to-air communications rather  than simply intercepting these messages. ADS-B messages are both unencrypted and unauthenticated and  therefore an attacker can transmit falsified messages of this type thus succeeding in mounting an  67 European Aviation Safety Agency European Aviation confirmed the concerns about the Airplane hacking.

ADS-B is also susceptible to jamming attacks that can be performed by using only a ground-based radio- frequency source radiating within a specific range. Jamming, which implies disrupting the ADS-B frequencies,  is also an attack with high impact as it is capable to result in outage of the GPS service over an entire airport.  Drones and UAVs in general, that can be easily equipped with advanced computing and communication  capabilities are an additional means to perform spoofing, replay or jamming attacks in these days79.  Furthermore, attacks are not limited only to interception of air traffic messages and radio signals. Another  attack surface involves security compromises and manipulation of assets inside the airport. Such attacks may  affect both customer services and passenger management; for example, self-serving check-in kiosks can be  exploited via their input communication channels. Input channels that allow input from external users to a  device include USB, parallel, serial or Ethernet ports or even wireless connections, such as Bluetooth or Wi- Fi. Usually, ports such as USB are installed to support hardware or software update using peripheral devices.  However, there exists a wide variety of USB dongles80 and corresponding software81 that generate payload  which will force a device to execute commands and therefore exploits resulting in unauthorised modification  of hardware or software (e.g. installation of malware, key loggers). In case the compromised device is also  Internet connected, an attacker could be also able to execute remotely arbitrary code.  In another interesting recent proof of concept82, the manipulation of the flight ticket barcode scanner was  illustrated. While this is one of the many ways to manipulate barcodes83, in this case, the manipulated input  was the flight ticket barcode itself. Many tools84 offer the ability to convert a barcode to plaintext and then  modify the corresponding text. The simpler the logic of the coded plaintext is, the easier it can be  manipulated. This text can be modified through a notepad and then a new barcode can be generated using  specialized tools or online services85.  Additionally, ICS SCADA systems that reside on and support airport infrastructures86, e.g. utilised for many  functions such as baggage handling87, are equally exposed to vulnerabilities as computers and network  devices. In case these systems are connected to the Internet, the probability of being discovered through  SCADA specific online scanning tools88 is increased. Moreover, numerous metasploit modules89 and tools90  for fuzzing and vulnerability discovery facilitate network attacks since the discovery of vulnerabilities and  77 KGX 150/130 or PING-2020  78 GNURadio and Matlab  79 http://theconversation.com/are-drones-really-dangerous-to-airplanes-56770  80 Rubber ducky, usb armory, etc.  81 https://ducktoolkit.com/  82 http://www.slideshare.net/PrzemekJaroszewski/how-to-get-good-seats-in-the-security-theater  83 http://hackaday.com/2016/02/17/barcodes-that-hack-devices/  84 http://www.onlinebarcodereader.com/  85 http://www.barcode-generator.org/  86 http://www.schad-automation.com/en/industries/airport-scada  87 http://www.ats-global.com/baggage-handling_351_gben  88 https://shodan.io , https://www.censys.io/  89 https://scadahacker.com/resources/msf-scada.html  90 https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/bacnet-info.html  https://github.com/digitalbond/Redpoint  https://github.com/scadastrangelove/SCADAPASS  https://www.automatak.com/aegis/  http://gleg.net/agora_scada_upd.shtml  https://www.wurldtech.com/products/achilles  http://immunityinc.com/products/canvas/  http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner  http://theconversation.com/are-drones-really-dangerous-to-airplanes-56770 http://store.hackaday.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe https://github.com/inversepath/usbarmory https://ducktoolkit.com/ http://www.slideshare.net/PrzemekJaroszewski/how-to-get-good-seats-in-the-security-theater http://hackaday.com/2016/02/17/barcodes-that-hack-devices/ http://www.onlinebarcodereader.com/ http://www.barcode-generator.org/ http://www.schad-automation.com/en/industries/airport-scada http://www.ats-global.com/baggage-handling_351_gben https://shodan.io/ https://www.censys.io/ https://scadahacker.com/resources/msf-scada.html https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/bacnet-info.html https://github.com/digitalbond/Redpoint https://github.com/scadastrangelove/SCADAPASS https://www.automatak.com/aegis/ http://gleg.net/agora_scada_upd.shtml https://www.wurldtech.com/products/achilles http://immunityinc.com/products/canvas/ http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  41  exploitations can lead to possible attacks at a second hop, namely the airport IT & Comms. A recent  research91 reveals that a piece of malware targeting SCADA systems was discovered and most likely posed a  proof of concept of ICS attack techniques. A malware, named IRONGATE, was first placed to this system by  a dropper which installed the payload under certain conditions92. This malware unravelled a man-in-the- middle attack and could potentially cause unauthorised modification of hardware, software or data. This  particular case happening in a SCADA responsible baggage handling processes would greatly impact the  passenger management function of an airport.  91 http://www.securityweek.com/mysterious-ics-malware-targets-scada-systems  92 ibid.  http://www.securityweek.com/mysterious-ics-malware-targets-scada-systems  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  42  6. Security good practices  Securing Smart airports and staying ahead of evolving cyber threats is a shared responsibility, involving  governments, airlines, airports, vendors and regulators. Therefore, it is imperative to put in place a  collaborative model to set goals and define an appropriate cyber security approach to strengthen the  aviation system’s resilience against attacks. To this aim, significant effort is being invested across the aviation  community at different levels, including standardisation, security working groups, research and education.  Identification of challenges posed by cyber threats, risk assessment approaches and guidelines to enhance  cyber security, either in terms of high level governance strategies93,94 or in terms of specific technological  supports95, are priorities currently tackled.  In order to help both asset owners and all the actors involved in securing Smart airports, ENISA has taken  stock of the current good practices. These practices represent what exists at the moment and have been  consulted in order to form the groups of good practices and the categories for each one of them. As a result,  some of them are general and not airport specific practices. As noticed in the Gap Analysis Section (see Gap  1), existing good practices tend to be general with few specifically addressing cyber security practices in  Smart airports. The identified good practices for Smart airports are presented here and arranged according  to three main groups: Technical/tool-based; Policies and standards; and Organisational, people and  processes. Figure 9 presents the full mind map of the identified good practices. Each main group is then  discussed in details in the following sub-sections.

Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  47  7. Gap analysis and identification of areas of improvement  This section provides an analysis of the main gaps in relation to cyber security in smart airports. Gaps have  been identified via a comparison among the identified assets, vulnerabilities, threats and good practices.  Expert interviews were used to further identify and validate the gaps. Gaps to be addressed focused on  different areas, including: operational practices, policy and standardisation, and the need to develop more  comprehensive and integrated tools. This section summaries seven identified key cyber security gaps in  Smart airport.  While they are numbered 1 to 7 below, these gaps have not been ranked according to any  measure of importance.  Gap 1: Disparity of cyber security practices in airports  There is a disparity amongst airports in the methods and degree to which cyber security is addressed. While  certain airports are often described as having a very mature cyber security posture132, in the expert  interviews other airports admitted to having limited capabilities or resources dedicated to cyber security.  Poor practices include password reuse/sharing, a lack of a centralised centre for incident handling, and low  levels of cyber security awareness and prioritisation.  Individual airports are required to develop their own posture to cyber security, typically in relation to  adhering to various (mostly non-airport specific) guidelines and standards. Each airport is therefore  responsible for interpreting existing guidelines and standards, and adapting these to suit the context of an  airport. While many of the threats (as documented in Section 4) are common to the security of various ICT  systems, there are specific risks (such as public Wi-Fi and kiosks, and infrastructures with passenger risk to  life) and network design considerations that are specific to airports and critical infrastructure.  Existing security guidelines and standards (such as ISO27001133, EN16495,134 and EN16082135) serve an  important role in providing assurance that a baseline level of security processes is in place. However, there  is still a gap in that there are few guidelines and standards specifically addressing cyber security practices in  Smart airports, and those that do exist are not consistently applied.  Gap 2: Lack of a common approach and multi-stakeholders model on cyber security of  airports  There is not a common EU approach to cyber security of smart airports or a common multi-stakeholder  model on cyber security. Both could facilitate harmonisation of practises and interventions in a very  competitive environment, with the aim to protect public safety, regularity and efficiency of transportation  by air, and rights such as life in flight and on the ground. Furthermore, the rapid advance of technology and  the slower pace of the legislative processes, may lead to serious legal gaps within the future environment of  smart airports. These gaps might pose some challenge to both Member States and the European Institutions  to address security and safety of European citizens.136 The NIS Directive (NISD) is expected to provide some  directions and high-level consistency, especially in terms of baseline security measures and incident  reporting.  132 For example, see: ACI , “Cyber Security: Potential Impact on European Airports”, Briefing Paper.  133 ISO/IEC 27001 - Information security management http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001.  134 BS EN 16495:2014 Air Traffic Management.

This is complicated by the fact that each airport has many ICT networks being  operated within the airport, many of which the airport does not have direct control over. Networks in  airports include those supporting landside, airside and terminal operations systems; this includes  (sometimes multiple) passenger Wi-Fi networks run by external vendors, mobile telecoms and devices to  manage people and assign tasks, cloud-based infrastructure for the solutions to be deployed at the airport  for passenger management, CUPPS (Common Use Passenger Processing Systems) solutions for border  control, e-ticketing, and biometric controls. Each of these networks are often managed by, and externally  connected to, various external organisations. Critical and non-critical networks should be segregated. Many  networks and systems are remotely managed. The resulting airport cyber security landscape can be  described as having a large and complex attack surface.  The complexity of the situation and the lack of IT architecture reference models, suggests a gap in industry  models and guidelines on airport network architecture, ownership, and remote management. There is  currently no reference model that focuses on the IT architecture of smart airports that can be used to inform  the development of ICT and network security. Such a reference model should take account of the changing  ownership structure of airports that are increasingly being turned over to private hands with more  fragmentation of service providers in relation to the ICT network, clearly define the segregation of critical  and non-critical networks, and provide a common basis for designing network interoperability.  Gap 4: Evidence-based vulnerability analysis metrics and priorities  Risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests should be carried out on a regular basis  to identify potential security issues. Airports can formally define and assess risks and aim for compliance  with standards, such as ISO27001 and PCI DSS.137 Guidance on security assessments within aviation and  airports exists (CANSO Cyber Security and Risk Assessment Guide)138 as do generic and adaptable security  assessment approaches.139 However, there is little consensus on what metrics or standards should be used  to measure the cyber security of smart airports. There also lacks an evidence-based understanding of the  systems that are critical to the airport and incident control management: for example, what systems should  be prioritised in the case of an incident to best avoid panic that could cause further disruption and security  risk.  Gap 5: Threat modelling and architecture analysis  The software vendors surveyed for this research had detailed security processes in place for the  development of infrastructure components for airports. In one example, Microsoft Security Development  Lifecycle was used to design security into the systems that were developed. Formal threat modelling is used  to model the interactions of systems to identify and analyse potential security threats. However, there is a  lack of modelling of the networks in place at airports to analyse the interactions between systems and  networks for potential security issues within this airport environment. Introducing formal threat modelling  and architecture analysis to airport systems and networks may identify otherwise difficult-to-identify  weaknesses, such as insufficient authentication or validation between back-end systems.  137 Helping Airports Understand the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI  DSS)http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rrd_011.pdf  138 CANSO Cyber Security and Risk Assessment Guide  https://www.canso.org/sites/default/files/CANSO%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Assessment%20Guide.pdf  and ACI, “Cyber Security: Potential Impact on EU Airports.  139 Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) http://www.isecom.org/research/.  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rrd_011.pdf https://www.canso.org/sites/default/files/CANSO%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Assessment%20Guide.pdf http://www.isecom.org/research/  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  49  Gap 6: Information sharing  There is arguably the need for a collaborative platform for airports to share data with airport authorities and  national governments. Delegates tend to convene for physical security activities, but to date there is no real  network to collaborate on specific issues of cyber security, and this is reflected in the structure of the airport  and the security priorities within it. A data sharing platform would enable airports to share information on  new vectors of attacks, and early warning of vulnerabilities in systems to provide continuous improvements  of systems. Cooperation among cyber security agencies, law enforcement, industry, and academia would  further benefit information sharing.  Gap 7:  Multi-stakeholder trust framework and trust-enable security technologies  Smart airports are paving the way for a change in how airports operate; moving from an uncooperative and  independent approach to one that is cooperative and dependent.140 This is due to the number of  communication networked technologies and connected systems applied across the airport systems, often  belonging to different operators and displaying multiple interdependence.141 However, lack of trust among  the diverse operators and providers can hinder further development within Smart airports. As a result there  is a need for more advanced security IT infrastructures allowing the formation of transient trust within a  highly mobile environment.142 This could lead to further work and development combining light-weight  cryptography protocols (for light duty devices usage) and regular cryptography framework (e.g. PKI - Public  Key Infrastructure, for back- end infrastructures) as well as the exploration of implementation technology  and testbeds (e.g. elliptic- curve cryptography mutual authentication RFID).143 Furthermore, there is the  need for the identification and development of airport specific trust framework helping operators navigate  their trust relationships and dictate how the devices, sensors, readers and operators exchange data and  operate together (e.g. how much a passenger's smart phone can interact with the airport concession kiosk).  Within this trust framework, considerations around key management should also be addressed (i.e.,  identifying the actors generating the encryption keys- private/public keys, how these will be distributed and  who, i.e.  which agencies/companies/authorities, will eventually be given access to such keys when  necessary).144  Gap 8:  Lack of awareness and skills  This relates to the increasing move toward connected and interdependent systems and devices. Due to the  fast growing interconnect nature of Smart airport, operators are struggling to achieve a full awareness of  the new security landscape including the full range of cyber threats and boundaries for securing the Smart  airport perimeter. Moreover, there is the need to educate a new generation of experts and train them both  in safety and cyber security145; to increase awareness and promote education of passengers and airports’  personnel on the security risks posed by new technologies and ways to be prepared; and properly train  airports’ personnel and passengers on the use of the new devices and technologies.  140 Strohmeier Martin “On the Security of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Protocol”.  141 Boutin Nicolas,  Achim Fechtel, Hean Ho Loh, and Michael Tan, “The Connected Airport: The Time Is Now”, bcg.perspectives, January 2016.  142 Strohmeier Martin “On the Security of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Protocol”.  143 ENISA, “Fly 2.0”, 2010, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flying-2.0-enabling-automated-air-travel-by-identifying-and-addressing-the- challenges-of-iot-rfid-technology.  144 Ibid.  145 ARINC, Smart Airport: Connecting Airports, Airline and Aircraft, 2015.  javascript:ShowEmailClient('nbjmup;gfdiufm/bdijnAcdh/dpn') javascript:ShowEmailClient('nbjmup;mpi/ifboipAcdh/dpn') javascript:ShowEmailClient('nbjmup;ubo/njdibfmAcdh/dpn')  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  50  8. Recommendations  This section of the report provides some key, high level recommendations on how to enhance cyber security  and resilience within the Smart airport. Recommendations are mainly directed towards airport CISOs.  However, some recommendations have also been developed for policy-makers, service providers and  industry representatives. This is because enhancement of cyber security in Smart airports will require the  integrated efforts of all the stakeholders involved. Each recommendation has been developed based on the  information and analysis presented in earlier sections and insights from stakeholders. Below each  recommendation are brief explanatory notes.  Recommendations for airport decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of  Operations) and airport information security professionals  Prioritise cyber security for safety  Airport operators should prioritise cyber security to untimely promote the safety of passengers, personnel  and public in general. Cyber threats and risks will continue to grow driven by developments in technologies,  while the relationship between safety and security will become more and more interwoven. It is no longer  possible to be truly safe without also being secure. Therefore, it is responsibility of airport operators to  recognise the threat and to ensure that their organisation is adequately prepared and protected in order to  provide proper cyber security for safety. This is also aligned with regulatory development at the EU level  (see Annex 1) stressing the relevance of cyber security as a key enabler of safety, which is becoming  paramount in the aviation context. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and 8.  Establish a clear airport cyber security posture and allocate adequate roles and  resources  Substantial changes to business-as-usual processes are required to adequately safeguard critical assets,  satisfy regulatory requirements, and protect passenger security and airport business processes. In order for  such changes to be accomplished, the full support and leadership of smart airport senior executives,  together with a new and holistic approach to Enterprise Security Governance, is required. Responsibility for  cyber security should be clearly allocated by the board of directors and adequate roles and resources should  be clearly defined. Smart airports should envision the role of Chief Security Officer with senior leadership at  the CEO and board level and information security teams. This clear allocation of responsibility and senior  leadership will enable prioritisation of cyber security for safety within the whole organisation. Third party  responsibilities and roles should also be considered. Cyber security would be then promoted by senior  leadership at the CEO and board level and extend throughout the enterprise including third parties to foster  a more security-aware culture. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and indirectly 4, 5 and 8.  Revise cyber security policies and practices based on good practices monitoring  Airport operators should consistently review cyber risk management policies and practices to ensure that  they remain appropriate and effective in light of changing circumstances and risks. The establishment of  regular monitoring, via checks and penetration testing, and regular assessment of airport preparedness  should be linked to the revision of existing policies and practices so supporting an enterprise culture of  continuous process and technology improvement.  The revision of cyber security practices should be done  on an enterprise-wide basis. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and indirectly 4, 5, 7 and 8.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  51  Implement network-based, holistic risk and threat management policy and  processes for cyber security  Airport operators should have tailored risk and threat management policy and processes in place for cyber  security, which focus on network dependencies and the interactions between systems, and systems and  networks for potential security issues. This also needs to take into account the changing ownership structure  (i.e., third party providers and privatisation of key functions) and key operational aspects of Smart airports.  The interconnection among the different systems, which can offer vectors of attack for those systems and  entry gates to others, requires traditional aviation security to work hand by hand with ATM and aviation  safety from the perspective of technology, operations and human factors. This will improve awareness of  cascading effects and critical systems as well as support prioritisation efforts and promote consistency on  how to holistically manage cyber security risks within Smart airports. The focus is to implement  methodologies and processes for systemic/holistic risk assessment where threats and vulnerabilities are  analysed from the whole aviation perspective and not in isolation. This recommendation directly addresses  gap 1, 5 and 7, and 8.  Recommendations for policy-makers  Promote and facilitate the development of common guidelines, standards, metrics,  awareness and knowledge exchange on cyber security for smart airports  Relevant EC institutions and agencies (e.g., ETSI, CEN, CENELEC, ENISA, DG MOVE, European Civil Aviation  Conference, ECAC, etc.) together with international organisations (e.g., IATA and ICAO, etc.) should facilitate  and promote, via open coordination initiatives, the use and development of common standards, guidelines  and metrics aimed at enhancing cyber security in smart airports. These should be further supported by  organisation at the national level, e.g. Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs), providing implementation  recommendations. In addition, awareness initiatives and the cross-exchange of know-how and practices  among airport operators should be supported to leverage lessons learned and existing good practices. These  actions would enable the identification of common standards and guidelines in areas where these are  currently less effective and mature (e.g., how to design a new smart airport; how to measure the security of  a smart airport and monitor threats including threat modelling and architecture analysis; networked  architecture; ownership, and remote management; evidence-based vulnerability analysis metrics and  priorities; data retention practices; etc.). Such guidelines and common practices could be based on the work  of IATA, ICAO, ENISA, ECAC, ETSI and/or national CSIRTs. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1, 2,  3, 4, 5 6 and 8.  Facilitate the development of accreditation and third party auditing for cyber  security in Smart airport  EU institutions should facilitate the development of accreditation schemes aimed at cyber security in Smart  airports as well as third party auditing of Smart airports’ operations related to cyber security. General  objectives of such initiatives could either be to generate new certification strategies or harmonise existing  ones, with the aim of ensuring that certification frameworks, targeted to Smart airport security operations,  are adequate to meet existing and new EU requirements. Moreover, moving to greater mutual recognition  among EU countries, increasing transparency of procedures, and improving the level and quality of  interaction between approval and auditing bodies could raise the efficiency of the Smart airports in Europe  and support constant improvement in EU security technology aimed at Smart airports. This recommendation  directly addresses gap 1, 3, 4 and 5.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  52  Recommendations for industry representatives  Collaborate with key stakeholders in the development of specific standards for  cyber security products and solutions  Industry representatives should actively collaborate with airport operators and relevant European and  international organisations (e.g.., ETSI, CEN, CENELEC, ENISA, DG MOVE, IATA and ICAO) in the development  of security standards and specifications tailored to Smart airports’ products and solutions. This will lead to  coordinated efforts to strengthen cyber security for Smart airports, while reducing market fragmentation  for cyber security products. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and 3.  Work with airport operators to develop products and/or solutions that are aligned  to their cyber security requirements  Airport manufacturers and providers should work closely with airport operators to align their solutions  and/or products to the cyber security requirements, needs and affordability-levels of airport operators.  Solutions should be specifically tailored to address both existing gaps and the specific needs of airport  operators (for instance working together to develop advanced interdependent threat analysis tools, and  technologies that enable security in a multi-stakeholder environment). Products should also be developed  by employing a security-by-design approach. This recommendation directly addresses gap 4, 5 and 7.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  53  9. Annexes  Example of information security incidents impacting airports operations  DATE COUNTRY DESCRIPTION  August  2016  US  Thousands of air passengers around the world were left  stranded after a power cut forced the US airline Delta to  suspend flights.146 The overnight power failure took  place in Atlanta, near Delta's headquarters, causing  computer systems to crash. Airport check-in systems,  passenger advisory screens, the airline's website and  smartphone apps were all affected by the system  failure.  July  2016  Vietnam  Attackers successfully attacked Vietnam's two largest  airports and the nation's flag carrier, Vietnam  Airlines147. The attackers briefly hijacked flight  information screens and sound systems inside the two  airports. Instead of departure and arrival details, the  airports' flight screens and speakers broadcasted what  local media described as anti-Vietnamese and  Philippines slogans, in turn prompting authorities to  shut down both systems.  Vietnam Airlines’ website,  meanwhile, was also seized and transferred to a  malicious website abroad, while passenger data  pertaining to an undisclosed number of its frequent  flyers was published online as well. As a result of this  attack Vietnamese authorities will carry out a  comprehensive check on Chinese devices and  technology to ensure information security at the  Vietnamese airports since it is feared that the Chinese  hacker group 1937cn might be responsible for the  attacks.148  July  2016  IT  A third party failure at Rome’s Fiumicino airport caused  the shutdown of the automated passenger check-in  system, which in turn caused two hours’ delays for the  passenger checking operation.149 The failure was  related to the internet connection (Fastweb) that the  146 Delta: Power cut strands thousands of passengers, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37007908.  147 Cyberattack claims multiple airports in Vietnam, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports- vietnam-airli/.  148 Vietnam to inspect use of Chinese technology following cyberattacks on airports, http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use- of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports.  149 Aeroporto di Fiumicino, ore di stop e code al check in per un guasto alla connessione,  http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada- 144357812/?ref=HREC1-6.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37007908 http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports-vietnam-airli/ http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports-vietnam-airli/ http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6 http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  54  automated passenger check–in at the airport uses for  accessing and processing passenger data.  April  2016  UK  After landing, the pilot of a British Airways flight from  Geneva reported a collision with a drone while  approaching the London Heathrow airport on the 17th  April.150 The incident highlighted the issues faced with  regard to drones. While the threat of bird strikes has  been well researched, there is still little data about how  much damage a drone could cause to an airplane.151  April  2016  Worldwide  The civil aircraft manufacturer Airbus Group is hit by up  to 12 cyber-attacks per year, mostly in the form of  ransomware and hostile actions carried out by state- sponsored attackers.152 Airbus’ chief information  security officer cited an instance of ransomware  compromising a computer, used by an employee offsite,  which then (after the computer was connected to the  company's intranet) spread over Airbus' corporate  network, encrypting the contents stored on the hard  drives of several machines.  November  2015  France  In November 2015, a bug due to obsolete versions of  the operating systems in use caused disruptions at the  Paris Orly airport.153 The failure affected a system  known as DÉCOR, which is used by air traffic controllers  to communicate weather information to pilots who  usually rely on such a system when weather conditions  are poor. DÉCOR runs on Windows 3.1, released in  1992.154  June  2015  Poland  In June 2015, around 1,400 passengers were delayed at  Warsaw’s Chopin airport when the flight plan system  went offline after its servers were overloaded by  fraudulent information requests as part of a Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.155 As a result the airport  was not able to create flight plans and outbound flights  were not able to depart.156 This resulted in a 5-hour  150 ‘Drone’ hits British Airways plane approaching Heathrow, with no damage caused,

Each legal instrument has been  categorised according to whether its implementation effects: Air Traffic Management; Protection and  Processing of Passenger Data; Technical Standards (including inspections); Minimum Standards on Basic  Aviation Security; and/or Security Risk Management.  EU EXISTING LEGISLATION  Title Domain(s) Description Impacts on Smart airports  EU Network  Information Security  (NIS) Directive188  Security Risk  Management; Air  Traffic Management;  Minimum Standards  on Basic Aviation  Security  It places a duty on operators of  essential services (including  airports) to manage the risks  posed to the security of networks  and information systems which  they control and use in their  operations. The broad aim of the  proposed Directive is to again,  ensure a common (high) level of  network and information security  across Member States that will  require operators of essential  services such as energy,  transport, and key providers of  information society services (e- commerce platforms, social  networks, etc.), as well as public  administrations to adopt  appropriate steps to manage  security risks and report serious  incidents to the national  competent authorities.  Imposes new network and information  security requirements on operators of  essential services including Smart  airport operators and their third party  providers, and digital service providers  (DSPs). Those organisations are also  required to report certain security  incidents to competent authorities or  Computer Security Incident Response  Teams (CSIRTs). Each EU country must  establish these teams, the Directive  says. Different security and incident  reporting rules will apply to operators of  essential services than to DSPs, with a  lighter touch framework applicable to  DSPs.  Commission  Implementing  Regulation (EU) (EU)  2016/1377  of 4 August 2016  laying down common  requirements for  service providers and  the oversight in air  traffic  management/air  navigation services  and other air traffic  management  Air Traffic  management  The Regulation 2016/1377 laying  down common requirements for  service providers and the  oversight in ATM/ANS and other  ATM network functions (repealing  Regulation No 482/2008,  Implementing Regulations No  1034/2011 and No 1035/2011  and amending Regulation No  677/2011) and its relevant  Acceptable Means of Compliance  (AMC) and Guidance Material  (GM). It combines theory and  practical exercises based on both  ATM and non-ATM examples of  Set up common requirements for ATM  and ANS providers and the declaration  of political relevance of security in  general, and especially the relevance of  security as a key enabler of the  (aeronautical) safety, which is  paramount in the aviation context.  Specifically , air navigation services and  air traffic flow management providers  and the Network Manager shall take the  necessary measures to protect their  systems, constituents in use and data  and prevent compromising the network  against information and cyber security  threats which may have an unlawful  188 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of Council  concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and  information security across the Union (COM/2013/048 final - 2013/0027 (COD)). http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52013PC0048.

IDS can  be categorised as follows:   Network based intrusion detection systems focused on the analysis of  network traffic and the detection of broader actions (i.e. network scan,  vulnerability assessment, spoofing, etc.) either from outside or internal  attackers   Host based intrusion detection systems which are able to analyse  activities on the host (e.g., servers, workstations, embedded devices,  etc.)  and raise an alert in case of events such as unauthorised access to  applications, escalation of privileges, modification of file systems,  connection of peripherals, etc.).  IDS alerts should be investigated and acted upon, e.g. via forensic  investigation. IDS implementation should ensure compliance with relevant  standards (e.g., ED-153).  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Exploitation of (known or  unknown) software vulnerabilities  -Network/interception attacks  -Social attacks  GP02 – Antimalware: Computers should run antimalware software (also  known as antivirus) to detect and remove and/or quarantine malicious  software. This includes but is not limited to: kiosk devices, IT equipment,  Common-Use Passenger Processing Systems (CUPPS), SCADA, and Cloud- based data and application services, etc. It is also recommended to use multi- engine anti-virus solutions to check against maximum virus signatures in  order to better protect available resources.  Malicious actions  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Tampering with airport devices  -Misuse of  authority/authorisation  GP03 – Change default credentials of devices: Devices, connected to the  airport network, such as routers, access points, IP-cameras and/or  surveillance cameras connected to closer networks, should be properly  configured and default user accounts should not be used, or should have the  default password changed. In addition, when not required, remote access  should be disabled to prevent cyber criminals from attempting remote  connection to devices. For critical assets, password enforcement policy  should be implemented, avoiding the adoption of computationally weak  passwords.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Breach of physical access  controls  GP04 – Bring your own device (BYOD) controls: Airports should typically  prevent employees from connecting their own personal devices to airport  systems (including via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or VPN), and where this is not  appropriate apply effective technical controls to protect the airport and the  network infrastructure from rouge or compromised devices. Due to the lack  of control on BYOD mixed infrastructures, these appliances should be kept off  the perimeter of relevant servers and services and network access of these  devices should be regulated by individual credentials associated to the device  (for example, using digital certificates). Wherever possible, these devices  should operate under a policy based infrastructure while joining the airport  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Breach of physical access  controls  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Network/interception attacks  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  71  IT domain, giving a more restricted environment (i.e. restriction of  peripherals usage via group policy).  GP05 – Monitoring and auditing for malicious insiders:  This includes:  A:  Logging systems: Log files should be managed and monitored to review  system and user activity across airport systems.  B: Real-time monitoring: Log files should be stored securely, and should  enable non-repudiation. For example, a security information and event  management (SIEM) software solution enables a centralised system for real- time analysis of recorded events including events correlation and alerting  B: Integrity management: Integrity management solutions should be used to  monitor systems for unauthorised changes: for example, modified software  on a shared server.  C: Data Loss Prevention (DLP): DLP systems can be used to detect and/or  prevent sensitive data at rest (such as an employee copying sensitive files  onto a USB storage drive) or in-motion (being copied over a network). This  can be combined with periodic, without notice, activity auditing of users. In  order to prevent data leakage, a special attention to stenographic  communication should be paid, due to this emerging approach in establishing  covert channels in restricted environments. Networks should be scanned for  rogue access points.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Breach of physical access  controls  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Network/interception attacks  -Tampering with airport devices  GP06 – Software and hardware updates: Software should be regularly  updated to avoid cyber criminals exploiting patched software vulnerabilities  to get access to devices and related data storage. Therefore, the airport  system administrator should plan a software update procedure to ensure  systems are kept up-to date so mitigating the possibility of security attacks.  The ‘window of vulnerability’ refers to the time taken for a vulnerability being  introduced into the software (such as a programming mistake), its discovery,  vendor fix, and eventual updates applied to systems to remove the  vulnerability. Applying security patches is an important practice that reduces  the exposure to known vulnerabilities.  Disposal of obsolete hardware has to be done carefully to prevent access to  specialised hardware and software (i.e. interfaces and software for baggage  security scanning hardware interaction) or data (activity logs, stored  credentials) from devices at their end of life. Physical or logical destruction of  end-of-life hardware, software and data should be ensured.  Malicious actions  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Misuse of  authority/authorisation  -Social attacks  Employ secure  digital access  controls to networks  and data  GP07 – Security hardening of systems:  Airports should reduce systems’  surface of vulnerability (i.e. attack surface) by for instance disabling services,  closing ports, restricting usage of external devices, regular patching of  systems, etc. This is particularly relevant for systems in the demilitarised zone  (DMZ)199.Network devices should not have services enabled that are not  required as this provides additional attack surface, which may be exploited  by malicious users. For this reason, system administrators should disable  those services that are not needed and also should close or block connections  that are not required.  External device access should be controlled and authorised only on explicit  requests. Access to external peripherals (i.e. USB storage drives) should be  denied wherever possible, in order to prevent data leakage or unauthorised  introduction of software. Internet activity (i.e. web navigation, and social  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Tampering with airport devices  199 DMZ or demilitarised zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an  organization's external-facing services to a usually larger and untrusted network, usually the Internet.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  72  network activities) should be subject to filtering, either for security scanning  purposes or white/black listing.  GP08 – Conduct security assessments and penetration tests: Airports should  undergo various forms of security assessment, to detect security  vulnerabilities and assess their impact. Vulnerability assessment involves an  automated scan of connected systems; these scans should be regularly  performed (potentially automated on a daily basis) to detect changes in the  security posture of the airport network. Vulnerability management solutions  make this potentially within the preview of airport system administrators.  Each relevant segment of the airport infrastructure can be scanned in a  distributed fashion, and credentialed scans can also improve scan accuracy.  Penetration tests should be performed to provide a more thorough offensive  assessment of the capabilities of a network, and such tests are typically  required from the airport by external parties200. Other more advanced forms  of security audit include threat modelling and architecture analysis, which can  be applied to airport systems to identify otherwise difficult-to-identify  weaknesses, such as modelling complex interactions between legacy systems  and smart components. Additionally, periodic vulnerability scanning should  be done in combination with hardening (see GP 07) to ensure systems are  always updated and secure.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Network attacks  -Breach of physical access  controls / administrative controls  GP09 – Least privilege and data classification: All users, processes,  passengers, and airport employees should be granted the least level of  privilege/authority necessary to enable them to perform their function.  Airport data at rest should be classified to ensure that information is only  accessible to those that need access and data classification should be part of  any information security management system (see GP016). This can help to  ensure data for airport use cannot trivially be made public. Security personnel  should consider the use of access policies that define which users have access  to the data, and enforcement mechanisms that protect on real-time the  access of the data from unauthorised read. Access to sensitive data should be  under mandatory access control (such as role-based-access-control, RBAC,  policies), and should be reviewed and subject to external auditing on a regular  basis. Access to data should be logged and logs should be stored in a secure  location, to prevent unauthorised alteration. Furthermore,  privacy impact  assessment  and privacy by design, based on the EU General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR), should be also followed for proper data and information  management.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  Human errors  -Operator/user error  GP10 – Data encryption: The use of encryption should be used to protect  sensitive information exchanged in the network from eavesdroppers, and to  protect data at rest. Insecure protocols, such as WEP and unencrypted Wi-Fi  networks should be avoided. Encryption should be configured using peer- reviewed and academically sound standard solutions to protect data. The use  of encryption, such as VPN, can enable employees to be remotely connected  with the airport service keeping a high level of secrecy in the data exchanged.  Critical devices that are unable to communicate over the network of  encrypted channels should be connected via hardware security modules to  implement secure data transfers across unsecure networks. Traffic  encryption should occur at both endpoints of mainstream link from airport  site and their counterpart at connectivity providers to ensure the privacy of  data communications. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware isolated  execution environments should be used to do all cryptographic operations  (e.g., secret key generation and encryption/decryption) to prevent  sophisticated attacks (e.g., cold boot attack). Many modern PCs provide such  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Network/interception attacks  200 Helping Airports Understand the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS),  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rrd_011.pdf.  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rrd_011.pdf  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  73  tamper-resistant capabilities. Encryption related to open and interoperable  systems, such communication systems used by ATC, might require further  developments both in technologies (e.g., non-cryptographic schemes and  public key) and trust framework (see section on gaps and recommendations).  GP 11 – Firewalls, network segmentation, and defence in depth: The border  of the airport network infrastructure should be protected by perimeter  firewalls to block untrusted connections between networks, such as remote  connections to airport systems. Firewalls should be configured to only allow  access to required ports and services and for specific transportation  protocols, like TCP or UDP. A defence in depth approach should be taken to  improve network security by further restricting traffic between network  segments and hosts: for example, using VLANs for traffic separation,  firewalled segmentation, and end-point controls. Separation of airport  functions communications should be enforced. Defence in depth is an  important security concept, as it can limit the impact of a breach in a specific  control: additional layers of communication security, such as authenticated  secure communications (such as, HTTPS) should be employed, combined with  the multitude of best practices, including least privilege.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Social attacks  GP 12 – Strong user authentication: IT services provided by airports should  be protected by the use of authentication, such as username and password  credentials. Moreover, sensitive or remote services should require access  only via multifactor authentication, in which identity is verified via multiple  forms of authentication, such as digital certificates, authentication tokens,  One-Time Passwords (OTP), or trusted IP addresses. Biometric identifiers,  such as fingerprints, facial image and iris-patterns can be introduced.  Biometrics techniques are intended to be employed for traveller  identification at border checks, as explored by the Smart Borders Pilot  Project.201 However, biometrics could play an increased role also as  authentication support in Smart airport protection. Persistent failed  authentication attempts should be blocked or rate limited. This will mitigate  the risk of brute force or dictionary attacks.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  Other  GP13 – Integrate shutdown procedure / remote deactivation of capabilities  for assets based on risk: Compromised services or devices should be  configured to foresee the presence of remote shutdown procedures that  switch-off services or devices to avoid data loss. Airport operators should  have the ability to remotely shut-down or deactivate certain  capabilities/functionalities of these assets to minimise damage/loss and  internal incident response capabilities should be established to avoid  individual, panic driven, actions. However, a risk assessment should weight  the advantage of enabling remote shut down (when hacked) against the  disadvantage of opening up another hack-opportunity through the remote  access itself.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Network/interception attacks  -Social attacks  -Tampering with airport devices  GP 14 – Application security and secure design: All airport systems including  bespoke websites and tools should be developed with security implications  and best practices under consideration. Secure design should be part of  System/Services/Technology Acquisition. It should be combined with airport  assets under provisioning risk assessment, privacy by design principle, and  security criteria requirements. Thorough testing, static code analysis and  fuzzing can help to ensure security vulnerabilities are not introduced during  development. A formal approach such as the Security Development Lifecycle  (SDL), including threat modelling, provides rigour to development and ensure  potential security issues are considered and mitigated. Websites should be  Malicious actions  -Social attack  --Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  201 Smart Borders, EU-LISA, http://www.eulisa.europa.eu/AboutUs/SmartBorders/Pages/FAQ.aspx.

GP 15 – Disaster recovery plans for IT assets: Technical procedures should be  in place to restore the operation of critical IT assets in a Smart airport to an  adequate level of service in case of an emergency, and therefore a disaster  recovery plans must be carefully designed. Both technical and organisational  aspects must be included in such a plan, and people involved in these  operations must have a clear view of their roles, the sequence of actions to  be performed, the actors involved and so on. The disaster recovery plan  should be revised annually, or earlier, if major changes in IT infrastructure  occur.

Relevant standards on information  security management include ISO/IEC 27001, which defines the technical  specifications of an information security management system (ISMS), and  ISO/IEC 27002, which provides guidelines concerning the selection,  implementation and management of information security controls.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  GP 17 – Rely on an information security framework and external audits to  assess maturity and demonstrate compliance: Organisations following  international standards on information security management should rely on  an information security framework (e.g. NIST Cyber Security Framework), as  well as external audits, for measuring progress, identifying gaps and  demonstrating compliance. To attest their contribution to supply chain  security, organisations involved in air traffic management should get certified  as compliant with the above-mentioned standards by a third-party  institution.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  Third party failures  -All  GP 18 – Appoint an information security officer: A security officer should be  appointed, with the mission and resources to coordinate, develop, implement  and maintain an airport-wide information security program plan. The security  officer should be an individual possessing the professional qualifications,  including training and experience, required to administer the airport's  information security program functions and should focus on security duties  as his/her primary responsibility. Information security as a function should  have the necessary resource to operate effectively and should be separated  by IT so as to be independent. In formation security officer should report  directly to C level executives or be high enough to be able to apply controls  throughout the organisation.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  Third party failures  -All  Programme  management  GP 19 – Establish an inventory of the information and information systems  available: An inventory of all the information collected and the information  systems maintained across the airport should be developed. As a first step in  the system security planning activity, the information and information  systems collected or maintained should be categorised based on the  objective of providing appropriate levels of information security according to  impact.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  75  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICE  THREAT GROUPS  ADDRESSED  GP 20 – Develop, monitor and report on the results of information security  measures of performance: The performance of the airport's information  security program and the security controls utilised to support the security  program should be measured, monitored and reported. Measures of  performance are outcome-based metrics employed for measuring the  effectiveness or efficiency of the information security program and the  security controls in place for supporting the program. Guidelines for the  development and implementation of an information security measurement  programme are provided in NIST's 'Performance Measurement Guide for  Information Security'.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  Risk assessment/  management  GP 21 – Classify information systems according to information classification  policy: The aim of security categorisation is to describe the negative effects  that may be suffered by airport operations, assets and individuals in case of  damage to airport information and information systems. The results should  be documented in the airport information system security plan, and be  subject to review and approval by the authorising official or an authorising  official's designated representative. The use of security categories should be  combined with vulnerability and threat information for the purpose of  assessing the risk to which the airport is exposed.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  GP 22 – Conduct risk assessments: Risk assessments include the  determination of the likelihood and magnitude of harm resulting from the  unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction  of the information system and the information being processed, stored or  transmitted. Risk assessments take into account vulnerabilities, threat  sources and security controls planned in order to evaluate the level of  residual risk based on the operation of the information system. Formal  methodologies currently in use for risk assessments related to airport  information security include 'EBIOS' and ‘MEHARI’. Guidance on how to carry  out risk assessments may be found also in NIST's 'Guide for Conducting Risk  Assessments'.

This should include a configuration  management process for the airport's information system, a determination  of the security impact of changes to the information system, a security  control assessment on the monitoring strategy, a continuous reporting on the  security state of the information system. Continuous and effective  monitoring may be supported by the use of data gathering technologies such  as:  o Asset management tools, allowing to keep an inventory of all the  hardware and software in use at the airport, track their life cycle and  remotely handle single assets;  o Network management tools, allowing to automate device configuration,  ensure device compliance with pre-defined policies as well as detect  unauthorised software/hardware on the network;  o Information management tools, allowing for the monitoring of data  coming from hardware and software equipment, mobile applications,  stationary client devices, cloud-based data and application services as  well as other relevant sources.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  Natural and social phenomena  -All  Third party failures  -All  GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach: Risk management should be carried out following  a sound methodological approach and in line with existing international  standards. Standard ISO 31000 provides a set of principles and generic  guidelines for managing risk within an organisation and to incorporate risk  management objectives into the organisation’s strategic, management and  operational tasks. 'Magerit' is a specific methodology used within the aviation  sector for implementing the risk management framework defined by ISO  31000.  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  System & services  acquisition  GP 26 – Require that providers of external information system services  comply with airport information security requirements and/or be certified  against relevant standards: An external information system service is a  service that is used by the airport but it is not a part of the airport's  information system. The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising  from the use of external information system services rests with the  authorising official, who requires that an appropriate chain of trust be  established with external service providers when dealing with the many  issues associated with information security. To enhance trust in the supply  chain, accreditation (i.e. the process of obtaining formal approval by an  authorising official) may be supported by certification against relevant  standards. Standard CEN - EN16082 lays out a set of quality criteria for the  delivery of civil aviation security services to public and private clients.  Third party failures  -All  GP 27 – Enforce explicit rules governing the installation of software: Airports  should rely on software and associated documentation in accordance with  contract agreements and copyright laws. They should employ tracking  systems for software and associated documentation protected by quantity  licenses to control copying and distribution, and controlling and documenting  the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability  is not used for unauthorised distribution. Specific rules should be established  as to which types of software are permitted and which are prohibited.  Such  rules should be applied to users of stationary client devices (e.g. desktops,  ports, workstations, etc.) but also to airport personnel using portable and  mobile devices, thus improving the level of security of 'bring your own device'  Malicious actions  -All  Human errors  -All  System failures  -All  Third party failures  -All  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  77  CATEGORY GOOD PRACTICE  THREAT GROUPS  ADDRESSED  airport staff policies. Software policies can be enforced using trusted  firmware and digital signatures.  GP 28 – Require developers/integrators to create and implement a security  and privacy assessment and evaluation plan, combined with a verifiable  flaw remediation process: Security test and evaluation process results are  used whenever there have been security-relevant modifications to the  information system subsequent to developer testing. A verifiable flaw  remediation process should also be implemented to correct security and/or  privacy-related weaknesses/deficiencies identified during the testing and  evaluation process. In the evaluation phase, information security criteria  must be completed by the vendors and software development should be  carried out following systems development life cycle (SDLC). Airport  components that may be subjected to security and privacy assessments  include: hardware and software IT equipment, mobile applications, Web  browsers and applications, database systems (e.g. human resources  management, staff records management, etc.), authentication systems (e.g.  badging systems, staff authentication systems) and intrusion detection  devices (e.g. Perimeter Intrusion Detection Systems).

Requiring airport employees to undergo biometric identification prior  to being issued access credentials can be beneficial for mitigating the risk of  identity fraud. Screening may be supported by enhanced CCTV surveillance and  monitoring at critical areas and entry points.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of  authority/authorisation  GP 30 – User access management: Logical and physical access authorisations  to airport information systems/facilities should be reviewed for personnel. User  access management and periodic review of user access rights should be  established. In more mature organisations, an Identity Access Management  System should be established to control effective provisioning of accesses to  various systems. Additionally, Privileged Access Management can also be  applied as technical control in order to monitor and protect privileged accounts.  There are cases that privileged users are also Third Parties, therefore, such  aforementioned controls are imperative to protect critical operations. To  prevent unauthorised personnel from gaining access to restricted areas,  policies and penalties may be put in place, directed at enforcing the  requirement to immediately report employee separations as well as lost, stolen  and unaccountable badges.

These airports are  implementing new smart components to offer travellers a portfolio of services that spans from self or  automatic check-in, baggage & document check, flight booking management and way finding services to  automated border control and security checks.  Smart components can be defined as any networked ICT system that has a data processing capability  ranging from aggregating simple data to extracting insights to support human decisions and/or triggering  an automated response. These components while enhancing the user experience, they also pave the way  for new attack vectors and expose airport assets to a larger attack surface. Therefore, airport decision  makers need to acknowledge the threats emerging from smart components, increase their awareness of  security implications and improve the security of their infrastructure in order to enhance safety for  passengers and all airport stakeholders.  In response to these new emerging threats faced by smart airports, this report provides a guide for airport  decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of Operations) and airport information security  professionals, but also relevant national authorities and agencies that are in charge of cyber-security for  airports. Based on an in depth examination of existing knowledge as well as validation interviews with  subject matter experts, this report highlights the key assets of smart airports. Built on this, a detailed  analysis and threats mapping was conducted with a particular focus on the vulnerabilities of smart  components. With the feedback from airport subject matter experts, a series of attack scenarios was  developed to underline the increased attack surface and challenges when smart components are  integrated in the traditional IT airport systems.  On the basis of this analysis, a number of good practices for securing smart airports is identified in order to  support Information security professionals and airport decision makers in their security efforts and risk  management activities. The goal of this study is to provide airport operators with a start-up kit to enhance  cybersecurity in smart airports. The study additionally identifies gaps on different areas, including:  operational practices and the need to develop clear airport cyber security postures.  As the result of this work a total of eight recommendations for enhancing the security and resilience of  Smart airports in Europe are presented, tailored specifically towards decision makers, airport operators  and industry.  Recommendations for airport decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of Operations) and  airport information security professionals:   Prioritise cyber security for safety   Establish a clear airport cyber security posture and allocate adequate roles and resources   Revise cyber security policies and practices based on good practices monitoring   Implement network-based, holistic risk and threat management policy and processes for cyber  security  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  08  Recommendations for policy-makers   Promote and facilitate the development of common guidelines, standards, metrics, awareness  and knowledge exchange on cyber security for smart airports   Facilitate the development of accreditation and third party auditing for cyber security in Smart  airport  Recommendations for industry representatives   Collaborate with key stakeholders in the development of specific standards for cyber security  products and solutions   Work with airport operators to develop products and/or solutions that are aligned to their cyber  security requirements.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  09  1. Introduction  Objectives and scope of the study  The objective of this study is to improve the security and resilience of smart airports, including air traffic  management for what is relevant to the functioning of smart airports.  This is in order to prevent disruptions  to smart components that could have an impact on the service and safety being delivered to passengers,  while also promoting cost benefits and protecting the environment. The aim is to provide guidance to  airports to help them ensure a seamless, safe and secure passenger experience.1 This is in the context of  ENISA’s role specified in EC Communication “Internet of Things – An Action Plan for Europe” and its support  for the implementation of the Network Information Security Directive. 2  Smart airports introduce new components and functionalities to facilitate the infrastructure-to-passenger  interaction and vice-versa.3 This improvement paves the way for new attack vectors or pathways and  exposes airport assets to a larger attack surface. Therefore, airport decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors  and Head of Operations) and airport information security professionals need to identify new threats  applicable to smart components, increase their awareness of security issues and improve the security of  their infrastructure in order to enhance safety through the most relevant good practices.  In this study smart airports are defined as those airports implementing smart components, which are value- added services built on the top of traditional legacy infrastructures. Such components and services aim to  produce a more seamless, secure and safe passenger experience via digital assistance and automation.4  Figure 1: Airport High Level Representation  1 Please note that privacy is not in scope for this report.  2 See: European Commission, Communication from the commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic an d Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Internet of Things — An action plan for Europe, COM(2009) 278, Brussels, 18.6.2009; and ENISA,  “ENISA’ s Position on the NIS Directive”, January 2016.  3 Boutin Nicolas, Achim Fechtel, Hean Ho Loh, and Michael Tan, “The Connected Airport: The Time Is Now”, bcg.perspectives, January , 2016.  4 IATA (2015).

The study is also relevant for all organisations that need to ensure the security of  their ‘smart’ integrated solutions and services they offer to airports. In addition, due to the supply chain  characterising smart airports and the dependencies among airport operators, this report can also be of  benefit to companies involved in the airport supply chain, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSP)  and Air Traffic Management (ATM) operators, as well as relevant national authorities and agencies that are  in charge of cyber security for airports.  Why cyber security is important for airports  Smart airports were included under the umbrella of smart infrastructures in the ENISA Work Programme  2016.5 The aim was to identify major airports that developed and operated smart services and to take stock  of the security challenges arising from usage of these services. Indeed, there has been an increase in  information security incidents, including both cyber-attacks and ICT dependencies disruptions, experienced  by the aviation sector worldwide, which has been widely reported in the press in recent years. Table 1  provides a timeline of the 2016 information security related incidents in airports, which illustrates their  potential prevalence and impact, and the relevance of this work. A more detailed list is available in the annex.  In this study, ENISA aims to provide good practices and recommendations, for airports as well as relevant  public authorities, which address these challenges.  Table 1: Example of 2016 information security incidents impacting airports operations  DATE COUNTRY DESCRIPTION  August 2016 US  Thousands of air passengers around the world were left stranded after  a power cut forced the US airline Delta to suspend flights.6 The  overnight power failure took place in Atlanta, near Delta's  headquarters, causing computer systems to crash. Airport check-in  systems, passenger advisory screens, the airline's website and  smartphone apps were all affected by the system failure.  July 2016 Vietnam  Attackers successfully attacked Vietnam's two largest airports and the  nation's flag carrier, Vietnam Airlines7. The attackers briefly hijacked  flight information screens and sound systems inside the two airports.  Instead of departure and arrival details, the airports' flight screens and  speakers broadcasted what local media described as anti-Vietnamese  and Philippines slogans, in turn prompting authorities to shut down  both systems.  Vietnam Airlines’ website, meanwhile, was also seized  and transferred to a malicious website abroad, while passenger data  pertaining to an undisclosed number of its frequent flyers was  published online as well.

April 2016 UK  After landing, the pilot of a British Airways flight from Geneva reported  a collision with a drone while approaching the London Heathrow  airport on the 17th April.10 The incident highlighted the issues faced  with regard to drones. While the threat of bird strikes has been well  researched, there is still little data about how much damage a drone  could cause to an airplane.11  April 2016 Worldwide  The civil aircraft manufacturer Airbus Group is hit by up to 12 cyber- attacks per year, mostly in the form of ransomware and hostile actions  carried out by state-sponsored attackers.12 Airbus’ chief information  security officer cited an instance of ransomware compromising a  computer, used by an employee offsite, which then (after the  computer was connected to the company's intranet) spread over  Airbus' corporate network, encrypting the contents stored on the hard  drives of several machines.  Methodology  This report was developed using a combination of desktop research as well as information from interviews  with key stakeholders. The goal is to define and cover the entire IT perimeter of smart airports, drawing on  the approach outlined above13 that incorporates assets inside airports, connected assets outside the airport  and dependencies on the airway. The approach taken follows the ENISA methodology developed over the  last three years based on the ENISA threat landscape approach, and involved:   Mapping assets and developing a threat taxonomy that covers possible attacks via desktop research, and  validating and/or identifying further gaps through interviews with security experts working in the field of  airport information security.   Enumerating possible attacks that target or affect smart components in airports.   Developing good practices and three attack scenarios with mitigation actions to provide information on  practical examples of implementation, and validating these with security experts working in the field of  airport information security.   Performing a gap analysis based on desktop research and interviews.  8 Vietnam to inspect use of Chinese technology following cyberattacks on airports , http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use- of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports.  9Aeroporto di Fiumicino, ore di stop e code al check in per un guasto alla connessione,  http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada- 144357812/?ref=HREC1-6.  10 ‘Drone’ hits British Airways plane approaching Heathrow, with no damage caused, http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/04/drone-hits-british- airways-plane-approaching-heathrow-with-no-damage-caused/.  11 'Drone' hits British Airways plane approaching Heathrow Airport , http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36067591.  12 How Airbus defends against 12 big cyber attacks each year, http://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks- each-year-418131.  13 Please see Section 1.1. on the objectives and scope of the study.  http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6 http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6 http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/04/drone-hits-british-airways-plane-approaching-heathrow-with-no-damage-caused/ http://www.airportwatch.org.uk/2016/04/drone-hits-british-airways-plane-approaching-heathrow-with-no-damage-caused/ http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36067591 http://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks-each-year-418131 http://www.itnews.com.au/news/how-airbus-defends-against-12-big-cyber-attacks-each-year-418131  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  12   Proposing recommendations for future steps in cyber security for airports in Europe.  Initial results from the desktop research were further consolidated with information acquired during the  interview process, specifically in relation to the development of assets, threats, cyber-attack scenarios, good  practices and recommendations. A comparative approach was employed in relation to the threats and assets  in order to identify asset exposure to cyber threats. This was further validated via interviews with asset  owners (i.e. individual airport operators) and a mapping approach was then employed to establish links or  connections between assets, threats, good practices, and gaps with the focus on enhancing cyber security  within the Smart airport perimeter.

Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  13  2. Key aspects in Smart airport cyber security  Within the context of this study, the “Smart airport” concept has been shaped from the vision for the future  of air travel that the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is promoting.14 IATA envisages for the  future “air travels [that] should be simple, smooth and hassle free”.15 Such objectives could be met by means  of offering the travellers a suite of advanced solutions and services that will cover aspects such as self or  automatic check-in, baggage check, document check, flight rebooking, boarding and bag recovery. At the  same time, Smart airports promise to guarantee improved security. Linked to the concept of Smart airport,  IATA introduced the concept of “smart security”, defined as: “a risk-based system that aims to offer a fast  and hassle-free passenger screening experience at airports while strengthening security and improving  operational efficiency.”16 Smart security “envisions a continuous journey from curb to airside [in which]  passengers will proceed through security with minimal inconvenience, with security resources allocated  based on risk, and with airport facilities optimised.”17  The definition of Smart airport that will be used throughout this document refers to airports making use of  networked, data driven response capabilities that, on the one hand, provide travellers with a better and  seamless travel experience and, on the other hand, aim to guarantee higher levels of security for the safety  of the passengers, operators and general public. These networked data driven response capabilities tend  to be referred to as smart components. In the context of this report these smart components are defined  as any integrated Internet of Things (IoT) components to bring added-value services that has a data  processing capability ranging from aggregating simple data to extracting insights to support human  decisions and/or triggering an automated response.  The foreseen increasing reliance on network  technologies (including the Internet) raises, nonetheless, obvious security concerns.18 Devising strategies for  securing smart airports in face of cyber-attacks and ICT dependencies disruptions is one of the objectives of  this study.  Smart components that lie internally and externally to the physical location of the airport are also included  in the scope of this research.  Any single device that is connected to a network of such systems, even those  with minimum or no data processing capabilities, is contained in the airport perimeter overview. As a result,  key functions underpinning network communication systems between aircraft, airports, air traffic control  and other forms of communication are also in scope of the study. This also encompasses providers of  common services and network infrastructures, including passenger and baggage processing technology.  Figure 2 shows which criteria are applied to define the scope of the airport perimeter in the context of this  study, bringing together the physical location of assets and functions related to airport operations, the  ownership structure and assets or functions defined as ‘smart’. This study has endorsed a more  encompassing view of what constitutes the Smart airport perimeter.  This view recognises the importance  of dependencies and interactions among assets and functions related to the overall operation of a Smart  airport rather than the location of ownership of such functions and/or assets. As a result, functions and/or  assets that might not be owned and/or located within the airport but they are important for the overall  14 IATA website, http://www.iata.org  15 IATA (2015).

For instance, this in the case for Air Traffic Management (ATM),  which the majority of airports do not own any more.  Figure 2: Scope of the Smart Airport Perimeter - Criteria  Key stakeholders in Smart airports  The Centre for Air Transportation Systems Research19 in their analysis of airport stakeholders identified two  conceptual stakeholder boundaries with regard to the functions and operations of airports. In most cases,  regional airport authorities operate airports as “public utilities providing infrastructure to service providers  and their supply chain under revenue neutral financial regulate”.20 These public entities work to balance the  interests of all of their stakeholders to build the airport infrastructure, lease space to service providers and  ensure that service providers meet the needs of seamless, safe and secure air travel services to the  passenger. In so doing, two distinct boundaries are generated in the analysis of airport stakeholders:   Airport Organisational Boundary, which depicts the limits of what is controlled or owned by the airport  authority or management. This relates to the design and configuration of airport infrastructure (including  IT infrastructure) and the operational processes and procedures that underpin the efficiency of its own  organisation.  19 Scharr, D., Sherry, L. (2011) Analysis of Airport Stakeholders, Centre for Air Transportation Systems Research, The Volgenau School of Information  Technology and Engineering, http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/pubs/ICNS_Schaar_AirportStakeholders.pdf  20 Ibid.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  15   Airport Service Boundary, which incorporates the airport supply chain and support services that lie  outside direct management control of the airport authority. This includes many IT and support services  that are important to the functioning of the airport, but are mainly operated and maintained by third  party suppliers.  Figure 3 maps the key stakeholders that contribute to the functioning and operation of the Smart airport,  making a distinction between those stakeholders that lie outside the direct boundaries and/or management  of the airport and those that lie within the airport organisational boundary. Based on existing related  literature19, Figure 3 provides the high level grouping of the airport key stakeholders21 , while Table 2  describes each identified stakeholder group and provides additional sub-groups within the main grouping.  Figure 3 Smart Airports: Key Stakeholders  21 For the sake of clarity, figure 3 shows a simplified representation of key stakeholders which emphasises the main interactive actors within a Smart  airport.  Above all for the service boundary reality is somehow more complex and porous since several information and data providers might involve,  for instance in the case of Google Maps with information overlaid/integrated from multiple industry and non-industry sources, providing services  directly to the Passenger.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  16  Table 2: Definition of Airport Stakeholder Groups:  STAKEHOLDER DEFINITION/EXPLANATION  Passengers  Customers of the airport, who travel between the ground and air transportation modes or wait for a  connection between two flights.  International/EU  Organizations  International and EU organisations participate in the airport system by providing international best  practices, regulatory standards for the operation of the airport and the management of international air- space. With regard to Air Traffic Management (ATM), organisations such as EUROCONTROL collect and  distribute flight information and/or plans among national air traffic controls to optimise Air Traffic Flow and  Capacity Management (ATFCM) operations across Europe via the Central Flow Management Unit (CFMU).  National Government  National Government participates in the airport system in two different ways: a) as an operator, focusing  on air traffic control services, transportation systems, security (e.g. baggage handling and screening, and  customs and immigration); b) as a regulator with regulations applying to airport infrastructure and service  providers within airport systems.  Local Government  Local Government is usually responsible for the strategic direction of the airport (in terms of planning  decisions) and for appointing airport management, depending on the ownership structure. It also  represents the views of local communities and contributes to capital investment projects.  Industry/Third-Party  Service Providers  Service providers are private operators that offer services to air carriers and general aviation users. Services  provided might include: 1) Air traffic management (i.e., Air Navigation Service Provider, ANSP), 2) fuel  management; 3) baggage handling and screening; 4) cargo processing services; 5) kiosk devices (e.g. e- Ticketing); 6) Way-finding services; 7) transport systems; 8) IT and Comms services; 9) security services; etc.  Surface Transport  Operators  Surface Transport Operators provide surface access to the airport and include rail services, taxicabs, buses,  private rental cars and the subway/underground, while parking services may be provided both on and off  the airport by the airports organization or private enterprises.  Airport Operators  The airport organisational structure varies and can be comprised of an individual airport or a group of  airports managed by the same organisation e.g. MAG in the UK is a single organisation that operates  Manchester, Stansted, Bournemouth and East Midlands airports.  Airlines  An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines  utilise aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for  codeshare agreements. Generally, airline companies are recognised via an air operating certificate or license  issued by a governmental aviation body.  Airport Suppliers  Airport suppliers have the airport itself as the end-customer and includes various contractor, consulting and  equipment suppliers.  Concessionaires  Airport Concessionaires operate passenger services in terminal buildings and may include food and  beverage services, retail and accommodation.  EU cyber security policy in civil aviation  At the international level the most important legal instrument on civil aviation security is given by Annex 17  to the Chicago Convention , “Security – Safeguarding International Civil Aviation against Acts of Unlawful  Interference” approved by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Council.22 The primary  objective of such instrument is safeguarding passengers, ground personnel, crew as well as the general  22 Annex 17- Security: Safeguarding International Civil Aviation against Acts of Unlawful Interference,  http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/annex_17_security_safeguarding_international_civil_aviation_against_acts_of_unlawful_interferen ce.htm.  http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/annex_17_security_safeguarding_international_civil_aviation_against_acts_of_unlawful_interference.htm http://www.icao.int/secretariat/PostalHistory/annex_17_security_safeguarding_international_civil_aviation_against_acts_of_unlawful_interference.htm  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  17  public against any acts of unlawful interference. At the European level, EU policy activities in commercial  aviation are undertaken by the European Commission (EC) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)  that was established by EC regulation no 216/2008.23 EU-Lisa, an EU agency responsible for managing and  promoting information and communication technology (ICT) in the area of justice, security and freedom, has  also supported EU cyber security policy related to aviation above all in relation to border security24. Similarly,  Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) has also provided support with studies and technological  developments. 25 The majority of policies at EU level tend to focus on civil aviation in general with some of  them also dealing with cyber security for safety within aviation.  The ones dealing with cyber security also  include concrete actions and outcomes through the use of action plans and/or the setting of specific  objectives. Examples of these plans are:   The European Aviation Safety Plan 2016 – 2020 by EASA26 published in 2015. 27 The plan outlines key  safety actions to address emerging cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in civil aviation. This has  arisen, in part, due to the need for new generation aircraft to have their systems connected to the  ground in real time with new Air Traffic Management (ATM) technologies requiring internet and wireless  connections between the various ground centres and the aircraft. The use and multiplication of network  connections serves to increase the vulnerability of the system as a whole.   The Air Traffic Management Master Plan by SESAR (2015)28 together with a set of solutions tested in  real-life operational conditions with airlines, airports, air navigation service providers and  manufacturers. The plan includes the development of an EU framework for cyber security that  encompasses regulatory, policy and operational functions across multiple stakeholders including the EU,  national and local service providers.  At the EU regulatory level, existing EU Directives and Regulations are categorised as follows, with individual  analysis and refences for these Directives and Regulations provided in Annex 2:   Harmonising rules across the European Community governing the protection of European citizens in  the context of civil aviation, including the protection and processing of passenger data.   Ensuring ATM security and safety in regards to air space security, personal security, computer network  system security and cyber security (e.g. Commission Implementing Regulation,  EU No 1035/2011).   Creating interoperability of Air Traffic Management (ATM) across European Community defined  airspace. In regard to ATM, EU regulators commonly formulate European Airspace Policy,  establish a  legal framework for Member States and ensure that legislation is implemented correctly through  regular inspections and oversight.  23 Their role is to draft implementing rules in all fields pertinent to the level of protection for EU citizens in aviation, to certify and approve products  where EASA has exclusive competence (e.g. airworthiness), to provide support to Member States in the field of air operations and air traffic  management and to promote the use of European and worldwide standards.  24 Smart Borders and eu-LISA, http://www.eulisa.europa.eu/AboutUs/SmartBorders/Pages/default.aspx.  25 SESAR ‘s study on cyber security in ATM, http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/all-news/study-details-rd-roadmap-atm-cyber-security.  26 In a communication from the European Commission in 2015 to the European Parliament, EASA was asked to address cyber-risks in civil aviation in  order to ‘foster security by design and to establish the necessary emergency response capability. As part of its role, EASA will offer support to European  aviation security stakeholders on the prevention and response to information related security incidents by raising cyber security awareness (cyber  security promotion initiatives); advising the EC on aviation cyber security policy/regulatory matters; and—advising the EC, MS or the European  Aviation Crisis Coordination Cell (EACCC) in case of an aviation cyber security crisis.

It is  not unusual that a producer has to produce different versions of the same type of aircraft and/or  equipment depending on the country where it is used. Other regulations lay down procedures for  conducting Commission inspections in the field of air safety standards.   Detailed measures for the implementation of common basic standards on aviation security, in  particular airport security, airport planning requirements, access control and so on.   Rules governing  network information security for critical infrastructures (e.g., Network Information  Security Directive see Annex).  Airport IT architecture and stakeholder interactions  The Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP)29 depicts IT system architectures in airports by organising  four conceptual categories in a layered fashion. All IT systems can be categorised into one of the four layers:   Physical Layer. The cabling and fibre infrastructure that provides the foundation for all IT systems in use  at the airport and is made up of the non-electronic physical components, including copper cabling, fibre  optic, or other components that provide for cross-connection structures.   Networking Layer. Communication systems incorporate the electronic components that send cable or  wireless signals. These systems underpinning the network layer communicate data and information  using the wired physical layer and/or wireless infrastructure. The physical components include routers,  switches, gateways and wireless access points. These IT and Comms systems can be broadly categorised  as Local Area Network (LAN) (wired and wireless), Wide Area Network (WAN) (wired and wireless), and  Virtual Private Networks (VPN).   Service Application Layer. The application layer contains all the systems that support the operations of  the airport. There are numerous smart application systems that have been identified as part of the  Assets MINDMAP30.   Integration Layer. The integration layer allows all applications that are crucial to the operations of the  airport to co-ordinate and share information amongst themselves. It allows systems to be directly linked  together or share a common data or information pool in order to make better informed decisions.  Systems integration is also a key pillar of the Smart airport.  Complex technical infrastructures, such System Wide Information Management (SWIM) and Airport  Operations Plan (AOP), developed by SESAR, would combine several layers in their architecture.31  Figure 4 shows some of the interactions across the different IT layers, key stakeholders and key airport  activities. This indicates that there are several dependencies and collaborations occurring within the airport.  29 ACRP (2012) Information Technology Systems at Airports: A Primer, http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rpt_059.pdf.  30 Please see Figure 6.  31 SESAR Factsheet - Airport Operations Management, http://www.eurocontrol.int/publications/sesar-factsheet-airport-operations-management;  and http://www.sesarju.eu/sesar-solutions/swim.  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rpt_059.pdf http://www.eurocontrol.int/publications/sesar-factsheet-airport-operations-management  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  19  Figure 4: Airport Stakeholders and Interactions  User experience in Smart airports:  the end-to-end passenger journey  Smart airport is seen principally as technology or IT systems that connect the airport and the passenger. This  covers a number of different smart systems that support the end-to-end passenger journey. Cisco (2009)32  provides a detailed map of the end-to-end passenger journey that starts from the home and finishes with  the arrival at the destination: as illustrated in Figure 5, End-To-End Passenger Journey. Their report suggests  that airports, airlines and other stakeholders “can provide a superior passenger experience by taking an  integrated approach to every touchpoint along the passenger journey”.33  Figure 5: End-to-End Passenger Journey (source: CISCO 2009)  32 CISCO, “Smart Airports: Transforming Passenger Experience to Thrive in the New Economy”,  http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/pov/Passenger_Exp_POV_0720aFINAL.pdf.  33 Ibid.  http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/ac79/docs/pov/Passenger_Exp_POV_0720aFINAL.pdf  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  20  Indeed, smart technology is perceived as the means towards innovation and the improvement of customer  experience, personalisation of services, targeted information flow (to the right people at the right time) and  interactive services through the use of physical IT infrastructures, such as beacons, sensors, wireless  infrastructure and mobile applications. At a technology level, this could mean automated passenger  announcements or updates linked to data within the Flight Information Display System(FIDS) or the use of  Near Field Communication (NFC) to allow passengers to interact with their choice of travel providers at every  stage of their journey. At a higher level, this indicates a full focus on the end-to-end passenger journey,  involving many interacting services.34 Any activity that automates management of airport business in  relation to the processing of passengers can be defined as a characteristic of the Smart airport, that either  supports the decision-making process through the provision and acquisition of up-to-date data or facilitates  automated processes that reduce manual actions and prevent human error.35  In order to support an end-to-end passenger journey experience, system integration is paramount. This  allows all applications that are crucial to the operations of the airport to co-ordinate and share information  amongst themselves. The concept of SWIM (System-Wide Information Management)36 and Airport  Collaborative Decision Making (CDM)37 cover a complete change in paradigm for how information is  managed and shared across the whole European ATM system.38 This is underpinned by the circularity of  information or data exchange among key stakeholders involved in air traffic navigation, including EU  organisations (i.e., EUROCONTROL Network Manager)39, airport operators (i.e., Airport Operation Centre  and Air Traffic Control), airlines (i.e., Airline Operation Centre and aircraft) and airport providers (i.e., air  navigation service providers, ANSPs). This shows the interdependencies between systems and sub-systems,  which are crucial to managing airspace (reflected by the Single European Sky, SES) and the control and  management of airport operations. This type of systems integration is facilitated by directly linking digital  systems or infrastructure together (through shared services) or by forming a common data or information  pool that is accessible and updated regularly in real-time. The results are common infrastructures that  facilitate collaborative decision-making between a disparate federation of critical infrastructure owners and  operators to ensure the continuity of service at airports, and efficiency in the management of airspace that  extends to service providers beyond the airport.40 Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC, 2015)41 also  discusses system integration among key stakeholders as an important feature of the Smart airport with  collaboration enabled technology implemented across business units and functional silos through the  utilisation of centralised and shared service strategies. The result is a set of information and data systems  that are accessible to key stakeholders  within the airport but also outside service operators and in some  cases, passengers.  34 CISCO has identified several smart service’ categories, focused on the passenger journey, such as transport and parking, the processing of  passengers through the airport and bespoke business to business services.

Physical security  controls and passenger screening have experienced substantial reform and cyber security has become an  increasingly important aspect, as illustrated in Table 1 with the list of recent cyber security related incidents  involving airports. These changes have simultaneously opened up opportunities for improving cyber security  and safety (i.e. proper network integration can improve cyber security, while CDM can also enhance cyber  situation awareness and safety) while increasing security and safety risks. The UK's Centre for the Protection  of National Infrastructure (CPNI) produced a report in 2012 on cyber security in civil aviation42. The report  noted that cyber security is an increasingly important issue. Reasons cited for this increased risk were:   Security is not currently covered by safety management   Aviation is increasingly making use of new and unfamiliar technologies   IT systems are becoming increasingly interconnected; this exposes operators to risks in other people's  systems.  CPNI provides also a concise summary of the cyber security issue in aviation, directly linking cyber security  to safety:  \"Cyber security is an issue because many civil aviation organisations rely on electronic systems for critical  parts of their operations, and for many organisations their electronic systems have safety-critical  functions.\"43  Particular to cyber security, risks constantly change as new threats and vulnerabilities surface along with  ever-changing technology implementations. It is no longer possible to be truly safe without also being  secure. This means that cyber security has a major stake in providing safety.  The challenge is to address  security issues not only to enhance security but also to ensure safety.  ENISA works to develop cyber security  for safety. Safety does not integrate security, and especially cyber security is not well integrated in  organisations. For this reason, ENISA has decided to perform this study with the aim of helping asset owners  and all stakeholders involved to enhance cyber security for the safety of European passengers.  Cyber security in Smart airports  Smart airports have the potential to deliver important improvements in overall security effectiveness,  operational efficiency and passenger experience and safety. When electronic devices are used, for example  to collect and monitor data relating to landside, terminal and airside activities at the airport, and these  systems become connected following a Total Airport Management (TAM) concept44, the airport can benefit  not only from increased passenger safety and greater operational efficiency but also from an embed system  of truly Collaborative Decision-Making (CDM)45, based around real-time information that is shared across  different actors. However, the increased flow of information, data processing and connections among  devices and systems also bring risks that airport operators, policy makers, vendors, airlines and third party  entities engaged in the provision of airport services need to address. These risks include vulnerabilities in  ICT and electronic systems as well as the information and data held and processed by such systems.  Vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious actions, but also human errors, system or third party failures  and natural phenomena. The cyber security threats to Smart airports are detailed in the following chapter.  42 CPNI (2012) Cyber-security in Civil Aviation, http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020- cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf.  43 Ibid.  44 Total Airport Management: a Step Beyond Airport Collaborative Decision Making,  https://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/public/standard_page/EEC_News_2006_3_TAM.html.  45 Airport Collaborative Decision Making, http://www.eurocontrol.int/articles/airport-collaborative-decision-making-cdm.  http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020-cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020-cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  22  3. Key asset groups and assets  Tackling cyber security starts from asset identification and decomposition46. In this chapter is provided an  overview of the key asset groups and assets to be protected in Smart airports. In the ACRP Guidebook on  Best Practices for Airport Cyber security - Appendix B47, cyber security-relevant airport assets and systems  are listed. Based on ACRP's work and insights from experts, we have identified the following as the key asset  groups in Smart airports: Landside Operations, Airport Administration, Staff Management, Customer  Ancillary Services, Facilities and Maintenance, Passenger Management, Airline/Airside Operations, Safety  and Security, and IT and Comms Systems. Table 3 shows these key asset groups together with their locations  within the airport. It is worth noting that there are some systems that are located across several locations  and also outside the physical perimeter of the airport.48 Specifically, Safety and Security spans multiple  locations within the airport and is identified here as a cross-location asset group. IT & Communication  Systems is also a cross-location asset group, while it also located inside and outside the physical perimeter  of the airport. These are reflected by External IT and Comms, whose ownership and control is exercised by  entities other than the airport authority or operator, and Internal IT and Comms, which are owned and  operated by the airport authority, operator, or by airlines and other third parties within the physical airport  perimeter.  Table 3: Airport Core Asset Groups  46 Many assets could be further decomposed into components and sub-processes, and the categorisation here attempts to strike a balance  between covering key significant categories and relevant detail.  47 Guidebook on Best Practices for Airport Cyber security (ACRP 140, 2015), Appendix B.  48 The scope of the Smart airport perimeter, in the context of cyber security, includes internal assets that are controlled and operated by entities  within the airport and located within the perimeter of the airport, and also external assets that are to a large extent controlled and operated by an  entity other than the airport operator or authority. Most of these external assets reflect the navigation and communication between the aircraft and  the airport itself, through intermediaries that collect and distribute the information to interested parties affected by the flight path and trajectory of  the aircraft.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  23  Smart airport assets  Based on the asset groups identified in Table 3, key smart assets for each of the groups were identified and  validated with experts. Smart assets include both primary and secondary assets as categorised by ISO  2700549. These assets are either owned and operated by the airport authority or outside service providers.  Primary assets are usually the core processes and information that underpin key airport activities. Normally  primary assets include business processes and activities, and information. Accordingly, secondary assets are  defined as those assets upon which the primary elements rely. These assets have vulnerabilities that are  exploitable by cyber security threats aiming to impair the primary assets – processes and information. They  include all types of deployable systems that allow an airport to carry out its primary functions such as  hardware, software, network, personnel, and site.  Figure 6 presents the full MINDMAP of the key  asset groups  and assets of the ‘Smart’ airport as identified  through the expert interviews and desktop research. All assets in the figure are ‘smart’ components and are  important to the functioning of the Smart airport. To further validate the criticality of the assets we present  in Figure 7 their prioritization according to the experts. We have collected their views on the top five most  critical assets, in the sense that they deem them particularly important and representing the top priorities  for cyber security.  Figure 6: Mapping Smart Assets and Asset Groups of the Airport  To facilitate information security professionals in their risk assessment, the complete list of assets is available  as an annex of the present document.  The goal is to give the interested parties an input regarding the  49 It outlines the international standard for managing information security risk that provides a framework for the identification of smart assets (based  on the criteria above) for the Smart airport.

Threat and risk analysis  Emerging challenges in smart airports  The Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP, 2015)50 has identified a trend toward greater  interconnectivity as airports and their stakeholders leverage digital technology to optimise resources and  work together more efficiently. Airports are also becoming increasingly reliant on computer services  delivered via Internet, with some airports allowing passengers and staff to use their own hardware (smart  phones, tablets and computers/laptops) to access airport data, systems and network resources.  A report by the UK Centre for Protection of National Infrastructures (CPNI) identifies the consolidation of IT  systems and Internet-based solutions in civil aviation management and operation as a major reason for  increased vulnerability to malicious cyber security attacks. The report suggests that “Interconnected and  interdependent systems are becoming more prevalent in commercial aviation, increasing the possibility that  different operators inside and outside the airport become exposed to risks caused by security weaknesses  in other people’s systems”.51 Indicatively, SESAR system-wide information management (SWIM)52, once  deployed, will allow all aviation sectors to access the data they require to undertake their role, clear in the  knowledge that it is consistent with the data being used by different actors. However, SWIM was not  designed with mechanisms that integrate cyber security requirements.53  An additional challenge arises from the use of open and unencrypted communication capabilities, such as  communication of routine air traffic commands between air traffic control and the aircraft. This introduces  further vulnerabilities that can cause rise to cyber attacks and subsequently can risk the safety and  performance of civil aviation.  Threat analysis  This Section presents a taxonomy of threats to the cyber security of Smart airports, including mapping to  Smart airport assets.  The threat taxonomy focuses on cyber security aspects with relevance to Smart  airports, many of which also generalise to any IT systems. The taxonomy was developed drawing on findings  from the interviews and desktop research. Previous ENISA reports have also been employed as a basis for  the taxonomy (including ENISA Threat Landscape and Good Practice Guide for Internet Infrastructure 201554,  and ENISA Study of IPT and smart grids in 201655).  A taxonomy of cyber security threats to smart components within the airport perimeter is presented,  followed by the attack vectors and actors involved. The threats are mapped to categories of assets they  50 Airport Co-operative Research Program (2015)  51CPNI (2012) Cyber-security in Civil Aviation, http://www.cpni.gov.uk/documents/publications/2012/2012020- cyber_security_in_civil_aviation.pdf?epslanguage=en-gb.  52 “The 2016 SESAR SWIM Global Demo shows that system-wide information management (SWIM) is no longer a concept on paper, but is  progressively becoming a reality that will propel aviation into a new era of global connectivity”, http://www.sesarju.eu/newsroom/all-news/global- partners-deliver-digitised-and-connected-aviation.  53 To cope with these emerging vulnerabilities enhanced System Monitoring and Control (SMC) and technical supervision become paramount  together with health status checks, predictive capabilities, machine learning and pattern recognition based on operational baselines.

Finally, specific attacks are highlighted against target elements, illustrating the threats to Smart  airport assets.  4.2.1 Threat taxonomy  Figure 8: Threat Taxonomy  Figure 8 illustrates a two-level threat taxonomy, based on root causes, including human errors, system  failures, natural phenomena, third party failures, and malicious actions. Annex 3 includes an expanded  diagram of the taxonomy, which provides a three-level categorisation of malicious attacks.   Malicious actions: Many cyber security threats are the result of malicious actions. Various methods can be  used by those with malicious intent to compromise IT assets or to perform elevation of privilege attacks  (where the attacker ends up with a different level of access). Each of these attacks often leads to risk of  breach of confidentiality, integrity, availability and should be considered in terms of the available attack  vectors for each asset in order to protect the safety and capacity of an airport (discussed in Section 3.2.2).  For the purposes of this report, major technical threats against Smart airports have been summarised into  nine categories:  ◦ Denial of Service: Denial of service (DoS) attacks impact on system availability and can enable well  equipped attackers to disrupt all but the most resilient of systems and networks. Jamming devices can  overshadow various kinds of wireless communications, such as Wi-Fi, and mobile telephony, and ATM  signals. Denial of service poses something of a challenge for network architecture, including Smart  airports where protection against mass DDoS may not be in place. Consequences can include network  outage, security check slow down, passenger delays, cancelled flights, loss of confidence, damages to  reputation, and/or financial damage.  ◦ Exploitation of software vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities may exist in Smart airport systems, including  security issues that the vendors of the IT/smart assets are unaware of, or issues for which a fix has been  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  27  created but not applied to the airport's systems. Any Smart airport systems with an available attack  surface that are not running with all the latest security patches are likely targets, and even systems for  which no security issues are known may be the target of sophisticated attacks7.  ◦ Misuse of authority / authorisation: Attackers may be in possession of credentials and/or authorisation,  and may misuse their privilege. Examples of attacks to gain this level of access include credential theft  via social engineering, such as spear phishing against airport personnel, or simply insider threats. Once  an attacker has gained a privileged level of access and/or holds a legitimate user's credentials (which  can also be the result of software exploitation, network interception attacks, or malware), the attacker  will be in a position to misuse the privileges, and the damage potential on the Smart airport depends on  the level of privilege obtained.  ◦ Network/interception attacks: Attacks can be network-based or focused on interception (including  physical tampering). This includes wiretaps, and physical tampering (including keyloggers, or internal  modification of assets). Depending on the attack surface and controls in place, networks or physical  devices in Smart airports may be the target of tampering or network attacks which could enable  attackers to compromise systems or communications.  ◦ Social attacks: Social engineering attacks manipulate people into divulging information or performing  actions on behalf of the attacker. Social attacks are effective as they circumvent technical and physical  controls. Airport employees who are not adequately security aware and trained on these issues, or who  do not follow procedures can pose a significant risk to airport cyber security; as the attackers may gain  full access to the victims’ accounts, identity, and authorisation12.  ◦ Tampering with airport devices:  This threat is that systems are tampered with in unauthorised ways.  Unauthorised modification includes data at rest, such as writing to central reservation systems (CRS),  passenger name records (PNR), airport administration IT solutions (including enterprise and human  resources management systems), or stored sensor data. The threat of tampering also includes  unauthorised modification of hardware or software, including modification of the behaviour of kiosk  devices (such as insertion of keyloggers or modification of firmware), or any IT and communications  systems. Data deletion or corruption is also another related threat. Tampering can have severe  consequences, as attackers can potentially gain complete control over systems, and can result in  malicious behaviour which can directly lead to breaches in physical safety and have an impact on  accountability and authentication.  ◦ Breach of physical access controls / administrative controls: This threat refers to a failure in the  verification of identity or authorisation. Breaches in authentication includes identity fraud, such as  impersonating a legitimate airport staff member, and breaches of physical access controls or  administrative controls, such as an attacker bypassing an authentication check, thereby gaining access  to a new attack surface (different systems they can interact with).  ◦ Malicious software on IT assets: Malware may become present on end user devices, including  passenger and staff devices, servers, or other smart components, such as sensor nodes or Supervisory  Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. Malware can cause severe impact on infrastructure, and  business as the software acts maliciously, misusing its ambient authority on the computer it runs on.  Malware often propagates to systems via social engineering (tricking the user to action): for example,  by sending phishing emails to victims (spear phishing is where the attack is targeted). Malware can also  spread via direct exploitation of software vulnerabilities (not requiring user interaction), or through the  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  28  tampering of devices. 56The degree of harm malware is likely to cause to Smart airports is dependent on  whether the malware is targeted and launched by an advanced attacker, or simply has opportunistically  or automatically infected airport systems, and the motivation of the attacker.  ◦ Physical attacks on airport assets: This threat is that an incident can result in physical damage to assets  or other stakeholders, including passengers or bystanders. This includes explosives, sabotage, and  vandalism. Much of traditional airport security is focussed on physical safety; however, in terms of cyber  security, this also includes physical attacks on airport smart assets (such as theft of damage of airport IT  infrastructure) or control of assets resulting in damage.   Human errors: Another major category of threats are those caused by human error. Administrative IT  personnel or network administrators may make configuration errors that negatively impact operations or  security.  For example, configuration errors can lead to administrator defined secure passwords not being  set on devices before they are deployed. The impact of which can include system downtime, cancelled  flights, or introducing major security weaknesses. Similarly, end users, such as airport personnel, can  inadvertently introduce errors into systems, by entering incorrect information or data. Lost hardware, such  as laptops containing sensitive data or authentication details (passwords, or VPN certificates) can introduce  vulnerability and lead to subsequent attacks. Policies and procedures should be designed to avoid  inappropriate actions that increase risk; however, personnel may inadvertently not correctly follow these  due to insufficient awareness, negligence, or when falling victim to previously mentioned social engineering  attacks.   System failures: Failures and malfunctions also have a cyber security element, as they can impact on the  security posture and operational capacity of the airport. Failures include parts of devices, devices or systems,  disruptions of communication links, disruptions of main supply, disruptions of service providers, disruptions  of the power supply6, failures of hardware, and software bugs.   Natural and social phenomena: Natural and social phenomena, such as earthquakes, extreme weather (  e.g. flood, heavy snow, blizzard, high temperatures, fog, sandstorm ), solar flare, volcano explosion, nuclear  incidents, dangerous chemical incidents, pandemics, social disruptions ( e.g. civil unrest, strikes, military  actions, terrorist attacks, political instability) impacting airport operations, shortage of fuel, and space debris  and meteorites can impact the systems supporting critical business functions, and therefore pose a threat  to cyber security to Smart airports.   Third party failures: Third party service providers play a critical role in Smart airport operations. For  example, Internet-based smart technologies can rely on cloud service providers, Internet service providers,  and utilities (including power). Also, management or maintenance of IT systems may be outsourced to third- party remote maintenance providers. Any service interruptions by external third-party providers impact on  those business functions, e.g. recent incident at the airport of Rome9.  4.2.2 Threat modelling  In order to reason about security, it is helpful to clearly define the threat actors (who the potential attackers  are) and potential attack surfaces (how they can interact). Each of these threat actors have different attack  surfaces available within Smart airports. Threat actors in airports include:57   Insider threats: These are airport staff (any role) with malicious intent. Many staff members have access to  otherwise restricted areas, access to restricted IT systems, direct access to interconnected devices and  56 Blended attacks that use a mix of techniques such as firmware modification, VOIP DoS, HMI attacks ,etc.  could be also Included in this groups.  57ACRP, Guide Book on Best Practices for Airport Cyber Security, 2015.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  29  networks, and may be subject to lower levels of scrutiny. These actors require authorisation to carry out  their duties, yet may misuse their authority and may have more authority than they require. As a  consequence, the attack surface is the largest for these attackers.   Malicious airport passengers and guests: These attackers are physically present within the Smart airport.  They have restricted access to physical areas (unless controls are circumvented).   Remote attackers: These attackers are not physically present within the Smart airport, and include  automated attacks, such as malware, and targeted attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APT). This  limits these actors to remotely available attack vectors (but could also include remotely compromising  legitimate staff or passengers’ devices).   Other causes: Environmental or accidental equipment/software failure can cause security incidents, yet  have no active attacker.  Potential attack surfaces in airports include:   Physical interaction with IT assets: Physically present attackers (insiders or passengers/guests) can directly  interact with devices that they have access to. For example, an attacker can type into Common Use  Passengers Processing System (CUPPS) ticketing kiosks using the provided interface (potentially exploiting  vulnerabilities in the software), or may attempt to insert USB devices, if a port is available, or may physically  tamper with a ticket machine to capture or modify input, or to compromise the underlying computer.  Likewise, a physically present attacker may install a keylogger on a staff PC to capture passwords and other  inputs, or may simply approach a staff PC and begin interacting with it, potentially misusing the authority of  a staff member. This applies to any smart assets the attacker can directly access.   Wireless communication with IT assets: Attackers within range of the wireless technologies (potentially  including remote attackers, depending on the technology), can interact with or receive wireless  communications, including: Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) and other Radio-Frequency  Identification (RFID) based asset tracking systems, Wi-Fi, ground-based line of sight data-links, and Air Traffic  Management (ATM) signals, such as ADS-B.   Wired communication with IT assets: Attackers with wired network communications (including access to  the Internet) can interact with related IT assets including cloud services, and online reservation systems.  Attackers with physical presence may have direct access to network infrastructure (such as routers and  switches, or CAT5 cables that can be tapped), which they can connect to in order to communicate with other  connected smart devices.   Interaction with other staff or passengers: Rather than directly target airport assets, attacks may be  targeted at (or via) other staff or passengers. Reflected attacks (such as CSRF or reflected XSS) and social  engineering attacks can involve fooling or convincing a person to send commands or carry out tasks on their  behalf. Tampering with the environment, by inserting themselves into a position where they can intercept  and modify communications is a typical attack vector: for example, man in the middle, man in the phone, or  man in the browser, or by introducing rogue Wi-Fi access points.   Pivoting attacks between assets: As an attacker compromises a system a new attack surface becomes  available to them. For example, after compromising a publicly facing web server, the attacker may gain  access to an internal network segment and may use the web server to attack the airport intranet local area  network systems and/or disrupt the supply chain. Any smart asset that has the potential to be compromised  is a potential attack vector for any other connected systems. Therefore, compromised systems can have  cascading effects on overall airport cyber security  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  30  In the annex 4 “Asset exposure to cyber threats” the threat exposure of assets is presented. The threats to  airport cyber security apply to broad categories of assets, such as communication networks, servers and  control systems, internal/sensitive information, authentication and access control systems, and end-point  systems (which include PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones and other external installations, such as e- ticketing devices). The next Section gives more detailed examples of specific Smart airport infrastructure  assets that can be targeted by specific attacks.  4.2.3 Sample cyber security attacks  Table 4 illustrates a few samples of threats (previously described Section 4) and how they relate to airport  assets (described in Section 2), in terms of specific target elements and attacks. This list of examples  highlights likely attacks and is based on desktop research and expert interviews.  The good practices section  list the relevant good practices collected in chapter 5 “security good practices”.  Table 4: Sample Cyber security Attacks  ASSET: TARGET ELEMENT THREAT: ATTACKS GOOD PRACTICES  Airport Administration:  Enterprise Management  System  Social attacks: Personnel with access to highly sensitive data,  such as administrator authority to the enterprise  management system, e.g. enterprise resource planning  (ERP) software, are at heightened risk of social engineering  spear phishing attacks. Attackers create realistic and  incentivised scenarios, targeted to employees (such as by  impersonating co-workers). For example, sending a link to a  convincing fake website requesting existing credentials; the  attacker can then leverage those credentials to gain control  of enterprise management systems.  GP01, GP11, GP13, GP14,  GP33,GP34  Airline/Airside  Operations:  ATM navigation  communications  Network / interception attacks: ADS-B ATM and older radio  ATM technologies are typically unauthenticated, meaning  that a well-equipped attacker can broadcast messages or  overshadow existing signals. Similarly, GPS, which aids  navigation and positioning, is vulnerable to untruthful  signals, which can maliciously alter positioning.  GP3, GP10, GP11, GP12, GP26,  GP27, GP28, GP33, GP34, GP41,  GP42, GP43, GP44  Landside Operations:  Airport Landside  Operations Systems  Control Centre  Misuse of authority / authorisation: Personnel with high  levels of access are also high risk insider threats. For  example, personnel misusing their authority in the landside  operations systems control centre could misuse their  authority to send malicious commands to SCADA systems.  GP05, GP09, GP16, GP24, GP29,  GP30, GP31, GP32  Safety and Security /  Passenger Management:  Common Use Passengers  Processing System  (CUPPS) central  reservation system (CRS)  and ticketing kiosks  Tampering with airport devices: Common Use Passengers  Processing System (CUPPS) self-service ticketing kiosks are  located in public spaces, are operated by various airlines,  and are subject to tampering attacks, and software or  authentication errors that can result in boarding passes  incorrectly produced or provided to the incorrect person. If  CUPPS is compromised, central reservation system (CRS) and  passenger name records (PNR) could potentially be affected,  which can cause data leakage or service outage. A  compromised system such as this also grants the attacker  GP02, GP05, GP07, GP08, GP09,  GP10, GP11, GP12, GP13, GP15  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  31  with access to internal networks for further penetration  attacks.  Safety and Security:  Baggage Screening  Systems  Network / interception attacks: Wi-Fi is used extensively in  many airports, from passenger Internet access, to various  business functions. Insecure Wi-Fi networks have been  demonstrated to exist in airports, including insecure  networks for operations such as baggage scanning  systems.58 Attackers can gain access to insecure Wi-Fi  networks (for example, cracking WEP) and begin to interact  with systems on the network, such as launching further  attacks on baggage tracking systems.  GP02, GP04, GP05, GP08, GP10- GP13, GP16-GP25, GP27, GP28,  GP33-GP44  Customer Ancillary  Services:  Point-of-Sales Machines  Malicious software on IT assets: Malware can potentially  infect any device, though malware is often found on end- point systems. Point-of-Sales (POS) systems are often the  target of malware attack, and malware exists that targets  these systems, often resulting in fraudulent transactions.59  When any devices are infected by malware (such as POS in  smart airports) any shared network infrastructure can  enable infected systems to attack and compromise  connected systems, resulting in remote command and  control over critical infrastructure.  GP01-GP06, GP11-GP25, GP27,  GP28, GP33-GP44  IT and Comms:  Passenger Wi-Fi  Network / interception attacks: Attackers can intercept,  modify and replay passenger Wi-Fi signals. Attackers can  create rogue access points, by posing as a legitimate Wi-Fi  networks. On insecure Wi-Fi networks attackers can use  session hijacking attacks to take control of passengers'  online identities or alter booking requests.  GP02, GP04, GP05, GP08, GP10- GP13, GP16-GP25, GP27, GP28,  GP33-GP44  IT and Comms:  Cloud-based data and  application services  Denial of Service: Airports are increasingly dependent on  third party cloud-based IT services, such as office software,  email, and data processing services.60 Online services can be  impacted by distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks,  which overwhelm servers with requests resulting in outage  of service.

Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  33  5. Attack scenarios  This study has identified three attack scenarios relevant to Smart airports based on current trends emerging  from the desktop research and experts’ insights. Indeed, the final three scenarios were selected based on  the experts’ recommendations taking into account which scenarios were identified by the majority of  experts as the most relevant. These three attack scenarios have been identified by the interviewed experts  as the most important in regards to security and resilience in Smart airports.  The attack scenarios are  presented in the following tables. For each of them, the table indicates: the type of attack; a more detailed  description of the scenario; the domains where those scenarios have been or could be potentially applied;  their likelihood; and the key users and stakeholders that actively take part in each scenario. Additionally,  security parameters are mentioned such as cascading effects, recovery time and efforts, assets involved, and  criticality. Finally, the table proposes which existing good practices could be deployed in each scenario in  order to enhance security and resilience.  The most specific and relevant good practices for the scenario are  listed at the beginning followed by more generic good practices.  The top five most relevant good practices  for the scenario are presented in bold.  Tampering with airport self-serving e-ticketing systems  Self-service check-in systems are operated and shared by various airlines and located in public spaces. Where  such kind of devices are unattended, physical access to these machines from a malicious user and/or attacker  can be an easy task. Self-serving e-ticketing infrastructures are becoming more and more used and shared  by multiple airlines, with third parties also starting to operate the service. This increases the complexity and  connections of the self-serving check-in infrastructure. The majority of these devices run commonly used  operating systems, such as (often obsolete versions of) Windows or Linux and kiosk ticketing software, which  are installed in a custom hard-shell case. These devices usually leverage intranet connectivity in order to  access content on company servers, and provide remote management functionalities.  These devices may  be subject to tampering attacks as they are in public spaces. Furthermore, the tempering attacks can be  assisted or conducted by an insider, for instance an employee of the third- party provider in charge of  operating the service. There are some tactics that insiders are likely to use in the course of preparing or  conducting their attacks; this includes manipulation (access gained by manipulating external staff).  Tampering may involve physically altering the hardware, such as gaining access to the contained PC via  picking a lock on the side of the device or drilling/punching a small hole through the side of the device; or  tampering with the interface between the passenger and the device by installing inconspicuous keyboard,  reader, or screen overlays; or exploiting a software vulnerability. Successful tampering can then result in the  attacker having unauthorised access to the machine and potentially lead to privilege escalation to super user  root/administrator access of this machine. This enables the attacker to change the behaviour of the machine  both in terms of the customer facing actions and the interactions with other connected systems. This can  potentially allow the attacker to: access passenger boarding passes, print arbitrary boarding passes,  invalidate and/or modify existing passenger passes (i.e. via record tampering) and steal sensitive passenger’s  data (i.e., passport or credit card details when these are used to initiate the check-in operation at the kiosk).  Criticality  Disruption of check-in services may create inconvenience to passengers (i.e., longer time for boarding) but  it might also lead to more serious service outage and further security risks involving safety (e.g. it might  assist with the boarding of unknown passengers into the plane).  Likelihood  Based on interviews’ key findings, this was one of the most cited possible attack scenarios. Airline companies  foster strongly the use of e-ticketing systems to speed up the check-in process via automation. This scale of  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  34  popularity, combined with a low level of control of check-in devices within the airport, make them a very  good/likely target for cyber-attacks. Unless these devices are equipped with the latest tamper-proof  technology and/or readers that encrypt data, they are highly prone – given their public locations – to criminal  tampering and are a perfect target for attackers.  Exploiting software bugs as well as systems that are not  often updated are seen by attackers as weak points to acquire access into check-in devices in order, for  instance, to add or modify passengers’ information.  Cascading effects  Once a check-in system is compromised the attacker can pivot from this device to attack connected systems  and databases. Also, in addition to any interruption or black out on the whole system, a threat that arises  here is the alteration of data aiming at whatever act that can compromise the safety of passengers, including  potential terrorist acts. Although the majority of airports use segregated networks, depending on the  effectiveness of the controls, cascading effects have the potential to impact on the entire Common Use  Passenger Processing System (CUPPS).

Often  third party providers will be involved in  managing part of the service (e.g. local area  network). This will require the whole chain to  react to the attack by providing the effort  needed to detect the flaw, and provide the  solution to fix it.   GP 07 – Disable services, close ports, restrict usage of external  devices   GP 10 – Data encryption   GP 01 – Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)   GP 08 – Conduct vulnerability and penetration tests   GP 22 – Conduct risk assessments   GP 06 – Operating systems updates and backups   GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach.   GP 26 – Require that providers of external information system  services comply with airport information security requirements  and/or be certified against relevant standards   GP 17 – Rely on an information security framework and external  audits to assess maturity and demonstrate compliance   GP 23 – Create a risk registry and monitor risk effectively   GP 34 – Provide basic security awareness training to all  information system users   GP 38 – Develop a contingency plan   GP 42 – Provide incident response capabilities for airports   GP 45 – Track and document information system security  incidents  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  35  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  The degree of interconnection among physical devises (in our case the kiosk) and ICT systems as well as among systems  is challenging since it opens up more vectors of attack for connected systems and entry gates to others (see Gap 8).  Another key challenge lies in the effective and efficient monitoring of check-in devices and all their components  (physical, hardware and software) due to the number of devices and spread and size of areas where they are located. In  addition, as underlined in the gap section there is a gap in industry models and guidelines on airport network  architecture, ownership, and remote management (see Gap 3). There are few guidelines and standards specifically  addressing cyber security practices in Smart airports, in particular in relation to the security of shared infrastructures  (software or hardware), which is usually the case for automated e-ticketing devices.  Network attack to the baggage handling  Airports make extensive use of ICS SCADA systems for baggage handling.62 Most ICS advanced systems allow  the centralisation of the baggage handling control and visualisation, display of the relevant data, control of  the site CCTV systems giving the operators all the information required to confidently and remotely make  their control decisions. SCADA are also becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent with  other airport information systems or airside systems, which may introduce additional vectors of attack.  Because of this interconnectivity, ICS SCADA systems are exposed to similar vulnerabilities as computers and  networked devices. Specifically, weak network security (e.g. poorly configured firewalls, interconnected  peer networks, weak authentication features, etc.) often combined with SCADA running old or not  updated/unpatched out-of-date software, allow attackers to open a backdoor and exploit weaknesses in  these systems: for example, a software vulnerability may enable the attacker to gain super user access.  Malware could be uploaded during patching (a key vulnerability) and with the collaboration of compromised  employees (i.e. insider threat). A successful attack on SCADA systems would then facilitate an attack on  physical airport infrastructure. The attacker may send malicious commands, such as halt baggage handling,  or disrupt normal operations of baggage handling.  Criticality  Depending on the severity of the cascading affect this could lead to significant disruption in disembarking  and loading procedures with a consequent serious disruption on the airside operations. Furthermore, similar  to the other scenarios, a further threat and cascading effect that could rise here is related to acts that can  compromise the safety of passengers, including: terrorist acts, such as the combination of a network attack  with the loading of explosives into the luggage in order to attack the aircraft; or the hiding of other illegal  products in the luggage (e.g. drugs).63  Likelihood  In recent years SCADA systems have suffered several cyber-attacks. The increasing interconnection and  interdependency between SCADA systems and other airport assets, together with the lack of security  countermeasures applied to them have opened up vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited.  Cascading effects  Once a malware is uploaded into an ICS SCADA this will disrupt the logic of the real time control system and  its components (e.g. system sensors, reading, etc.)  but also the functions of the dependent infrastructures.  62 ICS SCADA systems are used in airport to monitor and control several physical infrastructures ranging from air-conditioning, power supply  including airfield lighting to apron services (‘finger’ or air bridges).  63A similar attack has occurred at the port of Antwerp.

Due to the interconnection among  systems and possible cascading effects  this could require a significant effort from  several of the stakeholders involved.  Recovery time could be reduced by  prioritising which services should be  recovered first focusing on recovering the  most relevant in the first instance.   GP13 – Integrate shutdown procedure / remote deactivation of  capabilities for assets based on assets   GP 11 – Firewalls, network segmentation and defence in depth   GP 12 – Strong user authentication   GP 03 – Change default administrator credentials of devices   GP 01 – Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)   GP08 – Conduct vulnerability and penetration tests   GP06 – Operating systems updates and backups   GP 16 – Set up an information security management system and  implement international standards   GP 19 – Establish an inventory of the information and information  systems available   GP 22 – Conduct risk assessments   GP 23 – Create a risk register and monitor risk effectively   GP 24 – Perform continuous monitoring of information security   GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach   GP 35 – Provide specialised information security training   GP 38 – Develop a contingency plan   GP 42 – Provide incident response capabilities for airports   GP 43 – Train airport personnel in their incident response roles with  respect to the information system   GP 45 – Track and document information system security incidents  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  One of the key challenges in relation to SCADA is that cyber security good practices and countermeasures commonly applied  to IT infrastructure have not been applied to ICS. Another challenge is related to the increasing interdependence and  connection of SCADA with other airport systems. The degree of interconnections among systems increase the number of  vectors attacks while opening up back doors to connected systems. This increase in complexity and functionality requires an  enhanced approach to cyber security focusing on holistic assessments and planning (see Gap 8). ENISA has released several  guidelines on ICS SCADA security64.  64 ENISA ICS SCADA, http://enisa.europa.eu/scada  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  37  Drone intercept as mobile vehicle for jamming and spoofing aircraft-airport and  traffic control-airline communications  Drones, fitted with electronic devices, can be used to spoof, and jam aircraft-airport and traffic control- airline communications.  Aircrafts use the Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) system to  transmit their positions based on on-board navigational instruments and GPS technology. ADS-B broadcasts  information periodically and its signal can be received by the ground surveillance systems including air traffic  control centres and Approach Control Services, and also by aircraft in the vicinity when appropriately  equipped for receiving and processing this signal. ADS-B is unencrypted and unauthenticated, showing  aircraft ID, altitude, latitude and longitude position, bearing and speed.  ADS-B is used to support surveillance  in ensuring that aircraft are safely separated. Lack of authenticity, and, to a lesser extent, lack of encryption,  facilitate spoofing and/or jamming of communications, allowing a malicious person to inject false data or  disable sending or receiving messages into these real ATM Surveillance communications. Indeed, an attacker  may decide to spoof existing signals on the ADS-B frequencies in order to generate crafted and false ADS-B  messages, containing tampered information (e.g. fake GPS positions but also other fake information  contained in the ADS-B messages), which show aircrafts not existing in the air space on screens of the air  traffic controllers and/or lead to conflicting data between Air Traffic Control (ATC) and cockpit displays. This  may lead to different situational awareness pictures for pilots and ATC, provoke false collision warnings and  thus generate safety issues, while potentially impacting the airport flight management operations.  Criticality  The presence of mitigation actions, focusing on reconciling messages using primary and secondary  transmission sources (i.e. radar), means that criticality is medium.  However, in the case of a successful attack  the criticality should be considered high.  However, it is worth considering that the use of drones, as we see it nowadays, will develop into a possible  weapon (for instance ad hoc communication networks could be used to direct flocks of drones near jet  intakes or drones could be used to pass forbidden liquids or other dangerous materials and products over  the controlled perimeter of the airport). In the present and immediate future, beside any interruption or  disruption of airport flight management operations a threat that arises here is related to acts that can  compromise the safety of passengers, including terrorist acts.  Likelihood  The lack of encryption and authentication features in the ADS-B system together with low technical difficulty  required to perform the attack make the likelihood that an attack might occur high. Indeed, ADS-B equipped  planes are widely used and operating right now since many airlines worldwide have already embraced the  technology. In addition, ADS-B is expected to be mandatory in the United States and in Europe by 2020. This  will make this type of attacks even more likely in the near future. However, due to mitigation measures in  place, the likelihood that this type of attack would be successful should be considered as medium.  Cascading effects  Spoofing attacks on ATM infrastructure can affect the reliability of communications from aircraft to air traffic  control/airport and vice-versa as well as aircraft-to-aircraft communications. This can impair the entire  management of flight operations due to the injection of unreliable data into other information systems that  make use of these flight data.

The response time for the resolution of  the cyber security attack will be  proportional to the time taken from the  ANSP to resolve the situation.  Having the  required technical tools to identify fake  aircrafts may significantly reduce  recovery time and efforts especially in  case of single attacks.   GP 12 – Strong user authentication   GP 01 – Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)65   GP 25 – Manage risk according to international standards and a  methodological approach   GP 35 – Provide specialised information security training   GP 40 – Train airport personnel in their contingency and disaster  recovery roles (specifically for air traffic control personnel)   GP 38 – Develop a contingency plan   GP 39 – Develop a disaster recovery plan   GP 42 – Provide incident response capabilities for airports (including  airlines)   GP 45 – Track and document information system security incidents   GP 37 – Maintain on-going contacts with security groups and  associations  CHALLENGES AND GAPS  Communication systems and protocols, especially for legacy Air Navigation Systems, have not been developed with  security in mind since the emphasis was to provide an open and interoperable system and protocol. Interdependence  among systems and the combination of threat vectors resulting from the interdependence is a key challenge for cyber  security (see Gap 8).  In addition, effective legislation could control the production and operation of drones, at least for commonly used  ones, but also, to a certain extent, for military usage.66  There is also a need for more information sharing (see Gap 6) leading to quickly identifying early warning of  vulnerabilities and/or occurring attacks and multi-stakeholder enable security technologies (see Gap 7) that could offer  real-time authentication in a complex and interdependent multi-stakeholder environment.  65 This should also include appropriate procedures at Air Traffic Controller level to facilitate better reaction to such threat detection.  66 The military use of drones might represent the biggest threat in some cases.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  39  Attacks tools and techniques available  This section provides some more detailed examples of some of the tools, techniques and procedures  available to potential attackers. There are already many available hacking tools as well as general purpose  technical tools that an attacker can use in order to compromise airport security both in airside, landside and  terminal operations. One of these technical tools is Software Defined Radio (SDR) which is a radio  communication system that consists of a computer equipped with radio receivers (i.e. antennas, dongles)  and the appropriate software (i.e. SDR software). Antennas, dongles and SDR software can be easily  procured and then used to spoof, intercept and decode or jam any air-to-ground or air-to-air radio frequency  communications, such as ACARS, ADS-B etc. Attackers have also other means to compromise security in  airports by manipulating devices inside the airport, such as barcode scanners, biometric devices, point of  sales devices, self-serving check-in kiosks and SCADA systems where they apply common hacking methods  and techniques.  ACARS messages are transmitted in plaintext even though their content can reveal which aircraft is flying  nearby by decoding the flight number and aircraft registration details. While this information might not seem  as sensitive as the airplane location position that ADS-B messages carry, nonetheless it can provide  meaningful input to potential attackers67. To eavesdrop on ACARS messages, one needs to consider that the  worldwide frequency of ACARS transmissions is at 131.550 MHz. A list of all frequencies of ACARS (primary  and secondary) for Europe, US and other countries is available online68.  An antenna (e.g. a J-Pole antenna)  has to be placed within a specific range nearby an aircraft and ground stations as a radio scanner and it has  to be synchronized to the frequency of ACARS in order to receive these transmissions. Subsequently and  with the help of the dongle (e.g. RTL-SDR dongle) the intercepted transmissions are passed on to the ACARS  decoding software69, to decode and display the digital messages of ACARS. Moreover, online services70 which  are publicly available provide to anyone access to aggregated data from all over the world in order to either  locate aircrafts in real time or access real time ACARS web servers or even search for aircrafts, airlines and  flights through ACARSD search71 without the need of knowledge or any sophisticated cyberattack method.  In the case of ADS-B the process is along the same lines as in ACARS. However, whereas the J-pole antenna  could still be employed, other antennas72 have proven to be more suitable in receiving the vertically  polarized signal of ADS-B (it transmits at 1030 MHz for interrogation and 1090 MHz for replies). The Collinear  Coax Antenna is considered as the most suitable73 one for high quality reception of ADS-B signals. Subject to  the signal having been intercepted, software tools74 can decode ADS-B transmissions in a very effective  manner providing among other information the geolocation of all aircrafts in the range. A recent proof of  concept75 shows how easy it is to develop a homemade aircraft radar to collect the geolocation coming from  the ADS-B messages of nearby aircrafts. Another proof of concept76, has demonstrated the possibility to  mount replay attacks and to inject false data into an aircraft’s real ADS-B air-to-air communications rather  than simply intercepting these messages. ADS-B messages are both unencrypted and unauthenticated and  therefore an attacker can transmit falsified messages of this type thus succeeding in mounting an  67 European Aviation Safety Agency European Aviation confirmed the concerns about the Airplane hacking.

ADS-B is also susceptible to jamming attacks that can be performed by using only a ground-based radio- frequency source radiating within a specific range. Jamming, which implies disrupting the ADS-B frequencies,  is also an attack with high impact as it is capable to result in outage of the GPS service over an entire airport.  Drones and UAVs in general, that can be easily equipped with advanced computing and communication  capabilities are an additional means to perform spoofing, replay or jamming attacks in these days79.  Furthermore, attacks are not limited only to interception of air traffic messages and radio signals. Another  attack surface involves security compromises and manipulation of assets inside the airport. Such attacks may  affect both customer services and passenger management; for example, self-serving check-in kiosks can be  exploited via their input communication channels. Input channels that allow input from external users to a  device include USB, parallel, serial or Ethernet ports or even wireless connections, such as Bluetooth or Wi- Fi. Usually, ports such as USB are installed to support hardware or software update using peripheral devices.  However, there exists a wide variety of USB dongles80 and corresponding software81 that generate payload  which will force a device to execute commands and therefore exploits resulting in unauthorised modification  of hardware or software (e.g. installation of malware, key loggers). In case the compromised device is also  Internet connected, an attacker could be also able to execute remotely arbitrary code.  In another interesting recent proof of concept82, the manipulation of the flight ticket barcode scanner was  illustrated. While this is one of the many ways to manipulate barcodes83, in this case, the manipulated input  was the flight ticket barcode itself. Many tools84 offer the ability to convert a barcode to plaintext and then  modify the corresponding text. The simpler the logic of the coded plaintext is, the easier it can be  manipulated. This text can be modified through a notepad and then a new barcode can be generated using  specialized tools or online services85.  Additionally, ICS SCADA systems that reside on and support airport infrastructures86, e.g. utilised for many  functions such as baggage handling87, are equally exposed to vulnerabilities as computers and network  devices. In case these systems are connected to the Internet, the probability of being discovered through  SCADA specific online scanning tools88 is increased.

A recent  research91 reveals that a piece of malware targeting SCADA systems was discovered and most likely posed a  proof of concept of ICS attack techniques. A malware, named IRONGATE, was first placed to this system by  a dropper which installed the payload under certain conditions92. This malware unravelled a man-in-the- middle attack and could potentially cause unauthorised modification of hardware, software or data. This  particular case happening in a SCADA responsible baggage handling processes would greatly impact the  passenger management function of an airport.  91 http://www.securityweek.com/mysterious-ics-malware-targets-scada-systems  92 ibid.  http://www.securityweek.com/mysterious-ics-malware-targets-scada-systems  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  42  6. Security good practices  Securing Smart airports and staying ahead of evolving cyber threats is a shared responsibility, involving  governments, airlines, airports, vendors and regulators. Therefore, it is imperative to put in place a  collaborative model to set goals and define an appropriate cyber security approach to strengthen the  aviation system’s resilience against attacks. To this aim, significant effort is being invested across the aviation  community at different levels, including standardisation, security working groups, research and education.  Identification of challenges posed by cyber threats, risk assessment approaches and guidelines to enhance  cyber security, either in terms of high level governance strategies93,94 or in terms of specific technological  supports95, are priorities currently tackled.  In order to help both asset owners and all the actors involved in securing Smart airports, ENISA has taken  stock of the current good practices. These practices represent what exists at the moment and have been  consulted in order to form the groups of good practices and the categories for each one of them. As a result,  some of them are general and not airport specific practices. As noticed in the Gap Analysis Section (see Gap  1), existing good practices tend to be general with few specifically addressing cyber security practices in  Smart airports. The identified good practices for Smart airports are presented here and arranged according  to three main groups: Technical/tool-based; Policies and standards; and Organisational, people and  processes. Figure 9 presents the full mind map of the identified good practices. Each main group is then  discussed in details in the following sub-sections.

Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  47  7. Gap analysis and identification of areas of improvement  This section provides an analysis of the main gaps in relation to cyber security in smart airports. Gaps have  been identified via a comparison among the identified assets, vulnerabilities, threats and good practices.  Expert interviews were used to further identify and validate the gaps. Gaps to be addressed focused on  different areas, including: operational practices, policy and standardisation, and the need to develop more  comprehensive and integrated tools. This section summaries seven identified key cyber security gaps in  Smart airport.  While they are numbered 1 to 7 below, these gaps have not been ranked according to any  measure of importance.  Gap 1: Disparity of cyber security practices in airports  There is a disparity amongst airports in the methods and degree to which cyber security is addressed. While  certain airports are often described as having a very mature cyber security posture132, in the expert  interviews other airports admitted to having limited capabilities or resources dedicated to cyber security.  Poor practices include password reuse/sharing, a lack of a centralised centre for incident handling, and low  levels of cyber security awareness and prioritisation.  Individual airports are required to develop their own posture to cyber security, typically in relation to  adhering to various (mostly non-airport specific) guidelines and standards. Each airport is therefore  responsible for interpreting existing guidelines and standards, and adapting these to suit the context of an  airport. While many of the threats (as documented in Section 4) are common to the security of various ICT  systems, there are specific risks (such as public Wi-Fi and kiosks, and infrastructures with passenger risk to  life) and network design considerations that are specific to airports and critical infrastructure.  Existing security guidelines and standards (such as ISO27001133, EN16495,134 and EN16082135) serve an  important role in providing assurance that a baseline level of security processes is in place. However, there  is still a gap in that there are few guidelines and standards specifically addressing cyber security practices in  Smart airports, and those that do exist are not consistently applied.  Gap 2: Lack of a common approach and multi-stakeholders model on cyber security of  airports  There is not a common EU approach to cyber security of smart airports or a common multi-stakeholder  model on cyber security. Both could facilitate harmonisation of practises and interventions in a very  competitive environment, with the aim to protect public safety, regularity and efficiency of transportation  by air, and rights such as life in flight and on the ground. Furthermore, the rapid advance of technology and  the slower pace of the legislative processes, may lead to serious legal gaps within the future environment of  smart airports. These gaps might pose some challenge to both Member States and the European Institutions  to address security and safety of European citizens.136 The NIS Directive (NISD) is expected to provide some  directions and high-level consistency, especially in terms of baseline security measures and incident  reporting.  132 For example, see: ACI , “Cyber Security: Potential Impact on European Airports”, Briefing Paper.  133 ISO/IEC 27001 - Information security management http://www.iso.org/iso/iso27001.  134 BS EN 16495:2014 Air Traffic Management.

This is complicated by the fact that each airport has many ICT networks being  operated within the airport, many of which the airport does not have direct control over. Networks in  airports include those supporting landside, airside and terminal operations systems; this includes  (sometimes multiple) passenger Wi-Fi networks run by external vendors, mobile telecoms and devices to  manage people and assign tasks, cloud-based infrastructure for the solutions to be deployed at the airport  for passenger management, CUPPS (Common Use Passenger Processing Systems) solutions for border  control, e-ticketing, and biometric controls. Each of these networks are often managed by, and externally  connected to, various external organisations. Critical and non-critical networks should be segregated. Many  networks and systems are remotely managed. The resulting airport cyber security landscape can be  described as having a large and complex attack surface.  The complexity of the situation and the lack of IT architecture reference models, suggests a gap in industry  models and guidelines on airport network architecture, ownership, and remote management. There is  currently no reference model that focuses on the IT architecture of smart airports that can be used to inform  the development of ICT and network security. Such a reference model should take account of the changing  ownership structure of airports that are increasingly being turned over to private hands with more  fragmentation of service providers in relation to the ICT network, clearly define the segregation of critical  and non-critical networks, and provide a common basis for designing network interoperability.  Gap 4: Evidence-based vulnerability analysis metrics and priorities  Risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, and penetration tests should be carried out on a regular basis  to identify potential security issues. Airports can formally define and assess risks and aim for compliance  with standards, such as ISO27001 and PCI DSS.137 Guidance on security assessments within aviation and  airports exists (CANSO Cyber Security and Risk Assessment Guide)138 as do generic and adaptable security  assessment approaches.139 However, there is little consensus on what metrics or standards should be used  to measure the cyber security of smart airports. There also lacks an evidence-based understanding of the  systems that are critical to the airport and incident control management: for example, what systems should  be prioritised in the case of an incident to best avoid panic that could cause further disruption and security  risk.  Gap 5: Threat modelling and architecture analysis  The software vendors surveyed for this research had detailed security processes in place for the  development of infrastructure components for airports. In one example, Microsoft Security Development  Lifecycle was used to design security into the systems that were developed. Formal threat modelling is used  to model the interactions of systems to identify and analyse potential security threats. However, there is a  lack of modelling of the networks in place at airports to analyse the interactions between systems and  networks for potential security issues within this airport environment. Introducing formal threat modelling  and architecture analysis to airport systems and networks may identify otherwise difficult-to-identify  weaknesses, such as insufficient authentication or validation between back-end systems.  137 Helping Airports Understand the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI  DSS)http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rrd_011.pdf  138 CANSO Cyber Security and Risk Assessment Guide  https://www.canso.org/sites/default/files/CANSO%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Assessment%20Guide.pdf  and ACI, “Cyber Security: Potential Impact on EU Airports.  139 Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) http://www.isecom.org/research/.  http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/acrp_rrd_011.pdf https://www.canso.org/sites/default/files/CANSO%20Cyber%20Security%20and%20Risk%20Assessment%20Guide.pdf http://www.isecom.org/research/  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  49  Gap 6: Information sharing  There is arguably the need for a collaborative platform for airports to share data with airport authorities and  national governments. Delegates tend to convene for physical security activities, but to date there is no real  network to collaborate on specific issues of cyber security, and this is reflected in the structure of the airport  and the security priorities within it. A data sharing platform would enable airports to share information on  new vectors of attacks, and early warning of vulnerabilities in systems to provide continuous improvements  of systems. Cooperation among cyber security agencies, law enforcement, industry, and academia would  further benefit information sharing.  Gap 7:  Multi-stakeholder trust framework and trust-enable security technologies  Smart airports are paving the way for a change in how airports operate; moving from an uncooperative and  independent approach to one that is cooperative and dependent.140 This is due to the number of  communication networked technologies and connected systems applied across the airport systems, often  belonging to different operators and displaying multiple interdependence.141 However, lack of trust among  the diverse operators and providers can hinder further development within Smart airports. As a result there  is a need for more advanced security IT infrastructures allowing the formation of transient trust within a  highly mobile environment.142 This could lead to further work and development combining light-weight  cryptography protocols (for light duty devices usage) and regular cryptography framework (e.g. PKI - Public  Key Infrastructure, for back- end infrastructures) as well as the exploration of implementation technology  and testbeds (e.g. elliptic- curve cryptography mutual authentication RFID).143 Furthermore, there is the  need for the identification and development of airport specific trust framework helping operators navigate  their trust relationships and dictate how the devices, sensors, readers and operators exchange data and  operate together (e.g. how much a passenger's smart phone can interact with the airport concession kiosk).  Within this trust framework, considerations around key management should also be addressed (i.e.,  identifying the actors generating the encryption keys- private/public keys, how these will be distributed and  who, i.e.  which agencies/companies/authorities, will eventually be given access to such keys when  necessary).144  Gap 8:  Lack of awareness and skills  This relates to the increasing move toward connected and interdependent systems and devices. Due to the  fast growing interconnect nature of Smart airport, operators are struggling to achieve a full awareness of  the new security landscape including the full range of cyber threats and boundaries for securing the Smart  airport perimeter. Moreover, there is the need to educate a new generation of experts and train them both  in safety and cyber security145; to increase awareness and promote education of passengers and airports’  personnel on the security risks posed by new technologies and ways to be prepared; and properly train  airports’ personnel and passengers on the use of the new devices and technologies.  140 Strohmeier Martin “On the Security of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Protocol”.  141 Boutin Nicolas,  Achim Fechtel, Hean Ho Loh, and Michael Tan, “The Connected Airport: The Time Is Now”, bcg.perspectives, January 2016.  142 Strohmeier Martin “On the Security of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Protocol”.  143 ENISA, “Fly 2.0”, 2010, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/flying-2.0-enabling-automated-air-travel-by-identifying-and-addressing-the- challenges-of-iot-rfid-technology.  144 Ibid.  145 ARINC, Smart Airport: Connecting Airports, Airline and Aircraft, 2015.  javascript:ShowEmailClient('nbjmup;gfdiufm/bdijnAcdh/dpn') javascript:ShowEmailClient('nbjmup;mpi/ifboipAcdh/dpn') javascript:ShowEmailClient('nbjmup;ubo/njdibfmAcdh/dpn')  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  50  8. Recommendations  This section of the report provides some key, high level recommendations on how to enhance cyber security  and resilience within the Smart airport. Recommendations are mainly directed towards airport CISOs.  However, some recommendations have also been developed for policy-makers, service providers and  industry representatives. This is because enhancement of cyber security in Smart airports will require the  integrated efforts of all the stakeholders involved. Each recommendation has been developed based on the  information and analysis presented in earlier sections and insights from stakeholders. Below each  recommendation are brief explanatory notes.  Recommendations for airport decision makers (CISOs, CIOs, IT Directors and Head of  Operations) and airport information security professionals  Prioritise cyber security for safety  Airport operators should prioritise cyber security to untimely promote the safety of passengers, personnel  and public in general. Cyber threats and risks will continue to grow driven by developments in technologies,  while the relationship between safety and security will become more and more interwoven. It is no longer  possible to be truly safe without also being secure. Therefore, it is responsibility of airport operators to  recognise the threat and to ensure that their organisation is adequately prepared and protected in order to  provide proper cyber security for safety. This is also aligned with regulatory development at the EU level  (see Annex 1) stressing the relevance of cyber security as a key enabler of safety, which is becoming  paramount in the aviation context. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and 8.  Establish a clear airport cyber security posture and allocate adequate roles and  resources  Substantial changes to business-as-usual processes are required to adequately safeguard critical assets,  satisfy regulatory requirements, and protect passenger security and airport business processes. In order for  such changes to be accomplished, the full support and leadership of smart airport senior executives,  together with a new and holistic approach to Enterprise Security Governance, is required. Responsibility for  cyber security should be clearly allocated by the board of directors and adequate roles and resources should  be clearly defined. Smart airports should envision the role of Chief Security Officer with senior leadership at  the CEO and board level and information security teams. This clear allocation of responsibility and senior  leadership will enable prioritisation of cyber security for safety within the whole organisation. Third party  responsibilities and roles should also be considered. Cyber security would be then promoted by senior  leadership at the CEO and board level and extend throughout the enterprise including third parties to foster  a more security-aware culture. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and indirectly 4, 5 and 8.  Revise cyber security policies and practices based on good practices monitoring  Airport operators should consistently review cyber risk management policies and practices to ensure that  they remain appropriate and effective in light of changing circumstances and risks. The establishment of  regular monitoring, via checks and penetration testing, and regular assessment of airport preparedness  should be linked to the revision of existing policies and practices so supporting an enterprise culture of  continuous process and technology improvement.  The revision of cyber security practices should be done  on an enterprise-wide basis. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and indirectly 4, 5, 7 and 8.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  51  Implement network-based, holistic risk and threat management policy and  processes for cyber security  Airport operators should have tailored risk and threat management policy and processes in place for cyber  security, which focus on network dependencies and the interactions between systems, and systems and  networks for potential security issues. This also needs to take into account the changing ownership structure  (i.e., third party providers and privatisation of key functions) and key operational aspects of Smart airports.  The interconnection among the different systems, which can offer vectors of attack for those systems and  entry gates to others, requires traditional aviation security to work hand by hand with ATM and aviation  safety from the perspective of technology, operations and human factors. This will improve awareness of  cascading effects and critical systems as well as support prioritisation efforts and promote consistency on  how to holistically manage cyber security risks within Smart airports. The focus is to implement  methodologies and processes for systemic/holistic risk assessment where threats and vulnerabilities are  analysed from the whole aviation perspective and not in isolation. This recommendation directly addresses  gap 1, 5 and 7, and 8.  Recommendations for policy-makers  Promote and facilitate the development of common guidelines, standards, metrics,  awareness and knowledge exchange on cyber security for smart airports  Relevant EC institutions and agencies (e.g., ETSI, CEN, CENELEC, ENISA, DG MOVE, European Civil Aviation  Conference, ECAC, etc.) together with international organisations (e.g., IATA and ICAO, etc.) should facilitate  and promote, via open coordination initiatives, the use and development of common standards, guidelines  and metrics aimed at enhancing cyber security in smart airports. These should be further supported by  organisation at the national level, e.g. Civil Aviation Authorities (CAAs), providing implementation  recommendations. In addition, awareness initiatives and the cross-exchange of know-how and practices  among airport operators should be supported to leverage lessons learned and existing good practices. These  actions would enable the identification of common standards and guidelines in areas where these are  currently less effective and mature (e.g., how to design a new smart airport; how to measure the security of  a smart airport and monitor threats including threat modelling and architecture analysis; networked  architecture; ownership, and remote management; evidence-based vulnerability analysis metrics and  priorities; data retention practices; etc.). Such guidelines and common practices could be based on the work  of IATA, ICAO, ENISA, ECAC, ETSI and/or national CSIRTs. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1, 2,  3, 4, 5 6 and 8.  Facilitate the development of accreditation and third party auditing for cyber  security in Smart airport  EU institutions should facilitate the development of accreditation schemes aimed at cyber security in Smart  airports as well as third party auditing of Smart airports’ operations related to cyber security. General  objectives of such initiatives could either be to generate new certification strategies or harmonise existing  ones, with the aim of ensuring that certification frameworks, targeted to Smart airport security operations,  are adequate to meet existing and new EU requirements. Moreover, moving to greater mutual recognition  among EU countries, increasing transparency of procedures, and improving the level and quality of  interaction between approval and auditing bodies could raise the efficiency of the Smart airports in Europe  and support constant improvement in EU security technology aimed at Smart airports. This recommendation  directly addresses gap 1, 3, 4 and 5.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  52  Recommendations for industry representatives  Collaborate with key stakeholders in the development of specific standards for  cyber security products and solutions  Industry representatives should actively collaborate with airport operators and relevant European and  international organisations (e.g.., ETSI, CEN, CENELEC, ENISA, DG MOVE, IATA and ICAO) in the development  of security standards and specifications tailored to Smart airports’ products and solutions. This will lead to  coordinated efforts to strengthen cyber security for Smart airports, while reducing market fragmentation  for cyber security products. This recommendation directly addresses gap 1 and 3.  Work with airport operators to develop products and/or solutions that are aligned  to their cyber security requirements  Airport manufacturers and providers should work closely with airport operators to align their solutions  and/or products to the cyber security requirements, needs and affordability-levels of airport operators.  Solutions should be specifically tailored to address both existing gaps and the specific needs of airport  operators (for instance working together to develop advanced interdependent threat analysis tools, and  technologies that enable security in a multi-stakeholder environment). Products should also be developed  by employing a security-by-design approach. This recommendation directly addresses gap 4, 5 and 7.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  53  9. Annexes  Example of information security incidents impacting airports operations  DATE COUNTRY DESCRIPTION  August  2016  US  Thousands of air passengers around the world were left  stranded after a power cut forced the US airline Delta to  suspend flights.146 The overnight power failure took  place in Atlanta, near Delta's headquarters, causing  computer systems to crash. Airport check-in systems,  passenger advisory screens, the airline's website and  smartphone apps were all affected by the system  failure.  July  2016  Vietnam  Attackers successfully attacked Vietnam's two largest  airports and the nation's flag carrier, Vietnam  Airlines147. The attackers briefly hijacked flight  information screens and sound systems inside the two  airports. Instead of departure and arrival details, the  airports' flight screens and speakers broadcasted what  local media described as anti-Vietnamese and  Philippines slogans, in turn prompting authorities to  shut down both systems.  Vietnam Airlines’ website,  meanwhile, was also seized and transferred to a  malicious website abroad, while passenger data  pertaining to an undisclosed number of its frequent  flyers was published online as well. As a result of this  attack Vietnamese authorities will carry out a  comprehensive check on Chinese devices and  technology to ensure information security at the  Vietnamese airports since it is feared that the Chinese  hacker group 1937cn might be responsible for the  attacks.148  July  2016  IT  A third party failure at Rome’s Fiumicino airport caused  the shutdown of the automated passenger check-in  system, which in turn caused two hours’ delays for the  passenger checking operation.149 The failure was  related to the internet connection (Fastweb) that the  146 Delta: Power cut strands thousands of passengers, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37007908.  147 Cyberattack claims multiple airports in Vietnam, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports- vietnam-airli/.  148 Vietnam to inspect use of Chinese technology following cyberattacks on airports, http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use- of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports.  149 Aeroporto di Fiumicino, ore di stop e code al check in per un guasto alla connessione,  http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada- 144357812/?ref=HREC1-6.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37007908 http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports-vietnam-airli/ http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jul/29/cyberattack-claims-multiple-airports-vietnam-airli/ http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/36329/vietnam-to-inspect-use-of-chinese-technology-following-cyberattacks-on-airports http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6 http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2016/07/18/news/fiumicino_problema_tecnico_al_t3_code_per_i_controlli_arrivano_in_strada-144357812/?ref=HREC1-6  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  54  automated passenger check–in at the airport uses for  accessing and processing passenger data.  April  2016  UK  After landing, the pilot of a British Airways flight from  Geneva reported a collision with a drone while  approaching the London Heathrow airport on the 17th  April.150 The incident highlighted the issues faced with  regard to drones. While the threat of bird strikes has  been well researched, there is still little data about how  much damage a drone could cause to an airplane.151  April  2016  Worldwide  The civil aircraft manufacturer Airbus Group is hit by up  to 12 cyber-attacks per year, mostly in the form of  ransomware and hostile actions carried out by state- sponsored attackers.152 Airbus’ chief information  security officer cited an instance of ransomware  compromising a computer, used by an employee offsite,  which then (after the computer was connected to the  company's intranet) spread over Airbus' corporate  network, encrypting the contents stored on the hard  drives of several machines.  November  2015  France  In November 2015, a bug due to obsolete versions of  the operating systems in use caused disruptions at the  Paris Orly airport.153 The failure affected a system  known as DÉCOR, which is used by air traffic controllers  to communicate weather information to pilots who  usually rely on such a system when weather conditions  are poor. DÉCOR runs on Windows 3.1, released in  1992.154  June  2015  Poland  In June 2015, around 1,400 passengers were delayed at  Warsaw’s Chopin airport when the flight plan system  went offline after its servers were overloaded by  fraudulent information requests as part of a Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.155 As a result the airport  was not able to create flight plans and outbound flights  were not able to depart.156 This resulted in a 5-hour  150 ‘Drone’ hits British Airways plane approaching Heathrow, with no damage caused,

Each legal instrument has been  categorised according to whether its implementation effects: Air Traffic Management; Protection and  Processing of Passenger Data; Technical Standards (including inspections); Minimum Standards on Basic  Aviation Security; and/or Security Risk Management.  EU EXISTING LEGISLATION  Title Domain(s) Description Impacts on Smart airports  EU Network  Information Security  (NIS) Directive188  Security Risk  Management; Air  Traffic Management;  Minimum Standards  on Basic Aviation  Security  It places a duty on operators of  essential services (including  airports) to manage the risks  posed to the security of networks  and information systems which  they control and use in their  operations. The broad aim of the  proposed Directive is to again,  ensure a common (high) level of  network and information security  across Member States that will  require operators of essential  services such as energy,  transport, and key providers of  information society services (e- commerce platforms, social  networks, etc.), as well as public  administrations to adopt  appropriate steps to manage  security risks and report serious  incidents to the national  competent authorities.  Imposes new network and information  security requirements on operators of  essential services including Smart  airport operators and their third party  providers, and digital service providers  (DSPs). Those organisations are also  required to report certain security  incidents to competent authorities or  Computer Security Incident Response  Teams (CSIRTs). Each EU country must  establish these teams, the Directive  says. Different security and incident  reporting rules will apply to operators of  essential services than to DSPs, with a  lighter touch framework applicable to  DSPs.  Commission  Implementing  Regulation (EU) (EU)  2016/1377  of 4 August 2016  laying down common  requirements for  service providers and  the oversight in air  traffic  management/air  navigation services  and other air traffic  management  Air Traffic  management  The Regulation 2016/1377 laying  down common requirements for  service providers and the  oversight in ATM/ANS and other  ATM network functions (repealing  Regulation No 482/2008,  Implementing Regulations No  1034/2011 and No 1035/2011  and amending Regulation No  677/2011) and its relevant  Acceptable Means of Compliance  (AMC) and Guidance Material  (GM). It combines theory and  practical exercises based on both  ATM and non-ATM examples of  Set up common requirements for ATM  and ANS providers and the declaration  of political relevance of security in  general, and especially the relevance of  security as a key enabler of the  (aeronautical) safety, which is  paramount in the aviation context.  Specifically , air navigation services and  air traffic flow management providers  and the Network Manager shall take the  necessary measures to protect their  systems, constituents in use and data  and prevent compromising the network  against information and cyber security  threats which may have an unlawful  188 Proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of Council  concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and  information security across the Union (COM/2013/048 final - 2013/0027 (COD)). http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:52013PC0048.

IDS can  be categorised as follows:   Network based intrusion detection systems focused on the analysis of  network traffic and the detection of broader actions (i.e. network scan,  vulnerability assessment, spoofing, etc.) either from outside or internal  attackers   Host based intrusion detection systems which are able to analyse  activities on the host (e.g., servers, workstations, embedded devices,  etc.)  and raise an alert in case of events such as unauthorised access to  applications, escalation of privileges, modification of file systems,  connection of peripherals, etc.).  IDS alerts should be investigated and acted upon, e.g. via forensic  investigation. IDS implementation should ensure compliance with relevant  standards (e.g., ED-153).  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Exploitation of (known or  unknown) software vulnerabilities  -Network/interception attacks  -Social attacks  GP02 – Antimalware: Computers should run antimalware software (also  known as antivirus) to detect and remove and/or quarantine malicious  software. This includes but is not limited to: kiosk devices, IT equipment,  Common-Use Passenger Processing Systems (CUPPS), SCADA, and Cloud- based data and application services, etc. It is also recommended to use multi- engine anti-virus solutions to check against maximum virus signatures in  order to better protect available resources.  Malicious actions  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Tampering with airport devices  -Misuse of  authority/authorisation  GP03 – Change default credentials of devices: Devices, connected to the  airport network, such as routers, access points, IP-cameras and/or  surveillance cameras connected to closer networks, should be properly  configured and default user accounts should not be used, or should have the  default password changed. In addition, when not required, remote access  should be disabled to prevent cyber criminals from attempting remote  connection to devices. For critical assets, password enforcement policy  should be implemented, avoiding the adoption of computationally weak  passwords.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Breach of physical access  controls  GP04 – Bring your own device (BYOD) controls: Airports should typically  prevent employees from connecting their own personal devices to airport  systems (including via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or VPN), and where this is not  appropriate apply effective technical controls to protect the airport and the  network infrastructure from rouge or compromised devices. Due to the lack  of control on BYOD mixed infrastructures, these appliances should be kept off  the perimeter of relevant servers and services and network access of these  devices should be regulated by individual credentials associated to the device  (for example, using digital certificates). Wherever possible, these devices  should operate under a policy based infrastructure while joining the airport  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Breach of physical access  controls  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Network/interception attacks  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  71  IT domain, giving a more restricted environment (i.e. restriction of  peripherals usage via group policy).  GP05 – Monitoring and auditing for malicious insiders:  This includes:  A:  Logging systems: Log files should be managed and monitored to review  system and user activity across airport systems.  B: Real-time monitoring: Log files should be stored securely, and should  enable non-repudiation. For example, a security information and event  management (SIEM) software solution enables a centralised system for real- time analysis of recorded events including events correlation and alerting  B: Integrity management: Integrity management solutions should be used to  monitor systems for unauthorised changes: for example, modified software  on a shared server.  C: Data Loss Prevention (DLP): DLP systems can be used to detect and/or  prevent sensitive data at rest (such as an employee copying sensitive files  onto a USB storage drive) or in-motion (being copied over a network). This  can be combined with periodic, without notice, activity auditing of users. In  order to prevent data leakage, a special attention to stenographic  communication should be paid, due to this emerging approach in establishing  covert channels in restricted environments. Networks should be scanned for  rogue access points.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  -Breach of physical access  controls  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Network/interception attacks  -Tampering with airport devices  GP06 – Software and hardware updates: Software should be regularly  updated to avoid cyber criminals exploiting patched software vulnerabilities  to get access to devices and related data storage. Therefore, the airport  system administrator should plan a software update procedure to ensure  systems are kept up-to date so mitigating the possibility of security attacks.  The ‘window of vulnerability’ refers to the time taken for a vulnerability being  introduced into the software (such as a programming mistake), its discovery,  vendor fix, and eventual updates applied to systems to remove the  vulnerability. Applying security patches is an important practice that reduces  the exposure to known vulnerabilities.  Disposal of obsolete hardware has to be done carefully to prevent access to  specialised hardware and software (i.e. interfaces and software for baggage  security scanning hardware interaction) or data (activity logs, stored  credentials) from devices at their end of life. Physical or logical destruction of  end-of-life hardware, software and data should be ensured.  Malicious actions  -Malicious software on airport IT  assets  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Misuse of  authority/authorisation  -Social attacks  Employ secure  digital access  controls to networks  and data  GP07 – Security hardening of systems:  Airports should reduce systems’  surface of vulnerability (i.e. attack surface) by for instance disabling services,  closing ports, restricting usage of external devices, regular patching of  systems, etc. This is particularly relevant for systems in the demilitarised zone  (DMZ)199.Network devices should not have services enabled that are not  required as this provides additional attack surface, which may be exploited  by malicious users. For this reason, system administrators should disable  those services that are not needed and also should close or block connections  that are not required.  External device access should be controlled and authorised only on explicit  requests. Access to external peripherals (i.e. USB storage drives) should be  denied wherever possible, in order to prevent data leakage or unauthorised  introduction of software. Internet activity (i.e. web navigation, and social  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Tampering with airport devices  199 DMZ or demilitarised zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an  organization's external-facing services to a usually larger and untrusted network, usually the Internet.  Securing Smart Airports  December 2016  72  network activities) should be subject to filtering, either for security scanning  purposes or white/black listing.  GP08 – Conduct security assessments and penetration tests: Airports should  undergo various forms of security assessment, to detect security  vulnerabilities and assess their impact. Vulnerability assessment involves an  automated scan of connected systems; these scans should be regularly  performed (potentially automated on a daily basis) to detect changes in the  security posture of the airport network. Vulnerability management solutions  make this potentially within the preview of airport system administrators.  Each relevant segment of the airport infrastructure can be scanned in a  distributed fashion, and credentialed scans can also improve scan accuracy.  Penetration tests should be performed to provide a more thorough offensive  assessment of the capabilities of a network, and such tests are typically  required from the airport by external parties200. Other more advanced forms  of security audit include threat modelling and architecture analysis, which can  be applied to airport systems to identify otherwise difficult-to-identify  weaknesses, such as modelling complex interactions between legacy systems  and smart components. Additionally, periodic vulnerability scanning should  be done in combination with hardening (see GP 07) to ensure systems are  always updated and secure.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Network attacks  -Breach of physical access  controls / administrative controls  GP09 – Least privilege and data classification: All users, processes,  passengers, and airport employees should be granted the least level of  privilege/authority necessary to enable them to perform their function.  Airport data at rest should be classified to ensure that information is only  accessible to those that need access and data classification should be part of  any information security management system (see GP016). This can help to  ensure data for airport use cannot trivially be made public. Security personnel  should consider the use of access policies that define which users have access  to the data, and enforcement mechanisms that protect on real-time the  access of the data from unauthorised read. Access to sensitive data should be  under mandatory access control (such as role-based-access-control, RBAC,  policies), and should be reviewed and subject to external auditing on a regular  basis. Access to data should be logged and logs should be stored in a secure  location, to prevent unauthorised alteration. Furthermore,  privacy impact  assessment  and privacy by design, based on the EU General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR), should be also followed for proper data and information  management.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  Human errors  -Operator/user error  GP10 – Data encryption: The use of encryption should be used to protect  sensitive information exchanged in the network from eavesdroppers, and to  protect data at rest. Insecure protocols, such as WEP and unencrypted Wi-Fi  networks should be avoided. Encryption should be configured using peer- reviewed and academically sound standard solutions to protect data. The use  of encryption, such as VPN, can enable employees to be remotely connected  with the airport service keeping a high level of secrecy in the data exchanged.  Critical devices that are unable to communicate over the network of  encrypted channels should be connected via hardware security modules to  implement secure data transfers across unsecure networks. Traffic  encryption should occur at both endpoints of mainstream link from airport  site and their counterpart at connectivity providers to ensure the privacy of  data communications. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware isolated  execution environments should be used to do all cryptographic operations  (e.g., secret key generation and encryption/decryption) to prevent  sophisticated attacks (e.g., cold boot attack).

Encryption related to open and interoperable  systems, such communication systems used by ATC, might require further  developments both in technologies (e.g., non-cryptographic schemes and  public key) and trust framework (see section on gaps and recommendations).  GP 11 – Firewalls, network segmentation, and defence in depth: The border  of the airport network infrastructure should be protected by perimeter  firewalls to block untrusted connections between networks, such as remote  connections to airport systems. Firewalls should be configured to only allow  access to required ports and services and for specific transportation  protocols, like TCP or UDP. A defence in depth approach should be taken to  improve network security by further restricting traffic between network  segments and hosts: for example, using VLANs for traffic separation,  firewalled segmentation, and end-point controls. Separation of airport  functions communications should be enforced. Defence in depth is an  important security concept, as it can limit the impact of a breach in a specific  control: additional layers of communication security, such as authenticated  secure communications (such as, HTTPS) should be employed, combined with  the multitude of best practices, including least privilege.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Exploitation of software  vulnerabilities  -Social attacks  GP 12 – Strong user authentication: IT services provided by airports should  be protected by the use of authentication, such as username and password  credentials. Moreover, sensitive or remote services should require access  only via multifactor authentication, in which identity is verified via multiple  forms of authentication, such as digital certificates, authentication tokens,  One-Time Passwords (OTP), or trusted IP addresses. Biometric identifiers,  such as fingerprints, facial image and iris-patterns can be introduced.  Biometrics techniques are intended to be employed for traveller  identification at border checks, as explored by the Smart Borders Pilot  Project.201 However, biometrics could play an increased role also as  authentication support in Smart airport protection. Persistent failed  authentication attempts should be blocked or rate limited. This will mitigate  the risk of brute force or dictionary attacks.  Malicious actions  -Misuse of authority /  authorisation  Other  GP13 – Integrate shutdown procedure / remote deactivation of capabilities  for assets based on risk: Compromised services or devices should be  configured to foresee the presence of remote shutdown procedures that  switch-off services or devices to avoid data loss. Airport operators should  have the ability to remotely shut-down or deactivate certain  capabilities/functionalities of these assets to minimise damage/loss and  internal incident response capabilities should be established to avoid  individual, panic driven, actions. However, a risk assessment should weight  the advantage of enabling remote shut down (when hacked) against the  disadvantage of opening up another hack-opportunity through the remote  access itself.  Malicious actions  -Denial of service attacks  -Network/interception attacks  -Social attacks  -Tampering with airport devices  GP 14 – Application security and secure design: All airport systems including  bespoke websites and tools should be developed with security implications  and best practices under consideration. Secure design should be part of  System/Services/Technology Acquisition. It should be combined with airport  assets under provisioning risk assessment, privacy by design principle, and  security criteria requirements. Thorough testing, static code analysis and  fuzzing can help to ensure security vulnerabilities are not introduced during  development. A formal approach such as the Security Development Lifecycle  (SDL), including threat modelling, provides rigour to development and ensure  potential security issues are considered and mitigated.

GP 15 – Disaster recovery plans for IT assets: Technical procedures should be  in place to restore the operation of critical IT assets in a Smart airport to an  adequate level of service in case of an emergency, and therefore a disaster  recovery plans must be carefully designed. Both technical and organisational  aspects must be included in such a plan, and people involved in these  operations must have a clear view of their roles, the sequence of actions to  be performed, the actors involved and so on. The disaster recovery plan  should be revised annually, or earlier, if major changes in IT infrastructure  occur.

This should include a configuration  management process for the airport's information system, a determination  of the security impact of changes to the information system, a security  control assessment on the monitoring strategy, a continuous reporting on the  security state of the information system. Continuous and effective  monitoring may be supported by the use of data gathering technologies such  as:  o Asset management tools, allowing to keep an inventory of all the  hardware and software in use at the airport, track their life cycle and  remotely handle single assets;  o Network management tools, allowing to automate device configuration,  ensure device compliance with pre-defined policies as well as detect  unauthorised software/hardware on the network;  o Information management tools, allowing for the monitoring of data  coming from hardware and software equipment, mobile applications,  stationary client devices, cloud-based data and application services as  well as other relevant sources.

The responsibility for adequately mitigating risks arising  from the use of external information system services rests with the  authorising official, who requires that an appropriate chain of trust be  established with external service providers when dealing with the many  issues associated with information security. To enhance trust in the supply  chain, accreditation (i.e. the process of obtaining formal approval by an  authorising official) may be supported by certification against relevant  standards. Standard CEN - EN16082 lays out a set of quality criteria for the  delivery of civil aviation security services to public and private clients.  Third party failures  -All  GP 27 – Enforce explicit rules governing the installation of software: Airports  should rely on software and associated documentation in accordance with  contract agreements and copyright laws. They should employ tracking  systems for software and associated documentation protected by quantity  licenses to control copying and distribution, and controlling and documenting  the use of peer-to-peer file sharing technology to ensure that this capability  is not used for unauthorised distribution. Specific rules should be established  as to which types of software are permitted and which are prohibited.

A verifiable flaw  remediation process should also be implemented to correct security and/or  privacy-related weaknesses/deficiencies identified during the testing and  evaluation process. In the evaluation phase, information security criteria  must be completed by the vendors and software development should be  carried out following systems development life cycle (SDLC). Airport  components that may be subjected to security and privacy assessments  include: hardware and software IT equipment, mobile applications, Web  browsers and applications, database systems (e.g. human resources  management, staff records management, etc.), authentication systems (e.g.  badging systems, staff authentication systems) and intrusion detection  devices (e.g. Perimeter Intrusion Detection Systems).

Additionally, Privileged Access Management can also be  applied as technical control in order to monitor and protect privileged accounts.  There are cases that privileged users are also Third Parties, therefore, such  aforementioned controls are imperative to protect critical operations.

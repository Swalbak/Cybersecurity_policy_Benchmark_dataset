While various initiatives related to  cybersecurity skills have been proposed and multiple actions have been launched to address  the problems, the shortage and gap persist. ENISA has a long tradition of studies and  programmes that have attempted to mitigate similar cybersecurity issues. In an effort to  increase the EU’s future cybersecurity workforce and ensure the availability of appropriately  trained professionals, ENISA has investigated the problem further.  In this report, ENISA contributes to both practice and research on the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap in two distinctive areas. Firstly, it provides an overview of the current supply of  cybersecurity skills in Europe through an analysis of data gathered and generated by the  recently established Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD). Secondly, it  describes the policy approaches adopted by EU Member States in their quest to increase and  sustain their national cybersecurity workforces. These approaches have been classified and  analysed based on objectives defined by ENISA’s National Capabilities Assessment Framework  (NCAF), namely cybersecurity awareness, training, challenges and exercises. Here we note that  this report focuses on the role of the higher education sector in addressing the EU cybersecurity  skills shortage and gap, and therefore vocational or lower forms of education in cybersecurity  related topics are not considered as core parts of this study.  Based on the data collected and analysed under the two areas mentioned above, this report  makes five recommendations to address the EU cybersecurity skills shortage and gap:   Increase enrolments and eventually graduates in cybersecurity programmes through:  o the diversification of the Higher Educational Institutes’ (HEIs) curricula in  terms of content, levels and language.  o the provision of scholarships, especially for underrepresented groups, and  more active efforts to promote cybersecurity as a diverse field.   Support a unified approach across government, industry and HEIs through:  o the adoption of a common framework regarding cybersecurity roles,  competencies, skills and knowledge, for example, the one provided by the  European Cybersecurity Skills Framework.  o the promotion of challenges and competitions in cybersecurity skills.   Increase collaborations between Member States in:  o launching European cybersecurity initiatives with shared objectives.  o sharing of the outputs of programmes (including results and lessons learnt).   Promote analysis of the cybersecurity market needs and trends through:  o the identification of metrics showing the extent of the problem and possible  measures to cope with it.   Support the promotion of CyberHEAD (and its further evolution) in order to:  o facilitate an ongoing understanding of the status of cybersecurity higher  education programmes in the EU.  o monitor trends regarding the number of cybersecurity graduates who could  potentially fill current vacancies in the sector.  o support the analysis of demographics (including the diversity) of new  students and graduates in cybersecurity.  o assist in monitoring the effectiveness of cybersecurity initiatives targeting the  supply side (e.g. changes in enrolments in HEI programmes after the release  of new cybersecurity initiatives).  o demonstrate the value of CyberHEAD for HEIs as well as incentivise HEIs to  submit their programmes to CyberHEAD.  This report  describes the  approaches to  address the  cybersecurity  skills shortage  and gap within  the EU.  It provides  unique insights  into the  programmes  offered by the  EU’s academic  institutions  based on  CyberHEAD  data.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  Technology plays a central role in society today. It supports initiatives by business and  government, enables worldwide communications and drives innovation. As technology has  become more prevalent, so has the reality of cyber-attacks targeting corporations, governments  and individuals. Over the last five years, the World Economic Forum has consistently rated  cyber-attacks as a substantial global risk1, 2 and the latest reports from ENISA further highlight  the complexity of the threat landscape, suggesting that these attacks are increasingly  sophisticated, targeted and widespread3.  In response to the vast increase in online and emerging cyberthreats, the field of cybersecurity  has grown substantially over the last decade. Cybersecurity solutions and technologies are  widely available from industry and open-source communities, and security processes, standards  and laws (e.g. ISO27000, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIS Directive) continue to be  developed and refined. These are all signs of an increasingly mature field and are pivotal to  adequately addressing the dynamic nature of cyberthreats.  An area where cybersecurity remains under-developed however is in the skills present in the  workforce. More specifically, there is a lack of skilled and qualified personnel in the labour  market to work in cybersecurity roles and who can sufficiently address the range of cyberthreats  posed. Over the years, this has become a well-documented problem, which continues to  significantly impact countries across Europe and the world4,5,6,7,8,9. Within countries and specific  sectors, these issues are even more pronounced due to strong competition for security  professionals which often means that certain sectors (e.g. governments and central banks)  have difficulty attracting talented security professionals compared to others (such as the finance  industry) that can offer more lucrative employment10.  The lack of cybersecurity professionals is usually discussed in the context of the cybersecurity  skills gap and cybersecurity skills shortage. These are two distinctive, albeit closely related,  issues. The cybersecurity skills gap is seen to refer to a lack of appropriate skills in the  workforce to perform cybersecurity tasks within a professional setting11,12. On the other hand,  the skills shortage refers to a lack of cybersecurity professionals to fill cybersecurity roles or, as  1 WEF, 2020, The Global Risks Report http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf  2 WEF, 2021, The Global Risks Report 2021 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2021.pdf  3 ENISA, 2020, ENISA Threat Landscape - 2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and- trends Accessed on 27/07/2021  4 ENISA, 2020, Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber- security-education-in-the-european-union  5 CPO, 2020, Study Reveals That Cybersecurity Skills Gap Affects About Three-Quarters of Organizations and Still  Worsening https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/study-reveals-that-cybersecurity-skills-gap-affects-about-three- quarters-of-organizations-and-still-worsening/  6 CBR, 2020, Europe’s Cybersecurity Skills Gap Has Doubled: Report https://www.cbronline.com/news/cybersecurity-job- gap  7 UK Government, 2021, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2021  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2021  8 Australian Cybersecurity Growth Network, 2020, Australia’s Cybersecurity Sector Competitiveness Plan 2020  https://www.austcyber.com/resources/sector-competitiveness-plan  9 NIST, 2017, Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for  a More Secure American Future https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/07/24/eo_wf_report_to_potus.pdf  10 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2020, Priority #4: Cybersecurity Workforce Challenges  https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/11/18/priority-4-cybersecurity-workforce-challenges-pub-83112  11 McGuinness, S., Pouliakas, K., & Redmond, P. 2018.

In this report, we examine both areas.  There have been various attempts to address the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap.  Examples of policies include changes in higher education programmes, closer engagement  between academia and industry, and an increasing number of security certifications and training  opportunities14,15,16,17. Educators, in particular, are often viewed as central figures, as evidenced  by existing research using France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Italy and the UK as units of  analysis.18  One important question for the EU is how such national policies, programmes and interventions  (including any additional ones from industry and academia) may apply to the EU as a whole,  and whether they can help in addressing the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap. Therefore,  in this report, one goal is to pursue these questions to provide insights and recommendations  that are suitable in an EU context.  1.1 SCOPE OF THE REPORT  This report contributes to practice and research into the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap in  two ways. Firstly, it provides an overview of the current supply of advanced cybersecurity skills  in Europe through an analysis of the recently established Cybersecurity Higher Education  Database (CyberHEAD). Secondly, it describes the policy approaches adopted by EU Member  States in their quest to increase and sustain their national cybersecurity workforce. With this  basis the report then proposes a series of recommendations for reducing the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap through Higher Education in the EU.  A primary area of focus in this report is the ENISA Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (CyberHEAD).19 Launched in March 2020, this crowd-sourced database – populated by Higher  Education Institutions (HEIs) – aggregates cybersecurity degrees in the EU and European Free  Trade Association (EFTA) countries. As such, this database provides a unique insight into the  supply of cybersecurity skills on offer from European HEIs as well as information about the  types of individuals being trained. This report presents the first analysis of this data collected by  CyberHEAD.  This report will answer the following research questions:  1. What insights can be derived from ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  about the cybersecurity qualifications and skills being developed by European HEIs?  2. Based on ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, how many and what  types of individuals are undertaking HEI cybersecurity courses in Europe (i.e. the  individuals likely to enter the security workforce)?  3. How are EU Member States attempting to address the cybersecurity skills shortage  and gap in their own countries? For instance, what policy initiatives and what  programmes exist? How do these compare and contrast within the EU?  4. What recommendations can be provided to address the EU’s cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap? This involves questions such as: What recommendations may be  13 McGuinness, S., Pouliakas, K., & Redmond, P. 2018. Skills mismatch: Concepts, measurement and policy approaches.

What policy  initiatives may prove valuable at addressing the cybersecurity shortage and gap? How  can ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database be further enhanced to better  capture key indicators of skills supplied and the workforce being trained in the EU?  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The cybersecurity skills shortage and gap represent a significant problem that is faced by  governments, industry and the wider society. In this report, we provide key insights into the  cybersecurity skills shortage and gap in the EU, reflect on approaches to address it, and  conclude with a series of recommendations to enhance the provisions of skills. The research  and findings in this report are targeted at four main bodies:   EU Member States and European institutions interested in cybersecurity skills  and the role that Higher Education has to play: This report provides the first  comprehensive digest of the provision of cybersecurity qualifications and skills in EU  HEIs, as represented by CyberHEAD (which contains 126 programmes from 25  European countries20). It also presents notable insights into current approaches to  address the skills shortage and gap and the recommendations for states, which draws  on international best practices, which can be applied.   EU Higher Education Institutions (HEIs): This report’s findings can provide an  overview of the cybersecurity qualifications and skills on offer in HEIs across the EU,  how they are supplied, and how many students are currently enrolled and graduating  broken down by gender. Such summary information, along with this report’s  recommendations, can help HEIs better tailor new or existing programmes (e.g. to  match demand in certain subject areas, or fill a gap in other areas).   Business and industry: Businesses and the security industry generally are central to  mitigating the shortage of cybersecurity professionals. This report’s findings define  some of the ongoing problems within the HEI sector, and present opportunities for  businesses to work more closely with academia to create HEI curricula that are in line  with the needs of businesses in the EU.   Researchers and the academic community: The research presented in this report  advances the current discourse into cybersecurity skills, using quantitative (e.g. from  CyberHEAD) and qualitative data (e.g. reports from EU Member States), while also  outlining a series of recommendations. This is one of the largest studies to date on this  topic in the EU and can provide a basis for future research efforts and intellectual  discussion.  1.3 REPORT STRUCTURE  This report is organised as follows:   Section 2 analyses data from ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (CyberHEAD) to understand the characteristics of programmes, the students engaging  with them, and the ability of graduating students to assist in addressing the EU’s need  for skills.   Section 3 examines the different approaches adopted by EU Member States to  mitigate the cybersecurity workforce skills shortage and gap. This is based on a  questionnaire completed by States and openly sourced information.   Section 4 reconsiders the previous sections and provides recommendations on how  EU’s cybersecurity skills shortage and gap may be addressed. This section also  includes recommendations for the further development of CyberHEAD given the key  role it may play in understanding the state of the EU’s cybersecurity skills.  20 This number is based on CyberHEAD data as of 20th June 2021. A different number of programmes might be showing at  the time of reading.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  8  In addition, the Annexes delve deeper into some of the above topics:   Annex A lists the questions that need to be answered by European academic  institutions (HEIs) when listing their programmes in CyberHEAD.   Annex B investigates the questions that might be added to the database in the future in  order to give further insights into the cybersecurity skills gap and shortage.   Annex C includes the full replies provided by the Member States on cybersecurity  skills, policies and initiatives. This data informed Section 3.   Annex D lists the approaches taken by two non-EU countries (the United Kingdom and  the United States) in their efforts to address the shortfall in cybersecurity professionals.   Annex E includes the 126 programmes listed in CyberHEAD on the 20th of June 2021.

THE SUPPLY OF  CYBERSECURITY  QUALIFICATIONS AND SKILLS  2.1 INTRODUCTION  To analyse the supply of cybersecurity qualifications and skills in the EU, this report makes use  of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD). This database is the  largest resource of its nature and is able to provide a reliable and up-to-date snapshot of  cybersecurity programmes available across the EU. This is complementary to, and informed by,  other efforts (e.g. pilot maps from the Cyber Competence Network (CCN)) which aim to  catalogue security courses and training across Europe21. It should be noted that CyberHEAD  may not list all the available cybersecurity programmes in the EU, because it is a crowd-sourced  database which relies on HEIs to submit their programmes.  For degree programmes to be eligible for inclusion in CyberHEAD, there are two core criteria22.  Firstly, the degree must be recognised by the national authority of an EU or European Free  Trade Association (EFTA) Member State. Secondly, the degree’s content must contain a  notable volume of cybersecurity topics. Cybersecurity is defined as any subject within the  knowledge areas of the Cybersecurity Curricula 2017 developed by the Joint Task Force on  Cybersecurity Education23. More specifically:   For a bachelor’s degree: at least 25% of the taught modules must address  cybersecurity topics.   For a master’s degree: at least 40% of the taught modules must address cybersecurity  topics.   For a postgraduate specialisation programme: at least 40% of the taught modules must  address cybersecurity topics and the programme must have a minimum of 30 hours for  the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).  The questions that HEIs are expected to answer in order to be added to CyberHEAD, which  also define the type of data stored in the database, can be found in Annex A.  The dynamic nature of programmes – i.e. the speed at which degrees may be launched,  changed or removed – makes it difficult for any database to be complete. On the 20th of June  2021, CyberHEAD contained 126 programmes from 25 European countries as can be found in  Annex E. Figure 1 presents the geographical distribution of CyberHEAD programmes.  21 Cyber Competence Network, 2021, CCN projects contributed to the ENISA CyberHEAD portal which helps students to  choose cybersecurity programs. https://cybercompetencenetwork.eu/ccn-projects-contributed-to-the-enisa-cyberhead- portal-which-helps-students-to-choose-cybersecurity-programs/  22 ENISA, 2020, Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber- security-education-in-the-european-union  23 Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education, 2017, Curriculum Guidelines for Post-Secondary Degree Programs in  Cybersecurity https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf  CyberHEAD – Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  provides the largest reliable and updated source of information  on higher education cybersecurity programmes in Europe  www.enisa.europa.eu/cyberhead  https://cybercompetencenetwork.eu/ccn-projects-contributed-to-the-enisa-cyberhead-portal-which-helps-students-to-choose-cybersecurity-programs/ https://cybercompetencenetwork.eu/ccn-projects-contributed-to-the-enisa-cyberhead-portal-which-helps-students-to-choose-cybersecurity-programs/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber-security-education-in-the-european-union https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber-security-education-in-the-european-union https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/cyberhead  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  10  Figure 1: Geographical distribution of CyberHEAD programmes  Section 2 is composed of two parts: Section 2.2 reports on an analysis of HEI data to derive  insights into the cybersecurity qualifications and skills provided, while Section 2.3 uses  CyberHEAD’s data to examine demographic information about the cohorts and graduates of the  programmes listed.  2.2 AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CYBERSECURITY  PROGRAMMES  CyberHEAD includes a variety of information about cybersecurity programmes, which can be  used to assess the nature of skills courses being offered in the EU. The oldest programme in  the database started in 2000 and is a bachelor’s degree in Secure Information Systems, and  after that there is a master’s degree in Cybersecurity which was founded in 2002. Most  programmes (64%) were launched between 2015 and 2020, with 2019 being the most prolific  year (20 new courses were established, 16% of the total in the database).  Figure 2 provides an overview based on programmes where we possess data on the years  when they were started, while Figure 3 aggregates these data to visualise the increase of  cybersecurity programmes over the years. These trends broadly match the rise in cybersecurity  as a field of study and practice, and the increase in demand for adequately trained security  professionals. Several notable strategies and reports were also released in the lead up to these  years including the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, ENISA’s Cybersecurity Education snapshot for  workforce development in the EU24 and the International Information System Security  Certification Consortium’s (ISC)² report on Cybersecurity Workforce Competencies25.  24 ENISA, 2015, Cybersecurity Education snapshot for workforce development in the EU  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/cybersecurity-education-snapshot-for- workforce-development-in-the-eu/view  25 (ISC)2, 2014, Cybersecurity Workforce Competencies: Preparing Tomorrow’s Risk-Ready Professionals  https://www.isc2.org/-/media/Files/Research/GISWS-Archive/Workforce-Competencies-Report-Phoenix-2014.ashx  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/cybersecurity-education-snapshot-for-workforce-development-in-the-eu/view https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/cybersecurity-education-snapshot-for-workforce-development-in-the-eu/view https://www.isc2.org/-/media/Files/Research/GISWS-Archive/Workforce-Competencies-Report-Phoenix-2014.ashx  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  11  These reports, in combination with the increase in demand for cybersecurity skills and changes  in the labour market26, have undoubtedly influenced the demand for, and provision of, security-  oriented HEI programmes.  Figure 2: Programmes established per year27  Figure 3: Total programmes per year28  26 ISO, 2021, The Cybersecurity Skills Gap: Why education is our best weapon against cybercrime  https://www.iso.org/news/ref2655.html  27 Programme data for the year 2021 has been excluded because for 2021 the data are only provisional.  28 Ibid.  https://www.iso.org/news/ref2655.html  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  12  Master-level qualifications constitute most of the programme types (77%) in the database,  followed by bachelor programmes (17%) and postgraduate programmes (6%), as can be seen  from Figure 4. The high number of master programmes is intriguing when considering that there  is a higher cybersecurity topic requirement (i.e. at least 40% of taught modules) compared with  undergraduate programmes (which require at least 25%). The large quantity of master's degree  programmes suggests that cybersecurity is regarded as a specialist topic which should be  taught at a higher educational level than an undergraduate degree. This is also noticeable in  some courses as they present admission profiles that call for recent graduates in Computer  Science, Engineering, Mathematical Sciences or Physical Sciences. There is also an emphasis  on work experience as a requirement for admission to a small set of master programmes. In  such cases, at least two years of relevant professional experience is mentioned, preferably after  an undergraduate degree.  Bachelor qualifications in cybersecurity seem less common based on the data but there has  been a rise in new courses since 2018. A challenge for the establishment of such programmes,  however, is for HEIs to convince students to commit to a specific qualification pathway instead  of a more general degree such as computer science or engineering, which may give them  broader career options later on. Choosing cybersecurity as an undergraduate degree may be  risky for many students, particularly as cybersecurity jobs are attainable with only a computing  or engineering degree. For reference, if we compare the proportion of master and bachelor  programmes to those in other countries, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre shows that  certified master qualifications are similarly prominent29.  Figure 4: Programme types  The accessibility of EU HEI programmes is an important concern when discussing the  cyber skills gap. Courses that present barriers to entry for students can impact recruitment and  ultimately reduce the pool of graduates that may later enter the security workforce. Accessibility  is interpreted broadly in this report, and as such is concerned with any factors that may impact  the ability to access or apply for courses. To assess accessibility, this report examines the  delivery method adopted by current programmes, the language in which programmes are  taught, and whether fees apply for EU citizens. All these factors provide some basic insights into  how open current courses are to applicants from across the EU and are grounded in general  literature regarding potential inhibitors to education30,31.  29 UK National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC), 2020, NCSC-certified degrees https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc- certified-degrees  30 Nuffield Foundation, 2019, Tuition fee rises mean children are less likely to aspire to go to university  https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/news/tuition-fee-rises-mean-children-are-less-likely-to-aspire-to-go-to-university  31 World Economic Forum (WEF), 2020, The COVID-19 pandemic has changed education forever. This is how  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-certified-degrees https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-certified-degrees https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/news/tuition-fee-rises-mean-children-are-less-likely-to-aspire-to-go-to-university https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  13  Considering delivery methods first, 57% of programmes are classroom only, 29% are blended  (classroom and online) and 14% are online (see Figure 5). This suggests that geographic  proximity to the HEI is necessary in most programmes. While the benefits of classroom-based  interaction are undeniable (and typically range from tailored in-person teaching to dedicated  security labs and class-based exercises), online courses are increasingly popular as they are  more flexible and can cater to a large number of geographically dispersed students. This reality  has become even more salient due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the various national and  city-wide lockdowns across Europe.  Figure 5: Programme delivery methods  Language is relevant to the discussion of opportunities and barriers-to-entry because at least 24  languages are spoken across Europe. Programmes in widely known languages such as English  are arguably more accessible to a greater number of EU citizens. In total, 16 languages were  represented in the CyberHEAD data: 38% of courses were in English, 17% in Spanish, 11% in  German, 7% in Italian, 5% in French, 4% in Greek, and 4% in Portuguese (see Figure 6).  There is some overlap in the origin of courses with programmes from Italy, Spain, France, and  Austria appearing most. The fact that 38% of programmes are taught in English is excellent  given the diversity of languages in Europe, but an even higher percentage of English-based  programmes also presents additional benefits. For instance, it might facilitate the creation of a  fully rounded professional who is able to read and communicate in English and interact  seamlessly in an international setting. It might also attract international students looking for the  best opportunities in the EU.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  14  Figure 6: Programmes per language with percentages  Fees are another important topic when it comes to considering access. This report found that in  71% of programmes EU citizens need to pay fees in order to enrol (see Figure 7). This topic is  more contentious because although free programmes can lower the financial barrier to entry,  HEIs need income to fund teaching staff, dedicated software and computing labs. Unless these  funds are provided by governments or through industry partnerships, fees will still have to be  charged.  Figure 7: Programme fees  A primary aim of this report is to determine the skills provided by EU cybersecurity programmes.  To investigate this further, this study assessed the amount of credits (measured using the  European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)) allocated to various security  topics within each course. Across all programmes (bachelor, master and postgraduate  programmes) where data was provided:  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  15   48.45% of content was dedicated to Security Computing/Engineering disciplines,   9.55% to Law, Ethics, Policy, Privacy, Cybercrime disciplines,   12.11% to Organisational, Risk management, Business, Compliance disciplines,   4.49% to internships,   and 25.4% to other content.  For a breakdown according to programme, see Figure 8.  Figure 8: All Bachelor and Master/Postgraduate programmes average ECTS allocation  Programmes Average ECTS Allocation  Bachelor Programmes: Average ECTS Allocation  Master/Postgraduate Programmes: Average ECTS Allocation  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  16  The data demonstrates a clear presence of more cybersecurity engineering topics in the EU’s  HEI cybersecurity programmes, which is especially visible in master and postgraduate  programmes. The bachelor programmes contain only 33.73% of cybersecurity engineering  material, and instead have substantial ‘Other’ content (at 42.92%). This is likely attributable to  the need to cover more general topics outside the scope of security (including foundational  computing courses) considering that these cannot be assumed because it is a first degree.  Reflecting on this finding, it appears to map well with the skills needed as discussed in reports  on the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap. The 2020 ESG and ISSA report found that the  areas with the greatest shortage of cybersecurity skills were application security, cloud  computing security, security analysis and investigations, security engineering, and the  administration of risk and/or compliance32. Many of these areas continued to be weak in the  2021 ESG and ISSA report.33 Cloud computing security (which is within Security  Computing/Engineering disciplines) is highlighted in the (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study  2020 as the principal area in which professionals should aim to increase their skills34. These  studies suggest that current programmes have the appropriate subject focus.  Beyond Cybersecurity Computing/Engineering disciplines, it is encouraging to see programmes  also offering topics such as Organisational, Risk Management, Business, Compliance  disciplines and Law, Ethics, Policy, Privacy and Cybercrime. However, these seem low when  compared to skills required by the labour market as mentioned in the (ISC)² Cybersecurity  Workforce Study35. In this study, Risk assessment, analysis, management and governance, and  Risk management and compliance occupy the second and forth positions (respectively) of the  top cybersecurity skills of interest to professionals. This research is especially relevant to this  report’s work as 28% of the 3,790 respondents were from Europe.  Over time, the importance of law, ethics and privacy concerns within cybersecurity are also  likely to increase, due to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  and the NIS Directive. The reality is that these topics are not traditionally taught within  engineering or computers science degrees and therefore will require HEIs to involve educators  from other departments. An added benefit to offering a broader curriculum would be the  development of more rounded cybersecurity students who will then be able to blend technical  and socio-technical skills in a professional setting.  An important point concerning the above analysis is that it presents mean averages across the  entire 124 programmes present in the database36. A reality however is that, as with all degree  courses, some courses specialise in certain areas and therefore contain more (or less) of  certain topics. For instance, a cybersecurity degree offered by a Politics department will differ  significantly to one offered by an Engineering school; i.e. the former is likely to include more  Law, Ethics, Policy, Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines rather than engineering or computer  science courses.  To provide more insight into the programmes, we also assessed the number of programmes  that concentrated on Security Computing/Engineering disciplines as compared to those that  focused on other disciplines. In total, 60 programmes contained 50% or more content (in terms  of ECTS points) on Security Computing/Engineering disciplines. This represents almost half of  all programmes and reaffirms the above findings.  32 ESG and ISSA, 2020, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020 https://www.esg- global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020  33 ESG and ISSA, 2021, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2021 https://www.esg- global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021  34 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  35 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  36 2 out of 126 programmes have not provided information about their ECTS  CyberHEAD  shows, on  average, a clear  prevalence of  cybersecurity  computing and  engineering topics  in the EU’s higher  education  cybersecurity  programmes  https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  17  Considering Organisational, Risk management, Business, Compliance disciplines and Law,  Ethics, Policy, Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines, only 10 programmes possess more than  50% of these disciplines combined. This demonstrates the dearth of such programmes but  presents opportunities for further expansion in HEIs.  Preparing graduates for the cybersecurity workplace is an implicit goal of HEI programmes.  There are various ways in which this can be achieved. For instance, internships in organisations  provide students with valuable working experience through which knowledge can be applied  and practice gained. Programmes with educators from industry (or content directly informed by  industry) ensure that security topics are relevant to actual workplace tasks and issues. Finally,  courses which prepare students for a professional security certification (e.g. CISSP, CISM) or  are accredited by national security bodies directly support the development of a career in  security. We reflect on these topics further below.  Assessing CyberHEAD data, only 34% of EU programmes envisage a compulsory internship for  students. While internships can be challenging to setup, the lack of internship opportunities may  negatively impact the skills of graduates, and also make it more difficult to attain a security job  given a lack of working experience. Internships are one of the top recommendations in the  Cybersecurity professionals report37 and the BHEF’s report on reducing the deficit in  Cybersecurity talent38. Another method of supporting engagement with industry is through the  use of educators and guest lecturers who are employed in the cybersecurity industry. This type  of interaction was present in 75% of the programmes, which is an impressive statistic (see  Figure 9). Although the data do not provide information on the extent to which these  professionals are engaged in these educational settings, it is encouraging to find this level of  collaboration between the HEIs and industry.  Figure 9: How programmes prepare students for the work environment  As it relates to professional certification, 23% of programmes in the database reported that they  prepare students for specific professional certifications. The top 7 certifications that were  mentioned are shown in Figure 10 and include: ISO 27001, CEH, CISM, CCNA Security,  CySA+, CISSP and CompTIA Security+. This low percentage appears to be reasonable  because, while certificates may be ideal to link the supply with the demand for cybersecurity  skills, educationalists may contend that HEIs should arguably be more concentrated on  foundational knowledge and skills. The certifications mentioned appear quite common,  37 ESG and ISSA, 2020, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020 https://www.esg- global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020  38 BHEF, 2020, Invest to Improve: The Cybersecurity Talent Deficit https://www.bhef.com/publications/invest-improve- cybersecurity-talent-deficit  Beyond  Cybersecurity  computing and  engineering  disciplines,  programmes also  focus on topics  such as  Organisational,  Risk Management,  Business,  Compliance  disciplines and  Law, Ethics,  Policy, Privacy and  Cybercrime.  https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.bhef.com/publications/invest-improve-cybersecurity-talent-deficit https://www.bhef.com/publications/invest-improve-cybersecurity-talent-deficit  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  18  especially ones such as CISSP, which are viewed as particularly coveted and conducive to  enhancing the chances of acquiring a job in cybersecurity39, 40, 41.  There are also several other certifications which are held by security professionals in industry.  These include Cisco Certified CyberOps, CCNP Security, CCSP, Certified Web Security  Professional and CISA42. Adapting such courses that prepare students for any of these wide  ranges of certificates as well may further increase their job prospects.  A noteworthy factor is their hands-on nature and the work experience that they require, which  may make them less suitable to be adopted in traditional HEI settings. One option could be for  certain HEI programmes to build on the technical knowledge necessary to obtain certificates  while also ensuring that an appropriate academic foundation is provided within their courses.  This would be especially important for HEIs, as the CISSP has been recognised as being  comparable to the RQF Level 7, which is the same level as an UK master degree43.  Figure 10: Top seven (7) certifications in CyberHEAD  2.3 AN ASSESSMENT OF ENROLMENTS AND GRADUATES AND THEIR  ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS FOR SKILLS  Another important question this report seeks to answer pertains to the demographic of  individuals undertaking HEI cybersecurity courses in the EU. Addressing this question would  provide some understanding of the number of graduates who could potentially enter the  cybersecurity workforce over the next 2-3 years, the gender balance within EU HEI programmes  (which also has further implications on the persons entering the workforce) and insights that  may be attained at the level of EU Member States.  Focusing first on current graduates, a total of 2,444 students graduated from the HEIs in 2020  according to CyberHEAD’s data. Of these, 1,940 were from master and other postgraduate  programmes, and 504 from bachelor programmes. Looking at the enrolment data present in the  database, 4,843 students entered their first year of studies in 2020. Of these, 3,415 were new  students at the master and postgraduate level and 1,428 at bachelor level (see Figure 11).  39 ESG and ISSA, 2020, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020 https://www.esg- global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020  40 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  41 ESG and ISSA, 2021, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2021 https://www.esg- global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021  42 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  43 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² CISSP Certification Now Comparable to master’s degree Standard https://www.isc2.org/News-and- Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard  GRADUATES  PROJECTION  The number of  cybersecurity  graduates is going to  double in the next 2-  3 years.  https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.isc2.org/News-and-Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard https://www.isc2.org/News-and-Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  19  The benefit of knowing the number of enrolments per year (in the database) is that one can  make a projection about the number of cybersecurity students who may enter the cybersecurity  workforce in the near future, taking into account some assumptions such as that enrolled  students successfully complete their studies and that the majority of students in these  programmes decide to pursue a cybersecurity career.  For instance, as master programmes are typically one-to-two years in duration, it may be  assumed that either in 2021 or 2022, the number of master and postgraduate graduates will be  76% more than in 2020. For bachelor programmes, which typically have a duration of 3 years,  the number of graduates who may enter the workforce in 2023 is almost triple with respect to  2020. Overall, based on the same assumptions, we can expect that the number of graduates in  cybersecurity will double in 2 or 3 years (i.e. when the first-year students complete their  academic studies). It should be noted that the increase in potential graduates can primarily be  linked to the introduction of new programmes, and not necessarily large rises in enrolment.  Figure 11: New enrolments and graduates in 2020  Gender balance is another important topic that should be examined as we investigate  cybersecurity education and the cybersecurity industry. As noted in existing research, gender  diversity in security roles can often be less representative than some national populations44.  From an analysis of CyberHEAD’s data, the percentage of female students graduating in 2020  with respect to the overall population was 18% (434). In the same year, only 20% (940) of  students enrolled were female (see Figure 12). These numbers are lower than what is reported  in studies that found that women represent 25% of the industry’s cybersecurity workforce45,  which again suggests that HEIs should aim to increase their enrolment numbers further.  The general underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics  (STEM) and in cybersecurity is a well-documented phenomenon46, but research has shown that this  issue is improving47. One of the primary suggestions to increase the representation of women in  cybersecurity is to encourage them to pursue STEM degrees in the first place. This could therefore  44 NCSC, 2020, Decrypting diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cyber security. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and- inclusion-in-cyber-security-report  45 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  46 (ISC)², 2018, Women in Cybersecurity. https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/ISC2-Women-in-Cybersecurity- Report.ashx  47 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  CyberHEAD  shows an under-  representation of  women studying  cybersecurity.  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  20  be a perfect opportunity for EU courses to try to boost female enrolment, given the benefits this would  have on the larger security industry in the EU. To add to this, a more concrete suggestion that might  be explored is spotlighting women in cyber roles and recent female graduates, offering mentoring  opportunities for young students or by offering scholarships to female students. Each of these actions  may assist in increasing enrolments, which could later translate into graduates entering the EU  security workforce.  Figure 12: Students that graduated (left) and new students enrolled (right) in 2020 by gender  Graduates by Gender  New Students Enrolled by Gender  On the issue of gender diversity and the number of graduates at the country level, we can  observe in Figure 13 that there are only six countries with a rate of 20% or more of female  graduates (out of the total number of graduates) within their cybersecurity programmes, namely  Romania (50%), Latvia (47%), Bulgaria (42%), Lithuania (31%), France (20%) and Sweden  (20%).  Regarding enrolment’s numbers, Romania (48%), Latvia (42%), Estonia (30%), Hungary (27%),  Spain (24%), Finland (23%), Denmark (22%), Cyprus (22%), Greece (21%) and Germany  (20%) report the highest number of female enrolments48. This enrolment rate is above the 20%  average across the entire CyberHEAD database. Unfortunately, these statistics mean that,  overall, most HEI programmes in Europe have particularly low levels of gender diversity. The  nature of enrolment thus suggests that this issue could persist in the future EU workforce as  well and it can directly impact the workforces in the States identified49.  48 It should be noted that Romania, Estonia and Hungary only have one programme each in CyberHEAD and therefore this  may not be representative. Furthermore, the total number of programmes in CyberHEAD with at least one graduate in 2020  was 93 and the total number of programmes with complete enrolment data in 2020 was 121.  49 Readers should note that there were no records of graduates for 2020 generally for Denmark, Hungary and Norway in  CyberHEAD. Hence, these countries are absent from the graduate component of Figure 13.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  21  Figure 13: Female students graduated (top) and new female students enrolled (bottom) in 2020  per country  Female Students Graduated in 2020 - Percentage per Country  New Female Students Enrolled in 2020 - Percentage per Country  Going beyond these descriptive figures there is also a critical question as to whether the gender  balance in countries has improved or worsened. This can be examined to some extent by  reviewing the number of graduates in 2020 (viewed as a representation of the past) and the  enrolments in that year (a representation of the present situation, which also influences future  graduates), by combining the data used in Figure 13.  A total of twelve countries reported increases in female students on programmes when  comparing those graduating and those recently enrolled: Estonia (10% to 30%), Switzerland  (0% to 24%), Poland (0% to 15%), Cyprus (13% to 22%), Spain (18% to 24%), Finland (17% to  23%), Germany (14% to 20%), Greece (17% to 21%), Italy (15% to 19%), Austria (12% to 14%),  Ireland (9% to 10%) and Belgium (11% to 12%). This is a positive and encouraging finding.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  22  Nine countries, however, reported decreases in the percentage of females on average enrolled  across programmes: Bulgaria (42% to 18%), Lithuania (31% to 19%), Latvia (47% to 42%),  Portugal (13% to 9%), Romania (50% to 48%), Luxembourg (14% to 13%), France (20% to  19%), Netherlands (16% to 15%) and Sweden (20% to 19%). While these numbers are prone to  fluctuations from year-to-year, these countries and their HEIs should pay closer attention to  gender balance and act to actively reduce the gender gap.  At a more general level, it is also pertinent to reflect on how cybersecurity programmes, student  enrolments and the number of students graduating compare between countries. Although  CyberHEAD may not be, at this point in time, completely representative of EU cybersecurity  programmes, it is the largest database established thus far and therefore can still provide some  valuable insights.  The top six countries with the highest number of cybersecurity programmes by population are  Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Austria and Finland respectively (Figure 14). As these  programme totals offer only a very high-level view, it is also prudent to assess the breakdown by  student enrolments and graduates.  Figure 14: Number of programmes by country per capita (based on 1-1-2021 Eurostat)  For enrolments by population, Cyprus again scores highly followed by Finland, Austria,  Lithuania and Estonia (Figure 15). Also, in examining graduates, there is a similar trend with  Cyprus, Finland, Estonia, Austria and Luxembourg leading. These rankings are undoubtedly  impacted by the smaller sizes of the populations of these countries as compared to larger  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  23  states. For instance, Cyprus has only 3 programmes, 128 students enrolled and 53 graduates,  yet it scores the highest – albeit its population being 896,005. Although the size of the country  affects the above figures, it is still encouraging to see the emphasis placed by HEIs in these  countries on developing their cybersecurity HEI programmes.  Figure 15: New students enrolled and graduates by population (in Million)  New Students Enrolled by Population  Graduates by Population  This concludes our analysis into the supply of cybersecurity qualifications and skills in the EU,  based on ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD).  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  24  3. INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP IN THE EU  3.1 INTRODUCTION  In the context of the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap, actions around Europe have been  taken not only to increase the cybersecurity workforce but also to increase the quality of  candidates and equip them with the skills most requested by the industry.  Since 2010, the European Commission‘s Digital Agenda for Europe50 has highlighted the  challenge concerning the ‘lack of digital literacy and skills’ and that their enhancement would  promote employment in the overall ICT field (including security). Additionally, it has been noted  that the ‘ICT skills shortage’ needs to be addressed through coordination and a joint approach  by the EU Member States (MS). Similar goals were also included in the renewed Digital  Education Action Plan (2021-2027)51. Furthermore, to tackle the growing gap between  capacities and market needs caused by the fast evolution of technology, initiatives such as the  European Digital Skills and Jobs Platform52 – offering information and resources on digital skills  – were launched.  At the policy level, the NIS Directive53, published in July 2016, requires EU MSs to adopt a  national strategy for the security of network and information systems, also referred to as a  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS). By 2021, most of the EU MSs have included in their  NCSS at least one objective that aims to address the cybersecurity skills shortage.  The following section examines several policy initiatives that address the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap in Europe. The data used was collected via a questionnaire which was sent to  representatives of EU MSs at the end of March 2021. The information provided by the MSs was  supplemented by publicly available information. In April 2021, 13 out of 27 EU MSs54 provided  information on their cybersecurity workforce initiatives; these are included in full in Annex C. We  have to note that this section does not seek to list all the initiatives working towards alleviating  the problem. Instead, it explores a sample of such initiatives to gain an understanding of the  state of such efforts across the EU.  The analysis below will follow ENISA’s National Capabilities Assessment Framework (NCAF)55,  more specifically the strategic objectives under ‘Cluster 2 - Capacity-building and awareness’.  Within this cluster, we made use of three strategic objectives in order to classify the initiatives of  Member States to mitigate the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap:   Raise user awareness amongst the general public, as well as primary and  secondary education – Identify gaps in cybersecurity knowledge and address them  50 A Digital Agenda For Europe (2010) COM(2010)245 final. https://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF  51 European Commission (2021) Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the- eu/digital-education-action-plan_en  52 European Commission (2021) Digital Skills and Jobs Platform, https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/about/digital-skills- and-jobs-platform  53 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  54 The approaches taken by Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania,  Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain will be examined.  55 ENISA National Capabilities Assessment Framework (2020) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national- capabilities-assessment-framework  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/about/digital-skills-and-jobs-platform https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/about/digital-skills-and-jobs-platform https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  25  by raising awareness or by developing or strengthening basic knowledge. Related  initiatives should target the general public as well as primary and secondary school  students and teachers.   Strengthen training and promote cybersecurity in higher education – Enhance  the operational capabilities of the existing cybersecurity workforce, encourage  university students to join the cybersecurity field and equip them with the appropriate  knowledge bases, foster collaboration in cybersecurity between academia and industry  and align cybersecurity training with business needs.   Organise cybersecurity exercises and challenges – Identify the skills that need to  be assessed, set up a national cyber exercise planning team, integrate cyber exercises  within the lifecycle of the national cybersecurity strategy or the national cyber  contingency plan. Deploy cyber-ranges that allow individuals to advance their skills in  cybersecurity inside controlled environments. Identify young talent and promote  cybersecurity by organising competitions.  Annex D lists an analysis of some of the initiatives conducted outside the EU.  3.2 RAISE USER AWARENESS AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND  IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION  Most of the initiatives to fill gaps in cybersecurity knowledge have involved awareness-raising  events and the inclusion of digital skills (including information security) in primary and secondary  education. These initiatives have aimed to not only to improve cyber capabilities in the younger  generation but also to promote cybersecurity and motivate students to study cybersecurity and  to seek a career in this sector. In many cases, cybersecurity skills and competencies have been  introduced as part of broader digital literacy programmes. Below we present the most relevant  initiatives.  CZECH REPUBLIC  The NCSS (2021-2025)56 of the Czech Republic dedicates an entire section to cybersecurity  ‘Education and Awareness’, stressing the need to develop cybersecurity skills and educate the  population (especially high-risk groups). Cybersecurity education starts in pre-school and aims  to teach the safe use of digital technologies.  To this end, the Czech Republic’s National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB)57  seeks to ensure that building relevant cybersecurity skills is a goal at the primary and secondary  school levels. The revision of the educational plan is currently underway and NÚKIB is aiming to  ensure that relevant cybersecurity skills are implemented at these levels of education.  The Czech NCSS also includes goals related to ’Expanding the Qualified Base’ of cybersecurity  and the need to create and maintain a qualified cybersecurity workforce. There are two ways it  seeks to achieve this: firstly, by promoting awareness-raising programmes and creating the  appropriate working conditions that encourage talented people to study and pursue a career in  cybersecurity; secondly, by improving the ability of organisations to hire and retain cybersecurity  professionals using inducements such as the provision of opportunities for career growth,  attractive salaries and healthy work cultures and environments.  Furthermore, NÚKIB offers internships to university students in various cybersecurity areas,  while it also organises an annual conference called CyberCon58, which is open to the public and  focuses on students and education. Moreover, NÚKIB also hosts various public panel  56 National Cybersecurity Strategy of the Czech Republic 2021-2025,  https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf  57 NÚKIB, https://www.nukib.cz  58 CyberCon, https://www.cybercon.cz/  https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf https://www.nukib.cz/ https://www.cybercon.cz/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  26  discussions and workshops centred around the topics of cybersecurity (often targeting children,  the elderly, parents, and/or teachers), which include cybersecurity courses for the public59.  DENMARK  The Danish National Cyber and Information Security Strategy (2018)60 has launched two  cybersecurity awareness programmes under the ‘Better competencies initiatives’: 1) an initiative  called the ‘Digital judgment and digital competencies acquired via the educational system’ which  focuses on raising awareness of security challenges and developing cybersecurity teaching  resources targeting young children, students and teachers; and 2) an initiative called ‘Improved  awareness drives aimed at citizens and businesses’ which targets specific groups of citizens  and businesses to address their cybersecurity challenges.  Moreover, the Danish government has organised awareness campaigns and disseminated  educational materials via the ‘sikkerdigital.dk’61 information portal, hosted by the Danish Agency  for Digitisation (an agency of the Ministry of Finance) and the Danish Business Authority.  Through this portal, citizens, companies and authorities can access cybersecurity related  knowledge, guidance and tools, which can be used to improve online security. The main  purpose of the portal is to strengthen competencies in the field of cybersecurity in both the  public and private sectors, to raise awareness of cyberthreats and to continuously improve  knowledge on how they can be safely mitigated.  Moreover, the Danish government has developed and supported a number of cybersecurity  educational programmes and academic curricula to be taught at the primary and secondary  education levels. Additionally, Denmark’s digital learning portal (EMU)62,63 was established in  order to provide educational material on digital education, cybersecurity and more broadly in  ICT. It is currently being evaluated in Danish primary schools. Furthermore, the Ministry of  Children and Education has also developed a large quantity of educational material the focuses  on helping educators teach data protection and information security.  GREECE  Greece, in its latest NCSS (2020-2025)64, puts special emphasis on capacity building, in  particular the development of cybersecurity skills. On raising awareness, the strategy foresees  the creation of an Education and Awareness Action Plan. Moreover, the strategy highlights the  special emphasis that will be given to the creation of appropriate incentives for the younger  generation in order to acquainted them with cybersecurity and induce them to consider it as a  subject of study or specialisation.  IRELAND  In its most recent NCSS (2019-2024)65, Ireland placed a special focus on cybersecurity skills.  Among other measures, the strategy plans the promotion of cybersecurity as a career option,  through the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) with its Smart Futures Programme, targeting  schools and colleges66. Moreover, the strategy foresees the support of the development of a  junior cycle short course in cybersecurity. To this end, the Irish National Cyber Security Centre  (NCSC)67, in collaboration with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications,  is involved in the development of a curriculum for short cybersecurity courses targeting  59 NÚKIB, https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/  60 National Cyber and Information Security Strategy (2018),  https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf  61 Sikkerdigital.dk, https://sikkerdigital.dk/  62 EMU Denmark's learning portal, https://emu.dk  63 Ministry of Children and Education.

Furthermore, the strategy also aims to support initiatives which encourage  women to join the cybersecurity field, such as the ‘Cyber Women Ireland’ initiative.  LATVIA  The latest Latvian NCSS (2019-2022)68 had an area dedicated to ‘public awareness, education  and research’, among other topics. In particular, the strategy’s action plan includes the following  initiatives in awareness:   raising awareness about information security among students and teachers,   improving public awareness of online safety, and   developing and implementing annual multi-agency action and campaign plans with  cybersecurity information events and awareness raising campaigns.  LITHUANIA  Lithuania’s NCSS (2018) acknowledges the cybersecurity skills shortage problem, stating that  the needs of the Lithuanian labour market are currently not being met by the supply of those  skills. Nevertheless, the strategy observes that cybersecurity courses are available for civil  servants in order to improve their cybersecurity skills and, based on statistics related to the  number of participants, attendance by civil servants is growing each year. The strategy also  states that in order to improve the country’s cybersecurity culture, fundamental cybersecurity  knowledge should be provided at all educational levels.  MALTA  One of the goals of the Maltese NCSS (2016)69 is to establish a specialist cybersecurity  educational curriculum and to integrate the digital education of its citizens into primary schools.  THE NETHERLANDS  One of the actions taken by the Dutch National Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA)70 on the issue of  cybersecurity knowledge and awareness was to include ‘Digital Literacy’ in the curriculum at the  primary and secondary education levels. Moreover, the policy documents also encourage the  business community and civil society organisations to advance further the digital skills of  employees and citizens. Furthermore, Kennisnet71, a public organisation which was funded by  the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, supports the use of ICT in schools, providing  educational content, strategic advice and expertise in the broader field of ICT.  SLOVENIA  The Slovenian NCSS (2016)72 sets two awareness related measures to improve citizens’ safety  in cyberspace. Firstly, it sets up the regular implementation of awareness-raising programmes  on cybersecurity; secondly, it adds cybersecurity content to education and training programmes.  SPAIN  Through Digital Spain 202573 ‘Line 3 - Digital Skills’, Spain promotes of basic digital skills to the  public in order to increase confidence in conducting online activities responsibly. The plan aims  to equip both students and workers with the advanced digital skills required in the workplace  and for everyday use, to promote digital careers and reduce the gender gap in digital skills.  68 Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia, Cyber Security Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022,  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022  69 Maltese Cybersecurity Strategy (2016), https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security- Strategy-Book.pdf  70 Dutch National Cybersecurity Agenda (2018) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf  71 Kennisnet, https://www.kennisnet.nl/about-us/  72 Slovenian National Cybersecurity Strategy (2016)  https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf  73 Spain Digital 2025, https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/ministerio/estrategias/Pages/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022 https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security-Strategy-Book.pdf https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security-Strategy-Book.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf https://www.kennisnet.nl/about-us/ https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/ministerio/estrategias/Pages/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  28  Another measure concerns the identification and development of cybersecurity talent in order to  address the overall shortage of skills.  Furthermore, the National Plan for Digital Skills of Spain (2021)74 provides 3.75 billion euro to  promote public reforms and investments in fields such as digital inclusion (including reducing  the digital gap between men and women), the digitalisation of education and the acquisition of  digital skills by both unemployed and employed workers.  The Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) has also launched ‘Despega’75, a  programme which aims to promote the presence of women in cybersecurity. Although the goal  of the initiative is to improve the gender balance, it also seeks to improve the shortage in skills  by raising awareness, attracting talent, boosting training, visibility, entrepreneurship and the  employability of women. In the same context, the first national section of ECSO's  Women4Cyber76 programme has recently been founded in Spain. This programme is aligned  with other initiatives at the European level and it is reaching agreements with different entities  (both public and private) seeking to promote the presence of women in this area.  3.3 STRENGTHEN TRAINING AND PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY IN  HIGHER EDUCATION  Initiatives that aim to build up cybersecurity training and higher educational programmes are of  great importance when it comes to mitigating the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap as they  improve the operational capabilities of the existing cybersecurity workforce, encourage students  to pursue cybersecurity topics and promote and foster relations between academia and the  industry, as well as aligning cybersecurity training with the actual needs of industry. In what  follows, we present some key initiatives.  CZECH REPUBLIC  The Czech Republic’s Action Plan77 is a policy document that traditionally complements the  NCSS. It was approved by the government in July 2021 and the following three focus areas in  relation to cybersecurity skills are listed:  1. Quality education system,  2. Outreach and education, and  3. Vocational education and expanding the qualified base.  The above three areas specify 23 tasks that are expected to have a positive impact on the  development of cybersecurity skills. These tasks deal with the definition and implementation of  standards in cybersecurity skills into general and vocational education, training, conferences,  workshops and other activities. NÚKIB is responsible for most of these tasks and cooperates  with several other entities (e.g. the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports) to fulfil them.  DENMARK  In Denmark, in order to have sufficiently skilled personnel to detect and handle cyber-attacks,  the Centre for Cybersecurity (CFCS)78 has created its own Cyber Academy.  With regards to higher education, a number of HEIs have organised two-day seminars in  cybersecurity supported by CFCS. The lectures and practical exercises included topics such as  74 Spain - National Plan for Digital Skills, https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/actions/national-initiatives/national- strategies/spain-national-plan-digital-skills  75 INCIBE-CERT, INCIBE reivindica el impulso de la mujer en ciberseguridad con el programa ‘Despega’ (March 2021),  https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/incibe-reivindica-el-impulso-mujer-ciberseguridad-el-programa-despega  76 https://www.women4cyberspain.es/  77 National Cybersecurity Strategy of the Czech Republic 2021-2025,  https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf  78 Centre for Cybersecurity, https://cfcs.dk/en/  https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/actions/national-initiatives/national-strategies/spain-national-plan-digital-skills https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/actions/national-initiatives/national-strategies/spain-national-plan-digital-skills https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/incibe-reivindica-el-impulso-mujer-ciberseguridad-el-programa-despega https://www.women4cyberspain.es/ https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf https://cfcs.dk/en/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  29  threat analysis, avoidance and mitigation (both at the technical and business level), as well as  data security management (authentication, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, etc.). Moreover,  summer schools have been launched focusing on cybersecurity and building cyber skills.  In August 2019, several HEIs conducted a Summer School in Cybersecurity supported by  CFCS79. The Summer School included classes on basic security and network principles,  software development and practices in IT operations (DevOps) and security, data carving in  forensics, and network security exercises. The Summer school was repeated in 202080.  GERMANY  In Germany, course offerings, in particular in computer science and IT security, will be  expanded by establishing additional university professorships and by supporting leading  institutions. Additionally, cooperation with private industry will be supported through, for  example, funds channelled by foundations and externally funded teaching and research posts.  HUNGARY  In Hungary, the development of cybersecurity skills is an integral part of the new Cybersecurity  Strategy that was adopted in 201881. It is now mandatory for Chief Information Security Officers  (CISOs) in the public service to attend two semesters of postgraduate cybersecurity training at  the National University of Public Service82. Moreover, a 10-week cybersecurity internship is  mandatory for those enrolled in master programmes at the National University of Public  Service83.  In Hungary, one can also find WITSEC (Women in IT Security), the association of women  working in the field of IT security, which was founded in 2014 and whose main aim is to provide  mentorship, development of IT skills and security skills among youngsters, especially girls84.  IRELAND  Ireland continues its efforts to address the skills gap in cybersecurity by implementing the  measures mentioned in its latest NCSS (2019-2024)85. The strategy recognises the need not  only to train new personnel but also to upskill professionals in ICT and other related sectors.  The strategy also notes that, in spite of last year’s efforts in addressing the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap, there exists a time lag between academia and industry. Thus, there is an  urgent need to create a pipeline of graduate students with the appropriate cybersecurity skills.  Additionally, another measure is to provide support to initiatives under the Technology Skills  2022 Initiative, including the development of Skillnet and ICT apprenticeship programmes.  The Skillnet86 agency is a supporting agency working in the area of workforce development with  the aim of increasing the competitiveness, productivity and innovation of Irish businesses. To  improve skills in the ICT sector, cybersecurity skills87 are also taken into account through the  organisation of training programmes. Furthermore, the Cyber Skills project, which received an  8.1 million euro investment, is aiming to provide pathways and micro-credentials in order to  tackle the cybersecurity skills shortage.  79 Centre for Cybersecurity, News, Summer School in Cybersecurity, https://cfcs.dk/da/nyheder/2019/sommerskole-i- cybersikkerhed/  80 Cybersecurity Summer School (2020) https://www.tilmeld.dk/cybersec20/conference  81 Hungarian Cybersecurity Strategy (2018) https://2015- 2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre- 20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse  82 Act on the Electronic Information Security of Central and Local Government Agencies (2013)  https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=a1300050.tv  83 National University of Public Service, https://en.uni-nke.hu/research/eotvos-jozsef-research-centre/institute-of-cyber- security  84 WITSEC, https://www.witsec.hu/en/content/about-us  85 Irish National Cybersecurity Strategy, https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf  86 Skillnet Ireland , https://www.skillnetireland.ie/  87 ICT Skillnet Ireland, Cybersecurity Skills, https://www.ictskillnet.ie/cyber-security-skills/  https://cfcs.dk/da/nyheder/2019/sommerskole-i-cybersikkerhed/ https://cfcs.dk/da/nyheder/2019/sommerskole-i-cybersikkerhed/ https://www.tilmeld.dk/cybersec20/conference https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=a1300050.tv https://en.uni-nke.hu/research/eotvos-jozsef-research-centre/institute-of-cyber-security https://en.uni-nke.hu/research/eotvos-jozsef-research-centre/institute-of-cyber-security https://www.witsec.hu/en/content/about-us https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.skillnetireland.ie/ https://www.ictskillnet.ie/cyber-security-skills/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  30  LATVIA  The latest Latvian NCSS (2019-2022)88 has ‘public awareness, education and research’ among  its main focuses. In particular, the strategy’s plan includes tasks such as:   Delivering advanced cybersecurity training for specific target groups, and   Upskilling digital competencies in the public sector and among government employees  as well as promoting good ICT safety practices.  Furthermore, a legal framework in the area of cybersecurity has been established, the ‘Law on  the Security of Information Technologies’89, which has important implications for cybersecurity  education also. In fact, the Cabinet Regulation No.442 on ‘Procedures for the Ensuring  Conformity of Information and Communication Technologies Systems to Minimum Security  Requirements’ (adopted July 28, 2015) serves as a guideline for educational institutions when  creating and adopting educational curricula90.  LITHUANIA  Lithuania’s NCSS (2018) identifies the need to study its own shortage problem in cybersecurity  skills firstly at national level. Furthermore, the strategy sets as an objective the development of  creativity, advanced capabilities and cybersecurity skills at a level of competence that is capable  of meeting market needs. Based on the strategy, this objective could be achieved by improving  cybersecurity competencies, developing training systems that are oriented towards market  needs that provide accreditation and certification, and are suitable training environments.  MALTA  In Malta, the ‘B SECURE’ scheme91, which was launched at the Malta Cybersecurity Summit in  2019, offers training courses for both executives and industry professionals. Moreover, CSIRT  Malta offers cybersecurity training to its constituents.  THE NETHERLANDS  In the Netherlands, the National Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA)92 recognises that the next  important step towards addressing the skills shortage problem is an analysis identifying gaps  between higher education curricula (the supply) and industry requirements (the demand) in the  creation of well-trained personnel.  SPAIN  The 2019 Spanish NCSS93 has the goal of promoting a ‘culture and commitment to  cybersecurity and empowerment of human and technological capabilities’. This goal points out  the need to acquire technical and human resources and adopt training in the appropriate skills  to use cyberspace more securely. To achieve this goal, it encourages the strengthening of the  cybersecurity industry and its ability to generate and retain talent. In particular, measures 5 to 8  of the strategy are associated with the identification of the skills needed by industry, the  promotion of training and the retention of cybersecurity talent.  88 Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia, Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022,  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022  89 Legal Acts Of The Republic Of Latvia (2010) Law on the Security of Information Technologies.  https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/220962  90 Republic of Latvia, Cabinet Regulation No. 442 (28 July 2015) Procedures for the Ensuring Conformity of Information and  Communication Technologies Systems to Minimum Security Requirements. http://ncsi.ega.ee/app/uploads/2017/04/Cab.- Reg.-No.-442-Ensuring-Conformity-of-Information.docx  91 B SECURE Scheme, https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/bsecure/  92 Dutch National Cybersecurity Agenda (2018) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf  93 Spanish National Security Council, (2019) National Cybersecurity Strategy, https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/about- us/spanish-cybersecurity-strategy-2013.html  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022 https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/220962 http://ncsi.ega.ee/app/uploads/2017/04/Cab.-Reg.-No.-442-Ensuring-Conformity-of-Information.docx http://ncsi.ega.ee/app/uploads/2017/04/Cab.-Reg.-No.-442-Ensuring-Conformity-of-Information.docx https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/bsecure/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/about-us/spanish-cybersecurity-strategy-2013.html https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/about-us/spanish-cybersecurity-strategy-2013.html  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  31  Besides university degrees in the field of cybersecurity, Spain also has vocational training  programmes. These have three levels (basic, intermediate and advanced), with the advanced  level being recognised as preparing students to the same level as a university master’s degree.  As a first step in the development of such specialised cybersecurity courses, two basic  courses94,95 will be delivered for the first time in the 2021-22 academic year. The Spanish  National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) was involved in the Working Group that developed the  syllabus for these courses and is collaborating with the Spanish Ministry of Education and  Vocational Training96 to train the professionals who will teach these courses in partnership with  the School of Industrial Organisation (EOI).  Moreover, INCIBE is working on the establishment of training paths with the intention to cover  the competencies needed for the cybersecurity profiles that are most in demand in the country.  3.4 ORGANISE CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES AND CHALLENGES  Other important initiatives are those that aim to test the skills of cybersecurity professionals and  the readiness of cybersecurity teams. Cybersecurity exercises are an increasingly popular  activity for assessing the efficiency, preparedness and ability of security teams and systems in  solving a security crisis. On the other hand, cybersecurity challenges complement exercises by  focusing on attracting the interest of young talent in ‘Capture-the-flag’ or other attack/defence  types of cybersecurity games.  At the EU level, ENISA is in charge of coordinating a pan-European series of exercises called  Cyber Europe97. This programme consists of EU-level cyber incident and crisis management  exercises for both the public and private sectors from the EU and EFTA Member States. The  exercises, which have been organised every two years since 2010, are simulations of large-  scale cybersecurity incidents that can escalate into cyber crises. In addition, the Cyber Exercise  Platform (CEP) managed by ENISA supports the management of complex exercises such as  virtual exercise ‘playgrounds’ with high-end technical challenges by bringing together experts of  the incident development community. In addition, ENISA offers training and research related to  cybersecurity exercises in the form of guidelines on exercise planning98, a global survey of  exercises99 and incidents research100, and has also contributed to the French National  Cybersecurity Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) guide on cyber  exercises101.  The EU also engages and supports cybersecurity exercises outside the EU. For instance, in  May 2021, EU CyberNet participated in the first national cyber exercise of the Dominican  Republic ‘Cyber llamas102. In the same month, a cybersecurity simulation exercise took place in  Kyiv (Ukraine) with state cybersecurity officials, organised by the EU4DigitalUA project.103  94 Course of Specialisation in Cybersecurity in Information Technology Environments, Royal Decree 479/2020,  https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rd/2020/04/07/479  95 Specialisation Course in Cybersecurity in Operational Technology Environments, Royal Decree 478/2020,  https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962  96 Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (2021), https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A- 2021-3904.pdf  97 ENISA, Cyber Europe Programme, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme  98 ENISA, Guidelines on exercise planning, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/cyber_exercises  99 ENISA, National and International Cybersecurity Exercises: Survey, Analysis & Recommendations,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/exercise-survey2012  100 ENISA, Incidents research, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/login?came_from=/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/research  101 ENISA, Organising A Cyber Crisis Management Exercise, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber- exercises/trainings/20210906_np_anssi_guide_exercice_crise_en_v4.pdf  102 EU Cybernet, EU CyberNet work in Dominican Republic, first national cybersecurity exercise ‘Cyber llamas’,  https://www.eucybernet.eu/news/  103 EU4Digital, EU helps Ukraine strengthen its cybersecurity, https://eufordigital.eu/eu-helps-ukraine-strengthen-its- cybersecurity/  https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rd/2020/04/07/479 https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962 https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/cyber_exercises https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/exercise-survey2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/login?came_from=/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/research https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/20210906_np_anssi_guide_exercice_crise_en_v4.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/20210906_np_anssi_guide_exercice_crise_en_v4.pdf https://www.eucybernet.eu/news/ https://eufordigital.eu/eu-helps-ukraine-strengthen-its-cybersecurity/ https://eufordigital.eu/eu-helps-ukraine-strengthen-its-cybersecurity/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  32  One of the most popular and well-received cybersecurity challenges for youth is the European  Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC). The ECSC initiative has sparked a number of national  initiatives worldwide that focus on identifying young cybersecurity talent and training them to  attend national cybersecurity skills challenges supported by national agencies. The popularity of  the ECSC has grown exponentially in recent years. The first edition of the ECSC took place in  Austria in 2014, where 30 participants from only three national teams attended. In the latest  iteration in 2021 hosted in Prague, 19 national teams and 169 contestants104 participated in a  two-day long skills challenge featuring tasks from various cybersecurity knowledge areas.  CYPRUS  In its latest NCSS (2020)105, Cyprus acknowledges the benefits of cyber crisis simulation  exercises. These can improve national capabilities in the field by testing the communication  systems for crisis management and enhancing the efficacy of incident handling. For this reason,  the strategy includes the planning and organisation of regular national cybersecurity exercises  based on realistic scenarios as well as active participation in Pan-European and other  international exercises.  CZECH REPUBLIC  In the Czech Republic, the NCSS sets, as an objective, the sharing of knowledge and expertise  which is acquired by the NÚKIB in cybersecurity exercises, training and other activities. As a  result, NÚKIB regularly organises technical and non-technical cybersecurity exercises106 for  various partners with the aim of strengthening their cybersecurity skills and resilience. In  addition, the agency supports cybersecurity competitions, such as the European Cybersecurity  Challenge (ECSC). To track such initiatives (such as cybersecurity courses, exercises, etc.) the  number of participating users is monitored.  IRELAND  In Ireland, the Discover Programme of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is funding the ‘Cyber  Academy’ project107, a summer bootcamp initiative for young people from 15-18 years old. The  initiative includes exploration of general and technical cybersecurity topics, career talks with  cybersecurity professionals and the National Cyber Schools Challenge (NCSC).  SPAIN  In Spain, since 2014 INCIBE has been organising CyberCamp108, an event which mainly aims  to identify career paths for students and to broaden technical knowledge, as well as to awaken  and promote talent in cybersecurity through technical competitions. Two competitions are  organised during the camp, one for individuals and the other team-based (CyberOlympics109).  The competition for individuals also has the purpose of selecting the Spanish team attending  ENISA’s annual ECSC. The team competition is aimed at secondary school and vocational  training students, and it is the first step before moving on to the competition for individuals. Thus  far, the design of the tests and challenges of these competitions have not been based on any  specific criteria or definition of competencies. However, the intention is to adapt them to the  competencies and profiles needed by the Spanish cybersecurity industry.  There are additional Spanish competitions developed by different organisations and entities that  seek to boost the interest of the younger generation in dedicating themselves professionally to  104 ENISA, European Cybersecurity Challenge 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/winner-of-the-european- cybersecurity-challenge  105 Cyprus NCSS, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security- strategies-interactive-map?selected=Cyprus  106 NÚKIB exercises https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/exercises/  107 Cyber Security Academy, https://cyberireland.ie/ireland-cyber-security-academy-cyber-crime/  108 CyberCamp, https://cybercamp.es/  109 CyberOlympics, https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/cyberolympics  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/winner-of-the-european-cybersecurity-challenge https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/winner-of-the-european-cybersecurity-challenge https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Cyprus https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Cyprus https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/exercises/ https://cyberireland.ie/ireland-cyber-security-academy-cyber-crime/ https://cybercamp.es/ https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/cyberolympics  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  33  cybersecurity. Some of these competitions were established nationally over the last year by  public bodies, such as:   National League of challenges in Cyberspace110 organised by the Spanish Civil Guard,  and   CyberWallChallenge111 organised by the Spanish National Police as part of its  CyberWallAcademy training action.  GREECE  The latest Greek NCSS (2020-2025)112 focuses on capacity building, including organising  national cybersecurity exercises in cooperation with national and European agencies. In this  regard, a series of flagship activities to develop preparedness and the operational skills of  participating organisations have been implemented in the form of responses to simulated  cybersecurity incidents (supervised by the National Cybersecurity Authority), made possible by  the development and use of cyber range platforms. Greece has also been participating in the  ECSC consistently since 2017.  SLOVENIA  In 2021, Slovenia participated in the ECSC for the first time in order to develop cybersecurity  skills among its youth and to nudge students into acquiring such skills. The plan is to continue to  regularly attend and participate in the ECSC in the future.  This concludes this section’s examination of the different approaches adopted by EU Member  States to mitigate the cybersecurity workforce skills shortage and gap.  110 National League of Challenges, https://www.nationalcyberleague.es/  111 CyberWallChallenge, https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-academy-es/  112 ENISA (2020) Greek National Cybersecurity Strategy 2020-2025 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber- security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Greece  https://www.nationalcyberleague.es/ https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-academy-es/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Greece https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Greece  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  34  4. SUMMARY AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This section provides recommendations and key insights based on the analyses presented in  this report.  Section 2 began this research and reported on the status of cybersecurity programmes at  higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the EU and EFTA countries. It focused on the supply of  cybersecurity qualifications and skills by analysing the characteristics of the 126 programmes in  ENISA’s CyberHEAD database. It also provided an assessment of the number of new students  studying cybersecurity as well as the number of graduates both at the level of the EU and of  individual Member States.  Section 3 examined the different approaches adopted by EU Member States to address the  cybersecurity workforce skills shortage and gap by analysing initiatives regarding cybersecurity  awareness, training, challenges and exercises.  In order to better understand the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap and plan a coherent  strategy to mitigate these problems, our analysis recommends an approach based on five key  features:   Increasing enrolments and eventually graduates in cybersecurity programmes  through:  o the diversification of the HEIs curricula in terms of content, levels and  language;  o the provision of scholarships, especially for underrepresented groups, and  more active efforts to promote cybersecurity as a diverse field.   Supporting a unified approach across government, industry and HEIs through:  o the adoption of a common framework regarding cybersecurity roles,  competencies, skills and knowledge such as, for example, the framework  provided by the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework;  o the promotion of cybersecurity skill-building challenges and competitions.   Increasing collaborations between Member States (MSs) in:  o launching European cybersecurity initiatives with shared objectives;  o sharing of the outputs of programmes (including results and lessons learnt).   Promoting analysis of the needs of the cybersecurity market and related trends  through:  o the identification of metrics showing the extent of the problem and possible  measures to cope with it.   Supporting the use and promotion of CyberHEAD (and its further evolution) in order  to:  o facilitate an ongoing understanding of the status of cybersecurity higher  education programmes in the EU;  o monitor trends regarding the number of cybersecurity graduates who could  potentially fill current vacancies in the sector;  o support the analysis of demographics (including the diversity) of new  cybersecurity students and graduates;  o assist in monitoring the effectiveness of cybersecurity initiatives targeting the  supply side (e.g. changes in enrolments in HEI programmes after the release  of new cybersecurity initiatives);  o demonstrate the value of CyberHEAD for HEIs as well as incentivise HEIs to  submit their programmes to CyberHEAD.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  35  In the next sections, we detail and outline the context for these recommendations. Here we note  that this report’s analysis and its recommendations focus on addressing the EU’s cybersecurity  skills shortage and gap through the higher education sector, and therefore vocational or lower  forms of education are not considered.  4.1 INCREASE ENROLMENT IN CYBERSECURITY PROGRAMMES  A wider selection and greater diversity of cybersecurity programmes in HEIs should be provided  to increase enrolments and eventually graduates who may than enter the cybersecurity  workforce. The lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals can only be addressed through an  increase in the pipeline of individuals with the appropriate skills to tackle emerging cybersecurity  threats. Therefore, the report recommends further analysis of the following:  The range of skills required needs to be reflected in the curricula in terms of content and  levels. For instance, in the CyberHEAD database it was found that there were surprisingly few  non-technical topics covered especially at the master and postgraduate levels. While technical  skills are clearly in high demand, knowledge and skills in social science (e.g. from  Organisational, Risk management, Business and Compliance disciplines, to Law, Ethics, Policy,  Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines) are increasingly important. These skills and other soft skills  (e.g. management, communication, etc.)113 are considered particularly crucial in the industry.  An increase in the topics covered by programmes would allow students to be able to choose  from courses that specialise in programmes which combine a technical curriculum with some  organisational and policy aspects, or a non-technical (e.g. business-oriented programme)  curriculum with fewer technical aspects. In both cases this could still help to address key gaps in  industry. As the topic diversity of programmes is expanded, this should also be represented in  the prerequisites to entry. That is, if a programme is concentrating on more technical topics, it  should require some level of a technical background (e.g. a bachelor’s degree in engineering or  computing or a professional certification), but if it is concentrating on Law, Ethics, Policy,  Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines, the requirements should be relaxed and replaced with more  suitable criteria.  The levels at which programmes are available can play a primary role in increasing enrolment  and subsequently graduates. Currently, bachelor programmes are only minimally represented in  the CyberHEAD dataset. While the dataset may not be entirely representative, it is widely  known that bachelors in cybersecurity are rarer than master programmes. Nonetheless,  increasing the number and variety of bachelors by including a noteworthy cybersecurity  component would be advantageous for multiple reasons.  Firstly, such programmes have much larger cohorts (the maximum yearly cohort size for  bachelor programmes in CyberHEAD is 117 on average while it is only 55 for master  programmes) and could therefore contribute significantly to increasing the talent pool. Secondly,  considering that cybersecurity is becoming a more established profession114,115,116,117,118,  students may wish to have an opportunity to select a cybersecurity-focused initial degree  instead of waiting to specialise at the graduate level.  The accessibility and openness of programmes should also be considered, with a focus  on language and delivery methods (i.e. online, classroom or blended). As found in this  report, online programmes are less available than on-site courses.

Launching more blended and online degree options may also  result in a rise in enrolment. Additionally, though language is contentious as there is no one  shared language in the EU, if courses were offered in multiple languages (or a few widely  spoken languages), student uptake could increase at both bachelor’s and master’s degree  levels.  More scholarships should be made available and more active efforts focused on diversity in  order to increase enrolments and the graduate pool of cybersecurity students, since, based on  CyberHEAD’s data, 71% of programmes charge students tuition fees. In particular, scholarships for  underrepresented groups (such as women, ethnic and other minorities) might be beneficial and could  potentially help recruitment. These would have to be advertised and targeted properly as research  has found that such groups (especially women) are often not aware of opportunities in the  cybersecurity field119. To add to this, women and minority groups from cyber roles (or those that are  recent cyber graduates) should be spotlighted to highlight this career or study pathway as an  opportunity for prospective students from underrepresented groups. Each of these actions might  assist in increasing enrolments, which could later result in graduates entering the EU security  workforce. Funding for these activities and for scholarships is an area where government and  industry can assist to ensure that university fees are not a significant inhibitor to the development of  national and regional cybersecurity workforces.  4.2 SUPPORT A UNIFIED APPROACH ACROSS GOVERNMENT,  INDUSTRY AND UNIVERSITIES  The skills shortage and gap can only be addressed through a joint effort among key  stakeholders. Thus, a more concerted effort between government, industry and HEIs is needed  to produce more cybersecurity graduates, particularly those with skills that can meet market  requirements. To this end, this report makes the following recommendations:  Support the development and adoption of a common language regarding cybersecurity  roles, competencies, skills and knowledge, for example the one provided by the  European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF). In this context, ENISA launched an Ad  Hoc Working Group on the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework in December 2020. A  multi-disciplinary group of experts was brought together with the aim of promoting  harmonisation of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development concepts and  tools. In July 2021, the Ad Hoc Working Group completed the first draft of the European  Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF), producing a user manual which will be released  imminently with the goal of making the implementation of the framework easier. The user  manual will use several examples to explain how the framework can be implemented in different  European organisations. The ECSF, if successful in achieving its objective, will be an invaluable  instrument for supporting the design of cybersecurity related training programmes in the area of  skills and career development; as well as supporting employment in cybersecurity120.  Support Cybersecurity Challenges. ENISA organises the European Cyber Security  Competition (ECSC)121 which – along with the national cybersecurity skill-building competitions  across Europe – provides excellent training and exposure for younger individuals interested in  the sector. Cybersecurity companies and public organisations also use these skill challenges to  identify, attract and recruit cybersecurity talent. Moreover, they are likely to increase interest in a  cybersecurity career and be effective in creating a network of young cybersecurity specialists122.  119 DCMS, 2019, Identifying the Role of Further and Higher Education in Cybersecurity Skills Development,  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767425/The_role_of_FE _and_HE_in_cyber_security_skills_development.pdf  120 ENISA, n.d., European Cybersecurity Skills Framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity- education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework  121 European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  122 Towards a Common ECSC roadmap https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-a-common-ecsc-roadmap  A more concerted  effort between  governments,  industry and HEIs  is needed to  produce more  appropriately  skilled  cybersecurity  graduates.  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767425/The_role_of_FE_and_HE_in_cyber_security_skills_development.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767425/The_role_of_FE_and_HE_in_cyber_security_skills_development.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-a-common-ecsc-roadmap  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  37  Academic institutions should encourage their students to participate – even if they are not  enrolled in traditional STEM curricula. Companies and organisations could suggest  cybersecurity challenges that are aligned with real-world events as well as create partnerships  with academia to, for example, facilitate internships or provide feedback for the curricula.  4.3 UNDERSTAND JOB MARKET NEEDS AND TRENDS  The EU and its Member States (MSs) should aim to develop and maintain a good  understanding of the needs of the cybersecurity market and related trends in order to tackle the  skills problem effectively. For this reason, this report recommends:  Conduct research and monitoring activities in the EU and in Member States to  continuously assess what cybersecurity skills the market needs and what cybersecurity  jobs it can offer. This insight should then be used to allow appropriate actions to be taken to  prepare the future workforce.  Metrics that highlight the actual problem may include but are not limited to:   the number of unfilled cybersecurity vacancies,   the average time to fill cybersecurity vacancies,   which skills, and in what percentage, are mostly needed in certain positions,   the number of cybersecurity professionals that do not possess the requisite skills or  possess these skills only partially,   the average training time to acquire new skills,   an estimation of the cybersecurity workforce size,   the percentage of unqualified candidates.  MSs could monitor such metrics not only for maintaining awareness of their national labour  markets but also as a way of assessing progress towards the implementation of their NCSSs.  4.4 COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES  A number of EU initiatives have attempted to tackle the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap.  Similarly, Member States (MS) have also launched their own actions and included them as  objectives in their NCSSs. Even when focused on the skills problem at the level of the MSs, the  nature of the EU means that national programmes are likely to have an influence beyond their  geographic boundaries and extend their benefits to other MSs, helping to tackle the matter at  the EU level. In a similar vein, synergies among MSs and EU institutions, which might be  facilitated through EU common funding, should be strengthened. For this reason, this report  recommends:  Facilitating new joint initiatives to address the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap.  Since many MSs share similar issues when it comes to the shortage of cybersecurity skills,  launching common initiatives could prove an advantageous solution to pull resources together.  These collaborations may involve:   developing cybersecurity related material grounded in practice and research,   releasing joint campaigns in raising awareness,   expanding on previously launched initiatives to include other MSs.  Exchanging outputs of initiatives with other MSs with the support of European bodies. By  sharing the results of initiatives with other Member States in terms of metrics (e.g. participation,  people reached), in deliverables (e.g. curricula, e-learnings) and lessons learnt (e.g. activities  that worked or failed), the EU can work more efficiently towards closing the gap. Furthermore,  this will promote the re-use of already developed material (either sourced from MSs or EU  institutions), eventually saving resources.  Develop synergies  among Member  States’  cybersecurity  initiatives with the  support of  European bodies  and EU funded  projects.  MARKET  NEEDS AND  TRENDS  The EU and Member  States should have a  good understanding  of the needs of the  cybersecurity market  and related trends in  order to tackle the  problem efficiently.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  38  4.5 CYBERHEAD’S VALUE FOR STUDENTS, HIGHER EDUCATION  INSTITUTIONS AND MEMBER STATES  The supply of cybersecurity skills should also be regularly analysed in order to  understand how cybersecurity-related programmes and training responds to market  needs. This would also allow better planning towards what other initiatives should be put in  place to alleviate the scarcity of graduates. CyberHEAD provides some of the most important  metrics in order to understand the development of skills in MSs.  CyberHEAD provides a unique database of cybersecurity courses in the EU and EFTA  countries. Prospective students interested in studying cybersecurity can use the  database to quickly search for programmes according to a variety of requirements. For  instance, they can search by location, programme type (master, bachelor, etc.), programme  language, delivery method (online, classroom or blended) and fees. Two particularly important  data points available to students in CyberHEAD are whether programmes offer internships and  their core curriculum. Internships are crucial for gaining practical experience, while knowing the  ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) credits allows students to find programmes suited to  their interests and needs.  European HEIs can gain further exposure by including their degrees in CyberHEAD.  Currently there are 126 programmes scattered around 25 European countries. While this is a  good number given the young age of CyberHEAD, there is a strong need for more programmes,  especially from countries that have low representation in CyberHEAD. To enable this, more  should be done to incentivise EU HEIs to enter their programmes into the database. As one  individual (e.g. a professor or an administrator within HEIs) may not be able to answer all  questions, EU MSs should consider whether there are any resources or incentives that could be  offered to support HEIs in the first rounds of data collection.  EU Member States can also directly benefit from CyberHEAD, for example when they can  access relevant information to assess the status of their national cybersecurity  programmes and can themselves conduct many of the analyses presented in this report  (e.g. on gender balance, predicted numbers of future graduates entering the workforce).  These analyses can be performed over time to track changes in programme offerings and the  extent to which national cybersecurity jobs are being filled. This may also allow countries to  measure the impact of their national or local initiatives and may even be used to inform national  policy.  This report therefore recommends that CyberHEAD’s benefits (exemplified above) should  be further emphasised and promoted across the EU, and supported by MSs, who will  also ultimately benefit from the database.  Additional data gathering in CyberHEAD should be investigated as it will allow a deeper insight  into skills programmes in the EU as well as provide a platform through which the EU (and MSs)  can compare and contrast data with other regions and countries. However, as mentioned  above, additional data gathering could increase the workload for HEIs and for those validating  them. A cost-benefit analysis taking into account the wider benefits of CyberHEAD to the EU  should be conducted before including these extra questions to ensure they are not too time  consuming. A list of additional data-gathering questions and the reasoning why they should be  included is provided in Annex B.  The value and use  of CyberHEAD for  students, HEIs  and Member  States should be  further  emphasised and  promoted across  the EU.

ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  40  B ANNEX:  EXPANDING THE CYBERHEAD  QUESTION SET  This annex reports on an investigation that was conducted to identify questions that may be  considered for addition to the CyberHEAD question set. Such questions would be targeted at  allowing CyberHEAD to better achieve its goals (see Section 2). More specifically, a larger  number of questions also has the benefit of supplying more useful information for students  when they are choosing a programme as well as supplying the EU with a more structured and  comparable information across Europe on the academic programmes.  Firstly, an analysis on the information currently published and shared by HEI degree  programmes across Europe was conducted. This approach is based on the argument that  degree programmes – particularly programme websites – have been developed over many  years specifically to accommodate the information students desire when researching degrees.  By comparing and contrasting information provided on a large number of programme websites,  it would therefore be possible to identify a series of key information items which may be  recommended for inclusion in the CyberHEAD database questionnaire posed to HEIs.  Following the approach outlined above, a total of 100 European degree programme websites  were gathered and assessed. These were gathered from countries that include the UK, Italy,  France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Lithuania  and the Czech Republic123. The UK featured most prominently in the sample, with 72 degrees.  This high representation was intentional and sought to acknowledge the advanced state of  cybersecurity degree courses in the UK, as well as the reality that the UK is often seen as a  primary destination for international students to pursue higher education124,125. EU programmes  were gathered from the CyberHEAD database and online searches, while UK programmes were  all gathered using online searches.  From an analysis of the degree programmes, a set of information commonly included was  identified. Attention was also paid to information that may assist in achieving another aim of the  CyberHEAD database, i.e. data that could allow for monitoring of the cyber skills shortage and  gap in the EU. This information, in question form, is presented below. Questions that are  already present in the CyberHEAD database are excluded. Furthermore, questions are  presented in three tiers according to their perceived usefulness based on the opinions of the  report’s authors. These questions provide input to recommendations (which are mentioned in  Section 4).  Tier 1 – High priority  1. Is the programme full-time, part-time, or both?  2. Are there scholarships or financial support options available?  3. What types of jobs will the programme allow students to attain afterwards?  123 UK courses were found through a web search for ‘cybersecurity degrees’ and ‘information security degrees’, and the  degrees from the other European countries were identified from a sample of those currently in the CyberHEAD database.  124 HESA, 2020, Higher Education Student Statistics: UK, 2018/19 - Where students come from and go to study.  https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/16-01-2020/sb255-higher-education-student-statistics/location  125 UK Department for Education, 2019, UK revenue from education related exports and TNE activity.  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-revenue-from-education-related-exports-and-tne-activity  https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/16-01-2020/sb255-higher-education-student-statistics/location https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-revenue-from-education-related-exports-and-tne-activity  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  41  4. Does the programme partner with any security industry organisations, consortiums or  academies?  5. To what extent are organisations or individuals from the security industry involved in  programme development?  6. What is the breakdown of the programme teaching format, in terms of lectures,  seminars/tutorials and practical exercises?  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1. Does the programme have dedicated cybersecurity facilities and labs?  2. Does the programme have any industry certifications built into it?  3. To what extent is cybersecurity-specific employability support available to students?  4. Is the programme accredited by a professional computing/IT/engineering body or  association?  Tier 3 – Low priority  1. What is the length of the programme?  2. What are the entry requirements of the programme?  3. What is the deadline for applications to the programme?  4. Are there any additional programme costs to students in addition to tuition fees?  5. What percentage of students find employment within 6 months of the programme  completing?  The second purpose of the CyberHEAD database is to allow cybersecurity skills across the EU  to be investigated, and in particular the supply-side of skills programmes. This can be divided  into two areas: the skills being provided in current programmes, and the types of individuals  being trained by the programmes. To identify a suitable set of additional information that may be  gathered from an updated database, examining existing research (such as international and  governmental reports126,127) into the gaps in cybersecurity skills is crucial. Such an analysis  would provide insights into the types of topics under deliberation across the world, and the  areas where gaps in skills and training are most prevalent. This information can provide input to  metrics for the state of the offerings of courses on security skills in Europe.  Based on the approach taken, a selection of areas of importance was defined. Focusing first on  the security skills provided in current programmes: there are numerous types of information that  may be recommended for addition to the CyberHEAD database which would be key to  understanding the state of the security programmes of European HEIs. These are phrased  below, as questions, similar to the format earlier in this report. A reference is added to questions  to identify where the notion originated.  Tier 1 – High priority  1. To what extent are non-technical (or ‘soft’) skills such as communication, leadership  and management, a part of the skills taught or practiced in the programme?128  126 ESG and ISSA, 2020, The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020. https://www.issa.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf  127 (ICS)2, 2019, 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  128 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  42  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1.

To what extent do students practice applying and implementing technical skills in a  business context?135  Tier 3 – Low priority  1. Does the programme or do students on the programme participate in capture-the-flag  competitions?136  The second area concentrates on the types of individuals being trained in programmes. This is  important to consider, given issues of workforce diversity, particularly in the technology field.  The following questions are recommended based on the analysis conducted.  Tier 1 – High priority  1. How many (or what percentage of) ethnic-minority students are present in the  programme each (or last) year?137  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1. How many (or what percentage of) students each (or last) year are sponsored (or paid  for) by their employers?138  2. For postgraduate programmes, what percentage of students each (or last) year had  backgrounds in non-IT/engineering subjects?139  Tier 3 – Low priority  1. What is the average age of students on the programme?140  To further inform the CyberHEAD database, this report conducted a high-level analysis of the  online policy documents focusing on how countries have attempted to address the shortages  129 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  130 (ICS)2, 2019, 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  131 ESG and ISSA, 2020, The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020. https://www.issa.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf  132 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  133 McAfee, 2020, Hacking the Skills Shortage. https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills- shortage.pdf  134 Kaspersky, 2016, The cybersecurity skills gap: a ticking time bomb. https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky- Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf  135 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  136 McAfee, 2020, Hacking the Skills Shortage. https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills- shortage.pdf  137 NCSC, 2020, Decrypting diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cybersecurity. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and- inclusion-in-cyber-security-report  138 (ICS)2, 2019, 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  139 Ibid  140 Ibid  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills-shortage.pdf https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills-shortage.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  43  and gaps in skills. From that analysis, the following questions are recommended for addition to  the CyberHEAD database. Similar to above, the questions are presented in three tiers  according to perceived usefulness from the perspective of the report’s authors.  Tier 1 – High priority  1. Are there any programme review processes or outcome-oriented metrics or surveys in  place to refine cybersecurity programmes?  2. Is sufficient budget available for the provision of cybersecurity courses and  cybersecurity educators?  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1. Do you follow any national or international cybersecurity frameworks when designing  cybersecurity courses?141  2.

Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to initiatives in  cybersecurity skills such as: vocational studies in cybersecurity, public-private  partnerships in cybersecurity skills, women in cybersecurity, internships in cyber,  national competitions, or any educational activities in cyber?  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so, how?  CYPRUS  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  At present, cybersecurity skills and education are promoted by the Digital Security Authority  (NIS Competent Authority, which includes the national CSIRT-CY), the Ministry of Education, a  number of local public and private universities, and through further initiatives (see response to  Q2 below).  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The current version of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (https://dsa.cy/wp-  content/uploads/csrc-2020.pdf), discusses cybersecurity skills, education and training initiatives  in section 3.10 (Action 15) of the document (only available in Greek at present). Additionally,  through the support of the DSA (among others), the Cyprus Computer Society annually  organises the national cybersecurity challenge, which feeds into the European Cybersecurity  Challenge every year.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Not at present, although we are examining ways in which such impacts can be measured.  CZECH REPUBLIC  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) – the agency has:   a department focusing on education - specifically focusing on education and outreach  in the area of cyber security and skills development   a cyber exercise unit - focusing on coordination and preparation of a wide range of  technical and non-technical cybersecurity exercises on the national and international  level (Cyber Czech, Cyber Coalition, Locked Shields, CMX); it also creates tailored  mobile cybersecurity for partners; and contributes to educational awareness activities  https://dsa.cy/wp-content/uploads/csrc-2020.pdf https://dsa.cy/wp-content/uploads/csrc-2020.pdf  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  45   as well as a national cybersecurity strategy (NCSS) that will be further presented at  question 2.  Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports  Educational institutions   there are 6 public universities offering programs in the field cybersecurity or similar  producing approx. 1000 – 1500 graduates yearly, which is not enough to cover the  needs of these professionals in the Czech Republic, and hundreds of cybersecurity  professionals are lacking   the universities also offer Postgraduate, Doctoral Studies or research initiatives,  such as:   Laboratory for AI and cybersecurity (Czech Technical University in Prague +  private company Avast)   Cybersecurity Hub (a project founded by 3 public universities)   Research team Advanced Cybersecurity at the University of Technology in  Brno   National Competence Centre for cybersecurity (PPP – universities, private  companies, public sector)  Non-governmental organisations (e.g. AFCEA) – among others organises the European  Cybersecurity Challenge  Others, such as:   CZ.NIC - an interest association of legal entities; one of their aims is also public  education is specific areas of cybersecurity   Digikoalice – an open fellowship of representatives of state institutions, IT companies,  ICT sector, educational institutions, academic assemblies, non-profit organisations,  statutory authorities of schools, educational institutions and other entities that wish to  contribute to the better digital literacy of citizens of the Czech Republic  Private institutions (CEVRO institute – MBA program)  IT Companies (e.g. CISCO Networking Academy)  Private companies   PwC and Cyber Arena   CyberG  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB)  The main legislative document in the field of cybersecurity, Cybersecurity Act, defines  prevention, education and systematic support in the field of cybersecurity as one of the  competences of NCISA.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  46  National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) dedicated a whole section to Education and  Awareness (section Resilient Society 4.0) stressing the need to develop cybersecurity skills  and educate population (especially the at-risk groups). In the upcoming Action plan, that is  traditionally complementing the NCSS, there are three areas of focus: 1. Quality education  system, 2. Outreach and education and 3. Vocational education and expanding the qualified  base which together specify 23 tasks that have a positive impact on cybersecurity skills  development. These tasks are concerned with defining and implementation of standards of  cybersecurity skills into general and vocational education, training, conferences, workshops and  other activities together with high schools, colleges, and universities.  Additionally, NCSS aims at sharing knowledge and expertise that NÚKIB acquires through  cybersecurity exercises, training and other activities. Not only that, NÚKIB also regularly  organises technical and non-technical cybersecurity exercises for various partners with the aim  of strengthening their cybersecurity skills and resilience.  Among others, NÚKIB also generates and offers and support materials to teachers and at-  risk groups (children and elderly), as well as offers support to the analysis of needs at the job  market in the area of cybersecurity, or supports cybersecurity competitions, such as the  European Cybersecurity Challenge — ECSC – this year, the competition is hosted in Prague.  NÚKIB is also open to university students in the form of internships in various areas in  cybersecurity. Moreover, NÚKIB organises an annual conference called “CyberCon”, which is  open for public and among others also focuses on students, outreach and education and tries to  present various topics of cybersecurity. Various public panel discussions and workshops  focused on topics of cybersecurity are organised by NÚKIB (often focusing on children, elderly,  parents, teachers). NÚKIB also prepared and made public cybersecurity courses for the general  public. Other than that, courses for public officers exist and are used by various national  institutions for personnel training.  Other legislation and strategy:  Generally, we monitor that the educational plans at the level from primary schools to high  schools miss generally digital and ICT skills, let alone cybersecurity skills. The revision of the  educational plans is underway and NÚKIB is trying to make sure that relevant cybersecurity  skills are implemented at these levels of education as well.  We also monitor various digital strategies at the national level that often include topics such as  digital literacy, digital skills, ICT skills, etc., however, cybersecurity skills as such are either  included only slightly, if at all.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  NCSS – the action plan and its progress is evaluated (mostly qualitatively) every year.  Cybersecurity courses, exercises and other activities – are evaluated based on attendance/the  number of users going through these courses and events.  DENMARK  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Several national actors are active in developing cybersecurity skills within Denmark, including:  the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Agency for Digitisation, the Ministry of Education, primary and  secondary schools, as well as universities. The Danish Business Authority also supports  increasing cyber skills in SMEs.  https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  47  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The National Cyber and Information Security Strategy from 2018 has a number of initiatives to  strengthen cyber competencies and skills, see page 27-33 in the national strategy:  https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf  <https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf>  Moreover, awareness campaigns and educational materials at the Government information  portal, Sikkerdigital.dk are all part of strengthening competencies in the field of cyber- and  information security in the public and private spheres https://sikkerdigital.dk/.  The public SME program SMV:Digital provides grants to SMEs for the procurement of private  consultations to help the SMEs complete their digital transformation, including grants for help  with digital security.  In January 2020, the Danish Industry Foundation launched a Danish Hub for Cybersecurity in  collaboration with Denmark’s technical University, DTU. The purpose of the hub is to bolster  innovation and development within the area of cybersecurity and to strengthen competencies in  cybersecurity among primarily SME’s, start-ups and suppliers.  https://www.cyberhub.dk/  In relation to education, the Danish government has developed and supported a number of  educational programmes and academic curricula in cybersecurity in primary and secondary  education. The Ministry of Education has established a learning portal with educational material  on digital education, cybersecurity and digital judgement, and a broader technological  comprehension educational program including cyber and information security is being tested in  the Danish primary school.  The Ministry of Education has also developed a large amount of educational materials focusing  on helping educators teach data protection and information security.  In regards to higher education, Denmark has both courses and summer schools, as well as  Bachelor and Master programmes, which focus on cybersecurity and building cyber skills.  The Danish government has developed and supported a number of educational programmes  and academic curricula in cybersecurity in higher education.  In order to have sufficiently skilled personnel to detect and handle cyber attacks on Denmark, in  particular with regard to critical infrastructure, the Centre for Cybersecurity has developed and  executed its own intensive Cyber Academy. The Cyber Academy had 15 graduates in 2019.  In August 2019, a number of higher education institutions carried out a Summer School in  Cybersecurity supported by Centre for Cybersecurity. The Summer School included classes on  amongst others basic security and network principles, DevOps and security, data carving in  forensics, and network security exercises. The Summer school was repeated in 2020.  Cyber Days (supported by Centre for Cybersecurity)  A number of higher education institutions have carried out a two days seminar in Cybersecurity  (Cyber Days) supported by Centre for Cybersecurity. The lectures and practical exercises  included topics such as threat analysis, avoidance, and mitigation (both at the technical and  https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf https://sikkerdigital.dk/ https://www.cyberhub.dk/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  48  business level), as well as data security management (authenticity, confidentiality, integrity,  privacy, etc.).  University educations/training:  IT University of Copenhagen  The IT University of Copenhagen offers 4 Bachelor (BSc.) programs and 5 Master (MSc.)  programs that include different levels of cybersecurity courses in their curriculum.  The University has established Center for Information Security and Trust, a multidisciplinary  research centre that aims to create an academic and practical foundation for raising the level of  IT security in Denmark so that it matches current and future cyber threats.  Master in Cybersecurity (Aalborg University)  Aalborg University’s M.Sc. programme in Cybersecurity is an engineering programme targeted  at B.Sc. graduates interested in privacy, network and software. The Cybersecurity educational  programme equips the student with the skills to handle challenges in the increasing number of  cyber-attacks, which companies and institutions are facing.  Centre for Cybersecurity has participated in developing some of the learning modules together  with Aalborg University.  Bachelor in Cyber Technology (DTU)  Technical University of Denmark offers an engineering Bachelor in Cyber Technology that  focuses on programming and software development competences including cybersecurity.  Master in IT Security (IT-Vest)  Aarhus University, University of Southern Denmark and Aalborg University (IT-Vest) offers a  single course Master in IT Security.

Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Not presently, but we are investigating ways to measure the impact of the initiatives.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  49  GERMANY  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?   In Germany, the national stakeholder landscape regarding cybersecurity skills is highly  diverse including stakeholders from various backgrounds including private and public  sector, civil society, associations and others.   It is important to note that in Germany school and university education are mainly in  the remit of the “Länder” (\"cultural sovereignty\"), while the Federal Government also  plays a significant role (e.g. Higher Education Pact, award of scholarships, Alliance for  Education). Shared responsibility between “Länder” and Federal Government is  particularly important in the fields of non-school vocational training, training assistance  and continuing education.   A key strategic actor for cybersecurity skills is the National Cybersecurity Council,  established with the 2011 Cybersecurity Strategy and serving the Federal Government  as a strategic adviser for the ongoing and evolving strategy process on cybersecurity  issues in Germany. The National Cybersecurity Council brings together high-level  representatives from the federal and state levels, as well as the private sector, thereby  offering a suitable format to advance the strategic cybersecurity issues most important  for Germany. The National Cybersecurity Council will increasingly draw on expertise  from society, private industry and the research community. Invited experts speaking on  individual strategic topics will provide background for discussion and for drawing up  recommendations for action.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?   Link to German national cybersecurity strategy 2016:  https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/it-und-digitalpolitik/it-und-cybersicherheit/cyber-  sicherheitsstrategie/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie-node.html  All following page references refer to English translation in attachment142.   The German national cybersecurity strategy 2016 highlights several action areas with  relevance for cybersecurity skills, in particular:   Action area 1: Remaining safe and autonomous in a digital environment,  strategic objective “Promoting digital literacy among all users” (p. 10)   Action area 3: Strong and sustainable cybersecurity architecture for every  level of government, strategic objective “Using resources, recruiting and  developing staff” (p. 27f)   Action area 4: Germany’s active role in European and international  cybersecurity policy, strategic objective “Bilateral and regional support and  cooperation for cyber capacity building” (p. 31f)   Ongoing strategy development in the National Cybersecurity Council (p. 33f)   Not only the German national cybersecurity strategy references the importance of  cybersecurity skills. Other strategies of the German Federal Government also  incorporate objectives regarding digital skills with related funding, e.g. digital strategy  of the German Federal Government (“Digitalstrategie der Bundesregierung”) or the  German “High-Tech Strategy 2025” (https://www.bmbf.de/en/high-tech-strategy-  2025.html).  142 The document de_ncss_2016_en.pdf was attached and is available if needed.  https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/it-und-digitalpolitik/it-und-cybersicherheit/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie-node.html https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/it-und-digitalpolitik/it-und-cybersicherheit/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie-node.html https://www.bmbf.de/en/high-tech-strategy-2025.html https://www.bmbf.de/en/high-tech-strategy-2025.html  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  50  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?   The German national cybersecurity strategy 2016 is currently under evaluation.  Other remarks:   The entire IT-sector in Germany is facing the challenge of a lack of IT-professionals.  This leads to rising wages all over the country and a competition between  employers as well as public sector and industry.   As an example: BSI as employer competes with the private sector by underlining its  special mission for government, business, and society as the federal cybersecurity  authority. In particular, aim and purpose of our work are to convince IT-professionals to  work with BSI. To do so, BSI’s HR department conducts various media campaigns to  spread its message and to provide insights into the work and profiles of different  employees. BSI offers furthermore various opportunities for students, e.g. to apply for a  scholarship, to do an internship, or the mentoring for their thesis.   BSI Human Resource Development uses a range of instruments to attract potential  candidates as well as to select and develop the skills of employees, e.g.:  i. Onboarding procedure  ii. Leadership Development Program  iii. Assessment Center for leadership positions  iv. Internships in different divisions of BSI and cooperation with other national  agencies  v. Networking initiatives: BSI also supports national and international networks, e.g.  Global Digital Women.  GREECE  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  National activities regarding skills strengthening on cybersecurity are spread across various  competent public institutions. The relevant activities target education, vocational training and  awareness raising. The National Cybersecurity Authority is actively monitoring the participation  of the various actors in cybersecurity capacity building.  A substantial number of Universities (Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs) have  developed courses on cybersecurity, while several of them participate in research activities and  programmes related to security of networks and information. The Training Institute of the  National Centre of Public Administration & Local Government (Ministry of Labour and Social  Affairs) has developed and conducting life-long training courses on cybersecurity, addressing  the skills gap of the public sector. Furthermore, the Hellenic Centre for Safer Internet, under the  auspices of the Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH), and the Cyber  Crime Unit of the Hellenic Police are running campaigns dedicated to awareness raising of  citizens, employees and teachers. Lastly, the National Cybersecurity Authority (Ministry of  Digital Governance) is currently shaping a strategic plan to identify and tackle gaps, as well as  to support existing activities.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The National Cybersecurity Strategy 2020-2025 gives special emphasis to capacity building,  inter alia through the development of cybersecurity skills into a dedicated Strategic Objective:  “5. Capacity building, promoting information and awareness raising”. In particular:   Under Specific Objective “5.A.

Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  The National Cybersecurity Authority is actively monitoring the national initiatives regarding  cybersecurity skills. The foreseen “Education and Awareness Action Plan” is anticipated to  include mechanisms for assessing the outcomes of activities in building cybersecurity skills.  HUNGARY  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Cybersecurity skill development is currently focused around the higher education. On BA level,  there are various specialties around information security, e.g. at University of Óbuda and  Budapest University of Technology and Economics and Corvinus University of Budapest. A  cybersecurity engineer BSc program is currently under accreditation at the University of Óbuda.  On Master level, University of Public Service has an MA on cybersecurity and Eötvös Lóránd  University has an MSc on cybersecurity. Some Postgraduate trainings are also available at the  University of Public Service and University of Óbuda. Additional short term courses between 3-5  days are also available on several universities and on the market.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  Vocational studies: it is mandatory for the CISOs in the public service to attend a 2 semesters  long Postgraduate training at the University of Public Service according to the Act L. of 2013 on  the electronic information security of state and municipal organisation.  PPP in cybersecurity skills: cybersecurity skills development is an integral part of the national  NIS strategy (Governmental Decree 1838/2018 (XII. 28.) on the network and information system  security strategy of Hungary)  Women in Cybersecurity: there is no national strategy or legislation in this topic.  Internship in cyber: 10 weeks internship is mandatory on the cybersecurity MA program of the  University of Public Service due to the relevant law on higher education.  National competitions: The Hungarian Cybersecurity Challenge is organised since 2018 as a  national competition, as it is written in the national NIS strategy.  In general, skills development is emphasised in the national NIS strategy.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Yes, the national NIS strategy’s action plan between 2020-22 has a non-public version that  contains KPIs for the above mentioned tasks.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  52  IRELAND  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Please refer to the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019-2024 for a contextual overview of  initiatives on skills. Measures 12 and 13 are particularly relevant.  Many of the initiatives are ‘bottom up’ rather than ‘top down’ with a large number of actors  involved. We are not a ‘command and control’ society so in practise many of the initiatives,  including government funding are not explicitly linked to legislation.  Updates on skills initiatives are delivered to quarterly meetings of the Inter-Departmental  Committee overseeing implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  These initiatives should be linked to the national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation.  The NCSC itself with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is directly  involved in curriculum development for a short course in cybersecurity for 12/13 to 15/16 year  olds in second level schools. This involves a pilot implementation with schools, teachers and  other education stakeholders.  Skillnet Ireland is tasked with upskilling and delivering conversion courses, including in the field  of cybersecurity. Last year it ran quarterly capture the flags, and webinar events on key aspects  of cybersecurity.  ‘Cyber Women Ireland’ is about promotion of female participation in cybersecurity.  The national industry cluster “Cyber Ireland” has received support from Government, notably the  State agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in its setup.  The ‘Cyber Skills’ project I an € 8.1m investment in third level institutions in Ireland in  collaboration with Northern Ireland and Virginia Tech in the US, who have a cyber range facility  to assist with improving the suitability of education courses for industry.  Science Foundation Ireland’s discover programme is funding ‘Cyber Academy’ a Summer  bootcamp initiative for 15 to 18 year olds that includes career talks, schools cyber challenge and  cyber tech skills.  From CyberIRELAND  From the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019-2024 see measure 12 & 13 that relate to skills -  https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf  The initiatives listed in the report are not directly funded under the national strategy, but those  funded by the government all relate to national skills policies / strategies.  From my knowledge, the government supported initiatives include:   New cybersecurity courses funded under the Human Capital Initiative & Springboard   Cyber Skills Project funded under Human Capital Initiative   Cybersecurity Skills Initiative (CSI) - Technology Ireland ICT SKillnet   FIT Cybersecurity Apprenticeship   FutureInTech <https://www.futureintech.ie/pathways/cybersecurity-analyst/> has a  Cybersecurity Analyst Course  This programme is aimed at those who are unemployed and came about as a result of the large  numbers of individuals in different sectors (retail, hospitality etc.) who were displaced by Covid.  https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.futureintech.ie/pathways/cybersecurity-analyst/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  53  LATVIA  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  There are national and also international actors, mostly academia, involved in development of  cybersecurity skills.  The Ministry of Education and Science has the most important role in the field of education at  the national level. The ministry enhances public knowledge and awareness about scientific,  technological, engineering and mathematical developments that form the knowledge base on  cyberspace at all levels of education. It also contributes to higher research capacity of  universities through national and European Union Structural Funds (European Regional  Development Fund, European Social Fund) investments into development and boosting of  research infrastructure, including human capital.  Education in information technologies (IT) field starts in primary schools and continues in  secondary schools and universities. National defence lessons, where cyber is one of the topics,  will be mandatory subject at secondary schools starting September, 2024. The cybersecurity  topics are also included in the curriculum of the Cadet Force.  Cybersecurity related professional education is also provided by professional secondary  education institutions, for example, the Saldus Technical School. After secondary or  professional secondary education, interested ones can continue their studies and join Bachelor  degree studies or choose the first level higher professional study programmes, for example, the  Riga Technical College.  Public and private higher education institutions provide Bachelor Degree programmes in IT.  Also, several higher educational institutions are providing professional Master Degrees in cyber  field, for example, the Riga Technical University, the University of Latvia, the Vidzeme  University of Applied Sciences and the BA School of Business and Economics.  The Information Technology Security Incident Response Institution of the Republic of Latvia  (CERT.LV) organises national technical exercises for state and local government IT security  specialists, as well as annual cybersecurity conference and workshops twice a year. CERT.LV  also provides several types of IT security awareness programmes for wide audience starting  from teachers to IT security professionals. In 2019-2020 CERT.LV in the framework of  Connecting Europe Facility project organised campaign “Cybersecurity at your workplace”. All  those activities are aimed to rise overall level of cyber awareness. Since 2006 the Latvian Safe  Internet Centre “Net-Safe Latvia” is a body engaged in public awareness rising about internet  safety issues and child safety online.  National Armed Forces are rising cyber expertise by participating in national and international  exercises. The Baltic Defence College, which is a multinational military college established by  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1999, has included cyber elements into Joint Command and  General Staff Course and the course “Cyber Defence Policy on National and International  Levels”. The last is organised in cooperation with the European Security and Defence College.  Latvia is also sponsoring nation of the NATO Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence, which  organises technical, legal, operational level and strategic level training.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  54  Latvia has a cybersecurity strategy since 2014. The Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2014-2018  was adopted in 2014, but the Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022 - in 2019. The latest  outlines 5 key areas of action, where public awareness, education and research is defined as a  separate area of action:   Promotion of cybersecurity, reduction of digital security risks,   Strengthening the resilience of information and communication technologies, the  provision of critical information and communication technologies and services to the  public,   Public awareness, education and research,   International cooperation   The rule of law in cyberspace and the reduction of cybercrime.  Every area of action includes an action plan with specific tasks given to ministries and other  involved parties. The Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022 states that “all stakeholders  are equally important for securing networks and information systems, and that means everyone  should be equally aware of risks they are exposed to when online and actions that may prevent  such exposure”. The action plan for the area “Public awareness, education and research”  includes tasks, for example:   raise awareness of students and teachers about information security, protection of  privacy and reliable online services, or   improve public awareness about online safety (age-group-specific information and  instructional materials with guidelines on online safety, social media campaign  security) and deliver advanced cybersecurity training for specific target groups.  Develop and implement annual multi-agency action and campaign plan with  cybersecurity information events and awareness raising campaigns.  Therefore, the strategy defines awareness, education and research as one of five areas of  action and it has direct impact on cybersecurity initiatives, but nevertheless it does not  specifically name all of them.  Latvia has established a legal framework in the area of cybersecurity – the Law on the Security  of Information Technologies and the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations pursuant to it. The link  between legal framework and cybersecurity initiatives might be not so evident, but is not less  important. For example, the Cabinet Regulation of July 28, 2015 No.442 “Procedures for the  Ensuring Conformity of Information and Communication Technologies Systems to Minimum  Security Requirements” serves as guideline for educational institutions when creating and  adopting curriculum.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Impact of the initiatives are usually monitored by the ones who are conducting them. For  example, CERT.LV has conducted assessments of IT security awareness by distributing  questionnaires to participants at CERT.LV events. Education activities on other hand can be  measured by number of applicants and graduates.  Regarding national cybersecurity strategy reviews, a mid-term progress review of the  Cybersecurity strategy of Latvia 2014-2018 was conducted in 2016 and the final progress  review was completed in 2019. The final review identified that majority of tasks have been  implemented or are in execution stage. The review also identified three challenges that had  effect to fully achieve the individual tasks: cybersecurity issues are not always a priority, a lack  of personnel and a lack of funding. A progress review of the Cybersecurity Strategy 2019-2022  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  55  is planned to be completed by 1st of May 2022 when preparation of a strategy for the next four  year period will be ongoing.

In the Lithuania actors, involved in development of cybersecurity skills are schools, academia,  private sector and governmental institutions.  Schools: Education of IT starts in primary schools.  Academia: Universities with IT, engineering and cybersecurity programs  Private sectors: entities, which provides training, certification.  Governmental institutions: Institutions, which provides training for the government entities (for  example NSCS under Mod).  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  It is directly related to the third target of the Lithuania’s strategy – to promote cybersecurity  culture and development of innovation and to fourth target – to strengthen a close cooperation  between private and public sectors.  The first objective of the third target is to expand scientific research and activities which create  high added value in the area of cybersecurity. This objective will be fulfilled by creating suitable  conditions for the creation of new, advanced capabilities which develop cybersecurity initiatives  by promoting the growth of the cybersecurity market, export of cybersecurity services to foreign  markets, by expanding the cybersecurity sector of financial technology and by carrying out  corresponding research.  The second objective of the third target is to develop creativity, advanced capabilities and  cybersecurity skills and qualification which match with the needs of the market. This objective  will be attained by having representatives of public and private sector as well as science and  education institutions create a cybersecurity competence model, establish cybersecurity  competence standards, develop systems of training, accreditation and certification all of which  would be oriented towards the needs of the labour market, also have them attract and develop  talents, create training and testing environment of cybersecurity, teach the  beginners/newcomers and provide opportunities of re-training/re-qualification to persons  working in the ICT field, improve knowledge on cybersecurity of persons who work with  sensitive data.  The third objective of the third target is to promote the cooperation between the public and  private sector and science and education institutions in developing cybersecurity innovation.  This objective will be fulfilled by identifying the common needs of private and public sectors,  their importance to scientific cybersecurity research, by creating technical measures, methods  and other resources, by developing competences to resolve cybersecurity problems and carry  out specific cybersecurity objectives.  The first objective of the fourth target is to improve the coordination of cooperation between  private and public sectors. This objective will be reached by creating a sustainable model of  cooperation between private and public sectors in the field of cybersecurity, by identifying  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  56  responsibility and capabilities, by strengthening the country’s cybersecurity, by making  exchange of relevant information on cyber threats, cyber incidents which have taken place and  lessons learned between private and public sectors more effective, by developing early warning  system, by creating new and improving the existing communication methods and processes.  The second objective of the fourth target is to increase the degree of cybersecurity maturity of  the representatives of private small and medium-sized businesses. This objective will be fulfilled  by encouraging (urging) the representatives of small and medium-sized businesses to check the  status of their cybersecurity and plug the gaps in cybersecurity.  The third objective of the fourth target is to create responsible practice of disclosing the ICT  security gaps in private and public sectors. This objective will be reached by initiating a  responsible practice of disclosing ICT gaps in private and public sectors, by establishing  operational principles of this field, the procedure of application of methods, technical capacities  and other measures designed for this purpose.  3.

The National Cybersecurity Strategy of 2016 set two measures for achieving the goal of safety  of citizens in cyberspace. Those measures were regular implementation of awareness-raising  programmes on cybersecurity and introduction of cybersecurity content in education and  training programmes. Slovenia is quite successful in performing the former but unfortunately not  successful in performing the latter. In 2021 Slovenia will participate in the European  Cybersecurity Challenge for the first time in order to popularise acquiring the cybersecurity skills  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  58  among the youth. It is planned that every year’s national challenge and the participation in  ECSC become traditional.  The new cybersecurity strategy will address various initiatives for acquiring and developing  cybersecurity skills.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  For the time being the impact of cybersecurity initiatives has not been measured, but this will  change with the new cybersecurity strategy.  SPAIN  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Spain has three official documents, which endorse the actions that are being carried out in  terms of talent and skills in Cybersecurity.  These three documents are:   The National Cybersecurity Strategy  (link)   Within this strategy, there is the \"Objective IV: Culture and commitment to  cybersecurity and empowerment of human and technological capabilities\" and in  its \"Line of action 5: Strengthen the Spanish cybersecurity industry and the  generation and retention of talent, for the strengthening of digital autonomy  (measures 5 to 8)\" we can find all the measures related to the promotion of talent.   The Digital Agenda “España Digital 2025” (link)   Also, within this plan, in \"Line 4: Cybersecurity (measure 14.2 - (2) generation,  identification and development of talent in cybersecurity, to increase capacities  and respond to the growth of the sector and the Spanish cybersecurity industry)\",  all the actions related to talent in Cybersecurity are specified.   The National Digital Skills Plan (link)   This plan provides for public reforms and investments to the sum of 3.75 billion  euros and its goals are guaranteeing digital inclusion, reducing the digital gap  between men and women, guaranteeing the digitalisation of education, promoting  the acquisition of the digital skills of the unemployed and of workers, increasing  the number of ICT specialists and promoting the necessary digital skills of  companies. In order to reach these goals, cybersecurity skills are considered  fundamental and, because of that, they are taken into account in this plan.  With this framework in mind, the Spanish government has set up the National Cybersecurity  Forum (FNCS), which is a public-private collaboration space promoted by the National  Security Council (DSN) with the collaboration of INCIBE (Spanish National Cybersecurity  Institute) and the CCN (National Cryptologic Centre), whom hold the two vice-presidencies.   The FNCS, aligned with the aforementioned documents, is working on several lines  focused on generating cybersecurity culture (Working Group 1), offering support to  Industry and R&D&i (Working Group 2) and an opportunity for training and talent in  cybersecurity (Working Group 3). Issues related to cybersecurity talent are dealt  with in WG 3 and in one of the sub-working groups of WG 2 (matching industry  demands regarding talent and skills).   Specifically, the objectives of WG3 are:   To update or, when appropriate, to develop cybersecurity competency  frameworks that respond to the needs of the labour market.  https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/documento/estrategia-nacional-ciberseguridad-2019 https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Documents/2020/230720-Espa%C3%B1aDigital_2025.pdf https://portal.mineco.gob.es/RecursosArticulo/mineco/ministerio/ficheros/210127_plan_nacional_de_competencias_digitales.pdf https://foronacionalciberseguridad.es/ https://foronacionalciberseguridad.es/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  59   Identify the needs for professional cybersecurity skills, fostering collaboration  with educational and training institutions, promoting lifelong learning, training  for employment and university education, promoting accreditation and  professional certification systems.   Promote the inclusion of professional cybersecurity profiles in public sector  job descriptions.   Detect, foster and retain cybersecurity talent with special attention to the field  of research.   Promote cybersecurity digital literacy initiatives and plans.   Seek and recognise the collaboration and participation of the media to  achieve greater reach in campaigns aimed at citizens and minors.  In parallel, INCIBE is executing additional actions in the field of cybersecurity competences at a  national level. These actions include the launch of a Cybersecurity Talent Analysis and  Diagnosis Service in Spain which, among other things, aims to carry out more than 600  surveys to determine the real need for profiles at national level.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  There are several other initiatives that have already been carried out over the years and that  could be of interest, as many of them will continue to be adapted to the new profiles sought:   Market studies:   Apart from the aforementioned study being carried out by INCIBE, the rest of the  initiatives launched in Spain have been at a more local level and not supported by  any of the documents or laws mentioned.   Competitions:   Since 2014, INCIBE has been organising the CyberCamp event, which mainly  aims to identify career paths and broaden technical knowledge, as well as to  awaken and promote talent in cybersecurity through technical competitions.   In this sense, two competitions are organised as part of the event, one  individual and the other by teams (CyberOlimpics).   The team competition is aimed at secondary school and vocational training  students and serves as a first step before moving on to the individual  competition.   The individual competition also serves to select the Spanish team that  participates every year in the ENISA European Cybersecurity Challenges   Up to now, the design of the tests and challenges of these competitions  hasn´t been based on any specific criteria or definition of competencies;  however, our intention is to adapt the challenges to the competencies and  profiles needed in the Spanish industry and also to increase the number of  training sessions and competitions by levels and competencies that they  develop.   There are more competitions developed by different organisations and entities that  seek the same objective, to boost the interest of the new generations in dedicating  themselves professionally to Cybersecurity. Below are some of the competitions  developed over the last year at national level by public bodies:   National League of challenges in Cyberspace organised by the Spanish Civil  Guard (link)  https://cybercamp.es/ https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/CTF https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/cyberolympics https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/eu-cyber-challenge https://www.nationalcyberleague.es/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  60   CyberWallChallenge organised by the Spanish National Police as part of its  CyberWallAcademy training action. (https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-  academy-es/)   Professional studies:   In addition to university studies in the field of cybersecurity (which we previously  mentioned in another thread on the different degrees available in Spain) and  which you can find a list of in the INCIBE catalogue, there are also vocational  training studies.   These studies have three levels (basic, intermediate and advanced). The last  of these levels is recognised at the same level as university Master degrees,  and this year the first courses of this type in cybersecurity have been  published:   Course of Specialisation in Cybersecurity in Information Technology  Environments endorsed by Royal Decree 479/2020, of 7 April,  establishing the Course of Specialisation in Cybersecurity in Information  Technology Environments and setting the basic aspects of the curriculum  (https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4963).   Specialisation Course in Cybersecurity in Operational Technology  Environments, endorsed by Royal Decree 478/2020, of 7 April, which  establishes the Specialisation Course in Cybersecurity in Operational  Technology Environments and sets out the basic aspects of the  curriculum (https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-  4962).   These two Cybersecurity Specialisation courses will be taught for the first time  in Spain this coming academic year (2021-22) as the first step towards  developing Cybersecurity courses at the other two levels of this type of  training (INCIBE has collaborated in the Working Group that developed the  CV of these courses and we are collaborating with the Spanish Ministry of  Education and Vocational Training in the continuity of the actions for the other  levels, as well as in the training of the professionals who will teach these  courses, together with the School of Industrial Organisation - EOI -  https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf).   Women in cybersecurity:   In relation to women in cybersecurity, we can highlight two initiatives at the  national level:   INCIBE has launched \"Despega\" (“Take-off”) a program that aims to promote  the presence of women in cybersecurity, including actions to raise awareness,  attract talent, training, visibility, entrepreneurship and employability for  women.   On the other hand, the first national chapter of ECSO's Women4Cyber  programme has recently been founded in Spain, which is also working on  these initiatives, aligned with the initiatives at European level and which is  reaching agreements with different entities (both public and private) seeking  to promote the presence of women in this area.   Educational actions in cybersecurity:   In addition to what has already been mentioned in previous points, INCIBE is  working in the medium to long term on the establishment of training itineraries  (with its own content as well as that of third parties), aligned with the profiles that  will be obtained from the different initiatives underway and whose objective is to  cover the demand for the necessary professionals at national level and that have  quality training oriented towards the competences required for each of the most in-  demand profiles.  https://c1b3rwall.hackrocks.com/ https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-academy-es/ https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-academy-es/ https://www.incibe.es/sites/default/files/paginas/talento/catalogos-formacion/catalogo-masteres.pdf https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/informatica-comunicaciones/ciberseguridad-entornos-tecnologias-informacion.html https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/informatica-comunicaciones/ciberseguridad-entornos-tecnologias-informacion.html https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4963 https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/electricidad-electronica/ciberseguridad-tecnologias-operacion.html https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/electricidad-electronica/ciberseguridad-tecnologias-operacion.html https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962 https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962 https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/incibe-reivindica-el-impulso-mujer-ciberseguridad-el-programa-despega https://women4cyber.eu/ https://www.women4cyberspain.es/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  61  Up to this point, we have indicated the initiatives at national level that are being worked on, but  which do not yet have published deliverables and which, in many of them, we are going to take  the results of the ENISA WG as a point of reference.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  In most of the initiatives showed before, there is no specific measuring tools for the impact.  However, we have information regarding indicators of the initiatives carried out so far, with data  on participation in some Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).  Course Season  Registered  participants  Passed  participants  Satisfaction rate  L1 – SMES 6* 11.747 3091 4,32 (1-5 scale)  L2 – Móviles 2 4.000 448 Not available  L3 – SCI 2** 2.132 721  Only qualitative analysis:  most of positive comments  L7 – FCSE  (basic)  1 1.779 1064 79,75% mostly satisfied  L7 – FCSE  (advance)  1 1.818 758 75,62% mostly satisfied  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  62  D ANNEX:  APPROACHES ADOPTED BY  NON-EU COUNTRIES  This annex examines the approaches adopted by two non-EU countries (the United Kingdom  and the United States) in their efforts to improve cybersecurity skills and education, and reduce  the shortfall in cybersecurity professionals. This analysis is based on open-source information.  In the United Kingdom (UK), cybersecurity and cyber defence have been a national priority for  many years. In order to increase the pool of cybersecurity skills, the UK has also focused on  ‘widespread and innovative collaboration across all sectors’143. The UK’s latest NCSS (2016-  2021)144 stresses the need to ‘develop’ the cyber skills base in the country. More importantly,  the Initial National Cybersecurity Skills Strategy (2019)145,146 considers cybersecurity education  to be a strategic outcome with the overall goal of ensuring that the country has enough  cybersecurity professionals to meet national needs.  In the past 30 years, the United States (US) has developed strategies and policies related to  cyberspace (security and defence). One of the priorities set by the US National Cyber Strategy  (2018) was to enhance efforts to build cyber capacity147. Pillar II of the strategy specifically  refers to the need to develop the workforce and maintain the supply of talent by: 1) increasing  reskilling and educational opportunities for workers, 2) enhancing the federal cybersecurity  workforce, and 3) using executive authority to highlight and reward talent148.  Below we conduct a high-level analysis based on the three primary areas used in Section 3.  D.1 RAISE USER AWARENESS AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND  IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION  UNITED KINGDOM  Launched in 2016 by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the CyberFirst149  initiative has been extended and has become part of an ‘£84 million government cyber-  education programme’. It offers, among other, courses and competitions for young people (11-  17 years old) and its CyberFirst Girls150 competitions motivates girls to develop their cyber skills.  143 IISS (2021) Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment, Cyber Power – Tier Two, United Kingdom,  https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-power---tier-two  144 HM Government, ‘National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016–2021’, 2016,  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_s ecurity_strategy_2016.pdf  145 HM Government, DCMS, (2019) Initial National Cybersecurity Skills Strategy: increasing the UK’s cybersecurity  capability - a call for views, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-strategy/initial-national-cyber- security-skills-strategy-increasing-the-uks-cyber-security-capability-a-call-for-views  146 Initial National Cybersecurity Skills Strategy (2019)  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949211/Cyber_security_ skills_strategy_211218_V2.pdf  147 The White House (2018) U.S. National Cyber Strategy, https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp- content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf  148 Ibid.  149 NCSC, CyberFirst overview, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/overview  150 NCSC, CyberFirst Girls competition, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/girls-competition  https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-power---tier-two https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-strategy/initial-national-cyber-security-skills-strategy-increasing-the-uks-cyber-security-capability-a-call-for-views https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-strategy/initial-national-cyber-security-skills-strategy-increasing-the-uks-cyber-security-capability-a-call-for-views https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949211/Cyber_security_skills_strategy_211218_V2.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949211/Cyber_security_skills_strategy_211218_V2.pdf https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/overview https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/girls-competition  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  63  In terms of campaign initiatives targeting the public, the UK launched Cyber Aware (led by the  NCSC). Its aim is to teach people on how to stay secure online and how to protect themselves  in a practical way151. Moreover, ‘Get Safe Online’ acts as one of the UK's leading resources on  awareness, helping to protect people, financial assets, devices and businesses from fraud,  abuse and other online threats152. Its website offers the public practical advice on, for example,  how to perform backups and keep safe online.  UNITED STATES  In 2018, the US’s Department of Commerce and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  released a report on ‘Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation’s Cybersecurity  Workforce’153. The report also raises awareness regarding the skills shortage problem,  acknowledges the need for an immediate expansion of the cybersecurity workforce, and  provides the following findings:   the increasing concerns of employers about the importance of cybersecurity related  educational programmes;   the insufficient number of skilled cybersecurity teachers at the primary and secondary  school levels and in higher education, as well as a lack of training instructors;   the need to increase the number of female candidates for cybersecurity careers and  the re-education of non-IT personnel in organisations;   the need to simplify hiring procedures (e.g. lengthy security clearance delays); and   the lack of reliable data to deliver a comprehensive picture of the needs of the  cybersecurity workforce and related education and training programmes.  More recently, in March 2021, the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance154 document,  which also highlights the importance of investing in people to build a talent base, was released.  Launched in 2020, Cyber.org155 is a cybersecurity-centric workforce development organisation,  backed by the cyber unit of DHS and CISA, that promotes cyber education and literacy. It  targets K-12 students (from kindergarten to 12th grade). It has published materials for teachers  to educate students on the basics of cybersecurity. In addition, the organisation has published  ‘K-12 Cybersecurity Learning Standards’156 which focuses on three core themes: Computing  Systems, Digital Citizenship and Security.  D.2 STRENGTHEN TRAINING AND PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY IN  HIGHER EDUCATION  UNITED KINGDOM  To prepare a knowledge base for scientific cybersecurity, the Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge  (CyBOK)157 project at the University of Bristol in the UK aims to ‘codify the foundational and  generally recognised knowledge on cybersecurity’. The project serves as a knowledge hub and  151 NCSC (2020) Cyber Aware Campaign Toolkit, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static- assets/documents/cyberaware/CyberAware%20campaign%20toolkit_Dec%2020.pdf  152 Get Safe Online, https://www.getsafeonline.org/  153 U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security (2018) A Report to the President on  Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation’s Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for a More  Secure American Future, https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/07/24/eo_wf_report_to_potus.pdf  154 The White House (2021) Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf  155 Cyber.org, https://cyber.org/about-us  156 Cyber.org, K-12 Cybersecurity Learning Standards, https://cyber.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/K- 12%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Standards.pdf  157 CyBOK, https://www.cybok.org/  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/cyberaware/CyberAware%20campaign%20toolkit_Dec%2020.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/cyberaware/CyberAware%20campaign%20toolkit_Dec%2020.pdf https://www.getsafeonline.org/ https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/07/24/eo_wf_report_to_potus.pdf https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf https://cyber.org/about-us https://cyber.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/K-12%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Standards.pdf https://cyber.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/K-12%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Standards.pdf https://www.cybok.org/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  64  guide for existing literature such as textbooks, academic research articles, technical reports,  white papers and standards158.  Furthermore, the UK’s NCSC certifies bachelor, integrated master, and master programmes,  and apprenticeships. This initiative directly stems from the UK Cybersecurity Strategy 2016-21,  which states that ‘the UK requires more talented and qualified cybersecurity professionals’159.  To obtain certification, degree courses should have a minimum number of credits in computer  science or cybersecurity, depending on whether they are bachelor or master programmes. The  NCSC provides either provisional or full certification, which is valid for 5 years.  In 2013, the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in Cybersecurity were established as a part of  the 2011 national cybersecurity programme. A CDT in cybersecurity provides a 4-year  programme. Doctoral students attend a taught component in their first year and undertake a  specific research project with a clear focus on cybersecurity in the remaining 3 years.  From the training side, the Cyber Retraining Academy160 is a UK government-funded  programme that provides an intensive 10-week conversion programme for people without a  formal background in cyber. This provides people with new opportunities by allowing them to  move into cybersecurity careers while, at the same time, it directly alleviates the shortage  problem in the cybersecurity workforce.  UNITED STATES  In the US, the National Security Agency (NSA) has invested substantially in the creation of  rigorous cybersecurity programmes across a network of universities161. Nevertheless, reports  suggest that ‘only 42% of the top 50 computer science programmes in the country include  security courses for undergraduates’162. According to CyberSeek, an initiative funded by the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), from April 2020 to March 2021, the  country’s total employed workforce in cybersecurity was 956,341 persons, whilst the number of  online job listings for cybersecurity-related positions was 464,420163.  Established in 2010, the Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework)164 aims to  aid in sustaining the cybersecurity workforce in partnership with the government, academia, and  the private sector on education, training, and the development of the workforce165. According to  the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)166, by using the NICE Framework,  among others, the creation of educational programmes aligned to jobs could be facilitated while,  at the same time, the appropriate knowledge and skills needed by the market could be selected  and delivered to students. To help in the implementation of the framework, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS)167 published resources (e.g. toolkit, mapping tools) for educators and  employers. Moreover, CyberSeek168, which was built through a public-private partnership, is a  tool that provides data about supply and demand for cybersecurity jobs in the US.  158 University of Bristol, CyBOK: Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge,  https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/ilo/academics/cybok/  159 UK’s National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016-2021  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_s ecurity_strategy_2016.pdf  160 CSIS (2019) The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap  161 Forbes (2019) The Cybersecurity Skills Gap Won't Be Solved in a Classroom,  https://www.forbes.com/sites/martenmickos/2019/06/19/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-wont-be-solved-in-a-classroom/  162 HDI (2020) The cybersecurity skills gap: 4 million professionals needed worldwide,  https://www.hdi.global/infocenter/insights/2020/cyber-skills-gap/  163 CyberSeek, Heatmap https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html  164 NICE Framework, https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework  165 U.S. Department of Commerce, NIST, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied- cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan  166 CISA, NICE Framework, https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework  167 NICCS, Cybersecurity resources, https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cybersecurity-resources  168 CyberSeek, https://www.cyberseek.org/  https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/ilo/academics/cybok/ https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap https://www.forbes.com/sites/martenmickos/2019/06/19/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-wont-be-solved-in-a-classroom/ https://www.hdi.global/infocenter/insights/2020/cyber-skills-gap/ https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cybersecurity-resources https://www.cyberseek.org/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  65  The National Centres of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C)169 programme,  managed by the National Cryptologic School, developed a set of academic standards  (cybersecurity curriculum and academic excellence) that colleges and universities in the US are  encouraged to meet. Currently, there are three categories:   Cyber Defence Education (CAE-CDE) designation awarded to regionally accredited  academic institutions;   Cyber Research (CAE-R) designation awarded to Department of Defense (DoD)  schools, PhD producing military academies; and   Cyber Operations (CAE-CO) a deeply technical, inter-disciplinary, higher education  programme.  Lastly but not least, the DoD has been vocal about the challenge of recruiting and retaining  cyber talent due to competition with industry170. The DoD Cyber Workforce Framework171 was  developed in 2020 and was defined in DoD Directive 8140.01. It works as a lexicon and refines  ‘all of the DoD’s cyber skillsets needed to conduct its missions into 54 roles’172.  D.3 ORGANISE CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES AND CHALLENGES  UNITED KINGDOM  The ‘Cybersecurity Challenge’ was established in 2010 in order to organise a series of national  competitions, learning programmes and networking initiatives to attract more people from  diverse backgrounds to become cybersecurity professionals173. It also acts as an ‘entry point for  students into other UK wide educational programmes such as Cyber First, Cyber Discovery and  the Cyber Centurion competition174.  UNITED STATES  The US Cyber Challenge (USCC)175 is a national programme that organises cybersecurity  camps and competitions targeting students. Free online competitions, called Cyber Quests, are  conducted every year in order to assess the cybersecurity knowledge of participants.  Depending on their performance, contestants may be invited to Cyber Camps where  cybersecurity training sessions taught by top instructors take place.  Additionally, in 2019 the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition176 was established. It  targets federal employees.

While various initiatives related to  cybersecurity skills have been proposed and multiple actions have been launched to address  the problems, the shortage and gap persist. ENISA has a long tradition of studies and  programmes that have attempted to mitigate similar cybersecurity issues. In an effort to  increase the EU’s future cybersecurity workforce and ensure the availability of appropriately  trained professionals, ENISA has investigated the problem further.  In this report, ENISA contributes to both practice and research on the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap in two distinctive areas. Firstly, it provides an overview of the current supply of  cybersecurity skills in Europe through an analysis of data gathered and generated by the  recently established Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD). Secondly, it  describes the policy approaches adopted by EU Member States in their quest to increase and  sustain their national cybersecurity workforces. These approaches have been classified and  analysed based on objectives defined by ENISA’s National Capabilities Assessment Framework  (NCAF), namely cybersecurity awareness, training, challenges and exercises. Here we note that  this report focuses on the role of the higher education sector in addressing the EU cybersecurity  skills shortage and gap, and therefore vocational or lower forms of education in cybersecurity  related topics are not considered as core parts of this study.  Based on the data collected and analysed under the two areas mentioned above, this report  makes five recommendations to address the EU cybersecurity skills shortage and gap:   Increase enrolments and eventually graduates in cybersecurity programmes through:  o the diversification of the Higher Educational Institutes’ (HEIs) curricula in  terms of content, levels and language.  o the provision of scholarships, especially for underrepresented groups, and  more active efforts to promote cybersecurity as a diverse field.   Support a unified approach across government, industry and HEIs through:  o the adoption of a common framework regarding cybersecurity roles,  competencies, skills and knowledge, for example, the one provided by the  European Cybersecurity Skills Framework.  o the promotion of challenges and competitions in cybersecurity skills.   Increase collaborations between Member States in:  o launching European cybersecurity initiatives with shared objectives.  o sharing of the outputs of programmes (including results and lessons learnt).   Promote analysis of the cybersecurity market needs and trends through:  o the identification of metrics showing the extent of the problem and possible  measures to cope with it.   Support the promotion of CyberHEAD (and its further evolution) in order to:  o facilitate an ongoing understanding of the status of cybersecurity higher  education programmes in the EU.  o monitor trends regarding the number of cybersecurity graduates who could  potentially fill current vacancies in the sector.  o support the analysis of demographics (including the diversity) of new  students and graduates in cybersecurity.  o assist in monitoring the effectiveness of cybersecurity initiatives targeting the  supply side (e.g. changes in enrolments in HEI programmes after the release  of new cybersecurity initiatives).  o demonstrate the value of CyberHEAD for HEIs as well as incentivise HEIs to  submit their programmes to CyberHEAD.  This report  describes the  approaches to  address the  cybersecurity  skills shortage  and gap within  the EU.  It provides  unique insights  into the  programmes  offered by the  EU’s academic  institutions  based on  CyberHEAD  data.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  Technology plays a central role in society today. It supports initiatives by business and  government, enables worldwide communications and drives innovation. As technology has  become more prevalent, so has the reality of cyber-attacks targeting corporations, governments  and individuals. Over the last five years, the World Economic Forum has consistently rated  cyber-attacks as a substantial global risk1, 2 and the latest reports from ENISA further highlight  the complexity of the threat landscape, suggesting that these attacks are increasingly  sophisticated, targeted and widespread3.  In response to the vast increase in online and emerging cyberthreats, the field of cybersecurity  has grown substantially over the last decade. Cybersecurity solutions and technologies are  widely available from industry and open-source communities, and security processes, standards  and laws (e.g. ISO27000, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, NIS Directive) continue to be  developed and refined. These are all signs of an increasingly mature field and are pivotal to  adequately addressing the dynamic nature of cyberthreats.  An area where cybersecurity remains under-developed however is in the skills present in the  workforce. More specifically, there is a lack of skilled and qualified personnel in the labour  market to work in cybersecurity roles and who can sufficiently address the range of cyberthreats  posed. Over the years, this has become a well-documented problem, which continues to  significantly impact countries across Europe and the world4,5,6,7,8,9. Within countries and specific  sectors, these issues are even more pronounced due to strong competition for security  professionals which often means that certain sectors (e.g. governments and central banks)  have difficulty attracting talented security professionals compared to others (such as the finance  industry) that can offer more lucrative employment10.  The lack of cybersecurity professionals is usually discussed in the context of the cybersecurity  skills gap and cybersecurity skills shortage. These are two distinctive, albeit closely related,  issues. The cybersecurity skills gap is seen to refer to a lack of appropriate skills in the  workforce to perform cybersecurity tasks within a professional setting11,12. On the other hand,  the skills shortage refers to a lack of cybersecurity professionals to fill cybersecurity roles or, as  1 WEF, 2020, The Global Risks Report http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risk_Report_2020.pdf  2 WEF, 2021, The Global Risks Report 2021 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2021.pdf  3 ENISA, 2020, ENISA Threat Landscape - 2020 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/threats-and- trends Accessed on 27/07/2021  4 ENISA, 2020, Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber- security-education-in-the-european-union  5 CPO, 2020, Study Reveals That Cybersecurity Skills Gap Affects About Three-Quarters of Organizations and Still  Worsening https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/study-reveals-that-cybersecurity-skills-gap-affects-about-three- quarters-of-organizations-and-still-worsening/  6 CBR, 2020, Europe’s Cybersecurity Skills Gap Has Doubled: Report https://www.cbronline.com/news/cybersecurity-job- gap  7 UK Government, 2021, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2021  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2021  8 Australian Cybersecurity Growth Network, 2020, Australia’s Cybersecurity Sector Competitiveness Plan 2020  https://www.austcyber.com/resources/sector-competitiveness-plan  9 NIST, 2017, Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for  a More Secure American Future https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/07/24/eo_wf_report_to_potus.pdf  10 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2020, Priority #4: Cybersecurity Workforce Challenges  https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/11/18/priority-4-cybersecurity-workforce-challenges-pub-83112  11 McGuinness, S., Pouliakas, K., & Redmond, P. 2018.

In this report, we examine both areas.  There have been various attempts to address the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap.  Examples of policies include changes in higher education programmes, closer engagement  between academia and industry, and an increasing number of security certifications and training  opportunities14,15,16,17. Educators, in particular, are often viewed as central figures, as evidenced  by existing research using France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Italy and the UK as units of  analysis.18  One important question for the EU is how such national policies, programmes and interventions  (including any additional ones from industry and academia) may apply to the EU as a whole,  and whether they can help in addressing the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap. Therefore,  in this report, one goal is to pursue these questions to provide insights and recommendations  that are suitable in an EU context.  1.1 SCOPE OF THE REPORT  This report contributes to practice and research into the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap in  two ways. Firstly, it provides an overview of the current supply of advanced cybersecurity skills  in Europe through an analysis of the recently established Cybersecurity Higher Education  Database (CyberHEAD). Secondly, it describes the policy approaches adopted by EU Member  States in their quest to increase and sustain their national cybersecurity workforce. With this  basis the report then proposes a series of recommendations for reducing the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap through Higher Education in the EU.  A primary area of focus in this report is the ENISA Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (CyberHEAD).19 Launched in March 2020, this crowd-sourced database – populated by Higher  Education Institutions (HEIs) – aggregates cybersecurity degrees in the EU and European Free  Trade Association (EFTA) countries. As such, this database provides a unique insight into the  supply of cybersecurity skills on offer from European HEIs as well as information about the  types of individuals being trained. This report presents the first analysis of this data collected by  CyberHEAD.  This report will answer the following research questions:  1. What insights can be derived from ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  about the cybersecurity qualifications and skills being developed by European HEIs?  2. Based on ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database, how many and what  types of individuals are undertaking HEI cybersecurity courses in Europe (i.e. the  individuals likely to enter the security workforce)?  3. How are EU Member States attempting to address the cybersecurity skills shortage  and gap in their own countries? For instance, what policy initiatives and what  programmes exist?

What policy  initiatives may prove valuable at addressing the cybersecurity shortage and gap? How  can ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database be further enhanced to better  capture key indicators of skills supplied and the workforce being trained in the EU?  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  The cybersecurity skills shortage and gap represent a significant problem that is faced by  governments, industry and the wider society. In this report, we provide key insights into the  cybersecurity skills shortage and gap in the EU, reflect on approaches to address it, and  conclude with a series of recommendations to enhance the provisions of skills. The research  and findings in this report are targeted at four main bodies:   EU Member States and European institutions interested in cybersecurity skills  and the role that Higher Education has to play: This report provides the first  comprehensive digest of the provision of cybersecurity qualifications and skills in EU  HEIs, as represented by CyberHEAD (which contains 126 programmes from 25  European countries20). It also presents notable insights into current approaches to  address the skills shortage and gap and the recommendations for states, which draws  on international best practices, which can be applied.   EU Higher Education Institutions (HEIs): This report’s findings can provide an  overview of the cybersecurity qualifications and skills on offer in HEIs across the EU,  how they are supplied, and how many students are currently enrolled and graduating  broken down by gender. Such summary information, along with this report’s  recommendations, can help HEIs better tailor new or existing programmes (e.g. to  match demand in certain subject areas, or fill a gap in other areas).   Business and industry: Businesses and the security industry generally are central to  mitigating the shortage of cybersecurity professionals. This report’s findings define  some of the ongoing problems within the HEI sector, and present opportunities for  businesses to work more closely with academia to create HEI curricula that are in line  with the needs of businesses in the EU.   Researchers and the academic community: The research presented in this report  advances the current discourse into cybersecurity skills, using quantitative (e.g. from  CyberHEAD) and qualitative data (e.g. reports from EU Member States), while also  outlining a series of recommendations. This is one of the largest studies to date on this  topic in the EU and can provide a basis for future research efforts and intellectual  discussion.  1.3 REPORT STRUCTURE  This report is organised as follows:   Section 2 analyses data from ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  (CyberHEAD) to understand the characteristics of programmes, the students engaging  with them, and the ability of graduating students to assist in addressing the EU’s need  for skills.   Section 3 examines the different approaches adopted by EU Member States to  mitigate the cybersecurity workforce skills shortage and gap. This is based on a  questionnaire completed by States and openly sourced information.   Section 4 reconsiders the previous sections and provides recommendations on how  EU’s cybersecurity skills shortage and gap may be addressed. This section also  includes recommendations for the further development of CyberHEAD given the key  role it may play in understanding the state of the EU’s cybersecurity skills.  20 This number is based on CyberHEAD data as of 20th June 2021. A different number of programmes might be showing at  the time of reading.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  8  In addition, the Annexes delve deeper into some of the above topics:   Annex A lists the questions that need to be answered by European academic  institutions (HEIs) when listing their programmes in CyberHEAD.   Annex B investigates the questions that might be added to the database in the future in  order to give further insights into the cybersecurity skills gap and shortage.   Annex C includes the full replies provided by the Member States on cybersecurity  skills, policies and initiatives. This data informed Section 3.   Annex D lists the approaches taken by two non-EU countries (the United Kingdom and  the United States) in their efforts to address the shortfall in cybersecurity professionals.   Annex E includes the 126 programmes listed in CyberHEAD on the 20th of June 2021.

THE SUPPLY OF  CYBERSECURITY  QUALIFICATIONS AND SKILLS  2.1 INTRODUCTION  To analyse the supply of cybersecurity qualifications and skills in the EU, this report makes use  of ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD). This database is the  largest resource of its nature and is able to provide a reliable and up-to-date snapshot of  cybersecurity programmes available across the EU. This is complementary to, and informed by,  other efforts (e.g. pilot maps from the Cyber Competence Network (CCN)) which aim to  catalogue security courses and training across Europe21. It should be noted that CyberHEAD  may not list all the available cybersecurity programmes in the EU, because it is a crowd-sourced  database which relies on HEIs to submit their programmes.  For degree programmes to be eligible for inclusion in CyberHEAD, there are two core criteria22.  Firstly, the degree must be recognised by the national authority of an EU or European Free  Trade Association (EFTA) Member State. Secondly, the degree’s content must contain a  notable volume of cybersecurity topics. Cybersecurity is defined as any subject within the  knowledge areas of the Cybersecurity Curricula 2017 developed by the Joint Task Force on  Cybersecurity Education23. More specifically:   For a bachelor’s degree: at least 25% of the taught modules must address  cybersecurity topics.   For a master’s degree: at least 40% of the taught modules must address cybersecurity  topics.   For a postgraduate specialisation programme: at least 40% of the taught modules must  address cybersecurity topics and the programme must have a minimum of 30 hours for  the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).  The questions that HEIs are expected to answer in order to be added to CyberHEAD, which  also define the type of data stored in the database, can be found in Annex A.  The dynamic nature of programmes – i.e. the speed at which degrees may be launched,  changed or removed – makes it difficult for any database to be complete. On the 20th of June  2021, CyberHEAD contained 126 programmes from 25 European countries as can be found in  Annex E. Figure 1 presents the geographical distribution of CyberHEAD programmes.  21 Cyber Competence Network, 2021, CCN projects contributed to the ENISA CyberHEAD portal which helps students to  choose cybersecurity programs. https://cybercompetencenetwork.eu/ccn-projects-contributed-to-the-enisa-cyberhead- portal-which-helps-students-to-choose-cybersecurity-programs/  22 ENISA, 2020, Cybersecurity Skills Development in the EU https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber- security-education-in-the-european-union  23 Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education, 2017, Curriculum Guidelines for Post-Secondary Degree Programs in  Cybersecurity https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf  CyberHEAD – Cybersecurity Higher Education Database  provides the largest reliable and updated source of information  on higher education cybersecurity programmes in Europe  www.enisa.europa.eu/cyberhead  https://cybercompetencenetwork.eu/ccn-projects-contributed-to-the-enisa-cyberhead-portal-which-helps-students-to-choose-cybersecurity-programs/ https://cybercompetencenetwork.eu/ccn-projects-contributed-to-the-enisa-cyberhead-portal-which-helps-students-to-choose-cybersecurity-programs/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber-security-education-in-the-european-union https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/the-status-of-cyber-security-education-in-the-european-union https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/csec2017.pdf http://www.enisa.europa.eu/cyberhead  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  10  Figure 1: Geographical distribution of CyberHEAD programmes  Section 2 is composed of two parts: Section 2.2 reports on an analysis of HEI data to derive  insights into the cybersecurity qualifications and skills provided, while Section 2.3 uses  CyberHEAD’s data to examine demographic information about the cohorts and graduates of the  programmes listed.  2.2 AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CYBERSECURITY  PROGRAMMES  CyberHEAD includes a variety of information about cybersecurity programmes, which can be  used to assess the nature of skills courses being offered in the EU. The oldest programme in  the database started in 2000 and is a bachelor’s degree in Secure Information Systems, and  after that there is a master’s degree in Cybersecurity which was founded in 2002. Most  programmes (64%) were launched between 2015 and 2020, with 2019 being the most prolific  year (20 new courses were established, 16% of the total in the database).  Figure 2 provides an overview based on programmes where we possess data on the years  when they were started, while Figure 3 aggregates these data to visualise the increase of  cybersecurity programmes over the years. These trends broadly match the rise in cybersecurity  as a field of study and practice, and the increase in demand for adequately trained security  professionals. Several notable strategies and reports were also released in the lead up to these  years including the EU Cybersecurity Strategy, ENISA’s Cybersecurity Education snapshot for  workforce development in the EU24 and the International Information System Security  Certification Consortium’s (ISC)² report on Cybersecurity Workforce Competencies25.  24 ENISA, 2015, Cybersecurity Education snapshot for workforce development in the EU  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/cybersecurity-education-snapshot-for- workforce-development-in-the-eu/view  25 (ISC)2, 2014, Cybersecurity Workforce Competencies: Preparing Tomorrow’s Risk-Ready Professionals  https://www.isc2.org/-/media/Files/Research/GISWS-Archive/Workforce-Competencies-Report-Phoenix-2014.ashx  https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/cybersecurity-education-snapshot-for-workforce-development-in-the-eu/view https://resilience.enisa.europa.eu/nis-platform/shared-documents/wg3-documents/cybersecurity-education-snapshot-for-workforce-development-in-the-eu/view https://www.isc2.org/-/media/Files/Research/GISWS-Archive/Workforce-Competencies-Report-Phoenix-2014.ashx  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  11  These reports, in combination with the increase in demand for cybersecurity skills and changes  in the labour market26, have undoubtedly influenced the demand for, and provision of, security-  oriented HEI programmes.  Figure 2: Programmes established per year27  Figure 3: Total programmes per year28  26 ISO, 2021, The Cybersecurity Skills Gap: Why education is our best weapon against cybercrime  https://www.iso.org/news/ref2655.html  27 Programme data for the year 2021 has been excluded because for 2021 the data are only provisional.  28 Ibid.  https://www.iso.org/news/ref2655.html  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  12  Master-level qualifications constitute most of the programme types (77%) in the database,  followed by bachelor programmes (17%) and postgraduate programmes (6%), as can be seen  from Figure 4. The high number of master programmes is intriguing when considering that there  is a higher cybersecurity topic requirement (i.e. at least 40% of taught modules) compared with  undergraduate programmes (which require at least 25%). The large quantity of master's degree  programmes suggests that cybersecurity is regarded as a specialist topic which should be  taught at a higher educational level than an undergraduate degree. This is also noticeable in  some courses as they present admission profiles that call for recent graduates in Computer  Science, Engineering, Mathematical Sciences or Physical Sciences. There is also an emphasis  on work experience as a requirement for admission to a small set of master programmes. In  such cases, at least two years of relevant professional experience is mentioned, preferably after  an undergraduate degree.  Bachelor qualifications in cybersecurity seem less common based on the data but there has  been a rise in new courses since 2018. A challenge for the establishment of such programmes,  however, is for HEIs to convince students to commit to a specific qualification pathway instead  of a more general degree such as computer science or engineering, which may give them  broader career options later on. Choosing cybersecurity as an undergraduate degree may be  risky for many students, particularly as cybersecurity jobs are attainable with only a computing  or engineering degree. For reference, if we compare the proportion of master and bachelor  programmes to those in other countries, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre shows that  certified master qualifications are similarly prominent29.  Figure 4: Programme types  The accessibility of EU HEI programmes is an important concern when discussing the  cyber skills gap. Courses that present barriers to entry for students can impact recruitment and  ultimately reduce the pool of graduates that may later enter the security workforce. Accessibility  is interpreted broadly in this report, and as such is concerned with any factors that may impact  the ability to access or apply for courses. To assess accessibility, this report examines the  delivery method adopted by current programmes, the language in which programmes are  taught, and whether fees apply for EU citizens. All these factors provide some basic insights into  how open current courses are to applicants from across the EU and are grounded in general  literature regarding potential inhibitors to education30,31.  29 UK National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC), 2020, NCSC-certified degrees https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc- certified-degrees  30 Nuffield Foundation, 2019, Tuition fee rises mean children are less likely to aspire to go to university  https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/news/tuition-fee-rises-mean-children-are-less-likely-to-aspire-to-go-to-university  31 World Economic Forum (WEF), 2020, The COVID-19 pandemic has changed education forever. This is how  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-certified-degrees https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/ncsc-certified-degrees https://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/news/tuition-fee-rises-mean-children-are-less-likely-to-aspire-to-go-to-university https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/coronavirus-education-global-covid19-online-digital-learning/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  13  Considering delivery methods first, 57% of programmes are classroom only, 29% are blended  (classroom and online) and 14% are online (see Figure 5). This suggests that geographic  proximity to the HEI is necessary in most programmes. While the benefits of classroom-based  interaction are undeniable (and typically range from tailored in-person teaching to dedicated  security labs and class-based exercises), online courses are increasingly popular as they are  more flexible and can cater to a large number of geographically dispersed students. This reality  has become even more salient due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the various national and  city-wide lockdowns across Europe.  Figure 5: Programme delivery methods  Language is relevant to the discussion of opportunities and barriers-to-entry because at least 24  languages are spoken across Europe. Programmes in widely known languages such as English  are arguably more accessible to a greater number of EU citizens. In total, 16 languages were  represented in the CyberHEAD data: 38% of courses were in English, 17% in Spanish, 11% in  German, 7% in Italian, 5% in French, 4% in Greek, and 4% in Portuguese (see Figure 6).  There is some overlap in the origin of courses with programmes from Italy, Spain, France, and  Austria appearing most. The fact that 38% of programmes are taught in English is excellent  given the diversity of languages in Europe, but an even higher percentage of English-based  programmes also presents additional benefits. For instance, it might facilitate the creation of a  fully rounded professional who is able to read and communicate in English and interact  seamlessly in an international setting. It might also attract international students looking for the  best opportunities in the EU.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  14  Figure 6: Programmes per language with percentages  Fees are another important topic when it comes to considering access. This report found that in  71% of programmes EU citizens need to pay fees in order to enrol (see Figure 7). This topic is  more contentious because although free programmes can lower the financial barrier to entry,  HEIs need income to fund teaching staff, dedicated software and computing labs. Unless these  funds are provided by governments or through industry partnerships, fees will still have to be  charged.  Figure 7: Programme fees  A primary aim of this report is to determine the skills provided by EU cybersecurity programmes.  To investigate this further, this study assessed the amount of credits (measured using the  European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)) allocated to various security  topics within each course. Across all programmes (bachelor, master and postgraduate  programmes) where data was provided:  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  15   48.45% of content was dedicated to Security Computing/Engineering disciplines,   9.55% to Law, Ethics, Policy, Privacy, Cybercrime disciplines,   12.11% to Organisational, Risk management, Business, Compliance disciplines,   4.49% to internships,   and 25.4% to other content.  For a breakdown according to programme, see Figure 8.  Figure 8: All Bachelor and Master/Postgraduate programmes average ECTS allocation  Programmes Average ECTS Allocation  Bachelor Programmes: Average ECTS Allocation  Master/Postgraduate Programmes: Average ECTS Allocation  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  16  The data demonstrates a clear presence of more cybersecurity engineering topics in the EU’s  HEI cybersecurity programmes, which is especially visible in master and postgraduate  programmes. The bachelor programmes contain only 33.73% of cybersecurity engineering  material, and instead have substantial ‘Other’ content (at 42.92%). This is likely attributable to  the need to cover more general topics outside the scope of security (including foundational  computing courses) considering that these cannot be assumed because it is a first degree.  Reflecting on this finding, it appears to map well with the skills needed as discussed in reports  on the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap. The 2020 ESG and ISSA report found that the  areas with the greatest shortage of cybersecurity skills were application security, cloud  computing security, security analysis and investigations, security engineering, and the  administration of risk and/or compliance32. Many of these areas continued to be weak in the  2021 ESG and ISSA report.33 Cloud computing security (which is within Security  Computing/Engineering disciplines) is highlighted in the (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study  2020 as the principal area in which professionals should aim to increase their skills34. These  studies suggest that current programmes have the appropriate subject focus.  Beyond Cybersecurity Computing/Engineering disciplines, it is encouraging to see programmes  also offering topics such as Organisational, Risk Management, Business, Compliance  disciplines and Law, Ethics, Policy, Privacy and Cybercrime. However, these seem low when  compared to skills required by the labour market as mentioned in the (ISC)² Cybersecurity  Workforce Study35. In this study, Risk assessment, analysis, management and governance, and  Risk management and compliance occupy the second and forth positions (respectively) of the  top cybersecurity skills of interest to professionals. This research is especially relevant to this  report’s work as 28% of the 3,790 respondents were from Europe.  Over time, the importance of law, ethics and privacy concerns within cybersecurity are also  likely to increase, due to regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  and the NIS Directive. The reality is that these topics are not traditionally taught within  engineering or computers science degrees and therefore will require HEIs to involve educators  from other departments. An added benefit to offering a broader curriculum would be the  development of more rounded cybersecurity students who will then be able to blend technical  and socio-technical skills in a professional setting.  An important point concerning the above analysis is that it presents mean averages across the  entire 124 programmes present in the database36. A reality however is that, as with all degree  courses, some courses specialise in certain areas and therefore contain more (or less) of  certain topics. For instance, a cybersecurity degree offered by a Politics department will differ  significantly to one offered by an Engineering school; i.e. the former is likely to include more  Law, Ethics, Policy, Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines rather than engineering or computer  science courses.  To provide more insight into the programmes, we also assessed the number of programmes  that concentrated on Security Computing/Engineering disciplines as compared to those that  focused on other disciplines. In total, 60 programmes contained 50% or more content (in terms  of ECTS points) on Security Computing/Engineering disciplines. This represents almost half of  all programmes and reaffirms the above findings.  32 ESG and ISSA, 2020, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020 https://www.esg- global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020  33 ESG and ISSA, 2021, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2021 https://www.esg- global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021  34 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  35 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  36 2 out of 126 programmes have not provided information about their ECTS  CyberHEAD  shows, on  average, a clear  prevalence of  cybersecurity  computing and  engineering topics  in the EU’s higher  education  cybersecurity  programmes  https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  17  Considering Organisational, Risk management, Business, Compliance disciplines and Law,  Ethics, Policy, Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines, only 10 programmes possess more than  50% of these disciplines combined. This demonstrates the dearth of such programmes but  presents opportunities for further expansion in HEIs.  Preparing graduates for the cybersecurity workplace is an implicit goal of HEI programmes.  There are various ways in which this can be achieved. For instance, internships in organisations  provide students with valuable working experience through which knowledge can be applied  and practice gained. Programmes with educators from industry (or content directly informed by  industry) ensure that security topics are relevant to actual workplace tasks and issues. Finally,  courses which prepare students for a professional security certification (e.g. CISSP, CISM) or  are accredited by national security bodies directly support the development of a career in  security. We reflect on these topics further below.  Assessing CyberHEAD data, only 34% of EU programmes envisage a compulsory internship for  students. While internships can be challenging to setup, the lack of internship opportunities may  negatively impact the skills of graduates, and also make it more difficult to attain a security job  given a lack of working experience. Internships are one of the top recommendations in the  Cybersecurity professionals report37 and the BHEF’s report on reducing the deficit in  Cybersecurity talent38. Another method of supporting engagement with industry is through the  use of educators and guest lecturers who are employed in the cybersecurity industry. This type  of interaction was present in 75% of the programmes, which is an impressive statistic (see  Figure 9). Although the data do not provide information on the extent to which these  professionals are engaged in these educational settings, it is encouraging to find this level of  collaboration between the HEIs and industry.  Figure 9: How programmes prepare students for the work environment  As it relates to professional certification, 23% of programmes in the database reported that they  prepare students for specific professional certifications. The top 7 certifications that were  mentioned are shown in Figure 10 and include: ISO 27001, CEH, CISM, CCNA Security,  CySA+, CISSP and CompTIA Security+. This low percentage appears to be reasonable  because, while certificates may be ideal to link the supply with the demand for cybersecurity  skills, educationalists may contend that HEIs should arguably be more concentrated on  foundational knowledge and skills. The certifications mentioned appear quite common,  37 ESG and ISSA, 2020, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020 https://www.esg- global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020  38 BHEF, 2020, Invest to Improve: The Cybersecurity Talent Deficit https://www.bhef.com/publications/invest-improve- cybersecurity-talent-deficit  Beyond  Cybersecurity  computing and  engineering  disciplines,  programmes also  focus on topics  such as  Organisational,  Risk Management,  Business,  Compliance  disciplines and  Law, Ethics,  Policy, Privacy and  Cybercrime.  https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.bhef.com/publications/invest-improve-cybersecurity-talent-deficit https://www.bhef.com/publications/invest-improve-cybersecurity-talent-deficit  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  18  especially ones such as CISSP, which are viewed as particularly coveted and conducive to  enhancing the chances of acquiring a job in cybersecurity39, 40, 41.  There are also several other certifications which are held by security professionals in industry.  These include Cisco Certified CyberOps, CCNP Security, CCSP, Certified Web Security  Professional and CISA42. Adapting such courses that prepare students for any of these wide  ranges of certificates as well may further increase their job prospects.  A noteworthy factor is their hands-on nature and the work experience that they require, which  may make them less suitable to be adopted in traditional HEI settings. One option could be for  certain HEI programmes to build on the technical knowledge necessary to obtain certificates  while also ensuring that an appropriate academic foundation is provided within their courses.  This would be especially important for HEIs, as the CISSP has been recognised as being  comparable to the RQF Level 7, which is the same level as an UK master degree43.  Figure 10: Top seven (7) certifications in CyberHEAD  2.3 AN ASSESSMENT OF ENROLMENTS AND GRADUATES AND THEIR  ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS FOR SKILLS  Another important question this report seeks to answer pertains to the demographic of  individuals undertaking HEI cybersecurity courses in the EU. Addressing this question would  provide some understanding of the number of graduates who could potentially enter the  cybersecurity workforce over the next 2-3 years, the gender balance within EU HEI programmes  (which also has further implications on the persons entering the workforce) and insights that  may be attained at the level of EU Member States.  Focusing first on current graduates, a total of 2,444 students graduated from the HEIs in 2020  according to CyberHEAD’s data. Of these, 1,940 were from master and other postgraduate  programmes, and 504 from bachelor programmes. Looking at the enrolment data present in the  database, 4,843 students entered their first year of studies in 2020. Of these, 3,415 were new  students at the master and postgraduate level and 1,428 at bachelor level (see Figure 11).  39 ESG and ISSA, 2020, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020 https://www.esg- global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020  40 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  41 ESG and ISSA, 2021, ESG Research Report: The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2021 https://www.esg- global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021  42 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  43 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² CISSP Certification Now Comparable to master’s degree Standard https://www.isc2.org/News-and- Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard  GRADUATES  PROJECTION  The number of  cybersecurity  graduates is going to  double in the next 2-  3 years.  https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.esg-global.com/research/esg-research-report-the-life-and-times-of-cybersecurity-professionals-2020 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.esg-global.com/esg-issa-research-report-2021 https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.isc2.org/News-and-Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard https://www.isc2.org/News-and-Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  19  The benefit of knowing the number of enrolments per year (in the database) is that one can  make a projection about the number of cybersecurity students who may enter the cybersecurity  workforce in the near future, taking into account some assumptions such as that enrolled  students successfully complete their studies and that the majority of students in these  programmes decide to pursue a cybersecurity career.  For instance, as master programmes are typically one-to-two years in duration, it may be  assumed that either in 2021 or 2022, the number of master and postgraduate graduates will be  76% more than in 2020. For bachelor programmes, which typically have a duration of 3 years,  the number of graduates who may enter the workforce in 2023 is almost triple with respect to  2020. Overall, based on the same assumptions, we can expect that the number of graduates in  cybersecurity will double in 2 or 3 years (i.e. when the first-year students complete their  academic studies). It should be noted that the increase in potential graduates can primarily be  linked to the introduction of new programmes, and not necessarily large rises in enrolment.  Figure 11: New enrolments and graduates in 2020  Gender balance is another important topic that should be examined as we investigate  cybersecurity education and the cybersecurity industry. As noted in existing research, gender  diversity in security roles can often be less representative than some national populations44.  From an analysis of CyberHEAD’s data, the percentage of female students graduating in 2020  with respect to the overall population was 18% (434). In the same year, only 20% (940) of  students enrolled were female (see Figure 12). These numbers are lower than what is reported  in studies that found that women represent 25% of the industry’s cybersecurity workforce45,  which again suggests that HEIs should aim to increase their enrolment numbers further.  The general underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics  (STEM) and in cybersecurity is a well-documented phenomenon46, but research has shown that this  issue is improving47. One of the primary suggestions to increase the representation of women in  cybersecurity is to encourage them to pursue STEM degrees in the first place. This could therefore  44 NCSC, 2020, Decrypting diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cyber security. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and- inclusion-in-cyber-security-report  45 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  46 (ISC)², 2018, Women in Cybersecurity. https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/ISC2-Women-in-Cybersecurity- Report.ashx  47 (ISC)², 2020, (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  CyberHEAD  shows an under-  representation of  women studying  cybersecurity.  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  20  be a perfect opportunity for EU courses to try to boost female enrolment, given the benefits this would  have on the larger security industry in the EU. To add to this, a more concrete suggestion that might  be explored is spotlighting women in cyber roles and recent female graduates, offering mentoring  opportunities for young students or by offering scholarships to female students. Each of these actions  may assist in increasing enrolments, which could later translate into graduates entering the EU  security workforce.  Figure 12: Students that graduated (left) and new students enrolled (right) in 2020 by gender  Graduates by Gender  New Students Enrolled by Gender  On the issue of gender diversity and the number of graduates at the country level, we can  observe in Figure 13 that there are only six countries with a rate of 20% or more of female  graduates (out of the total number of graduates) within their cybersecurity programmes, namely  Romania (50%), Latvia (47%), Bulgaria (42%), Lithuania (31%), France (20%) and Sweden  (20%).  Regarding enrolment’s numbers, Romania (48%), Latvia (42%), Estonia (30%), Hungary (27%),  Spain (24%), Finland (23%), Denmark (22%), Cyprus (22%), Greece (21%) and Germany  (20%) report the highest number of female enrolments48. This enrolment rate is above the 20%  average across the entire CyberHEAD database. Unfortunately, these statistics mean that,  overall, most HEI programmes in Europe have particularly low levels of gender diversity. The  nature of enrolment thus suggests that this issue could persist in the future EU workforce as  well and it can directly impact the workforces in the States identified49.  48 It should be noted that Romania, Estonia and Hungary only have one programme each in CyberHEAD and therefore this  may not be representative. Furthermore, the total number of programmes in CyberHEAD with at least one graduate in 2020  was 93 and the total number of programmes with complete enrolment data in 2020 was 121.  49 Readers should note that there were no records of graduates for 2020 generally for Denmark, Hungary and Norway in  CyberHEAD. Hence, these countries are absent from the graduate component of Figure 13.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  21  Figure 13: Female students graduated (top) and new female students enrolled (bottom) in 2020  per country  Female Students Graduated in 2020 - Percentage per Country  New Female Students Enrolled in 2020 - Percentage per Country  Going beyond these descriptive figures there is also a critical question as to whether the gender  balance in countries has improved or worsened. This can be examined to some extent by  reviewing the number of graduates in 2020 (viewed as a representation of the past) and the  enrolments in that year (a representation of the present situation, which also influences future  graduates), by combining the data used in Figure 13.  A total of twelve countries reported increases in female students on programmes when  comparing those graduating and those recently enrolled: Estonia (10% to 30%), Switzerland  (0% to 24%), Poland (0% to 15%), Cyprus (13% to 22%), Spain (18% to 24%), Finland (17% to  23%), Germany (14% to 20%), Greece (17% to 21%), Italy (15% to 19%), Austria (12% to 14%),  Ireland (9% to 10%) and Belgium (11% to 12%). This is a positive and encouraging finding.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  22  Nine countries, however, reported decreases in the percentage of females on average enrolled  across programmes: Bulgaria (42% to 18%), Lithuania (31% to 19%), Latvia (47% to 42%),  Portugal (13% to 9%), Romania (50% to 48%), Luxembourg (14% to 13%), France (20% to  19%), Netherlands (16% to 15%) and Sweden (20% to 19%). While these numbers are prone to  fluctuations from year-to-year, these countries and their HEIs should pay closer attention to  gender balance and act to actively reduce the gender gap.  At a more general level, it is also pertinent to reflect on how cybersecurity programmes, student  enrolments and the number of students graduating compare between countries. Although  CyberHEAD may not be, at this point in time, completely representative of EU cybersecurity  programmes, it is the largest database established thus far and therefore can still provide some  valuable insights.  The top six countries with the highest number of cybersecurity programmes by population are  Cyprus, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Austria and Finland respectively (Figure 14). As these  programme totals offer only a very high-level view, it is also prudent to assess the breakdown by  student enrolments and graduates.  Figure 14: Number of programmes by country per capita (based on 1-1-2021 Eurostat)  For enrolments by population, Cyprus again scores highly followed by Finland, Austria,  Lithuania and Estonia (Figure 15). Also, in examining graduates, there is a similar trend with  Cyprus, Finland, Estonia, Austria and Luxembourg leading. These rankings are undoubtedly  impacted by the smaller sizes of the populations of these countries as compared to larger  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  23  states. For instance, Cyprus has only 3 programmes, 128 students enrolled and 53 graduates,  yet it scores the highest – albeit its population being 896,005. Although the size of the country  affects the above figures, it is still encouraging to see the emphasis placed by HEIs in these  countries on developing their cybersecurity HEI programmes.  Figure 15: New students enrolled and graduates by population (in Million)  New Students Enrolled by Population  Graduates by Population  This concludes our analysis into the supply of cybersecurity qualifications and skills in the EU,  based on ENISA’s Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD).  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  24  3. INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THE  CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP IN THE EU  3.1 INTRODUCTION  In the context of the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap, actions around Europe have been  taken not only to increase the cybersecurity workforce but also to increase the quality of  candidates and equip them with the skills most requested by the industry.  Since 2010, the European Commission‘s Digital Agenda for Europe50 has highlighted the  challenge concerning the ‘lack of digital literacy and skills’ and that their enhancement would  promote employment in the overall ICT field (including security). Additionally, it has been noted  that the ‘ICT skills shortage’ needs to be addressed through coordination and a joint approach  by the EU Member States (MS). Similar goals were also included in the renewed Digital  Education Action Plan (2021-2027)51. Furthermore, to tackle the growing gap between  capacities and market needs caused by the fast evolution of technology, initiatives such as the  European Digital Skills and Jobs Platform52 – offering information and resources on digital skills  – were launched.  At the policy level, the NIS Directive53, published in July 2016, requires EU MSs to adopt a  national strategy for the security of network and information systems, also referred to as a  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS). By 2021, most of the EU MSs have included in their  NCSS at least one objective that aims to address the cybersecurity skills shortage.  The following section examines several policy initiatives that address the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap in Europe. The data used was collected via a questionnaire which was sent to  representatives of EU MSs at the end of March 2021. The information provided by the MSs was  supplemented by publicly available information. In April 2021, 13 out of 27 EU MSs54 provided  information on their cybersecurity workforce initiatives; these are included in full in Annex C. We  have to note that this section does not seek to list all the initiatives working towards alleviating  the problem. Instead, it explores a sample of such initiatives to gain an understanding of the  state of such efforts across the EU.  The analysis below will follow ENISA’s National Capabilities Assessment Framework (NCAF)55,  more specifically the strategic objectives under ‘Cluster 2 - Capacity-building and awareness’.  Within this cluster, we made use of three strategic objectives in order to classify the initiatives of  Member States to mitigate the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap:   Raise user awareness amongst the general public, as well as primary and  secondary education – Identify gaps in cybersecurity knowledge and address them  50 A Digital Agenda For Europe (2010) COM(2010)245 final. https://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF  51 European Commission (2021) Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027) https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the- eu/digital-education-action-plan_en  52 European Commission (2021) Digital Skills and Jobs Platform, https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/about/digital-skills- and-jobs-platform  53 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive  54 The approaches taken by Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania,  Malta, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain will be examined.  55 ENISA National Capabilities Assessment Framework (2020) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national- capabilities-assessment-framework  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:0245:FIN:EN:PDF https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en https://ec.europa.eu/education/education-in-the-eu/digital-education-action-plan_en https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/about/digital-skills-and-jobs-platform https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/about/digital-skills-and-jobs-platform https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/nis-directive https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/national-capabilities-assessment-framework  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  25  by raising awareness or by developing or strengthening basic knowledge. Related  initiatives should target the general public as well as primary and secondary school  students and teachers.   Strengthen training and promote cybersecurity in higher education – Enhance  the operational capabilities of the existing cybersecurity workforce, encourage  university students to join the cybersecurity field and equip them with the appropriate  knowledge bases, foster collaboration in cybersecurity between academia and industry  and align cybersecurity training with business needs.   Organise cybersecurity exercises and challenges – Identify the skills that need to  be assessed, set up a national cyber exercise planning team, integrate cyber exercises  within the lifecycle of the national cybersecurity strategy or the national cyber  contingency plan. Deploy cyber-ranges that allow individuals to advance their skills in  cybersecurity inside controlled environments. Identify young talent and promote  cybersecurity by organising competitions.  Annex D lists an analysis of some of the initiatives conducted outside the EU.  3.2 RAISE USER AWARENESS AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND  IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION  Most of the initiatives to fill gaps in cybersecurity knowledge have involved awareness-raising  events and the inclusion of digital skills (including information security) in primary and secondary  education. These initiatives have aimed to not only to improve cyber capabilities in the younger  generation but also to promote cybersecurity and motivate students to study cybersecurity and  to seek a career in this sector. In many cases, cybersecurity skills and competencies have been  introduced as part of broader digital literacy programmes. Below we present the most relevant  initiatives.  CZECH REPUBLIC  The NCSS (2021-2025)56 of the Czech Republic dedicates an entire section to cybersecurity  ‘Education and Awareness’, stressing the need to develop cybersecurity skills and educate the  population (especially high-risk groups). Cybersecurity education starts in pre-school and aims  to teach the safe use of digital technologies.  To this end, the Czech Republic’s National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB)57  seeks to ensure that building relevant cybersecurity skills is a goal at the primary and secondary  school levels. The revision of the educational plan is currently underway and NÚKIB is aiming to  ensure that relevant cybersecurity skills are implemented at these levels of education.  The Czech NCSS also includes goals related to ’Expanding the Qualified Base’ of cybersecurity  and the need to create and maintain a qualified cybersecurity workforce. There are two ways it  seeks to achieve this: firstly, by promoting awareness-raising programmes and creating the  appropriate working conditions that encourage talented people to study and pursue a career in  cybersecurity; secondly, by improving the ability of organisations to hire and retain cybersecurity  professionals using inducements such as the provision of opportunities for career growth,  attractive salaries and healthy work cultures and environments.  Furthermore, NÚKIB offers internships to university students in various cybersecurity areas,  while it also organises an annual conference called CyberCon58, which is open to the public and  focuses on students and education. Moreover, NÚKIB also hosts various public panel  56 National Cybersecurity Strategy of the Czech Republic 2021-2025,  https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf  57 NÚKIB, https://www.nukib.cz  58 CyberCon, https://www.cybercon.cz/  https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf https://www.nukib.cz/ https://www.cybercon.cz/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  26  discussions and workshops centred around the topics of cybersecurity (often targeting children,  the elderly, parents, and/or teachers), which include cybersecurity courses for the public59.  DENMARK  The Danish National Cyber and Information Security Strategy (2018)60 has launched two  cybersecurity awareness programmes under the ‘Better competencies initiatives’: 1) an initiative  called the ‘Digital judgment and digital competencies acquired via the educational system’ which  focuses on raising awareness of security challenges and developing cybersecurity teaching  resources targeting young children, students and teachers; and 2) an initiative called ‘Improved  awareness drives aimed at citizens and businesses’ which targets specific groups of citizens  and businesses to address their cybersecurity challenges.  Moreover, the Danish government has organised awareness campaigns and disseminated  educational materials via the ‘sikkerdigital.dk’61 information portal, hosted by the Danish Agency  for Digitisation (an agency of the Ministry of Finance) and the Danish Business Authority.  Through this portal, citizens, companies and authorities can access cybersecurity related  knowledge, guidance and tools, which can be used to improve online security. The main  purpose of the portal is to strengthen competencies in the field of cybersecurity in both the  public and private sectors, to raise awareness of cyberthreats and to continuously improve  knowledge on how they can be safely mitigated.  Moreover, the Danish government has developed and supported a number of cybersecurity  educational programmes and academic curricula to be taught at the primary and secondary  education levels. Additionally, Denmark’s digital learning portal (EMU)62,63 was established in  order to provide educational material on digital education, cybersecurity and more broadly in  ICT. It is currently being evaluated in Danish primary schools. Furthermore, the Ministry of  Children and Education has also developed a large quantity of educational material the focuses  on helping educators teach data protection and information security.  GREECE  Greece, in its latest NCSS (2020-2025)64, puts special emphasis on capacity building, in  particular the development of cybersecurity skills. On raising awareness, the strategy foresees  the creation of an Education and Awareness Action Plan. Moreover, the strategy highlights the  special emphasis that will be given to the creation of appropriate incentives for the younger  generation in order to acquainted them with cybersecurity and induce them to consider it as a  subject of study or specialisation.  IRELAND  In its most recent NCSS (2019-2024)65, Ireland placed a special focus on cybersecurity skills.  Among other measures, the strategy plans the promotion of cybersecurity as a career option,  through the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) with its Smart Futures Programme, targeting  schools and colleges66. Moreover, the strategy foresees the support of the development of a  junior cycle short course in cybersecurity. To this end, the Irish National Cyber Security Centre  (NCSC)67, in collaboration with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications,  is involved in the development of a curriculum for short cybersecurity courses targeting  59 NÚKIB, https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/  60 National Cyber and Information Security Strategy (2018),  https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf  61 Sikkerdigital.dk, https://sikkerdigital.dk/  62 EMU Denmark's learning portal, https://emu.dk  63 Ministry of Children and Education.

Furthermore, the strategy also aims to support initiatives which encourage  women to join the cybersecurity field, such as the ‘Cyber Women Ireland’ initiative.  LATVIA  The latest Latvian NCSS (2019-2022)68 had an area dedicated to ‘public awareness, education  and research’, among other topics. In particular, the strategy’s action plan includes the following  initiatives in awareness:   raising awareness about information security among students and teachers,   improving public awareness of online safety, and   developing and implementing annual multi-agency action and campaign plans with  cybersecurity information events and awareness raising campaigns.  LITHUANIA  Lithuania’s NCSS (2018) acknowledges the cybersecurity skills shortage problem, stating that  the needs of the Lithuanian labour market are currently not being met by the supply of those  skills. Nevertheless, the strategy observes that cybersecurity courses are available for civil  servants in order to improve their cybersecurity skills and, based on statistics related to the  number of participants, attendance by civil servants is growing each year. The strategy also  states that in order to improve the country’s cybersecurity culture, fundamental cybersecurity  knowledge should be provided at all educational levels.  MALTA  One of the goals of the Maltese NCSS (2016)69 is to establish a specialist cybersecurity  educational curriculum and to integrate the digital education of its citizens into primary schools.  THE NETHERLANDS  One of the actions taken by the Dutch National Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA)70 on the issue of  cybersecurity knowledge and awareness was to include ‘Digital Literacy’ in the curriculum at the  primary and secondary education levels. Moreover, the policy documents also encourage the  business community and civil society organisations to advance further the digital skills of  employees and citizens. Furthermore, Kennisnet71, a public organisation which was funded by  the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, supports the use of ICT in schools, providing  educational content, strategic advice and expertise in the broader field of ICT.  SLOVENIA  The Slovenian NCSS (2016)72 sets two awareness related measures to improve citizens’ safety  in cyberspace. Firstly, it sets up the regular implementation of awareness-raising programmes  on cybersecurity; secondly, it adds cybersecurity content to education and training programmes.  SPAIN  Through Digital Spain 202573 ‘Line 3 - Digital Skills’, Spain promotes of basic digital skills to the  public in order to increase confidence in conducting online activities responsibly. The plan aims  to equip both students and workers with the advanced digital skills required in the workplace  and for everyday use, to promote digital careers and reduce the gender gap in digital skills.  68 Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia, Cyber Security Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022,  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022  69 Maltese Cybersecurity Strategy (2016), https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security- Strategy-Book.pdf  70 Dutch National Cybersecurity Agenda (2018) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf  71 Kennisnet, https://www.kennisnet.nl/about-us/  72 Slovenian National Cybersecurity Strategy (2016)  https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf  73 Spain Digital 2025, https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/ministerio/estrategias/Pages/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022 https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security-Strategy-Book.pdf https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mita-_Malta-Cyber-Security-Strategy-Book.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf https://www.kennisnet.nl/about-us/ https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf https://portal.mineco.gob.es/en-us/ministerio/estrategias/Pages/00_Espana_Digital_2025.aspx  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  28  Another measure concerns the identification and development of cybersecurity talent in order to  address the overall shortage of skills.  Furthermore, the National Plan for Digital Skills of Spain (2021)74 provides 3.75 billion euro to  promote public reforms and investments in fields such as digital inclusion (including reducing  the digital gap between men and women), the digitalisation of education and the acquisition of  digital skills by both unemployed and employed workers.  The Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) has also launched ‘Despega’75, a  programme which aims to promote the presence of women in cybersecurity. Although the goal  of the initiative is to improve the gender balance, it also seeks to improve the shortage in skills  by raising awareness, attracting talent, boosting training, visibility, entrepreneurship and the  employability of women. In the same context, the first national section of ECSO's  Women4Cyber76 programme has recently been founded in Spain. This programme is aligned  with other initiatives at the European level and it is reaching agreements with different entities  (both public and private) seeking to promote the presence of women in this area.  3.3 STRENGTHEN TRAINING AND PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY IN  HIGHER EDUCATION  Initiatives that aim to build up cybersecurity training and higher educational programmes are of  great importance when it comes to mitigating the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap as they  improve the operational capabilities of the existing cybersecurity workforce, encourage students  to pursue cybersecurity topics and promote and foster relations between academia and the  industry, as well as aligning cybersecurity training with the actual needs of industry. In what  follows, we present some key initiatives.  CZECH REPUBLIC  The Czech Republic’s Action Plan77 is a policy document that traditionally complements the  NCSS. It was approved by the government in July 2021 and the following three focus areas in  relation to cybersecurity skills are listed:  1. Quality education system,  2. Outreach and education, and  3. Vocational education and expanding the qualified base.  The above three areas specify 23 tasks that are expected to have a positive impact on the  development of cybersecurity skills. These tasks deal with the definition and implementation of  standards in cybersecurity skills into general and vocational education, training, conferences,  workshops and other activities. NÚKIB is responsible for most of these tasks and cooperates  with several other entities (e.g. the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports) to fulfil them.  DENMARK  In Denmark, in order to have sufficiently skilled personnel to detect and handle cyber-attacks,  the Centre for Cybersecurity (CFCS)78 has created its own Cyber Academy.  With regards to higher education, a number of HEIs have organised two-day seminars in  cybersecurity supported by CFCS. The lectures and practical exercises included topics such as  74 Spain - National Plan for Digital Skills, https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/actions/national-initiatives/national- strategies/spain-national-plan-digital-skills  75 INCIBE-CERT, INCIBE reivindica el impulso de la mujer en ciberseguridad con el programa ‘Despega’ (March 2021),  https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/incibe-reivindica-el-impulso-mujer-ciberseguridad-el-programa-despega  76 https://www.women4cyberspain.es/  77 National Cybersecurity Strategy of the Czech Republic 2021-2025,  https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf  78 Centre for Cybersecurity, https://cfcs.dk/en/  https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/actions/national-initiatives/national-strategies/spain-national-plan-digital-skills https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/actions/national-initiatives/national-strategies/spain-national-plan-digital-skills https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/incibe-reivindica-el-impulso-mujer-ciberseguridad-el-programa-despega https://www.women4cyberspain.es/ https://nukib.cz/download/publikace/strategie_akcni_plany/narodni_strategie_kb_2020-2025_%20cr.pdf https://cfcs.dk/en/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  29  threat analysis, avoidance and mitigation (both at the technical and business level), as well as  data security management (authentication, confidentiality, integrity, privacy, etc.). Moreover,  summer schools have been launched focusing on cybersecurity and building cyber skills.  In August 2019, several HEIs conducted a Summer School in Cybersecurity supported by  CFCS79. The Summer School included classes on basic security and network principles,  software development and practices in IT operations (DevOps) and security, data carving in  forensics, and network security exercises. The Summer school was repeated in 202080.  GERMANY  In Germany, course offerings, in particular in computer science and IT security, will be  expanded by establishing additional university professorships and by supporting leading  institutions. Additionally, cooperation with private industry will be supported through, for  example, funds channelled by foundations and externally funded teaching and research posts.  HUNGARY  In Hungary, the development of cybersecurity skills is an integral part of the new Cybersecurity  Strategy that was adopted in 201881. It is now mandatory for Chief Information Security Officers  (CISOs) in the public service to attend two semesters of postgraduate cybersecurity training at  the National University of Public Service82. Moreover, a 10-week cybersecurity internship is  mandatory for those enrolled in master programmes at the National University of Public  Service83.  In Hungary, one can also find WITSEC (Women in IT Security), the association of women  working in the field of IT security, which was founded in 2014 and whose main aim is to provide  mentorship, development of IT skills and security skills among youngsters, especially girls84.  IRELAND  Ireland continues its efforts to address the skills gap in cybersecurity by implementing the  measures mentioned in its latest NCSS (2019-2024)85. The strategy recognises the need not  only to train new personnel but also to upskill professionals in ICT and other related sectors.  The strategy also notes that, in spite of last year’s efforts in addressing the cybersecurity skills  shortage and gap, there exists a time lag between academia and industry. Thus, there is an  urgent need to create a pipeline of graduate students with the appropriate cybersecurity skills.  Additionally, another measure is to provide support to initiatives under the Technology Skills  2022 Initiative, including the development of Skillnet and ICT apprenticeship programmes.  The Skillnet86 agency is a supporting agency working in the area of workforce development with  the aim of increasing the competitiveness, productivity and innovation of Irish businesses. To  improve skills in the ICT sector, cybersecurity skills87 are also taken into account through the  organisation of training programmes. Furthermore, the Cyber Skills project, which received an  8.1 million euro investment, is aiming to provide pathways and micro-credentials in order to  tackle the cybersecurity skills shortage.  79 Centre for Cybersecurity, News, Summer School in Cybersecurity, https://cfcs.dk/da/nyheder/2019/sommerskole-i- cybersikkerhed/  80 Cybersecurity Summer School (2020) https://www.tilmeld.dk/cybersec20/conference  81 Hungarian Cybersecurity Strategy (2018) https://2015- 2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre- 20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse  82 Act on the Electronic Information Security of Central and Local Government Agencies (2013)  https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=a1300050.tv  83 National University of Public Service, https://en.uni-nke.hu/research/eotvos-jozsef-research-centre/institute-of-cyber- security  84 WITSEC, https://www.witsec.hu/en/content/about-us  85 Irish National Cybersecurity Strategy, https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf  86 Skillnet Ireland , https://www.skillnetireland.ie/  87 ICT Skillnet Ireland, Cybersecurity Skills, https://www.ictskillnet.ie/cyber-security-skills/  https://cfcs.dk/da/nyheder/2019/sommerskole-i-cybersikkerhed/ https://cfcs.dk/da/nyheder/2019/sommerskole-i-cybersikkerhed/ https://www.tilmeld.dk/cybersec20/conference https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/Strat%C3%A9gia%20honlapon%20k%C3%B6zz%C3%A9t%C3%A9telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf#!DocumentBrowse https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=a1300050.tv https://en.uni-nke.hu/research/eotvos-jozsef-research-centre/institute-of-cyber-security https://en.uni-nke.hu/research/eotvos-jozsef-research-centre/institute-of-cyber-security https://www.witsec.hu/en/content/about-us https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.skillnetireland.ie/ https://www.ictskillnet.ie/cyber-security-skills/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  30  LATVIA  The latest Latvian NCSS (2019-2022)88 has ‘public awareness, education and research’ among  its main focuses. In particular, the strategy’s plan includes tasks such as:   Delivering advanced cybersecurity training for specific target groups, and   Upskilling digital competencies in the public sector and among government employees  as well as promoting good ICT safety practices.  Furthermore, a legal framework in the area of cybersecurity has been established, the ‘Law on  the Security of Information Technologies’89, which has important implications for cybersecurity  education also. In fact, the Cabinet Regulation No.442 on ‘Procedures for the Ensuring  Conformity of Information and Communication Technologies Systems to Minimum Security  Requirements’ (adopted July 28, 2015) serves as a guideline for educational institutions when  creating and adopting educational curricula90.  LITHUANIA  Lithuania’s NCSS (2018) identifies the need to study its own shortage problem in cybersecurity  skills firstly at national level. Furthermore, the strategy sets as an objective the development of  creativity, advanced capabilities and cybersecurity skills at a level of competence that is capable  of meeting market needs. Based on the strategy, this objective could be achieved by improving  cybersecurity competencies, developing training systems that are oriented towards market  needs that provide accreditation and certification, and are suitable training environments.  MALTA  In Malta, the ‘B SECURE’ scheme91, which was launched at the Malta Cybersecurity Summit in  2019, offers training courses for both executives and industry professionals. Moreover, CSIRT  Malta offers cybersecurity training to its constituents.  THE NETHERLANDS  In the Netherlands, the National Cybersecurity Agenda (NCSA)92 recognises that the next  important step towards addressing the skills shortage problem is an analysis identifying gaps  between higher education curricula (the supply) and industry requirements (the demand) in the  creation of well-trained personnel.  SPAIN  The 2019 Spanish NCSS93 has the goal of promoting a ‘culture and commitment to  cybersecurity and empowerment of human and technological capabilities’. This goal points out  the need to acquire technical and human resources and adopt training in the appropriate skills  to use cyberspace more securely. To achieve this goal, it encourages the strengthening of the  cybersecurity industry and its ability to generate and retain talent. In particular, measures 5 to 8  of the strategy are associated with the identification of the skills needed by industry, the  promotion of training and the retention of cybersecurity talent.  88 Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia, Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022,  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022  89 Legal Acts Of The Republic Of Latvia (2010) Law on the Security of Information Technologies.  https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/220962  90 Republic of Latvia, Cabinet Regulation No. 442 (28 July 2015) Procedures for the Ensuring Conformity of Information and  Communication Technologies Systems to Minimum Security Requirements. http://ncsi.ega.ee/app/uploads/2017/04/Cab.- Reg.-No.-442-Ensuring-Conformity-of-Information.docx  91 B SECURE Scheme, https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/bsecure/  92 Dutch National Cybersecurity Agenda (2018) https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf  93 Spanish National Security Council, (2019) National Cybersecurity Strategy, https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/about- us/spanish-cybersecurity-strategy-2013.html  https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/news/latvia-approves-new-cyber-security-strategy-2019-2022 https://likumi.lv/ta/en/en/id/220962 http://ncsi.ega.ee/app/uploads/2017/04/Cab.-Reg.-No.-442-Ensuring-Conformity-of-Information.docx http://ncsi.ega.ee/app/uploads/2017/04/Cab.-Reg.-No.-442-Ensuring-Conformity-of-Information.docx https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/bsecure/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/member-states/CSAgenda_EN.pdf https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/about-us/spanish-cybersecurity-strategy-2013.html https://www.ccn-cert.cni.es/en/about-us/spanish-cybersecurity-strategy-2013.html  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  31  Besides university degrees in the field of cybersecurity, Spain also has vocational training  programmes. These have three levels (basic, intermediate and advanced), with the advanced  level being recognised as preparing students to the same level as a university master’s degree.  As a first step in the development of such specialised cybersecurity courses, two basic  courses94,95 will be delivered for the first time in the 2021-22 academic year. The Spanish  National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) was involved in the Working Group that developed the  syllabus for these courses and is collaborating with the Spanish Ministry of Education and  Vocational Training96 to train the professionals who will teach these courses in partnership with  the School of Industrial Organisation (EOI).  Moreover, INCIBE is working on the establishment of training paths with the intention to cover  the competencies needed for the cybersecurity profiles that are most in demand in the country.  3.4 ORGANISE CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES AND CHALLENGES  Other important initiatives are those that aim to test the skills of cybersecurity professionals and  the readiness of cybersecurity teams. Cybersecurity exercises are an increasingly popular  activity for assessing the efficiency, preparedness and ability of security teams and systems in  solving a security crisis. On the other hand, cybersecurity challenges complement exercises by  focusing on attracting the interest of young talent in ‘Capture-the-flag’ or other attack/defence  types of cybersecurity games.  At the EU level, ENISA is in charge of coordinating a pan-European series of exercises called  Cyber Europe97. This programme consists of EU-level cyber incident and crisis management  exercises for both the public and private sectors from the EU and EFTA Member States. The  exercises, which have been organised every two years since 2010, are simulations of large-  scale cybersecurity incidents that can escalate into cyber crises. In addition, the Cyber Exercise  Platform (CEP) managed by ENISA supports the management of complex exercises such as  virtual exercise ‘playgrounds’ with high-end technical challenges by bringing together experts of  the incident development community. In addition, ENISA offers training and research related to  cybersecurity exercises in the form of guidelines on exercise planning98, a global survey of  exercises99 and incidents research100, and has also contributed to the French National  Cybersecurity Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) guide on cyber  exercises101.  The EU also engages and supports cybersecurity exercises outside the EU. For instance, in  May 2021, EU CyberNet participated in the first national cyber exercise of the Dominican  Republic ‘Cyber llamas102. In the same month, a cybersecurity simulation exercise took place in  Kyiv (Ukraine) with state cybersecurity officials, organised by the EU4DigitalUA project.103  94 Course of Specialisation in Cybersecurity in Information Technology Environments, Royal Decree 479/2020,  https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rd/2020/04/07/479  95 Specialisation Course in Cybersecurity in Operational Technology Environments, Royal Decree 478/2020,  https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962  96 Spanish Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (2021), https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A- 2021-3904.pdf  97 ENISA, Cyber Europe Programme, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme  98 ENISA, Guidelines on exercise planning, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/cyber_exercises  99 ENISA, National and International Cybersecurity Exercises: Survey, Analysis & Recommendations,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/exercise-survey2012  100 ENISA, Incidents research, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/login?came_from=/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/research  101 ENISA, Organising A Cyber Crisis Management Exercise, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber- exercises/trainings/20210906_np_anssi_guide_exercice_crise_en_v4.pdf  102 EU Cybernet, EU CyberNet work in Dominican Republic, first national cybersecurity exercise ‘Cyber llamas’,  https://www.eucybernet.eu/news/  103 EU4Digital, EU helps Ukraine strengthen its cybersecurity, https://eufordigital.eu/eu-helps-ukraine-strengthen-its- cybersecurity/  https://www.boe.es/eli/es/rd/2020/04/07/479 https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962 https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/cyber-europe-programme https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/cyber_exercises https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/exercise-survey2012 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/login?came_from=/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/research https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/20210906_np_anssi_guide_exercice_crise_en_v4.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises/trainings/20210906_np_anssi_guide_exercice_crise_en_v4.pdf https://www.eucybernet.eu/news/ https://eufordigital.eu/eu-helps-ukraine-strengthen-its-cybersecurity/ https://eufordigital.eu/eu-helps-ukraine-strengthen-its-cybersecurity/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  32  One of the most popular and well-received cybersecurity challenges for youth is the European  Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC). The ECSC initiative has sparked a number of national  initiatives worldwide that focus on identifying young cybersecurity talent and training them to  attend national cybersecurity skills challenges supported by national agencies. The popularity of  the ECSC has grown exponentially in recent years. The first edition of the ECSC took place in  Austria in 2014, where 30 participants from only three national teams attended. In the latest  iteration in 2021 hosted in Prague, 19 national teams and 169 contestants104 participated in a  two-day long skills challenge featuring tasks from various cybersecurity knowledge areas.  CYPRUS  In its latest NCSS (2020)105, Cyprus acknowledges the benefits of cyber crisis simulation  exercises. These can improve national capabilities in the field by testing the communication  systems for crisis management and enhancing the efficacy of incident handling. For this reason,  the strategy includes the planning and organisation of regular national cybersecurity exercises  based on realistic scenarios as well as active participation in Pan-European and other  international exercises.  CZECH REPUBLIC  In the Czech Republic, the NCSS sets, as an objective, the sharing of knowledge and expertise  which is acquired by the NÚKIB in cybersecurity exercises, training and other activities. As a  result, NÚKIB regularly organises technical and non-technical cybersecurity exercises106 for  various partners with the aim of strengthening their cybersecurity skills and resilience. In  addition, the agency supports cybersecurity competitions, such as the European Cybersecurity  Challenge (ECSC). To track such initiatives (such as cybersecurity courses, exercises, etc.) the  number of participating users is monitored.  IRELAND  In Ireland, the Discover Programme of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) is funding the ‘Cyber  Academy’ project107, a summer bootcamp initiative for young people from 15-18 years old. The  initiative includes exploration of general and technical cybersecurity topics, career talks with  cybersecurity professionals and the National Cyber Schools Challenge (NCSC).  SPAIN  In Spain, since 2014 INCIBE has been organising CyberCamp108, an event which mainly aims  to identify career paths for students and to broaden technical knowledge, as well as to awaken  and promote talent in cybersecurity through technical competitions. Two competitions are  organised during the camp, one for individuals and the other team-based (CyberOlympics109).  The competition for individuals also has the purpose of selecting the Spanish team attending  ENISA’s annual ECSC. The team competition is aimed at secondary school and vocational  training students, and it is the first step before moving on to the competition for individuals. Thus  far, the design of the tests and challenges of these competitions have not been based on any  specific criteria or definition of competencies. However, the intention is to adapt them to the  competencies and profiles needed by the Spanish cybersecurity industry.  There are additional Spanish competitions developed by different organisations and entities that  seek to boost the interest of the younger generation in dedicating themselves professionally to  104 ENISA, European Cybersecurity Challenge 2021, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/winner-of-the-european- cybersecurity-challenge  105 Cyprus NCSS, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security- strategies-interactive-map?selected=Cyprus  106 NÚKIB exercises https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/exercises/  107 Cyber Security Academy, https://cyberireland.ie/ireland-cyber-security-academy-cyber-crime/  108 CyberCamp, https://cybercamp.es/  109 CyberOlympics, https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/cyberolympics  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/winner-of-the-european-cybersecurity-challenge https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/winner-of-the-european-cybersecurity-challenge https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Cyprus https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/national-cyber-security-strategies-interactive-map?selected=Cyprus https://www.nukib.cz/en/cyber-security/exercises/ https://cyberireland.ie/ireland-cyber-security-academy-cyber-crime/ https://cybercamp.es/ https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/cyberolympics  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  33  cybersecurity. Some of these competitions were established nationally over the last year by  public bodies, such as:   National League of challenges in Cyberspace110 organised by the Spanish Civil Guard,  and   CyberWallChallenge111 organised by the Spanish National Police as part of its  CyberWallAcademy training action.  GREECE  The latest Greek NCSS (2020-2025)112 focuses on capacity building, including organising  national cybersecurity exercises in cooperation with national and European agencies. In this  regard, a series of flagship activities to develop preparedness and the operational skills of  participating organisations have been implemented in the form of responses to simulated  cybersecurity incidents (supervised by the National Cybersecurity Authority), made possible by  the development and use of cyber range platforms. Greece has also been participating in the  ECSC consistently since 2017.  SLOVENIA  In 2021, Slovenia participated in the ECSC for the first time in order to develop cybersecurity  skills among its youth and to nudge students into acquiring such skills. The plan is to continue to  regularly attend and participate in the ECSC in the future.

SUMMARY AND  RECOMMENDATIONS  This section provides recommendations and key insights based on the analyses presented in  this report.  Section 2 began this research and reported on the status of cybersecurity programmes at  higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the EU and EFTA countries. It focused on the supply of  cybersecurity qualifications and skills by analysing the characteristics of the 126 programmes in  ENISA’s CyberHEAD database. It also provided an assessment of the number of new students  studying cybersecurity as well as the number of graduates both at the level of the EU and of  individual Member States.  Section 3 examined the different approaches adopted by EU Member States to address the  cybersecurity workforce skills shortage and gap by analysing initiatives regarding cybersecurity  awareness, training, challenges and exercises.  In order to better understand the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap and plan a coherent  strategy to mitigate these problems, our analysis recommends an approach based on five key  features:   Increasing enrolments and eventually graduates in cybersecurity programmes  through:  o the diversification of the HEIs curricula in terms of content, levels and  language;  o the provision of scholarships, especially for underrepresented groups, and  more active efforts to promote cybersecurity as a diverse field.   Supporting a unified approach across government, industry and HEIs through:  o the adoption of a common framework regarding cybersecurity roles,  competencies, skills and knowledge such as, for example, the framework  provided by the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework;  o the promotion of cybersecurity skill-building challenges and competitions.   Increasing collaborations between Member States (MSs) in:  o launching European cybersecurity initiatives with shared objectives;  o sharing of the outputs of programmes (including results and lessons learnt).   Promoting analysis of the needs of the cybersecurity market and related trends  through:  o the identification of metrics showing the extent of the problem and possible  measures to cope with it.   Supporting the use and promotion of CyberHEAD (and its further evolution) in order  to:  o facilitate an ongoing understanding of the status of cybersecurity higher  education programmes in the EU;  o monitor trends regarding the number of cybersecurity graduates who could  potentially fill current vacancies in the sector;  o support the analysis of demographics (including the diversity) of new  cybersecurity students and graduates;  o assist in monitoring the effectiveness of cybersecurity initiatives targeting the  supply side (e.g. changes in enrolments in HEI programmes after the release  of new cybersecurity initiatives);  o demonstrate the value of CyberHEAD for HEIs as well as incentivise HEIs to  submit their programmes to CyberHEAD.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  35  In the next sections, we detail and outline the context for these recommendations. Here we note  that this report’s analysis and its recommendations focus on addressing the EU’s cybersecurity  skills shortage and gap through the higher education sector, and therefore vocational or lower  forms of education are not considered.  4.1 INCREASE ENROLMENT IN CYBERSECURITY PROGRAMMES  A wider selection and greater diversity of cybersecurity programmes in HEIs should be provided  to increase enrolments and eventually graduates who may than enter the cybersecurity  workforce. The lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals can only be addressed through an  increase in the pipeline of individuals with the appropriate skills to tackle emerging cybersecurity  threats. Therefore, the report recommends further analysis of the following:  The range of skills required needs to be reflected in the curricula in terms of content and  levels. For instance, in the CyberHEAD database it was found that there were surprisingly few  non-technical topics covered especially at the master and postgraduate levels. While technical  skills are clearly in high demand, knowledge and skills in social science (e.g. from  Organisational, Risk management, Business and Compliance disciplines, to Law, Ethics, Policy,  Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines) are increasingly important. These skills and other soft skills  (e.g. management, communication, etc.)113 are considered particularly crucial in the industry.  An increase in the topics covered by programmes would allow students to be able to choose  from courses that specialise in programmes which combine a technical curriculum with some  organisational and policy aspects, or a non-technical (e.g. business-oriented programme)  curriculum with fewer technical aspects. In both cases this could still help to address key gaps in  industry. As the topic diversity of programmes is expanded, this should also be represented in  the prerequisites to entry. That is, if a programme is concentrating on more technical topics, it  should require some level of a technical background (e.g. a bachelor’s degree in engineering or  computing or a professional certification), but if it is concentrating on Law, Ethics, Policy,  Privacy and Cybercrime disciplines, the requirements should be relaxed and replaced with more  suitable criteria.  The levels at which programmes are available can play a primary role in increasing enrolment  and subsequently graduates. Currently, bachelor programmes are only minimally represented in  the CyberHEAD dataset. While the dataset may not be entirely representative, it is widely  known that bachelors in cybersecurity are rarer than master programmes. Nonetheless,  increasing the number and variety of bachelors by including a noteworthy cybersecurity  component would be advantageous for multiple reasons.  Firstly, such programmes have much larger cohorts (the maximum yearly cohort size for  bachelor programmes in CyberHEAD is 117 on average while it is only 55 for master  programmes) and could therefore contribute significantly to increasing the talent pool. Secondly,  considering that cybersecurity is becoming a more established profession114,115,116,117,118,  students may wish to have an opportunity to select a cybersecurity-focused initial degree  instead of waiting to specialise at the graduate level.  The accessibility and openness of programmes should also be considered, with a focus  on language and delivery methods (i.e. online, classroom or blended). As found in this  report, online programmes are less available than on-site courses.

Launching more blended and online degree options may also  result in a rise in enrolment. Additionally, though language is contentious as there is no one  shared language in the EU, if courses were offered in multiple languages (or a few widely  spoken languages), student uptake could increase at both bachelor’s and master’s degree  levels.  More scholarships should be made available and more active efforts focused on diversity in  order to increase enrolments and the graduate pool of cybersecurity students, since, based on  CyberHEAD’s data, 71% of programmes charge students tuition fees. In particular, scholarships for  underrepresented groups (such as women, ethnic and other minorities) might be beneficial and could  potentially help recruitment. These would have to be advertised and targeted properly as research  has found that such groups (especially women) are often not aware of opportunities in the  cybersecurity field119. To add to this, women and minority groups from cyber roles (or those that are  recent cyber graduates) should be spotlighted to highlight this career or study pathway as an  opportunity for prospective students from underrepresented groups. Each of these actions might  assist in increasing enrolments, which could later result in graduates entering the EU security  workforce. Funding for these activities and for scholarships is an area where government and  industry can assist to ensure that university fees are not a significant inhibitor to the development of  national and regional cybersecurity workforces.  4.2 SUPPORT A UNIFIED APPROACH ACROSS GOVERNMENT,  INDUSTRY AND UNIVERSITIES  The skills shortage and gap can only be addressed through a joint effort among key  stakeholders. Thus, a more concerted effort between government, industry and HEIs is needed  to produce more cybersecurity graduates, particularly those with skills that can meet market  requirements. To this end, this report makes the following recommendations:  Support the development and adoption of a common language regarding cybersecurity  roles, competencies, skills and knowledge, for example the one provided by the  European Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF). In this context, ENISA launched an Ad  Hoc Working Group on the European Cybersecurity Skills Framework in December 2020. A  multi-disciplinary group of experts was brought together with the aim of promoting  harmonisation of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development concepts and  tools. In July 2021, the Ad Hoc Working Group completed the first draft of the European  Cybersecurity Skills Framework (ECSF), producing a user manual which will be released  imminently with the goal of making the implementation of the framework easier. The user  manual will use several examples to explain how the framework can be implemented in different  European organisations. The ECSF, if successful in achieving its objective, will be an invaluable  instrument for supporting the design of cybersecurity related training programmes in the area of  skills and career development; as well as supporting employment in cybersecurity120.  Support Cybersecurity Challenges. ENISA organises the European Cyber Security  Competition (ECSC)121 which – along with the national cybersecurity skill-building competitions  across Europe – provides excellent training and exposure for younger individuals interested in  the sector. Cybersecurity companies and public organisations also use these skill challenges to  identify, attract and recruit cybersecurity talent. Moreover, they are likely to increase interest in a  cybersecurity career and be effective in creating a network of young cybersecurity specialists122.  119 DCMS, 2019, Identifying the Role of Further and Higher Education in Cybersecurity Skills Development,  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767425/The_role_of_FE _and_HE_in_cyber_security_skills_development.pdf  120 ENISA, n.d., European Cybersecurity Skills Framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity- education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework  121 European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  122 Towards a Common ECSC roadmap https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-a-common-ecsc-roadmap  A more concerted  effort between  governments,  industry and HEIs  is needed to  produce more  appropriately  skilled  cybersecurity  graduates.  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767425/The_role_of_FE_and_HE_in_cyber_security_skills_development.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/767425/The_role_of_FE_and_HE_in_cyber_security_skills_development.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/european-cybersecurity-skills-framework https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/towards-a-common-ecsc-roadmap  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  37  Academic institutions should encourage their students to participate – even if they are not  enrolled in traditional STEM curricula. Companies and organisations could suggest  cybersecurity challenges that are aligned with real-world events as well as create partnerships  with academia to, for example, facilitate internships or provide feedback for the curricula.  4.3 UNDERSTAND JOB MARKET NEEDS AND TRENDS  The EU and its Member States (MSs) should aim to develop and maintain a good  understanding of the needs of the cybersecurity market and related trends in order to tackle the  skills problem effectively. For this reason, this report recommends:  Conduct research and monitoring activities in the EU and in Member States to  continuously assess what cybersecurity skills the market needs and what cybersecurity  jobs it can offer. This insight should then be used to allow appropriate actions to be taken to  prepare the future workforce.  Metrics that highlight the actual problem may include but are not limited to:   the number of unfilled cybersecurity vacancies,   the average time to fill cybersecurity vacancies,   which skills, and in what percentage, are mostly needed in certain positions,   the number of cybersecurity professionals that do not possess the requisite skills or  possess these skills only partially,   the average training time to acquire new skills,   an estimation of the cybersecurity workforce size,   the percentage of unqualified candidates.  MSs could monitor such metrics not only for maintaining awareness of their national labour  markets but also as a way of assessing progress towards the implementation of their NCSSs.  4.4 COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES  A number of EU initiatives have attempted to tackle the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap.  Similarly, Member States (MS) have also launched their own actions and included them as  objectives in their NCSSs. Even when focused on the skills problem at the level of the MSs, the  nature of the EU means that national programmes are likely to have an influence beyond their  geographic boundaries and extend their benefits to other MSs, helping to tackle the matter at  the EU level. In a similar vein, synergies among MSs and EU institutions, which might be  facilitated through EU common funding, should be strengthened. For this reason, this report  recommends:  Facilitating new joint initiatives to address the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap.  Since many MSs share similar issues when it comes to the shortage of cybersecurity skills,  launching common initiatives could prove an advantageous solution to pull resources together.  These collaborations may involve:   developing cybersecurity related material grounded in practice and research,   releasing joint campaigns in raising awareness,   expanding on previously launched initiatives to include other MSs.  Exchanging outputs of initiatives with other MSs with the support of European bodies. By  sharing the results of initiatives with other Member States in terms of metrics (e.g. participation,  people reached), in deliverables (e.g. curricula, e-learnings) and lessons learnt (e.g. activities  that worked or failed), the EU can work more efficiently towards closing the gap. Furthermore,  this will promote the re-use of already developed material (either sourced from MSs or EU  institutions), eventually saving resources.  Develop synergies  among Member  States’  cybersecurity  initiatives with the  support of  European bodies  and EU funded  projects.  MARKET  NEEDS AND  TRENDS  The EU and Member  States should have a  good understanding  of the needs of the  cybersecurity market  and related trends in  order to tackle the  problem efficiently.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  38  4.5 CYBERHEAD’S VALUE FOR STUDENTS, HIGHER EDUCATION  INSTITUTIONS AND MEMBER STATES  The supply of cybersecurity skills should also be regularly analysed in order to  understand how cybersecurity-related programmes and training responds to market  needs. This would also allow better planning towards what other initiatives should be put in  place to alleviate the scarcity of graduates. CyberHEAD provides some of the most important  metrics in order to understand the development of skills in MSs.  CyberHEAD provides a unique database of cybersecurity courses in the EU and EFTA  countries. Prospective students interested in studying cybersecurity can use the  database to quickly search for programmes according to a variety of requirements. For  instance, they can search by location, programme type (master, bachelor, etc.), programme  language, delivery method (online, classroom or blended) and fees. Two particularly important  data points available to students in CyberHEAD are whether programmes offer internships and  their core curriculum. Internships are crucial for gaining practical experience, while knowing the  ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) credits allows students to find programmes suited to  their interests and needs.  European HEIs can gain further exposure by including their degrees in CyberHEAD.  Currently there are 126 programmes scattered around 25 European countries. While this is a  good number given the young age of CyberHEAD, there is a strong need for more programmes,  especially from countries that have low representation in CyberHEAD. To enable this, more  should be done to incentivise EU HEIs to enter their programmes into the database. As one  individual (e.g. a professor or an administrator within HEIs) may not be able to answer all  questions, EU MSs should consider whether there are any resources or incentives that could be  offered to support HEIs in the first rounds of data collection.  EU Member States can also directly benefit from CyberHEAD, for example when they can  access relevant information to assess the status of their national cybersecurity  programmes and can themselves conduct many of the analyses presented in this report  (e.g. on gender balance, predicted numbers of future graduates entering the workforce).  These analyses can be performed over time to track changes in programme offerings and the  extent to which national cybersecurity jobs are being filled. This may also allow countries to  measure the impact of their national or local initiatives and may even be used to inform national  policy.  This report therefore recommends that CyberHEAD’s benefits (exemplified above) should  be further emphasised and promoted across the EU, and supported by MSs, who will  also ultimately benefit from the database.  Additional data gathering in CyberHEAD should be investigated as it will allow a deeper insight  into skills programmes in the EU as well as provide a platform through which the EU (and MSs)  can compare and contrast data with other regions and countries. However, as mentioned  above, additional data gathering could increase the workload for HEIs and for those validating  them. A cost-benefit analysis taking into account the wider benefits of CyberHEAD to the EU  should be conducted before including these extra questions to ensure they are not too time  consuming. A list of additional data-gathering questions and the reasoning why they should be  included is provided in Annex B.  The value and use  of CyberHEAD for  students, HEIs  and Member  States should be  further  emphasised and  promoted across  the EU.

ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  40  B ANNEX:  EXPANDING THE CYBERHEAD  QUESTION SET  This annex reports on an investigation that was conducted to identify questions that may be  considered for addition to the CyberHEAD question set. Such questions would be targeted at  allowing CyberHEAD to better achieve its goals (see Section 2). More specifically, a larger  number of questions also has the benefit of supplying more useful information for students  when they are choosing a programme as well as supplying the EU with a more structured and  comparable information across Europe on the academic programmes.  Firstly, an analysis on the information currently published and shared by HEI degree  programmes across Europe was conducted. This approach is based on the argument that  degree programmes – particularly programme websites – have been developed over many  years specifically to accommodate the information students desire when researching degrees.  By comparing and contrasting information provided on a large number of programme websites,  it would therefore be possible to identify a series of key information items which may be  recommended for inclusion in the CyberHEAD database questionnaire posed to HEIs.  Following the approach outlined above, a total of 100 European degree programme websites  were gathered and assessed. These were gathered from countries that include the UK, Italy,  France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hungary, Finland, Switzerland, Sweden, Lithuania  and the Czech Republic123. The UK featured most prominently in the sample, with 72 degrees.  This high representation was intentional and sought to acknowledge the advanced state of  cybersecurity degree courses in the UK, as well as the reality that the UK is often seen as a  primary destination for international students to pursue higher education124,125. EU programmes  were gathered from the CyberHEAD database and online searches, while UK programmes were  all gathered using online searches.  From an analysis of the degree programmes, a set of information commonly included was  identified. Attention was also paid to information that may assist in achieving another aim of the  CyberHEAD database, i.e. data that could allow for monitoring of the cyber skills shortage and  gap in the EU. This information, in question form, is presented below. Questions that are  already present in the CyberHEAD database are excluded. Furthermore, questions are  presented in three tiers according to their perceived usefulness based on the opinions of the  report’s authors. These questions provide input to recommendations (which are mentioned in  Section 4).  Tier 1 – High priority  1. Is the programme full-time, part-time, or both?  2. Are there scholarships or financial support options available?  3. What types of jobs will the programme allow students to attain afterwards?  123 UK courses were found through a web search for ‘cybersecurity degrees’ and ‘information security degrees’, and the  degrees from the other European countries were identified from a sample of those currently in the CyberHEAD database.  124 HESA, 2020, Higher Education Student Statistics: UK, 2018/19 - Where students come from and go to study.  https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/16-01-2020/sb255-higher-education-student-statistics/location  125 UK Department for Education, 2019, UK revenue from education related exports and TNE activity.  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-revenue-from-education-related-exports-and-tne-activity  https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/16-01-2020/sb255-higher-education-student-statistics/location https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-revenue-from-education-related-exports-and-tne-activity  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  41  4. Does the programme partner with any security industry organisations, consortiums or  academies?  5. To what extent are organisations or individuals from the security industry involved in  programme development?  6. What is the breakdown of the programme teaching format, in terms of lectures,  seminars/tutorials and practical exercises?  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1. Does the programme have dedicated cybersecurity facilities and labs?  2. Does the programme have any industry certifications built into it?  3. To what extent is cybersecurity-specific employability support available to students?  4. Is the programme accredited by a professional computing/IT/engineering body or  association?  Tier 3 – Low priority  1. What is the length of the programme?  2. What are the entry requirements of the programme?  3. What is the deadline for applications to the programme?  4. Are there any additional programme costs to students in addition to tuition fees?  5. What percentage of students find employment within 6 months of the programme  completing?  The second purpose of the CyberHEAD database is to allow cybersecurity skills across the EU  to be investigated, and in particular the supply-side of skills programmes. This can be divided  into two areas: the skills being provided in current programmes, and the types of individuals  being trained by the programmes. To identify a suitable set of additional information that may be  gathered from an updated database, examining existing research (such as international and  governmental reports126,127) into the gaps in cybersecurity skills is crucial. Such an analysis  would provide insights into the types of topics under deliberation across the world, and the  areas where gaps in skills and training are most prevalent. This information can provide input to  metrics for the state of the offerings of courses on security skills in Europe.  Based on the approach taken, a selection of areas of importance was defined. Focusing first on  the security skills provided in current programmes: there are numerous types of information that  may be recommended for addition to the CyberHEAD database which would be key to  understanding the state of the security programmes of European HEIs. These are phrased  below, as questions, similar to the format earlier in this report. A reference is added to questions  to identify where the notion originated.  Tier 1 – High priority  1. To what extent are non-technical (or ‘soft’) skills such as communication, leadership  and management, a part of the skills taught or practiced in the programme?128  126 ESG and ISSA, 2020, The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020. https://www.issa.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf  127 (ICS)2, 2019, 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  128 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  42  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1. What is the length of workplace placements in degree courses?129  2. What are the primary topics covered in the programme?130,131  3. How regularly is the programme syllabus refreshed?132  4. How much of the programme includes practical learning or hands-on learning and  training?133  5. To what extent does industry consult on programme content, give guest lectures,  participate in showcases, etc.?134  6. To what extent do students practice applying and implementing technical skills in a  business context?135  Tier 3 – Low priority  1. Does the programme or do students on the programme participate in capture-the-flag  competitions?136  The second area concentrates on the types of individuals being trained in programmes. This is  important to consider, given issues of workforce diversity, particularly in the technology field.  The following questions are recommended based on the analysis conducted.  Tier 1 – High priority  1. How many (or what percentage of) ethnic-minority students are present in the  programme each (or last) year?137  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1. How many (or what percentage of) students each (or last) year are sponsored (or paid  for) by their employers?138  2. For postgraduate programmes, what percentage of students each (or last) year had  backgrounds in non-IT/engineering subjects?139  Tier 3 – Low priority  1. What is the average age of students on the programme?140  To further inform the CyberHEAD database, this report conducted a high-level analysis of the  online policy documents focusing on how countries have attempted to address the shortages  129 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  130 (ICS)2, 2019, 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  131 ESG and ISSA, 2020, The Life and Times of Cybersecurity Professionals 2020. https://www.issa.org/wp- content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf  132 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  133 McAfee, 2020, Hacking the Skills Shortage. https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills- shortage.pdf  134 Kaspersky, 2016, The cybersecurity skills gap: a ticking time bomb. https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky- Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf  135 UK DCMS, 2020, Cybersecurity skills in the UK labour market 2020. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber- security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020  136 McAfee, 2020, Hacking the Skills Shortage. https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills- shortage.pdf  137 NCSC, 2020, Decrypting diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cybersecurity. https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and- inclusion-in-cyber-security-report  138 (ICS)2, 2019, 2019 Cybersecurity Workforce Study. https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  139 Ibid  140 Ibid  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.issa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ESG-ISSA-Research-Report-Cybersecurity-Professionals-Jul-2020.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf https://media.kaspersky.com/uk/Kaspersky-Cyberskills-Report_UK.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020/cyber-security-skills-in-the-uk-labour-market-2020 https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills-shortage.pdf https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/assets/reports/rp-hacking-skills-shortage.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/diversity-and-inclusion-in-cyber-security-report https://www.isc2.org/Research/2019-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  43  and gaps in skills. From that analysis, the following questions are recommended for addition to  the CyberHEAD database. Similar to above, the questions are presented in three tiers  according to perceived usefulness from the perspective of the report’s authors.  Tier 1 – High priority  1. Are there any programme review processes or outcome-oriented metrics or surveys in  place to refine cybersecurity programmes?  2. Is sufficient budget available for the provision of cybersecurity courses and  cybersecurity educators?  Tier 2 – Medium priority  1.

Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to initiatives in  cybersecurity skills such as: vocational studies in cybersecurity, public-private  partnerships in cybersecurity skills, women in cybersecurity, internships in cyber,  national competitions, or any educational activities in cyber?  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so, how?  CYPRUS  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  At present, cybersecurity skills and education are promoted by the Digital Security Authority  (NIS Competent Authority, which includes the national CSIRT-CY), the Ministry of Education, a  number of local public and private universities, and through further initiatives (see response to  Q2 below).  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The current version of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (https://dsa.cy/wp-  content/uploads/csrc-2020.pdf), discusses cybersecurity skills, education and training initiatives  in section 3.10 (Action 15) of the document (only available in Greek at present). Additionally,  through the support of the DSA (among others), the Cyprus Computer Society annually  organises the national cybersecurity challenge, which feeds into the European Cybersecurity  Challenge every year.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Not at present, although we are examining ways in which such impacts can be measured.  CZECH REPUBLIC  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB) – the agency has:   a department focusing on education - specifically focusing on education and outreach  in the area of cyber security and skills development   a cyber exercise unit - focusing on coordination and preparation of a wide range of  technical and non-technical cybersecurity exercises on the national and international  level (Cyber Czech, Cyber Coalition, Locked Shields, CMX); it also creates tailored  mobile cybersecurity for partners; and contributes to educational awareness activities  https://dsa.cy/wp-content/uploads/csrc-2020.pdf https://dsa.cy/wp-content/uploads/csrc-2020.pdf  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  45   as well as a national cybersecurity strategy (NCSS) that will be further presented at  question 2.  Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports  Educational institutions   there are 6 public universities offering programs in the field cybersecurity or similar  producing approx. 1000 – 1500 graduates yearly, which is not enough to cover the  needs of these professionals in the Czech Republic, and hundreds of cybersecurity  professionals are lacking   the universities also offer Postgraduate, Doctoral Studies or research initiatives,  such as:   Laboratory for AI and cybersecurity (Czech Technical University in Prague +  private company Avast)   Cybersecurity Hub (a project founded by 3 public universities)   Research team Advanced Cybersecurity at the University of Technology in  Brno   National Competence Centre for cybersecurity (PPP – universities, private  companies, public sector)  Non-governmental organisations (e.g. AFCEA) – among others organises the European  Cybersecurity Challenge  Others, such as:   CZ.NIC - an interest association of legal entities; one of their aims is also public  education is specific areas of cybersecurity   Digikoalice – an open fellowship of representatives of state institutions, IT companies,  ICT sector, educational institutions, academic assemblies, non-profit organisations,  statutory authorities of schools, educational institutions and other entities that wish to  contribute to the better digital literacy of citizens of the Czech Republic  Private institutions (CEVRO institute – MBA program)  IT Companies (e.g. CISCO Networking Academy)  Private companies   PwC and Cyber Arena   CyberG  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÚKIB)  The main legislative document in the field of cybersecurity, Cybersecurity Act, defines  prevention, education and systematic support in the field of cybersecurity as one of the  competences of NCISA.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  46  National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) dedicated a whole section to Education and  Awareness (section Resilient Society 4.0) stressing the need to develop cybersecurity skills  and educate population (especially the at-risk groups). In the upcoming Action plan, that is  traditionally complementing the NCSS, there are three areas of focus: 1. Quality education  system, 2. Outreach and education and 3. Vocational education and expanding the qualified  base which together specify 23 tasks that have a positive impact on cybersecurity skills  development. These tasks are concerned with defining and implementation of standards of  cybersecurity skills into general and vocational education, training, conferences, workshops and  other activities together with high schools, colleges, and universities.  Additionally, NCSS aims at sharing knowledge and expertise that NÚKIB acquires through  cybersecurity exercises, training and other activities. Not only that, NÚKIB also regularly  organises technical and non-technical cybersecurity exercises for various partners with the aim  of strengthening their cybersecurity skills and resilience.  Among others, NÚKIB also generates and offers and support materials to teachers and at-  risk groups (children and elderly), as well as offers support to the analysis of needs at the job  market in the area of cybersecurity, or supports cybersecurity competitions, such as the  European Cybersecurity Challenge — ECSC – this year, the competition is hosted in Prague.  NÚKIB is also open to university students in the form of internships in various areas in  cybersecurity. Moreover, NÚKIB organises an annual conference called “CyberCon”, which is  open for public and among others also focuses on students, outreach and education and tries to  present various topics of cybersecurity. Various public panel discussions and workshops  focused on topics of cybersecurity are organised by NÚKIB (often focusing on children, elderly,  parents, teachers). NÚKIB also prepared and made public cybersecurity courses for the general  public. Other than that, courses for public officers exist and are used by various national  institutions for personnel training.  Other legislation and strategy:  Generally, we monitor that the educational plans at the level from primary schools to high  schools miss generally digital and ICT skills, let alone cybersecurity skills. The revision of the  educational plans is underway and NÚKIB is trying to make sure that relevant cybersecurity  skills are implemented at these levels of education as well.  We also monitor various digital strategies at the national level that often include topics such as  digital literacy, digital skills, ICT skills, etc., however, cybersecurity skills as such are either  included only slightly, if at all.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  NCSS – the action plan and its progress is evaluated (mostly qualitatively) every year.  Cybersecurity courses, exercises and other activities – are evaluated based on attendance/the  number of users going through these courses and events.  DENMARK  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Several national actors are active in developing cybersecurity skills within Denmark, including:  the Centre for Cybersecurity, the Agency for Digitisation, the Ministry of Education, primary and  secondary schools, as well as universities. The Danish Business Authority also supports  increasing cyber skills in SMEs.  https://europeancybersecuritychallenge.eu/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  47  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The National Cyber and Information Security Strategy from 2018 has a number of initiatives to  strengthen cyber competencies and skills, see page 27-33 in the national strategy:  https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf  <https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf>  Moreover, awareness campaigns and educational materials at the Government information  portal, Sikkerdigital.dk are all part of strengthening competencies in the field of cyber- and  information security in the public and private spheres https://sikkerdigital.dk/.  The public SME program SMV:Digital provides grants to SMEs for the procurement of private  consultations to help the SMEs complete their digital transformation, including grants for help  with digital security.  In January 2020, the Danish Industry Foundation launched a Danish Hub for Cybersecurity in  collaboration with Denmark’s technical University, DTU. The purpose of the hub is to bolster  innovation and development within the area of cybersecurity and to strengthen competencies in  cybersecurity among primarily SME’s, start-ups and suppliers.  https://www.cyberhub.dk/  In relation to education, the Danish government has developed and supported a number of  educational programmes and academic curricula in cybersecurity in primary and secondary  education. The Ministry of Education has established a learning portal with educational material  on digital education, cybersecurity and digital judgement, and a broader technological  comprehension educational program including cyber and information security is being tested in  the Danish primary school.  The Ministry of Education has also developed a large amount of educational materials focusing  on helping educators teach data protection and information security.  In regards to higher education, Denmark has both courses and summer schools, as well as  Bachelor and Master programmes, which focus on cybersecurity and building cyber skills.  The Danish government has developed and supported a number of educational programmes  and academic curricula in cybersecurity in higher education.  In order to have sufficiently skilled personnel to detect and handle cyber attacks on Denmark, in  particular with regard to critical infrastructure, the Centre for Cybersecurity has developed and  executed its own intensive Cyber Academy. The Cyber Academy had 15 graduates in 2019.  In August 2019, a number of higher education institutions carried out a Summer School in  Cybersecurity supported by Centre for Cybersecurity. The Summer School included classes on  amongst others basic security and network principles, DevOps and security, data carving in  forensics, and network security exercises. The Summer school was repeated in 2020.  Cyber Days (supported by Centre for Cybersecurity)  A number of higher education institutions have carried out a two days seminar in Cybersecurity  (Cyber Days) supported by Centre for Cybersecurity. The lectures and practical exercises  included topics such as threat analysis, avoidance, and mitigation (both at the technical and  https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf https://digst.dk/media/16943/danish_cyber_and_information_security_strategy_pdfa.pdf https://sikkerdigital.dk/ https://www.cyberhub.dk/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  48  business level), as well as data security management (authenticity, confidentiality, integrity,  privacy, etc.).

ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  49  GERMANY  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?   In Germany, the national stakeholder landscape regarding cybersecurity skills is highly  diverse including stakeholders from various backgrounds including private and public  sector, civil society, associations and others.   It is important to note that in Germany school and university education are mainly in  the remit of the “Länder” (\"cultural sovereignty\"), while the Federal Government also  plays a significant role (e.g. Higher Education Pact, award of scholarships, Alliance for  Education). Shared responsibility between “Länder” and Federal Government is  particularly important in the fields of non-school vocational training, training assistance  and continuing education.   A key strategic actor for cybersecurity skills is the National Cybersecurity Council,  established with the 2011 Cybersecurity Strategy and serving the Federal Government  as a strategic adviser for the ongoing and evolving strategy process on cybersecurity  issues in Germany. The National Cybersecurity Council brings together high-level  representatives from the federal and state levels, as well as the private sector, thereby  offering a suitable format to advance the strategic cybersecurity issues most important  for Germany. The National Cybersecurity Council will increasingly draw on expertise  from society, private industry and the research community. Invited experts speaking on  individual strategic topics will provide background for discussion and for drawing up  recommendations for action.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?   Link to German national cybersecurity strategy 2016:  https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/it-und-digitalpolitik/it-und-cybersicherheit/cyber-  sicherheitsstrategie/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie-node.html  All following page references refer to English translation in attachment142.   The German national cybersecurity strategy 2016 highlights several action areas with  relevance for cybersecurity skills, in particular:   Action area 1: Remaining safe and autonomous in a digital environment,  strategic objective “Promoting digital literacy among all users” (p. 10)   Action area 3: Strong and sustainable cybersecurity architecture for every  level of government, strategic objective “Using resources, recruiting and  developing staff” (p. 27f)   Action area 4: Germany’s active role in European and international  cybersecurity policy, strategic objective “Bilateral and regional support and  cooperation for cyber capacity building” (p. 31f)   Ongoing strategy development in the National Cybersecurity Council (p. 33f)   Not only the German national cybersecurity strategy references the importance of  cybersecurity skills. Other strategies of the German Federal Government also  incorporate objectives regarding digital skills with related funding, e.g. digital strategy  of the German Federal Government (“Digitalstrategie der Bundesregierung”) or the  German “High-Tech Strategy 2025” (https://www.bmbf.de/en/high-tech-strategy-  2025.html).  142 The document de_ncss_2016_en.pdf was attached and is available if needed.  https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/it-und-digitalpolitik/it-und-cybersicherheit/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie-node.html https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/themen/it-und-digitalpolitik/it-und-cybersicherheit/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie/cyber-sicherheitsstrategie-node.html https://www.bmbf.de/en/high-tech-strategy-2025.html https://www.bmbf.de/en/high-tech-strategy-2025.html  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  50  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?   The German national cybersecurity strategy 2016 is currently under evaluation.  Other remarks:   The entire IT-sector in Germany is facing the challenge of a lack of IT-professionals.  This leads to rising wages all over the country and a competition between  employers as well as public sector and industry.   As an example: BSI as employer competes with the private sector by underlining its  special mission for government, business, and society as the federal cybersecurity  authority. In particular, aim and purpose of our work are to convince IT-professionals to  work with BSI. To do so, BSI’s HR department conducts various media campaigns to  spread its message and to provide insights into the work and profiles of different  employees. BSI offers furthermore various opportunities for students, e.g. to apply for a  scholarship, to do an internship, or the mentoring for their thesis.   BSI Human Resource Development uses a range of instruments to attract potential  candidates as well as to select and develop the skills of employees, e.g.:  i. Onboarding procedure  ii. Leadership Development Program  iii. Assessment Center for leadership positions  iv. Internships in different divisions of BSI and cooperation with other national  agencies  v. Networking initiatives: BSI also supports national and international networks, e.g.  Global Digital Women.  GREECE  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  National activities regarding skills strengthening on cybersecurity are spread across various  competent public institutions.

How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  Vocational studies: it is mandatory for the CISOs in the public service to attend a 2 semesters  long Postgraduate training at the University of Public Service according to the Act L. of 2013 on  the electronic information security of state and municipal organisation.  PPP in cybersecurity skills: cybersecurity skills development is an integral part of the national  NIS strategy (Governmental Decree 1838/2018 (XII. 28.) on the network and information system  security strategy of Hungary)  Women in Cybersecurity: there is no national strategy or legislation in this topic.  Internship in cyber: 10 weeks internship is mandatory on the cybersecurity MA program of the  University of Public Service due to the relevant law on higher education.  National competitions: The Hungarian Cybersecurity Challenge is organised since 2018 as a  national competition, as it is written in the national NIS strategy.  In general, skills development is emphasised in the national NIS strategy.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Yes, the national NIS strategy’s action plan between 2020-22 has a non-public version that  contains KPIs for the above mentioned tasks.  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  52  IRELAND  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Please refer to the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019-2024 for a contextual overview of  initiatives on skills. Measures 12 and 13 are particularly relevant.  Many of the initiatives are ‘bottom up’ rather than ‘top down’ with a large number of actors  involved. We are not a ‘command and control’ society so in practise many of the initiatives,  including government funding are not explicitly linked to legislation.  Updates on skills initiatives are delivered to quarterly meetings of the Inter-Departmental  Committee overseeing implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  These initiatives should be linked to the national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation.  The NCSC itself with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications is directly  involved in curriculum development for a short course in cybersecurity for 12/13 to 15/16 year  olds in second level schools. This involves a pilot implementation with schools, teachers and  other education stakeholders.  Skillnet Ireland is tasked with upskilling and delivering conversion courses, including in the field  of cybersecurity. Last year it ran quarterly capture the flags, and webinar events on key aspects  of cybersecurity.  ‘Cyber Women Ireland’ is about promotion of female participation in cybersecurity.  The national industry cluster “Cyber Ireland” has received support from Government, notably the  State agencies, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in its setup.  The ‘Cyber Skills’ project I an € 8.1m investment in third level institutions in Ireland in  collaboration with Northern Ireland and Virginia Tech in the US, who have a cyber range facility  to assist with improving the suitability of education courses for industry.  Science Foundation Ireland’s discover programme is funding ‘Cyber Academy’ a Summer  bootcamp initiative for 15 to 18 year olds that includes career talks, schools cyber challenge and  cyber tech skills.  From CyberIRELAND  From the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019-2024 see measure 12 & 13 that relate to skills -  https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf  The initiatives listed in the report are not directly funded under the national strategy, but those  funded by the government all relate to national skills policies / strategies.  From my knowledge, the government supported initiatives include:   New cybersecurity courses funded under the Human Capital Initiative & Springboard   Cyber Skills Project funded under Human Capital Initiative   Cybersecurity Skills Initiative (CSI) - Technology Ireland ICT SKillnet   FIT Cybersecurity Apprenticeship   FutureInTech <https://www.futureintech.ie/pathways/cybersecurity-analyst/> has a  Cybersecurity Analyst Course  This programme is aimed at those who are unemployed and came about as a result of the large  numbers of individuals in different sectors (retail, hospitality etc.) who were displaced by Covid.  https://www.ncsc.gov.ie/pdfs/National_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf https://www.futureintech.ie/pathways/cybersecurity-analyst/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  53  LATVIA  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  There are national and also international actors, mostly academia, involved in development of  cybersecurity skills.  The Ministry of Education and Science has the most important role in the field of education at  the national level. The ministry enhances public knowledge and awareness about scientific,  technological, engineering and mathematical developments that form the knowledge base on  cyberspace at all levels of education. It also contributes to higher research capacity of  universities through national and European Union Structural Funds (European Regional  Development Fund, European Social Fund) investments into development and boosting of  research infrastructure, including human capital.  Education in information technologies (IT) field starts in primary schools and continues in  secondary schools and universities. National defence lessons, where cyber is one of the topics,  will be mandatory subject at secondary schools starting September, 2024. The cybersecurity  topics are also included in the curriculum of the Cadet Force.  Cybersecurity related professional education is also provided by professional secondary  education institutions, for example, the Saldus Technical School. After secondary or  professional secondary education, interested ones can continue their studies and join Bachelor  degree studies or choose the first level higher professional study programmes, for example, the  Riga Technical College.  Public and private higher education institutions provide Bachelor Degree programmes in IT.  Also, several higher educational institutions are providing professional Master Degrees in cyber  field, for example, the Riga Technical University, the University of Latvia, the Vidzeme  University of Applied Sciences and the BA School of Business and Economics.  The Information Technology Security Incident Response Institution of the Republic of Latvia  (CERT.LV) organises national technical exercises for state and local government IT security  specialists, as well as annual cybersecurity conference and workshops twice a year. CERT.LV  also provides several types of IT security awareness programmes for wide audience starting  from teachers to IT security professionals. In 2019-2020 CERT.LV in the framework of  Connecting Europe Facility project organised campaign “Cybersecurity at your workplace”. All  those activities are aimed to rise overall level of cyber awareness. Since 2006 the Latvian Safe  Internet Centre “Net-Safe Latvia” is a body engaged in public awareness rising about internet  safety issues and child safety online.  National Armed Forces are rising cyber expertise by participating in national and international  exercises. The Baltic Defence College, which is a multinational military college established by  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1999, has included cyber elements into Joint Command and  General Staff Course and the course “Cyber Defence Policy on National and International  Levels”. The last is organised in cooperation with the European Security and Defence College.  Latvia is also sponsoring nation of the NATO Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence, which  organises technical, legal, operational level and strategic level training.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  54  Latvia has a cybersecurity strategy since 2014. The Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2014-2018  was adopted in 2014, but the Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022 - in 2019. The latest  outlines 5 key areas of action, where public awareness, education and research is defined as a  separate area of action:   Promotion of cybersecurity, reduction of digital security risks,   Strengthening the resilience of information and communication technologies, the  provision of critical information and communication technologies and services to the  public,   Public awareness, education and research,   International cooperation   The rule of law in cyberspace and the reduction of cybercrime.  Every area of action includes an action plan with specific tasks given to ministries and other  involved parties. The Cybersecurity Strategy of Latvia 2019-2022 states that “all stakeholders  are equally important for securing networks and information systems, and that means everyone  should be equally aware of risks they are exposed to when online and actions that may prevent  such exposure”. The action plan for the area “Public awareness, education and research”  includes tasks, for example:   raise awareness of students and teachers about information security, protection of  privacy and reliable online services, or   improve public awareness about online safety (age-group-specific information and  instructional materials with guidelines on online safety, social media campaign  security) and deliver advanced cybersecurity training for specific target groups.  Develop and implement annual multi-agency action and campaign plan with  cybersecurity information events and awareness raising campaigns.  Therefore, the strategy defines awareness, education and research as one of five areas of  action and it has direct impact on cybersecurity initiatives, but nevertheless it does not  specifically name all of them.  Latvia has established a legal framework in the area of cybersecurity – the Law on the Security  of Information Technologies and the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations pursuant to it. The link  between legal framework and cybersecurity initiatives might be not so evident, but is not less  important. For example, the Cabinet Regulation of July 28, 2015 No.442 “Procedures for the  Ensuring Conformity of Information and Communication Technologies Systems to Minimum  Security Requirements” serves as guideline for educational institutions when creating and  adopting curriculum.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Impact of the initiatives are usually monitored by the ones who are conducting them. For  example, CERT.LV has conducted assessments of IT security awareness by distributing  questionnaires to participants at CERT.LV events. Education activities on other hand can be  measured by number of applicants and graduates.  Regarding national cybersecurity strategy reviews, a mid-term progress review of the  Cybersecurity strategy of Latvia 2014-2018 was conducted in 2016 and the final progress  review was completed in 2019. The final review identified that majority of tasks have been  implemented or are in execution stage. The review also identified three challenges that had  effect to fully achieve the individual tasks: cybersecurity issues are not always a priority, a lack  of personnel and a lack of funding. A progress review of the Cybersecurity Strategy 2019-2022  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  55  is planned to be completed by 1st of May 2022 when preparation of a strategy for the next four  year period will be ongoing.  LITHUANIA  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  In the Lithuania actors, involved in development of cybersecurity skills are schools, academia,  private sector and governmental institutions.  Schools: Education of IT starts in primary schools.  Academia: Universities with IT, engineering and cybersecurity programs  Private sectors: entities, which provides training, certification.  Governmental institutions: Institutions, which provides training for the government entities (for  example NSCS under Mod).  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  It is directly related to the third target of the Lithuania’s strategy – to promote cybersecurity  culture and development of innovation and to fourth target – to strengthen a close cooperation  between private and public sectors.  The first objective of the third target is to expand scientific research and activities which create  high added value in the area of cybersecurity. This objective will be fulfilled by creating suitable  conditions for the creation of new, advanced capabilities which develop cybersecurity initiatives  by promoting the growth of the cybersecurity market, export of cybersecurity services to foreign  markets, by expanding the cybersecurity sector of financial technology and by carrying out  corresponding research.  The second objective of the third target is to develop creativity, advanced capabilities and  cybersecurity skills and qualification which match with the needs of the market. This objective  will be attained by having representatives of public and private sector as well as science and  education institutions create a cybersecurity competence model, establish cybersecurity  competence standards, develop systems of training, accreditation and certification all of which  would be oriented towards the needs of the labour market, also have them attract and develop  talents, create training and testing environment of cybersecurity, teach the  beginners/newcomers and provide opportunities of re-training/re-qualification to persons  working in the ICT field, improve knowledge on cybersecurity of persons who work with  sensitive data.  The third objective of the third target is to promote the cooperation between the public and  private sector and science and education institutions in developing cybersecurity innovation.  This objective will be fulfilled by identifying the common needs of private and public sectors,  their importance to scientific cybersecurity research, by creating technical measures, methods  and other resources, by developing competences to resolve cybersecurity problems and carry  out specific cybersecurity objectives.  The first objective of the fourth target is to improve the coordination of cooperation between  private and public sectors. This objective will be reached by creating a sustainable model of  cooperation between private and public sectors in the field of cybersecurity, by identifying  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  56  responsibility and capabilities, by strengthening the country’s cybersecurity, by making  exchange of relevant information on cyber threats, cyber incidents which have taken place and  lessons learned between private and public sectors more effective, by developing early warning  system, by creating new and improving the existing communication methods and processes.  The second objective of the fourth target is to increase the degree of cybersecurity maturity of  the representatives of private small and medium-sized businesses. This objective will be fulfilled  by encouraging (urging) the representatives of small and medium-sized businesses to check the  status of their cybersecurity and plug the gaps in cybersecurity.  The third objective of the fourth target is to create responsible practice of disclosing the ICT  security gaps in private and public sectors. This objective will be reached by initiating a  responsible practice of disclosing ICT gaps in private and public sectors, by establishing  operational principles of this field, the procedure of application of methods, technical capacities  and other measures designed for this purpose.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Yes, criteria for the implementation of cybersecurity strategy is approved by the Lithuania’s  Government:  https://e-  seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/27107170d04511e8a82fc67610e51066?jfwid=dg8d31595  MALTA  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Currently, the national actors which are active in cybersecurity skills are the Critical Information  Infrastructure Protection Unit (NIS Competent Authority – includes also CSIRTMalta which is the  national CSIRT), eSkills Foundation (founded by the Ministry for Education and Employment,  Malta Digital Innovation Authority, Malta Enterprise, Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise  and Industry, Malta Communications Authority, Malta Information & Technology Agency, Malta  Gaming Authority, and Ministry for the Economy, Investment and Small Businesses), Malta  Information & Technology Agency, private and public universities, and additional initiatives.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  Through the current strategy, Malta Cybersecurity Strategy 2016, the goal of Education (Goal 5)  is discussed where a strategic approach towards an ongoing educational campaign is  recommended. One such scheme that was launched in the first edition of the ‘Malta  Cybersecurity Summit’, in 2019, is the ‘B SECURE’ scheme, where it offers training courses for  both Executives and Industry Professionals. Apart from this, the CSIRTMalta Constituent  Programme offers cybersecurity training to its constituents.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  No impact assessment has been made to date.  https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/27107170d04511e8a82fc67610e51066?jfwid=dg8d31595 https://e-seimas.lrs.lt/portal/legalAct/lt/TAD/27107170d04511e8a82fc67610e51066?jfwid=dg8d31595  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  57  NETHERLANDS  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  We have quite a few national actors active in cybersecurity skills in The Netherlands. Including  The Hague Security Delta (HSD) – a network for the development of knowledge and innovation  in security –, the platform for information security (PvIB) – an independent knowledge centre –,  and DCYPHER – the Dutch cybersecurity platform for higher education and research. The  Dutch government also has an i-traineeship for young cyber professionals to gain work  experience and knowledge in the field. Finally, the NCSC and i-Partnerschap are working on  setting up a government PhD programme (rijkspromovendiprogramma).  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The cybersecurity council (cybersecurity raad) recently wrote a report on this in Dutch. The  report advocates a continuous development of cybersecurity knowledge and skills. In February  2021 the collaboration platform cybersecurity knowledge and innovation was launched, to  stimulate an increase of specialised cybersecurity professionals. In 2019 the Human Capital  Agenda Security was launched by HSD, to improve the supply and demand of cybersecurity  professionals. A similar mission is found in the Roadmap Human Capital 2020-2030.  Furthermore, the NCSC is involved in CTF, like challenge the Cyber and ISIDOOR, and Women  in Cyber is a Dutch organisation.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  Currently we do not have an impact assessment.  SLOVENIA  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  In Slovenia cybersecurity is part of the educational programmes at the university level in some  Slovenian faculties, namely the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and  the Faculty for Security Studies of the University of Maribor, the Faculty of Computer and  Information Sciences and the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana, the  Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Primorska, the Faculty of Information Studies of  Novo mesto, and the licensed independent higher education institution GEA College. Other  important actor in promoting and acquiring cybersecurity skills is the Cybersecurity Section  within the Association of Informatics and Telecommunications at the Chamber of Commerce  and Industry of Slovenia which has organised several hackathons for the youth.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  The National Cybersecurity Strategy of 2016 set two measures for achieving the goal of safety  of citizens in cyberspace. Those measures were regular implementation of awareness-raising  programmes on cybersecurity and introduction of cybersecurity content in education and  training programmes. Slovenia is quite successful in performing the former but unfortunately not  successful in performing the latter. In 2021 Slovenia will participate in the European  Cybersecurity Challenge for the first time in order to popularise acquiring the cybersecurity skills  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  58  among the youth. It is planned that every year’s national challenge and the participation in  ECSC become traditional.  The new cybersecurity strategy will address various initiatives for acquiring and developing  cybersecurity skills.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  For the time being the impact of cybersecurity initiatives has not been measured, but this will  change with the new cybersecurity strategy.  SPAIN  1. Who are the national actors active in cybersecurity skills in your Member State?  Spain has three official documents, which endorse the actions that are being carried out in  terms of talent and skills in Cybersecurity.  These three documents are:   The National Cybersecurity Strategy  (link)   Within this strategy, there is the \"Objective IV: Culture and commitment to  cybersecurity and empowerment of human and technological capabilities\" and in  its \"Line of action 5: Strengthen the Spanish cybersecurity industry and the  generation and retention of talent, for the strengthening of digital autonomy  (measures 5 to 8)\" we can find all the measures related to the promotion of talent.   The Digital Agenda “España Digital 2025” (link)   Also, within this plan, in \"Line 4: Cybersecurity (measure 14.2 - (2) generation,  identification and development of talent in cybersecurity, to increase capacities  and respond to the growth of the sector and the Spanish cybersecurity industry)\",  all the actions related to talent in Cybersecurity are specified.   The National Digital Skills Plan (link)   This plan provides for public reforms and investments to the sum of 3.75 billion  euros and its goals are guaranteeing digital inclusion, reducing the digital gap  between men and women, guaranteeing the digitalisation of education, promoting  the acquisition of the digital skills of the unemployed and of workers, increasing  the number of ICT specialists and promoting the necessary digital skills of  companies. In order to reach these goals, cybersecurity skills are considered  fundamental and, because of that, they are taken into account in this plan.  With this framework in mind, the Spanish government has set up the National Cybersecurity  Forum (FNCS), which is a public-private collaboration space promoted by the National  Security Council (DSN) with the collaboration of INCIBE (Spanish National Cybersecurity  Institute) and the CCN (National Cryptologic Centre), whom hold the two vice-presidencies.   The FNCS, aligned with the aforementioned documents, is working on several lines  focused on generating cybersecurity culture (Working Group 1), offering support to  Industry and R&D&i (Working Group 2) and an opportunity for training and talent in  cybersecurity (Working Group 3). Issues related to cybersecurity talent are dealt  with in WG 3 and in one of the sub-working groups of WG 2 (matching industry  demands regarding talent and skills).   Specifically, the objectives of WG3 are:   To update or, when appropriate, to develop cybersecurity competency  frameworks that respond to the needs of the labour market.  https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/documento/estrategia-nacional-ciberseguridad-2019 https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Documents/2020/230720-Espa%C3%B1aDigital_2025.pdf https://portal.mineco.gob.es/RecursosArticulo/mineco/ministerio/ficheros/210127_plan_nacional_de_competencias_digitales.pdf https://foronacionalciberseguridad.es/ https://foronacionalciberseguridad.es/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  59   Identify the needs for professional cybersecurity skills, fostering collaboration  with educational and training institutions, promoting lifelong learning, training  for employment and university education, promoting accreditation and  professional certification systems.   Promote the inclusion of professional cybersecurity profiles in public sector  job descriptions.   Detect, foster and retain cybersecurity talent with special attention to the field  of research.   Promote cybersecurity digital literacy initiatives and plans.   Seek and recognise the collaboration and participation of the media to  achieve greater reach in campaigns aimed at citizens and minors.  In parallel, INCIBE is executing additional actions in the field of cybersecurity competences at a  national level. These actions include the launch of a Cybersecurity Talent Analysis and  Diagnosis Service in Spain which, among other things, aims to carry out more than 600  surveys to determine the real need for profiles at national level.  2. How does your national cybersecurity strategy or other legislation link to  cybersecurity initiatives in skills such as: Vocational studies in cybersecurity, PPP in  cybersecurity in skills, women in cybersecurity, internship in cyber, national  competitions, any education activities in cyber?  There are several other initiatives that have already been carried out over the years and that  could be of interest, as many of them will continue to be adapted to the new profiles sought:   Market studies:   Apart from the aforementioned study being carried out by INCIBE, the rest of the  initiatives launched in Spain have been at a more local level and not supported by  any of the documents or laws mentioned.   Competitions:   Since 2014, INCIBE has been organising the CyberCamp event, which mainly  aims to identify career paths and broaden technical knowledge, as well as to  awaken and promote talent in cybersecurity through technical competitions.   In this sense, two competitions are organised as part of the event, one  individual and the other by teams (CyberOlimpics).   The team competition is aimed at secondary school and vocational training  students and serves as a first step before moving on to the individual  competition.   The individual competition also serves to select the Spanish team that  participates every year in the ENISA European Cybersecurity Challenges   Up to now, the design of the tests and challenges of these competitions  hasn´t been based on any specific criteria or definition of competencies;  however, our intention is to adapt the challenges to the competencies and  profiles needed in the Spanish industry and also to increase the number of  training sessions and competitions by levels and competencies that they  develop.   There are more competitions developed by different organisations and entities that  seek the same objective, to boost the interest of the new generations in dedicating  themselves professionally to Cybersecurity. Below are some of the competitions  developed over the last year at national level by public bodies:   National League of challenges in Cyberspace organised by the Spanish Civil  Guard (link)  https://cybercamp.es/ https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/CTF https://cybercamp.es/competiciones/cyberolympics https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cybersecurity-education/eu-cyber-challenge https://www.nationalcyberleague.es/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  60   CyberWallChallenge organised by the Spanish National Police as part of its  CyberWallAcademy training action. (https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-  academy-es/)   Professional studies:   In addition to university studies in the field of cybersecurity (which we previously  mentioned in another thread on the different degrees available in Spain) and  which you can find a list of in the INCIBE catalogue, there are also vocational  training studies.   These studies have three levels (basic, intermediate and advanced). The last  of these levels is recognised at the same level as university Master degrees,  and this year the first courses of this type in cybersecurity have been  published:   Course of Specialisation in Cybersecurity in Information Technology  Environments endorsed by Royal Decree 479/2020, of 7 April,  establishing the Course of Specialisation in Cybersecurity in Information  Technology Environments and setting the basic aspects of the curriculum  (https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4963).   Specialisation Course in Cybersecurity in Operational Technology  Environments, endorsed by Royal Decree 478/2020, of 7 April, which  establishes the Specialisation Course in Cybersecurity in Operational  Technology Environments and sets out the basic aspects of the  curriculum (https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-  4962).   These two Cybersecurity Specialisation courses will be taught for the first time  in Spain this coming academic year (2021-22) as the first step towards  developing Cybersecurity courses at the other two levels of this type of  training (INCIBE has collaborated in the Working Group that developed the  CV of these courses and we are collaborating with the Spanish Ministry of  Education and Vocational Training in the continuity of the actions for the other  levels, as well as in the training of the professionals who will teach these  courses, together with the School of Industrial Organisation - EOI -  https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf).   Women in cybersecurity:   In relation to women in cybersecurity, we can highlight two initiatives at the  national level:   INCIBE has launched \"Despega\" (“Take-off”) a program that aims to promote  the presence of women in cybersecurity, including actions to raise awareness,  attract talent, training, visibility, entrepreneurship and employability for  women.   On the other hand, the first national chapter of ECSO's Women4Cyber  programme has recently been founded in Spain, which is also working on  these initiatives, aligned with the initiatives at European level and which is  reaching agreements with different entities (both public and private) seeking  to promote the presence of women in this area.   Educational actions in cybersecurity:   In addition to what has already been mentioned in previous points, INCIBE is  working in the medium to long term on the establishment of training itineraries  (with its own content as well as that of third parties), aligned with the profiles that  will be obtained from the different initiatives underway and whose objective is to  cover the demand for the necessary professionals at national level and that have  quality training oriented towards the competences required for each of the most in-  demand profiles.  https://c1b3rwall.hackrocks.com/ https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-academy-es/ https://www.ecteg.eu/c1b3rwall-academy-es/ https://www.incibe.es/sites/default/files/paginas/talento/catalogos-formacion/catalogo-masteres.pdf https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/informatica-comunicaciones/ciberseguridad-entornos-tecnologias-informacion.html https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/informatica-comunicaciones/ciberseguridad-entornos-tecnologias-informacion.html https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4963 https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/electricidad-electronica/ciberseguridad-tecnologias-operacion.html https://www.todofp.es/que-como-y-donde-estudiar/que-estudiar/familia/loe/electricidad-electronica/ciberseguridad-tecnologias-operacion.html https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962 https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-2020-4962 https://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2021/03/12/pdfs/BOE-A-2021-3904.pdf https://www.incibe.es/sala-prensa/notas-prensa/incibe-reivindica-el-impulso-mujer-ciberseguridad-el-programa-despega https://women4cyber.eu/ https://www.women4cyberspain.es/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  61  Up to this point, we have indicated the initiatives at national level that are being worked on, but  which do not yet have published deliverables and which, in many of them, we are going to take  the results of the ENISA WG as a point of reference.  3. Has the impact of cybersecurity initiatives such as those mentioned above been  measured and if so how?  In most of the initiatives showed before, there is no specific measuring tools for the impact.  However, we have information regarding indicators of the initiatives carried out so far, with data  on participation in some Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs).  Course Season  Registered  participants  Passed  participants  Satisfaction rate  L1 – SMES 6* 11.747 3091 4,32 (1-5 scale)  L2 – Móviles 2 4.000 448 Not available  L3 – SCI 2** 2.132 721  Only qualitative analysis:  most of positive comments  L7 – FCSE  (basic)  1 1.779 1064 79,75% mostly satisfied  L7 – FCSE  (advance)  1 1.818 758 75,62% mostly satisfied  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  62  D ANNEX:  APPROACHES ADOPTED BY  NON-EU COUNTRIES  This annex examines the approaches adopted by two non-EU countries (the United Kingdom  and the United States) in their efforts to improve cybersecurity skills and education, and reduce  the shortfall in cybersecurity professionals. This analysis is based on open-source information.  In the United Kingdom (UK), cybersecurity and cyber defence have been a national priority for  many years. In order to increase the pool of cybersecurity skills, the UK has also focused on  ‘widespread and innovative collaboration across all sectors’143. The UK’s latest NCSS (2016-  2021)144 stresses the need to ‘develop’ the cyber skills base in the country. More importantly,  the Initial National Cybersecurity Skills Strategy (2019)145,146 considers cybersecurity education  to be a strategic outcome with the overall goal of ensuring that the country has enough  cybersecurity professionals to meet national needs.  In the past 30 years, the United States (US) has developed strategies and policies related to  cyberspace (security and defence). One of the priorities set by the US National Cyber Strategy  (2018) was to enhance efforts to build cyber capacity147. Pillar II of the strategy specifically  refers to the need to develop the workforce and maintain the supply of talent by: 1) increasing  reskilling and educational opportunities for workers, 2) enhancing the federal cybersecurity  workforce, and 3) using executive authority to highlight and reward talent148.  Below we conduct a high-level analysis based on the three primary areas used in Section 3.  D.1 RAISE USER AWARENESS AMONGST THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND  IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION  UNITED KINGDOM  Launched in 2016 by the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the CyberFirst149  initiative has been extended and has become part of an ‘£84 million government cyber-  education programme’. It offers, among other, courses and competitions for young people (11-  17 years old) and its CyberFirst Girls150 competitions motivates girls to develop their cyber skills.  143 IISS (2021) Cyber Capabilities and National Power: A Net Assessment, Cyber Power – Tier Two, United Kingdom,  https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-power---tier-two  144 HM Government, ‘National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016–2021’, 2016,  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_s ecurity_strategy_2016.pdf  145 HM Government, DCMS, (2019) Initial National Cybersecurity Skills Strategy: increasing the UK’s cybersecurity  capability - a call for views, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-strategy/initial-national-cyber- security-skills-strategy-increasing-the-uks-cyber-security-capability-a-call-for-views  146 Initial National Cybersecurity Skills Strategy (2019)  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949211/Cyber_security_ skills_strategy_211218_V2.pdf  147 The White House (2018) U.S. National Cyber Strategy, https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp- content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf  148 Ibid.  149 NCSC, CyberFirst overview, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/overview  150 NCSC, CyberFirst Girls competition, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/girls-competition  https://www.iiss.org/blogs/research-paper/2021/06/cyber-power---tier-two https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-strategy/initial-national-cyber-security-skills-strategy-increasing-the-uks-cyber-security-capability-a-call-for-views https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cyber-security-skills-strategy/initial-national-cyber-security-skills-strategy-increasing-the-uks-cyber-security-capability-a-call-for-views https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949211/Cyber_security_skills_strategy_211218_V2.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/949211/Cyber_security_skills_strategy_211218_V2.pdf https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/overview https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/girls-competition  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  63  In terms of campaign initiatives targeting the public, the UK launched Cyber Aware (led by the  NCSC). Its aim is to teach people on how to stay secure online and how to protect themselves  in a practical way151. Moreover, ‘Get Safe Online’ acts as one of the UK's leading resources on  awareness, helping to protect people, financial assets, devices and businesses from fraud,  abuse and other online threats152. Its website offers the public practical advice on, for example,  how to perform backups and keep safe online.  UNITED STATES  In 2018, the US’s Department of Commerce and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  released a report on ‘Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation’s Cybersecurity  Workforce’153. The report also raises awareness regarding the skills shortage problem,  acknowledges the need for an immediate expansion of the cybersecurity workforce, and  provides the following findings:   the increasing concerns of employers about the importance of cybersecurity related  educational programmes;   the insufficient number of skilled cybersecurity teachers at the primary and secondary  school levels and in higher education, as well as a lack of training instructors;   the need to increase the number of female candidates for cybersecurity careers and  the re-education of non-IT personnel in organisations;   the need to simplify hiring procedures (e.g. lengthy security clearance delays); and   the lack of reliable data to deliver a comprehensive picture of the needs of the  cybersecurity workforce and related education and training programmes.  More recently, in March 2021, the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance154 document,  which also highlights the importance of investing in people to build a talent base, was released.  Launched in 2020, Cyber.org155 is a cybersecurity-centric workforce development organisation,  backed by the cyber unit of DHS and CISA, that promotes cyber education and literacy. It  targets K-12 students (from kindergarten to 12th grade). It has published materials for teachers  to educate students on the basics of cybersecurity. In addition, the organisation has published  ‘K-12 Cybersecurity Learning Standards’156 which focuses on three core themes: Computing  Systems, Digital Citizenship and Security.  D.2 STRENGTHEN TRAINING AND PROMOTE CYBERSECURITY IN  HIGHER EDUCATION  UNITED KINGDOM  To prepare a knowledge base for scientific cybersecurity, the Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge  (CyBOK)157 project at the University of Bristol in the UK aims to ‘codify the foundational and  generally recognised knowledge on cybersecurity’. The project serves as a knowledge hub and  151 NCSC (2020) Cyber Aware Campaign Toolkit, https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static- assets/documents/cyberaware/CyberAware%20campaign%20toolkit_Dec%2020.pdf  152 Get Safe Online, https://www.getsafeonline.org/  153 U.S. Secretary of Commerce and the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security (2018) A Report to the President on  Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation’s Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for a More  Secure American Future, https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/07/24/eo_wf_report_to_potus.pdf  154 The White House (2021) Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp- content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf  155 Cyber.org, https://cyber.org/about-us  156 Cyber.org, K-12 Cybersecurity Learning Standards, https://cyber.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/K- 12%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Standards.pdf  157 CyBOK, https://www.cybok.org/  https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/cyberaware/CyberAware%20campaign%20toolkit_Dec%2020.pdf https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/cyberaware/CyberAware%20campaign%20toolkit_Dec%2020.pdf https://www.getsafeonline.org/ https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/07/24/eo_wf_report_to_potus.pdf https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf https://cyber.org/about-us https://cyber.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/K-12%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Standards.pdf https://cyber.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/K-12%20Cybersecurity%20Learning%20Standards.pdf https://www.cybok.org/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  64  guide for existing literature such as textbooks, academic research articles, technical reports,  white papers and standards158.  Furthermore, the UK’s NCSC certifies bachelor, integrated master, and master programmes,  and apprenticeships. This initiative directly stems from the UK Cybersecurity Strategy 2016-21,  which states that ‘the UK requires more talented and qualified cybersecurity professionals’159.  To obtain certification, degree courses should have a minimum number of credits in computer  science or cybersecurity, depending on whether they are bachelor or master programmes. The  NCSC provides either provisional or full certification, which is valid for 5 years.  In 2013, the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) in Cybersecurity were established as a part of  the 2011 national cybersecurity programme. A CDT in cybersecurity provides a 4-year  programme. Doctoral students attend a taught component in their first year and undertake a  specific research project with a clear focus on cybersecurity in the remaining 3 years.  From the training side, the Cyber Retraining Academy160 is a UK government-funded  programme that provides an intensive 10-week conversion programme for people without a  formal background in cyber. This provides people with new opportunities by allowing them to  move into cybersecurity careers while, at the same time, it directly alleviates the shortage  problem in the cybersecurity workforce.  UNITED STATES  In the US, the National Security Agency (NSA) has invested substantially in the creation of  rigorous cybersecurity programmes across a network of universities161. Nevertheless, reports  suggest that ‘only 42% of the top 50 computer science programmes in the country include  security courses for undergraduates’162. According to CyberSeek, an initiative funded by the  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), from April 2020 to March 2021, the  country’s total employed workforce in cybersecurity was 956,341 persons, whilst the number of  online job listings for cybersecurity-related positions was 464,420163.  Established in 2010, the Workforce Framework for Cybersecurity (NICE Framework)164 aims to  aid in sustaining the cybersecurity workforce in partnership with the government, academia, and  the private sector on education, training, and the development of the workforce165. According to  the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)166, by using the NICE Framework,  among others, the creation of educational programmes aligned to jobs could be facilitated while,  at the same time, the appropriate knowledge and skills needed by the market could be selected  and delivered to students. To help in the implementation of the framework, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS)167 published resources (e.g. toolkit, mapping tools) for educators and  employers. Moreover, CyberSeek168, which was built through a public-private partnership, is a  tool that provides data about supply and demand for cybersecurity jobs in the US.  158 University of Bristol, CyBOK: Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge,  https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/ilo/academics/cybok/  159 UK’s National Cybersecurity Strategy 2016-2021  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_s ecurity_strategy_2016.pdf  160 CSIS (2019) The Cybersecurity Workforce Gap https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap  161 Forbes (2019) The Cybersecurity Skills Gap Won't Be Solved in a Classroom,  https://www.forbes.com/sites/martenmickos/2019/06/19/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-wont-be-solved-in-a-classroom/  162 HDI (2020) The cybersecurity skills gap: 4 million professionals needed worldwide,  https://www.hdi.global/infocenter/insights/2020/cyber-skills-gap/  163 CyberSeek, Heatmap https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html  164 NICE Framework, https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework  165 U.S. Department of Commerce, NIST, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied- cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan  166 CISA, NICE Framework, https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework  167 NICCS, Cybersecurity resources, https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cybersecurity-resources  168 CyberSeek, https://www.cyberseek.org/  https://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/ilo/academics/cybok/ https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/567242/national_cyber_security_strategy_2016.pdf https://www.csis.org/analysis/cybersecurity-workforce-gap https://www.forbes.com/sites/martenmickos/2019/06/19/the-cybersecurity-skills-gap-wont-be-solved-in-a-classroom/ https://www.hdi.global/infocenter/insights/2020/cyber-skills-gap/ https://www.cyberseek.org/heatmap.html https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan https://www.cisa.gov/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework https://niccs.cisa.gov/workforce-development/cybersecurity-resources https://www.cyberseek.org/  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  65  The National Centres of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C)169 programme,  managed by the National Cryptologic School, developed a set of academic standards  (cybersecurity curriculum and academic excellence) that colleges and universities in the US are  encouraged to meet. Currently, there are three categories:   Cyber Defence Education (CAE-CDE) designation awarded to regionally accredited  academic institutions;   Cyber Research (CAE-R) designation awarded to Department of Defense (DoD)  schools, PhD producing military academies; and   Cyber Operations (CAE-CO) a deeply technical, inter-disciplinary, higher education  programme.  Lastly but not least, the DoD has been vocal about the challenge of recruiting and retaining  cyber talent due to competition with industry170. The DoD Cyber Workforce Framework171 was  developed in 2020 and was defined in DoD Directive 8140.01. It works as a lexicon and refines  ‘all of the DoD’s cyber skillsets needed to conduct its missions into 54 roles’172.  D.3 ORGANISE CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES AND CHALLENGES  UNITED KINGDOM  The ‘Cybersecurity Challenge’ was established in 2010 in order to organise a series of national  competitions, learning programmes and networking initiatives to attract more people from  diverse backgrounds to become cybersecurity professionals173. It also acts as an ‘entry point for  students into other UK wide educational programmes such as Cyber First, Cyber Discovery and  the Cyber Centurion competition174.  UNITED STATES  The US Cyber Challenge (USCC)175 is a national programme that organises cybersecurity  camps and competitions targeting students. Free online competitions, called Cyber Quests, are  conducted every year in order to assess the cybersecurity knowledge of participants.  Depending on their performance, contestants may be invited to Cyber Camps where  cybersecurity training sessions taught by top instructors take place.  Additionally, in 2019 the President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition176 was established. It  targets federal employees. The competition aims to identify cybersecurity talents inside the  federal workforce, through challenges focusing on all cybersecurity areas covered by the NICE  Framework.  169 NSA, National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity, https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students- educators/centers-academic-excellence/  170 Defence Systems (2021) Inconsistent job coding may undercut DOD’s cyber workforce efforts,  https://defensesystems.com/articles/2021/08/10/dod-cyber-jobs-ig.aspx  171 DoD Cyber Workforce Framework, https://public.cyber.mil/cw/dcwf/  172 FCW (2021) Pentagon readies new policy to boost cyber workforce amid recruitment challenges,  https://fcw.com/articles/2021/04/22/williams-dod-cyber-workforce.aspx  173 Cybersecurity Challenge, https://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/  174 Ibid.  175 U.S. Cyber Challenge, https://www.uscyberchallenge.org/about  176 President’s Cup Cybersecurity Competition, https://www.cisa.gov/presidentscup  https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/ https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/ https://defensesystems.com/articles/2021/08/10/dod-cyber-jobs-ig.aspx https://public.cyber.mil/cw/dcwf/ https://fcw.com/articles/2021/04/22/williams-dod-cyber-workforce.aspx https://cybersecuritychallenge.org.uk/ https://www.uscyberchallenge.org/about https://www.cisa.gov/presidentscup  ADDRESSING THE EU CYBERSECURITY SKILLS  SHORTAGE AND GAP THROUGH HIGHER EDUCATION  November 2021  66  E ANNEX:  LIST OF CYBERHEAD  PROGRAMMES  Annex E presents a list of the 126 programmes published in CyberHEAD and whose data were  used in drafting this report.

Established in 2004 and  strengthened by the EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT products, services and  processes with cybersecurity certification schemes, cooperates with Member States and EU  bodies, and helps Europe prepare for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge  sharing, capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with its key  stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to boost resilience of the Union’s  infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure. More  information about ENISA and its work can be found here: www.enisa.europa.eu.  ISBN 978-92-9204-540-1  doi: 10.2824/033355",
    "abstract": "In this report, ENISA contributes to both practice and research on the cybersecurity skills shortage and gap in two distinctive areas. Firstly, it provides an overview of the current supply of cybersecurity skills in Europe through an analysis of data gathered and generated by the recently established Cybersecurity Higher Education Database (CyberHEAD). Secondly, it describes the policy approaches adopted by EU Member States in their quest to increase and sustain their national cybersecurity workforces. These approaches have been classified and analysed based on objectives defined by ENISA’s National Capabilities Assessment Framework (NCAF), namely cybersecurity awareness, training, challenges and exercises. Based on the data collected and analysed, this report makes five recommendations to address the EU cybersecurity skills shortage and gap."

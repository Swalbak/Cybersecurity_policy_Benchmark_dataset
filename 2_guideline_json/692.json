ENISA can influence both growth of the IT security market in Europe and enable significant value in the  wider economy:   ENISA can influence the European IT security market by increasing demand, reducing workforce  shortfall and increasing revenues for companies domiciled in Europe   ENISA can bring influence and transparency to achieve the potential value enabled by mature IT  security in Europe by reporting leading and lagging metrics that describe how security is influencing  adoption of value-adding technologies  1 REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 SECTION 1, SCOPE OBJECTIVES AND TASKS, Article 1,Subject matter and Scope: This Regulation establishes a  European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA, hereinafter ‘the Agency’) to undertake the tasks assigned to it for the purpose  of contributing to a high level of network and information security within the Union and in order to raise awareness of network and information  security and to develop and promote a culture, of network and information security in society for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and  public sector organisations in the Union, thus contributing to the establishment and proper functioning of the internal market.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  2  I Messages   ICT is the backbone every modern society, thus the EU needs to become the single market of preference  for governments and industry where trusted core NIS technologies and services for industry and citizens  are concerned (i.e. Trust in EU products and services).   The EU needs an industry policy approach to create a competitive EU based ICT industry. ENISA can  promote and support such an approach in the area of cybersecurity:  o Promote cooperation of EU SMEs to compete together in global tenders.  o Use public procurement2 to foster EU based ICT industry by e.g. enforcing the requirement of  standards and technical guidelines3.  o Further strengthen the EU position in areas like software, smart cards, cryptography.  o ENISA should be an advisor in the Commissioner’s Industry Advisory Group.   ENISA provides advice on developing legislation, but is unique in its ability to support the  implementation of legislation.  o ENISA is by regulation involved in the implementation of the 2009 telecommunication package  and the 2014 eIDAS Regulation4.  o ENISA is well positioned to support the Commission in implementing the NIS Directive and the  cybersecurity component of the Digital Single Market (DSM) approach.  o The Agency could also play a valuable role in supporting the upcoming General Data Protection  Regulation.   ENISA to become the platform to bring together public and private sector  o ENISA to drive the content of the NIS platform and ensure alignment with its strategy and work  program. This would result in more direct impact.  o ENISA should be given an advisory role in H2020 and could also be charged with setting up a  framework to ensure that H2020 ideas in cybersecurity result in commercial services and  products.  o ENISA to become a key advisor to standardisation committees.  o Obligation to call upon ENISA to advise in EU in legislative processes.   ENISA aligns the objectives and strategies of the Member States and Commission (DG CNECT).  o ENISA to be involved in Commissions’ communication regarding the Mandate extension.  2 The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be worth around one-sixth of total GDP in the EU.  3 By competition! Currently there is no real incentive for investment in e.g. common criteria certified products  4 REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  3  II Cyber Challenges  When talking about cyber threats, it is usual to distinguish different categories:  Cyber Trust  EU citizens and business need to have the trust to make the best use of ICT.  Cyber Privacy EU citizens need to have the confidence that all their online activity is protected in  line with the principles set down in the EU law.  Cyber Crime Crime on the internet has a new dimension. Modern technology allows organized  crime to scale their “business”, especially outside the legal boundaries of states.  Cyber Espionage Military/state/industrial espionage has existed for thousands of years. The only  difference between traditional espionage and cyber espionage is the use of  technology and as long as we have civil intelligence agencies it will not stop.  Another aspect is espionage because of philosophical disagreement5.  Cyber Sabotage The disruption if IT based infrastructure (e.g. Stuxnet).  Cyber Warfare A new type of asymmetric warfare with a new paradigm and no taxonomy.  The challenge is that from a threat perspective the one who is attacked cannot on first sight analyse the  origin of the threat.  Also, the governments still are organized in silos: i.e. Ministry for Defense, Ministry for  Economy, Ministry for Interior, etc.  5 e.g. some countries see industrial espionage as part of their social behaviour  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  4  III.EU and the Internet/ICT Industry  ICT is the backbone of every modern society, and here the EU needs to become the single market of choice  for governments and industry, where trusted core NIS technologies and services for industry and citizens are  concerned (i.e. Trust in EU products and services). However, over the past 15 years Europe has lost its leading  position in ICT technology. All the new global players, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Cisco, etc.  are from the United States. In addition, Chinese companies like Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Huawei, etc. have  sprung up in the last 10 years with the same or similar business models as US companies. “Old” companies like  IBM, Microsoft, HP, etc. still dominate the market. This leaves only a few big players from the EU such as SAP  or Nokia, the latter owned and strongly influenced by Microsoft. This problem needs to be urgently addressed.  The EU should seek to achieve a reasonable balance between measures that are derived  from strong ethical principles and measures reflecting current business practices that could  more effectively stimulate economic growth throughout the EU.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  5  IV. Issues & Proposed Solutions  #1  Current attempts to improve NIS throughout the EU  often do not achieve an optimal balance between  opportunity and risk. This reduces the effectiveness  of the overall approach and increases costs for both  the public and private sector.  ENISA produces Threat Landscape Reports and its  working with relevant stakeholders  Explanation  - There is no EU strategy for developing pool of competence that would establish the EU as leaders in the  field of cybersecurity.  - Current approaches to NIS throughout the EU concentrate on reducing risk rather than looking at what  level of risk is compatible with the business opportunity.  - Companies often set very risk-averse security policies at the board level, but need to take risk in practice  in order to benefit from market opportunities. This leads to a reactive approach where companies spend  a lot of money to close audit points.  - Security is perceived as a cost and not as an enabler.  How ENISA can make a difference  - Assist the Commission and the Member States in ensuring that EU cybersecurity strategy and EU industrial  policy are strongly aligned. Identify areas where the EU is well positioned to be a global leader and assist  in defining long-term plans for building up these competencies.  - Promote industry to reason in terms of the balance between opportunities and risks and not just to  concentrate on risk.  - Develop the ENISA Threat Landscape on a sectorial basis.  - Ensure that public policy can be implemented in an economically efficient way by promoting those good  practices that are economically efficient.  - Place more emphasis on solutions for SMEs and small market players.  - Define and implement a wide-reaching programme of security evangelism to ensure that key messages  spread between all sections of the community.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  6  #2  The internal market for security products and  services is not functioning correctly. The EU  security market is dominated by US companies  and functions on a ‘supply push’ principle rather  than a ‘demand pull’ principle.  ENISA is working closely with the key  stakeholders to support development of policy to  address these challenges.  Explanation  - The EU market for security products and services is dominated by non-EU companies.  - Economically, in risk terms, if Europe cannot provide confidence to enterprise and citizens on security then  €640b of economic value is at stake.  - The market is not an efficient market – it works by ‘supply push’ rather than by ‘demand pull’.  - Security is seen more as a cost centre than a business requirement. Budgets are therefore kept to a  minimum as they are not seen as contributing to the bottom line.  - EU NIS policy has traditionally concentrated on the telecommunications sector, whereas increasingly  security issues are becoming associated with the applications and services that use this infrastructure. It  would make more sense to talk about ‘critical information services’ than ‘critical information  infrastructure’.  - There is a gap in the market security needs to be more targeted for SMEs.  How ENISA can make a difference  - ENISA has developed a strong network of stakeholders in both the public and private sector and can call  upon these at any time to support policy initiatives. The ENISA approach to working with its stakeholders  greatly increases the scalability of its operations and results in a feeling of ‘ownership’ and a high level of  buy-in.  - Update the Commission’s 2009 study on the security market and provide targeted recommendations for  improvement.  - Stimulate ‘collective demand’ by getting different industry sectors to define security requirements on a  sector-by-sector basis. Use these requirements to drive procurement policies in these sectors.  - Assist the Commission in broadening the scope of current CIIP policy to other industry sectors. Produce a  roadmap and assist in implementation.  - Work together with industry to define and disseminate approaches to security adapted to the needs of  SMEs. Actively promote the uptake of such methods (e.g. by using the representative committee referred  to above).  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  7  #3  The area of privacy and data protection is moving  from a legal and principle-based debate to an  implementation phase.  The EU has a strong policy  in this area but is very weak in terms of  implemented solutions.  ENISA is engaging with the key stakeholders in this  area identifying solutions and is supporting  implementation  Explanation  - The revelations of Snowden have brought the issues of privacy and data protection into the public  spotlight. The EU needs to deliver concrete results to back up its ambitious proposal for a new legal  framework.  - Current processes and tools for managing privacy and data protection need to be greatly enhanced if we  are to achieve the goals of this legislation. It would be a mistake to wait until the legislation has been  adopted to start working on the processes and tools needed to implement the proposal.  - If the implementation details are not well thought out, there is a real danger that the EU will implement  policies in a ‘business unfriendly’ manner, thereby potentially reducing the competitiveness of EU industry.  - This area could also be an opportunity for EU business, allowing it to develop an expertise that is  underdeveloped in the global market place.  How ENISA can make a difference  - Identify existing methods and tools that could be used to implement the proposals of the regulation.  Suggest which methods and tools could provide the best cost/benefit based on current operational  experience.  - Identify ‘gaps’, where current methods and tools do not fulfil the requirements of the legal proposal.  Identify the requirements that need to be met and provide them to industry and to R&D programmes (e.g.  H2020).  - Help the Commission and Member States to move the privacy and data protection debate towards  implementation strategies.  - Provide feedback to those working on the legislative framework as to what is feasible and what is not  feasible from an operational perspective.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  8  #4  Current EU research & development activities are  not giving rise to successful services and products in  the EU Network & Information Security.  ENISA can brings its expertise and knowledge to  supporting initiatives such as H2020 and CEF  Explanation  - We are lagging behind the US in terms of security-related products – this is a fact.  - Whereas we developed a lead in certain areas in the past (e.g. EU cryptography) this has now been lost as  the US has adapted its policy on cryptography to support its industry.  - EU research in security is of a high standard, but it does not result in products and services – there is a  ‘process gap’ linking EU R&D in security to industry.  - H2020 now includes innovation as a goal, but it has a wide scope and will need to be actively supported  by other EU mechanisms if it is to succeed.  - The funding models in the EU need to be adapted to the current economic environment. We need new  models for venture capital (such as crowd funding).  How ENISA can make a difference:  - ENISA should implement a security ‘Technology Watch’ with the goal of identifying promising NIS  technology developments before other global powers.  - Assist the EU in leveraging the position of ‘trust’ that the EU has developed over the last few years to  support our security products (we are not weakened by Snowdon type revelations or human rights issues).  - Work together with universities and EU companies specialising in security to define and implement a  framework for rapid implementation of EU research ideas in industry environments. Ensure a feedback  mechanism to enable research to improve products together with industry.  - ENISA should be given a stronger role in participating H2020 projects in the area of NIS. In order to achieve  scalability, the ENISA regulation should be changed so as to allow the Agency to receive funds for this.  - ENISA should promote ideas that support EU security products without naming them – this could be done  on the basis of concepts where we have stronger implementation.  - Participate in important conferences outside the EU to influence the way in which NIS is perceived in  favour of the EU approach.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  9  #5  Standardisation and certification activities are not  sufficiently aligned with modern needs of the  industry.  ENISA can use the Cyber Security Coordination  Group to ensure that standards are aligned with  industry needs.  Explanation  - Proprietary standards increase the cost for the consumer and can result in ‘lock in’ to particular products.  - Standards are the basis of interoperability. If the EU does not develop the right standards it will not benefit  from interoperable products.  - Currently, industry is not the major driving force behind new standards, which may reduce their level of  buy-in to the final result.  - Technical guidelines developed with EU ICT companies give them a competitive advantage.  - Existing certification schemes are under-utilised:  o for products e.g. “Common Criteria6”  o for infrastructure e.g. “BSI Baseline Protection”  o for Cloud computing e.g. ENISA’s Cloud Certification Schemes List (CCSL).  How ENISA can make a difference  - ENISA should proactively foster the development of relevant standards by active participation in ISO, ETSI,  CEN/CENELEC and other relevant standardisation groups.  - Use the Cyber Security Coordination Group to ensure that standards are aligned with industry needs. Use  best practice as a precursor to standards in order to speed up implementation.  - Promote the development of technical guidelines for security in promising areas of innovation  (e.g. Smart  Cities, Internet of Things).  - Promote certification schemes by active contribution to initiatives such as the SOGIS7 group and facilitate  industry involvement.  6 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org  7 http://www.sogisportal.eu  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  10  #6  Knowledge and skills related to network and  information security are developed and maintained  in a fragmented manner. There is no coherent  approach for educating citizens, private sector and  government.  ENISA will continue promote IT Security behaviour  via national associations to outreach to citizens by  building on initiatives such as the Cyber Security  Month  Explanation  - Legislators need to understand the impact of their regulation. Technology impact assessments should  become obligatory.  - Industry must understand threats and risks and must be capable of maintaining this knowledge in the long-  term.  - Citizens must understand the consequences of their behaviour, surfing on the internet, buying in online  shops, doing online banking.  How ENISA can make a difference  - Work together with schools, universities and professional associations to create a coherent framework for  raising awareness and education in NIS. Assist industry in aligning skill sets with career paths.  - Organise events in Brussels where ENISA experts inform Politicians in legislative processes on security in  the corresponding field (e.g. Cloud Computing, Data protection and privacy, etc.).  - Educate CISOs (e.g. ENISA risk methodology, ENISA Threat Landscape).  - Promote IT Security behaviour via national associations to outreach to citizens by building on initiatives  such as the Cyber Security Month and the DsiN Cloud Scout8 in Germany.  8 https://www.sicher-im-netz.de/dsin-cloud-scout-der-cebit-2013  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  11  #7  The EU has Agencies in the area of ICT and security  like EU Lisa, Frontex, Europol/EC3, CEPOL, Eurojust,  EEAS, EDA, ENISA.  ENISA will work to ensure that all activities of these  Agencies are complementary to one other to  effective respond to the overall cyber challenges.  Explanation  ENISA is well integrated in the EU approach to Cybersecurity, but could take a more proactive role in ensuring  effective and efficient information exchange between other EU agencies and bodies. The Agency could also  act as coordinator for all activities in other agencies related to cybersecurity preparation.  How ENISA can make a difference  - ENISA to coordinate the NIS and cybersecurity activities of all EU agencies in line with existing policy  statements in order to ensure a coherent approach across all communities.  - ENISA to advise the key Steering Committees and Advisory Boards for all Agencies and bodies involved in  NIS as well as for all major NIS initiatives launched by the EU.  - ENISA to advise the key Steering Committees and Advisory Boards of Industrial Consortia that have a role  in improving NIS.  - ENISA to influence policy development and implementation by being recognized as the focal point for NIS  and cybersecurity for both the public and private sector.  - ENISA can strengthen the role and coordination of the CSIRT across Member States and EU institutions.  Support from the Commission  - The Commission should ensure that future EU policies, legislation and programmes recognize the central  coordination role of ENISA in ensuring a coherent approach to cybersecurity across the EU, both in terms  of Member States and in terms of communities.  - The Commission should actively support ENISA in its effort to be present on the key Steering Committees  and Advisory Boards for all Agencies involved in NIS as well as for all major NIS initiatives launched by the  EU.  - The Commission should promote ENISA as the focal point of NIS and cybersecurity.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  12  IV Summary  The Agency has a number of ‘flagships’, which can be used as a platform for launching new, more ambitious  services to support the Commission, Member States, EU Institutions and EU Citizens. Examples include the  Pan-European Cybersecurity Exercises, the ENISA Threat Landscape, support for implementation of Security &  Data Breach Notification obligations, the EU Cybersecurity Month and the work that ENISA has done in  supporting the CSIRT community in the Member States and EU Institutions.  ENISA is ready, willing and able to:  - Assist the Commission and the Member States in ensuring that EU cybersecurity strategy and EU industrial  policy are strongly aligned.  - Identify areas where the EU is well positioned to be a global leader in NIS and assist in defining long-term  plans for building up these competencies.  - Stimulate ‘collective demand’ for NIS services and products by getting different industry sectors to define  security requirements and drive procurement on a sector-by-sector basis.  - Encourage industry to balance opportunities and risks and not just to concentrate on risk, enabling  businesses to improve business models (scalability, flexibility, agility).  - Promote approaches to security adapted to the needs of SMEs. Establish a representative group of SMEs  to act as a communication channel for security issues dedicated to the SMEs in the EU.  - Actively promote implementation activities to support the new proposed privacy and data protection  legislation so as to avoid an ‘implementation gap’ once the legislation is passed.  - Work together with universities and industry to define and implement a framework for rapid  implementation of EU security research ideas in industry environments. Ensure a feedback mechanism to  enable research to improve products together with industry.  - Use the Cyber Security Coordination Group to ensure that standards are aligned with industry needs.  Foster the development of relevant standards by active participation in relevant standardisation groups.  - Work together with schools, universities and professional associations to create a coherent framework for  raising awareness and education in NIS. Assist industry in aligning skill sets with career paths.",

Identify the requirements that need to be met and provide them to industry and to R&D programmes (e.g.  H2020).  - Help the Commission and Member States to move the privacy and data protection debate towards  implementation strategies.  - Provide feedback to those working on the legislative framework as to what is feasible and what is not  feasible from an operational perspective.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  8  #4  Current EU research & development activities are  not giving rise to successful services and products in  the EU Network & Information Security.  ENISA can brings its expertise and knowledge to  supporting initiatives such as H2020 and CEF  Explanation  - We are lagging behind the US in terms of security-related products – this is a fact.  - Whereas we developed a lead in certain areas in the past (e.g. EU cryptography) this has now been lost as  the US has adapted its policy on cryptography to support its industry.  - EU research in security is of a high standard, but it does not result in products and services – there is a  ‘process gap’ linking EU R&D in security to industry.  - H2020 now includes innovation as a goal, but it has a wide scope and will need to be actively supported  by other EU mechanisms if it is to succeed.  - The funding models in the EU need to be adapted to the current economic environment. We need new  models for venture capital (such as crowd funding).  How ENISA can make a difference:  - ENISA should implement a security ‘Technology Watch’ with the goal of identifying promising NIS  technology developments before other global powers.  - Assist the EU in leveraging the position of ‘trust’ that the EU has developed over the last few years to  support our security products (we are not weakened by Snowdon type revelations or human rights issues).  - Work together with universities and EU companies specialising in security to define and implement a  framework for rapid implementation of EU research ideas in industry environments. Ensure a feedback  mechanism to enable research to improve products together with industry.  - ENISA should be given a stronger role in participating H2020 projects in the area of NIS. In order to achieve  scalability, the ENISA regulation should be changed so as to allow the Agency to receive funds for this.  - ENISA should promote ideas that support EU security products without naming them – this could be done  on the basis of concepts where we have stronger implementation.  - Participate in important conferences outside the EU to influence the way in which NIS is perceived in  favour of the EU approach.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  9  #5  Standardisation and certification activities are not  sufficiently aligned with modern needs of the  industry.  ENISA can use the Cyber Security Coordination  Group to ensure that standards are aligned with  industry needs.  Explanation  - Proprietary standards increase the cost for the consumer and can result in ‘lock in’ to particular products.  - Standards are the basis of interoperability. If the EU does not develop the right standards it will not benefit  from interoperable products.  - Currently, industry is not the major driving force behind new standards, which may reduce their level of  buy-in to the final result.  - Technical guidelines developed with EU ICT companies give them a competitive advantage.  - Existing certification schemes are under-utilised:  o for products e.g. “Common Criteria6”  o for infrastructure e.g. “BSI Baseline Protection”  o for Cloud computing e.g. ENISA’s Cloud Certification Schemes List (CCSL).  How ENISA can make a difference  - ENISA should proactively foster the development of relevant standards by active participation in ISO, ETSI,  CEN/CENELEC and other relevant standardisation groups.  - Use the Cyber Security Coordination Group to ensure that standards are aligned with industry needs. Use  best practice as a precursor to standards in order to speed up implementation.  - Promote the development of technical guidelines for security in promising areas of innovation  (e.g. Smart  Cities, Internet of Things).  - Promote certification schemes by active contribution to initiatives such as the SOGIS7 group and facilitate  industry involvement.  6 http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org  7 http://www.sogisportal.eu  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  10  #6  Knowledge and skills related to network and  information security are developed and maintained  in a fragmented manner. There is no coherent  approach for educating citizens, private sector and  government.  ENISA will continue promote IT Security behaviour  via national associations to outreach to citizens by  building on initiatives such as the Cyber Security  Month  Explanation  - Legislators need to understand the impact of their regulation. Technology impact assessments should  become obligatory.  - Industry must understand threats and risks and must be capable of maintaining this knowledge in the long-  term.  - Citizens must understand the consequences of their behaviour, surfing on the internet, buying in online  shops, doing online banking.  How ENISA can make a difference  - Work together with schools, universities and professional associations to create a coherent framework for  raising awareness and education in NIS. Assist industry in aligning skill sets with career paths.  - Organise events in Brussels where ENISA experts inform Politicians in legislative processes on security in  the corresponding field (e.g. Cloud Computing, Data protection and privacy, etc.).  - Educate CISOs (e.g. ENISA risk methodology, ENISA Threat Landscape).  - Promote IT Security behaviour via national associations to outreach to citizens by building on initiatives  such as the Cyber Security Month and the DsiN Cloud Scout8 in Germany.  8 https://www.sicher-im-netz.de/dsin-cloud-scout-der-cebit-2013  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  11  #7  The EU has Agencies in the area of ICT and security  like EU Lisa, Frontex, Europol/EC3, CEPOL, Eurojust,  EEAS, EDA, ENISA.  ENISA will work to ensure that all activities of these  Agencies are complementary to one other to  effective respond to the overall cyber challenges.  Explanation  ENISA is well integrated in the EU approach to Cybersecurity, but could take a more proactive role in ensuring  effective and efficient information exchange between other EU agencies and bodies. The Agency could also  act as coordinator for all activities in other agencies related to cybersecurity preparation.  How ENISA can make a difference  - ENISA to coordinate the NIS and cybersecurity activities of all EU agencies in line with existing policy  statements in order to ensure a coherent approach across all communities.  - ENISA to advise the key Steering Committees and Advisory Boards for all Agencies and bodies involved in  NIS as well as for all major NIS initiatives launched by the EU.  - ENISA to advise the key Steering Committees and Advisory Boards of Industrial Consortia that have a role  in improving NIS.  - ENISA to influence policy development and implementation by being recognized as the focal point for NIS  and cybersecurity for both the public and private sector.  - ENISA can strengthen the role and coordination of the CSIRT across Member States and EU institutions.  Support from the Commission  - The Commission should ensure that future EU policies, legislation and programmes recognize the central  coordination role of ENISA in ensuring a coherent approach to cybersecurity across the EU, both in terms  of Member States and in terms of communities.  - The Commission should actively support ENISA in its effort to be present on the key Steering Committees  and Advisory Boards for all Agencies involved in NIS as well as for all major NIS initiatives launched by the  EU.  - The Commission should promote ENISA as the focal point of NIS and cybersecurity.  Boosting IT Security made in Europe  12  IV Summary  The Agency has a number of ‘flagships’, which can be used as a platform for launching new, more ambitious  services to support the Commission, Member States, EU Institutions and EU Citizens. Examples include the  Pan-European Cybersecurity Exercises, the ENISA Threat Landscape, support for implementation of Security &  Data Breach Notification obligations, the EU Cybersecurity Month and the work that ENISA has done in  supporting the CSIRT community in the Member States and EU Institutions.  ENISA is ready, willing and able to:  - Assist the Commission and the Member States in ensuring that EU cybersecurity strategy and EU industrial  policy are strongly aligned.  - Identify areas where the EU is well positioned to be a global leader in NIS and assist in defining long-term  plans for building up these competencies.  - Stimulate ‘collective demand’ for NIS services and products by getting different industry sectors to define  security requirements and drive procurement on a sector-by-sector basis.  - Encourage industry to balance opportunities and risks and not just to concentrate on risk, enabling  businesses to improve business models (scalability, flexibility, agility).  - Promote approaches to security adapted to the needs of SMEs. Establish a representative group of SMEs  to act as a communication channel for security issues dedicated to the SMEs in the EU.  - Actively promote implementation activities to support the new proposed privacy and data protection  legislation so as to avoid an ‘implementation gap’ once the legislation is passed.  - Work together with universities and industry to define and implement a framework for rapid  implementation of EU security research ideas in industry environments. Ensure a feedback mechanism to  enable research to improve products together with industry.  - Use the Cyber Security Coordination Group to ensure that standards are aligned with industry needs.  Foster the development of relevant standards by active participation in relevant standardisation groups.  - Work together with schools, universities and professional associations to create a coherent framework for  raising awareness and education in NIS. Assist industry in aligning skill sets with career paths.",

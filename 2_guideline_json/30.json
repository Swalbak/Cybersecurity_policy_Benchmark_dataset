So, too, are the challenges. When it comes to cybersecurity, the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) has a long history of conducting path-breaking research and development, cultivating standards  and best practices, and facilitating technology transitions. We rely on open, transparent, and collaborative processes that  engage private and public sector participation and attract expertise from around the world. This 2016 report captures our  most noteworthy accomplishments.  In 2016, NIST continued to advance fundamental research to support security and interoperability standards and  guidelines. This work was led by the Computer Security Division (CSD) in the NIST Information Technology Laboratory  (ITL). Among other things, CSD is responsible for developing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for  the protection of non-national security federal information systems. Recognizing the agency’s need to respond to and  anticipate increasing demands for its cybersecurity expertise, NIST established the Applied Cybersecurity Division (ACD)  within ITL to support additional applied research and to transition effective cybersecurity technology approaches to  government and business sectors nationwide. ACD helps to drive the adoption of appropriate cybersecurity solutions by  government and commercial organizations – enabling solutions-oriented collaborative interactions and offering guidance  on the use of research results, standards, and best practices. Other parts of NIST also are key contributors to NIST’s  cybersecurity portfolio.  Strong partnerships with industry, academia and government are critical to NIST’s cybersecurity program. In 2016,  NIST continued to collaborate with stakeholders from across the country and around the world to raise awareness and  encourage use of the voluntary Cybersecurity Framework. In this spirit, NIST began to develop an update to the version first  published in 2014. NIST also prepared a draft Cybersecurity Framework profile aligned with manufacturing sector goals and  industry best practices. In addition, NIST developed the draft Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder self-assessment tool  that complements the Cybersecurity Framework and helps organizations to better understand the effectiveness of their  cybersecurity risk management efforts.  Looking ahead is vital in the realm of cybersecurity. Knowing that if large-scale quantum computers are ever built,  they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use and compromise the confidentiality and  integrity of digital communication on the Internet and elsewhere, NIST is working closely with the academic community and  industry to develop protective cryptographic standards that we all rely upon. Building on its successful tradition of working  openly with the worldwide cryptographic community, in 2016 NIST called for submissions for quantum-resistant public-key  cryptographic algorithms for standards. These algorithms must be secure against both quantum and classical computers,  and should interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. After submissions are received late in  2017, NIST plans to spend 3-5 years working with the research community and industry to analyze the candidates before  selecting algorithms for standardization.  Identity management is fundamental to security management. In 2016, NIST continued to advance solutions in identity  management through projects with partners who manage innovative but practical real-world solutions. Also in the past  year, NIST produced an introduction to the concepts of privacy engineering and risk management for federal information  systems. The goal is to help decrease privacy risks and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource  allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems. NIST also initiated an update to our Digital  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Building from these foundational resources, NIST’s efforts will focus on strengthening the  security, privacy, usability and interoperability of digital identity solutions that meet an organization’s identity and access  management needs throughout the system lifecycle.  During 2016, NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) moved into a new permanent facility that  expanded the Center’s workspace from four to 23 separate, flexible laboratories—including two larger areas capable of  safely hosting large equipment, such as automobiles. This additional space allows NCCoE to increase its collaborations  and projects. In 2016, the Center published draft practice guides to support industry sectors, including healthcare, financial  services, and energy; these guides are now beginning to be put to productive use. NCCoE also published draft documents  to support security in key technology areas, such as cloud computing and mobile applications.  The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by NIST, is a partnership between government, academia,  and the private sector that is focused on promoting a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education,  training, and workforce development. In 2016, NIST released an update to the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework  (NCWF); it already is being used in the private and public sectors to more effectively identify, recruit, develop and maintain  cybersecurity talent. The NICE framework provides a common language to categorize and describe cybersecurity work that  helps organizations to build a strong staff to protect systems and data.  Our dedicated staff has accomplished a great deal in 2016, developing standards and working closely with scores  of partners and drawing upon hundreds of private and public sector organizations and individuals. This is not a static  endeavor. For example, NIST is fully aware of the urgent need to more aggressively address the security challenges of the  Internet of Things and, more broadly, our connected world.  We welcome any and all suggestions about where and how we can better provide the nation with the kind of  cybersecurity information and tools that it needs in order to advance and protect our economy and our country.

This change reflects the opportunity to describe the many  cybersecurity program highlights and accomplishments from throughout the laboratory. This Annual Report is organized into  several sections, each identified by a title page.  Please note: This Annual Report covers the Federal Government’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 from October 1, 2015 to September  30, 2016.  ITL, an operating unit under NIST, contains seven divisions. Five of these seven divisions are involved with cybersecurity  efforts at NIST. Throughout this Annual Report, there are some references to particular division activities, and to work by  groups within those divisions. Primarily, the authors have attributed accomplishments to ITL, since ITL staff have been  involved with each cybersecurity program included in this Annual Report. At the end of each program/project write-up, one  or more points of contact are provided and may be used to address questions or request for more information. Many sections  also include additional references that readers may find valuable.

Title III of the E-Government Act, titled  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  of 2002, included the duties and responsibilities for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information  Technology Laboratory. There are multiple divisions within  ITL that are involved with cybersecurity programs/projects.  The work is being conducted collaboratively between the  divisions. In December 2014, the 113th Congress updated  FISMA as the Federal Information Security Modernization  Act (Public Law 113-283). NIST ITL responsibilities were  unchanged in the update. In 2016, the ITL Cybersecurity  Program addressed its assignment through the following  major activities:  •  Forty-three NIST Special Publications (SP) (20  approved as final and 23 drafts) were issued,  providing management, operational, and  technical security guidelines in topic areas  including:  The 2015 annual report; cryptography  (cryptographic standards used for the Federal  Government, block cipher modes of operation,  key management, random bit generator (RBG),  Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) cryptography,  transitioning the use of cryptographic algorithms  and key lengths); mobile security (enterprise  telework, remote access and bring-your-own  device (BYOD), mobile device security – cloud  and hybrid builds): application whitelisting; cyber  threat sharing; cybersecurity event recovery; data- centric system threat modeling; de-identifying  government datasets; asset management –  financial services; guidelines for checklist users  and developers; networks of “things”; personal  identification verification (PIV); protecting  Controlled Unclassified Information within  nonfederal information systems and organizations;  securing Apple Operating System (OS) X; security  content automation protocol (SCAP); systems  engineering; trustworthy email; and virtual  machine (VM) protection.  •  Thirty-one NIST Interagency/Internal Reports  (NISTIR) (18 approved as final and 13 drafts)  were issued on a variety of topics, including:  Cryptography (post-quantum cryptography,  lightweight cryptography, NIST cryptographic  standards and guidelines development process);  mobile security (mobile devices, infrastructure  and platforms); attribute metadata; automation  support for security control assessments;  catalyzing the identity ecosystem; de-identification  of personal information; Long-Term Evolution  (LTE) architecture overview and security analysis;  PIV; policy machine (access control framework);  public safety mobile applications; SCAP; security  of interactive and automated access management  using Secure Shell (SSH); software identification  (SWID) tags; strategic U.S. Government  engagement in international standardization;  trusted geolocation in the cloud; and vulnerability  description ontology (VDO).  • T he National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) moved into a new permanent facility:  This facility was made possible by the state of  Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland,  and has almost 60,000 square feet of modern  physical space and IT systems. The new facility  expanded the Center’s workspace from four  to twenty-two separate, flexible laboratories— including two larger areas capable of safely  housing large equipment (including a vehicle that  will be used in an upcoming project on auto- related cybersecurity issues). This additional  space allows NCCoE to increase its collaboration  and to undertake new projects.  •  The Strategic Plan for the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) was issued:  With a mission of energizing and promoting a  robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity  education, training, and workforce development,  this plan lays out important goals for the  cybersecurity workforce. (See:  http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/about/strategicplan. html)  •  A draft Cybersecurity Framework profile for  manufacturers was developed and issued:  This profile can be used as a roadmap for reducing  cybersecurity risk for manufacturers and is aligned  with manufacturing sector goals and industry best  practices.

(See:  https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/ baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative)  •  Continued to research, evaluate and develop  standards for Post-Quantum Cryptography  (PQC):  NIST announced a Call for Proposals to solicit,  evaluate, and standardize quantum-resistant  public key cryptography (a.k.a. post-quantum  cryptography (PQC)) algorithms through a Federal  Register Notice (FRN). The team solicited public  comments regarding requirements and evaluation  criteria, which were subsequently finalized. NIST  plans to spend three to five years analyzing the  submitted algorithms before selecting algorithms  for standardization, during which time NIST will  engage with the research community through  conferences and workshops.  •  Initiated a lightweight cryptography project  to study the performance of the current  NIST-approved cryptographic standards on  constrained devices:  To better understand the need for dedicated  lightweight cryptography, ITL has created a  portfolio of lightweight primitives through an  open process. ITL will evaluate and recommend  algorithms based on profiles, which consist of a set  of design goals, physical characteristics of target  devices, performance characteristics imposed by  the applications, and security characteristics.  •  Continued to develop expertise in several critical  research areas in cryptography:  ITL continues to conduct research into post- quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum  algorithms, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC),  privacy-enhancing cryptography, and lightweight  cryptographic schemes for constrained  environments.  •  A NIST/Industry joint working group was created  to study the automation of cryptographic  implementation testing:  After working with industry on the protocol  necessary to exchange cryptographic test data  in an automated fashion, the development of  the cryptographic algorithm testing service  to be hosted at NIST was begun, with the full  implementation expected to take approximately  one year. (See: http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ acvt)  •  Continued research and reporting results in  software testing:  In software testing, the oracle problem refers  to determining the expected output for a given  set of inputs. A determination of the expected  output normally requires human involvement or a  mathematical model of the specification. ITL has  developed an oracle-free software testing method  for which NIST filed a patent application. The test  settings for an input factor may represent ranges  of values (called equivalence classes) for which the  output is expected to remain unchanged.  •  Continued research and development of a new  conformance test tool for the ANSI/NIST-ITL  Machine Readable Table (MRT) Biometric Data  Formats:  A command-line interface was developed that  tests the MRTs themselves for conformance to  the specification, in addition to testing American  National Standards Institute (ANSI)/NIST-ITL  Transactions. An initial graphical user interface was  also developed to allow an easy-to-use software  suite for end users. National standard bodies  were encouraged to further the advancements of  biometric data interchange format standards.  •  Represented the NIST/NTIA PSCR (Public Safety  Communications Research Program), FirstNet  (the US First Responders’ Network Authority),  and Public Safety stakeholders in the 3GPP (Third  Generation Partnership Project):  The International Standards Organization,  which is developing the next-generation  telecommunications standard, LTE (Long Term  Evolution), is ensuring that features critical to Public  Safety are incorporated into the standards.  •  Continued refinement and support for the USG  Federal Identity Program:  In continued support of Homeland Security  Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal  Information Processing Standard 201-2 (FIPS 201- 2), the NIST Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Program updated and refined several supporting  documents.

C O N T A C T :  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro  (301) 975-6414  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov  N e x t  G e n e r a t i o n  A c c e s s  C o n t r o l  S t a n d a r d s  ITL has continued the development of an advanced  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) framework called  the Policy Machine, which was designed to be in alignment  with an emerging ANSI/INCITS standard under the title of  “Next Generation Access Control” (NGAC).  The NIST Policy Machine research and development  effort has resulted in three ongoing national standards  projects in CS1 in the early stages of development. They  include:  •  Next Generation Access Control –Functional  Architecture (NGAC-FA). Project number INCITS  499-2013, was published in FY 2013 and is  currently under revision.  •  Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC- GOADS). Serban Gavrila, ITL, is the editor. The  project is assigned project number 2195-D, and the  document was published during FY 2016.  •  Next Generation Access Control -Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions  (NGAC-IRPADS). Project number 2193-D has been  assigned. This part will be published as a technical  report in FY 2018.

ISO/IEC 19790 specifies the  security requirements for a cryptographic module utilized  within a security system protecting sensitive information  in computer and telecommunication systems. These  efforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic modules  to the global community by providing ISO-equivalent  standards representing FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules and Derived Test Requirements  [DTR] for FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules. Mr. Randall Easter (CSD) continues  as the principal editor for these standards.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Working Group (WG) 3 completed  and published revisions, followed with updated corrections,  of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and ISO/IEC 24759:2008. The  revision of ISO/IEC 19790 was published on August 15, 2012.  The revision of ISO/IEC 24759 was published on January  31, 2014. Both ISO/IEC standards were also adopted by the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI) (see:  http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO  %2FIEC+19790%3A2012). The two ISO/IEC revisions were  developed with international support and the collaboration  of governments, industry and academia. Revised corrections  of both standards were published on December 15, 2015.  The revision of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 addresses new  security areas, such as defined software module boundaries,  degraded modes of operation, trusted channels, two- factor authentication, software security, mitigation of fault  induction and side-channel attacks, operational self-tests for  algorithms, and lifecycle assurance from design to end-of- life.  Figure 2: Cryptographic Module Testing – ISO Standards  is a chart of the ISO/IEC standards, as ex-plained above,  in which CSD has played a part during the development  process.

Mr. Easter was the editor of both standards.  International Standard ISO/IEC 17825 specifies the  non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics for determining  conformance to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790  for Security Levels 3 and 4. The test metrics are associated  with the security functions specified in ISO/IEC 19790.  Testing will be conducted at the defined boundary of the  cryptographic module and using Input/Output (I/O) available  at the defined boundary .  International Standard ISO/IEC 18367 describes  conformance testing methods for cryptographic algorithms  and security mechanisms. Conformance testing assures that  an implementation of a cryptographic algorithm or security  mechanism is correct whether implemented in hardware,  software or firmware. It also confirms that it runs correctly  in a specific operating environment. Testing may consist  of known-answer or Monte Carlo testing, or a combination  of test methods. Testing may be performed on the actual  implementation or modeled in a simulation environment.  The test methods used by testing laboratories to  test whether the cryptographic module conforms to the  requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790 and the test  metrics specified in this International Standard for each of  the associated security functions specified in ISO/IEC 19790  are specified in ISO/IEC 24759. The test approach employed  in this International Standard is an efficient “push-button”  approach: the tests are technically sound, repeatable and  have moderate costs.  ITL is also the principal editor or co-editor of other ISO/ IEC documents. ITL’s contributions to the development of  these international standards create a strong foundation  for the adoption of and migration from currently used  national standards. In particular, this adoption will promote  international harmonization for the implementation and  testing of cryptographic algorithms and modules, while  accommodating individual country preferences in the choice  of approved security functions.

GICS defines an open platform where  identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used  in an interoperable way between the credential issuers and  credential users that aligns with the last revision of the NIST  SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification,  (PIV) specifications.  During FY 2017, ITL staff plans to:  •  Contribute to the publication of several revisions of  the ISO/IEC 7816 family of standards (Identification  cards - Integrated circuit cards), which are all  relevant to FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,  specifications;  •  Pursue the standardization and harmonization of  identity standards developed in the U.S.;  •  Develop requirements and identify standards gaps  for Mobile Driving Licenses;  •  Enhance the Machine-Readable Travel Documents  (ePassport) data model to address privacy and  security concerns; and  •  Contribute to the development of privacy- enhanced security protocols.  ITL staff will continue to actively support relevant ID  management standard initiatives, such as ISO/IEC 19286,  Integrated circuit card (ICC) Privacy-enhancing protocols  and services, and ISO/IEC 18328, ICC managed devices.  Web Authentication/FIDO: ITL participates in the  development of online authentication specifications.  These specifications are developed by the Fast Identities  Online (FIDO) alliance, which is a consortium of private  organizations. ITL also participates in the development of  similar specifications (called WebAuthn) for web browsers  that are being developed by the W3C consortium. Both the  FIDO and WebAuthn specifications enable relying parties to  create cryptographic tokens on the end-user’s device and  subsequently use this cryptographic token to authenticate  the end user. These specifications provide multi-factor  authentication directives, and they are designed to mitigate  common threat vectors for Internet communications, such  as phishing, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks.  ePassport: ITL participates in the development of an  ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 7501) for electronic Passports.  Specifically, ITL is contributing to the development of  passport data structure and its access control. ITL reviews  and comments on authentication protocols that are  developed to ensure strong user authentication and to  protect personally identifiable passport data.  Mobile Driver License: ITL is also participating in the  development of an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 18013) for an  International Mobile Driver License (DL). During 2016, ITL  gathered and discussed functional and security requirements  for Mobile DLs. ITL is now developing two models for the  Mobile DLs, namely, offline and online models. Once these  models are correctly defined, ITL plans to write technical  specification for each model.

Where standards are needed, ITL works closely with U.S.  industry, standards developers, other government agencies,  and leaders in the global standards community to develop  standards that will support secure cloud computing.  This standardization effort supports federal agencies in  adopting and implementing cloud computing infrastructures.  This standard work includes standards development within  the voluntary, consensus-based standards ecosystem and  the development of NIST standards and guidelines for  federal agencies, as required by government mandates.  The ITL staff participates in developing standards for many  aspects of cloud computing. ITL participation helps to  ensure the alignment of NIST standards with those of ISO/ IEC sub-committees, such as SC 27, SC 38 and their U.S.  counterparts, ANSI/INCITS CS1 and Cloud 38.

This EO directed NIST to work with  stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework—based on  existing standards, guidelines, and practices—for reducing  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructures.  The Cybersecurity Framework that was developed  provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based,  and cost-effective approach to help critical infrastructure  owners and operators—as well as other interested entities— to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity-related risk,  while protecting business confidentiality, individual privacy,  and civil liberties.  In FY 2016, ITL continued to work with a diverse  stakeholder community to support the use and understanding  of the Cybersecurity Framework. This process included:  •  Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to formally  gather stakeholder input about Framework  use, evolution, and future governance of the  Framework;  •  Conducting a public workshop at NIST in  Gaithersburg, MD to gather input about the current  use of the Framework and the need for an update  to the Framework as well as future governance of  the Framework;  •  Releasing the draft Baldrige Cybersecurity  Excellence Builder, a self-assessment tool to help  organizations better understand the effectiveness  of their cybersecurity risk management efforts;  •  Coordinating with critical infrastructure owners  and operators, regulators, and other industry  organizations through a variety of meetings and  industry events to ensure the understanding and  use of the Framework;  •  Analyzing various industry work products  (such as mapping documents) for Framework  correctness;  •  Consulting with state and local governments,  and the governments of other nations regarding  their alignment with both the principles and the  cybersecurity outcomes of the Framework;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary  goal has been to raise awareness of the Framework, and  encourage its use as a tool to help industry sectors and  organizations manage cybersecurity risks.  In FY 2017, ITL will continue to conduct stakeholder  outreach and will work collaboratively to further understand  stakeholder needs regarding tools and resources to enable  more effective use of the Framework. Additionally, in early  2017, NIST will publish a minor update to the Framework  and will minimize any disruption to current Framework  users by focusing on clarification and refinement. NIST will  also publish guidance on how Federal agencies can use  the Cybersecurity Framework, particularly illustrating how  the Risk Management Framework (Special Publication (SP)  800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security  Life Cycle Approach) and Cybersecurity Framework can  work together to help agencies develop, implement, and  continuously improve their information security programs.

During FY 2016, the ITL FISMA Implementation project  continued to strengthen collaboration through the Joint Task  Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative, which includes the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community  (IC), and the Committee on National Security Systems  (CNSS), and various federal agencies. The JTF partners  continue to develop and update key cybersecurity guidelines  for protecting federal information and information systems  as part of the Unified Information Security Framework.  Previously, the JTF developed common security guidance  in the critical areas of security controls for information  systems and organizations, security assessment procedures  to demonstrate security control effectiveness, security  authorizations for risk acceptance decisions, and continuous  monitoring activities to ensure that decision makers receive  the most up-to-date information on the security state of  their information systems. In addition, ITL worked with  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop  guidelines for automation support for security control  assessments on a security capability basis and in accordance  with the NIST RMF.  In FY 2016, the ITL FISMA Team worked on the following  initiatives:  •  System Security Engineering Initiative: The  final public draft of SP 800-160, Systems Security  Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary  Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy  Secure Systems, was published to address the  engineering-driven actions necessary to develop  more defensible and survivable systems—including  the components that compose and the services  that depend on those systems. To ensure that  the publication provides the utmost clarity and  focus for our customers, several of the supporting  appendices from the second public draft are being  recast into their own publications. SP 800-160  will become the flagship publication for the NIST  Systems Security Engineering Initiative. NIST  publications specifically addressing several key  systems security engineering considerations (i.e.,  resilience, software assurance, and hardware  assurance) will be developed and published,  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p s : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Additionally, the interaction of  the NIST RMF with the life cycle processes in SP  800-160, will be described in future updates to  existing RMF standards and guidelines.  •  Risk Management Guidelines: Work began on SP  800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls  for Systems and Organizations, with a pre-draft call  for comments, adjudication of those comments,  and coordination with our JTF partners. SP  800-53 provides organizations with the security  and privacy controls necessary to appropriately  strengthen their systems and the environments  in which those systems operate, and provides a  process for selecting the appropriate controls,  which contributes to systems that are resilient in  the face of attacks and other threats and protect  an individual’s privacy. The implementation of SP  800-53, SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal Information  Systems, and SP 800-137, Information Security  Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations, provides organizations  with near real-time information that is essential for  senior leaders making ongoing risk-based decisions  affecting their critical missions and business  functions.  •  FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private- Sector Organizations: Cybersecurity outreach  briefings were conducted and support was  provided to all levels of private-sector organizations  and government (including federal, state and local  entities) on multiple information security topics of  interest. These included, for example, an effective  implementation of the NIST RMF, contingency  planning, interconnection security agreements,  security-focused configuration management,  and information security for small businesses.  In addition, the ITL FISMA Team responded to  hundreds of inquiries from customers, served on  cybersecurity advisory panels, and conducted  outreach activities with academic institutions,  providing information on NIST’s security standards  and guidelines, and exploring new areas of  cybersecurity research and development.  •  Collaboration with JTF partners and other  federal organizations: The FISMA Team worked  closely with JTF partners to ensure that the five  JTF publications remain current, and to designate  additional special publications as JTF guidance.  The five JTF publications are:  1. SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk  Assessments;  2. SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: a Security Life Cycle  Approach;  3. SP 800-39, Managing Information  Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and  Information System View;  4. SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls  for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations; and  5. SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information  Systems and Organizations: Building  Effective Assessment Plans.  The FISMA Team also collaborated with DOD, the IC, DHS,  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA),  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),  the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Services  Administration (GSA), the Small Business Administration  (SBA), and the Inspectors General (IGs) on multiple projects  to ensure consistency with FISMA-related guidance and to  protect information in a way that is commensurate with  risk. In addition, the FISMA Team served as co-chairs on the  Committee on National Security Systems working groups.  In FY 2016, the FISMA Team completed the following  activities:  •  Published the final public draft of SP 800-160,  Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for  a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of  Trustworthy Secure Systems;  •  Started the development of SP 800-53, Revision  5, Security and Privacy Controls for Systems and  Organizations;  •  Published the Initial Public Draft (IPD) of  SP 800-171 Revision 1, Protecting Controlled  Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information  Systems and Organizations, to provide guidance  to federal agencies for the protection of  Controlled Unclassified Information when such  information is resident in nonfederal systems and  organizations;  •  Published the IPDs of NISTIR 8011, Automation  Support for Ongoing Assessments, Volume  1 - Overview, and Volume 2 - Hardware Asset  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p s : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Much of this  research pertains to the trustworthiness of these information  technologies and the systems in which they are incorporated.  Given concerns about how information technologies may  affect privacy at individual and societal levels, the ITL Privacy  Engineering Program (PEP) supports the development of  trustworthy information systems by applying measurement  science and system engineering principles to the creation of  frameworks, risk models, guidance, tools, and standards that  protect privacy, and by extension, civil liberties. The PEP also  seeks to promote NIST and ITL leadership in privacy research  and privacy-enhancing technologies.  The PEP was formally established as a program in FY  2016 as part of ACD. In 2014, the PEP team initiated research  with two workshops to explore the foundations of privacy  engineering and risk management and published a draft  of NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to Privacy Engineering  and Risk Management in Federal Systems, in May 2015 to  introduce a novel set of privacy engineering objectives and a  privacy risk assessment framework (see http://nvlpubs.nist. gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8062.pdf).  In FY 2016, the PEP focused resources in the following  areas: developing a near-term strategic plan, finalizing  NISTIR 8062, and coordinating with other NIST programs  and research efforts to address and integrate privacy.  The strategic plan is organized around the basic goals of  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Advancement of Privacy Engineering and Risk  Management  To further the development of processes for privacy  engineering and risk management (and inform its finalization  of NISTIR 8062), the PEP team conducted outreach with  stakeholders, researched privacy assessment and risk  mitigation methods, and supported the use of its Privacy Risk  Assessment Methodology (PRAM) inside and outside the  Federal Government. The PEP team also worked extensively  with OMB on the revision of Circular A-130, which lays out  new requirements for federal agencies to address privacy risk  in their information systems to ensure that the Circular and  the PEP were in alignment on privacy risk management.  As a result of these efforts, the PEP team has revised  NISTIR 8062 to more clearly introduce the concepts of  privacy engineering and risk management, clarify the  rationale for the introduction of a set of privacy engineering  objectives and a risk model, and include a roadmap for the  development of comprehensive privacy risk management  guidance for federal agencies that parallels NIST guidance  for information security.  The PEP also co-hosted a workshop in September 2016  with the Department of Transportation to gather input on  changes to the privacy controls in Appendix J of NIST SP  800-53, which is undergoing its fifth revision. The workshop  initiated the first stage of executing the guidance roadmap  that the PEP will continue in FY 2017.  Coordination with Other NIST Programs  An important role for the PEP is a collaboration and  coordination with other NIST programs and research efforts  to better integrate privacy in the pursuit of more trustworthy  systems.  Of particular note, the PEP put its preliminary concepts  into practice with the PRAM, a set of worksheets that take an  organization through a privacy risk assessment of its systems.  Working with the ITL Trusted Identities Group (TIG), the PEP  team supports the TIG grant awardees’ use of the PRAM  to evaluate privacy risks and develop mitigating controls in  their pilots. The PEP team also used the PRAM for privacy  evaluations of information systems in partnership with federal  agencies, including DHS and GSA. The lessons learned from  these PRAM evaluations have been critical to the PEP team’s  understanding of the practical aspects of applying privacy  risk management concepts in system development.  The program also collaborated on many other projects,  including a partnership PEP with TIG on a building block  at the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) to use the new privacy engineering objectives (see  https://nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/project- descriptions/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers-project- description-draft.pdf). There was also collaboration with  CSD and NIST’s Engineering Laboratory (EL) on the big data  and cyber-physical systems frameworks and related efforts,  and with ITL’s Information Access Division (IAD) to support  a successful Build-the-Future proposal on de-identification,  a process used to prevent a person’s identity from being  associated with information.  Figure 3: Collaboration Between PEP and Other NIST  Programs in FY 2016 illustrates a number of projects from the  programs described above that PEP collaborated on in FY  2016. These projects can be categorized as applied privacy  projects or guidance and frameworks.  NIST Leadership in Privacy  The program worked across public and private-sector  organizations to advance NIST’s role in privacy. The PEP  team participated in the Internet Policy Task Force’s Privacy  Working Group (see https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/ internet-policy-task-force) and now hold leadership  positions in the Federal Privacy Council (established by  Executive Order in FY 2016), and the Networking and  Information Technology Research and Development  (NITRD) Program’s Privacy Research Interagency Working  Group, whose work included drafting the National Privacy  Research Strategy (see https://www.nitrd.gov/cybersecurity/ nationalprivacyresearchstrategy.aspx), the Identity  Ecosystem Steering Group, and the Fast Identity Online  Alliance.  The PEP team presented its research at major  conferences, including the RSA Conference, the International  Association of Privacy Professionals Global Summit and  Privacy Academy, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers International Workshop on Privacy Engineering,  the Privacy + Security Forum, the TRUSTe Privacy Risk  Summit, and the Computing Community Consortium’s  Privacy by Design Workshop, among others.  The PEP team contributed to ongoing standards and  framework development efforts in various organizations,  including the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group, the Fast  Identity Online Alliance, and the ISO.

This ecosystem is composed  of various entities with multiple tiers of outsourcing, diverse  distribution routes, assorted technologies, laws, policies,  procedures, and practices, all of which interact to design,  manufacture, distribute, deploy, use, maintain, and manage  ICT products and services.  The factors that allow for low-cost, interoperability,  rapid innovation, a variety of product features, and other  benefits, also increase the risk of a compromise to the ICT  supply chain, which may result in risks to the end user.  These ICT supply chain risks may include an insertion of  counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and  the insertion of malicious software and hardware as well as  poor manufacturing and development practices in the ICT  supply chain.  Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is the  process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks  associated with the distributed and interconnected nature  of ICT product and service supply chains. It covers the  Figure 3: Collaboration Between PEP and Other NIST Programs in FY 2016  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In FY 2016, ITL continued to research the state of Cyber  SCRM in both the public and private sectors, related standards  and initiatives, effective practices, and metrics. ITL partnered  with a team composed of representatives from the Federal  Government (GSA and DHS), the insurance industry (Zurich  and Beecher Carlson) and academia (the University of  Maryland) to begin fundamental research and build the tools  necessary to measure and assess the actual effectiveness  of cybersecurity strategies and controls. The effort will use  voluntary, secure and anonymized risk assessments based  on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to begin developing  a large-scale anonymized data set that will, for the first time,  demonstrate cause and effect relationships between cyber  supply chain capability levels and organizational performance  outcomes over time.  Also in FY 2016, ITL co-chaired, with the Department of  Defense, the primary interagency working group on cyber  SCRM to revise CNSS Directive (CNSSD) No. 505, Supply  Chain Risk Management, which assigns responsibilities  and establishes minimum criteria for the development and  deployment of capabilities for SCRM of National Security  Systems. ITL also co-chaired the Software and Supply Chain  Assurance (SSCA) Forum and Working Groups, the purpose  of which is to bring together a stakeholder community of  government, industry, and academic experts in this field.  Meetings are held quarterly and cover a variety of subjects of  interest to attendees.  In April 2016, ITL held a workshop regarding an update  to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). During the  workshop, information was gathered in a breakout session  regarding attendees’ views about improving how SCRM is  covered in the CSF. Several ideas were proposed, and NIST  plans to incorporate the feedback into an updated version  of the CSF.  In May 2016, ITL hosted a forum event led by the Institute  for Defense Analyses (IDA) about their Trustworthy Supplier  Framework (TSF), a prototype toolbox that maps various  existing standards and practices to the controls provided in  NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The TSF  is intended to increase the utility of existing standards to  buyers and program managers making supplier selections,  while simultaneously allowing suppliers flexibility in  meeting procurement requirements. The forum provided an  opportunity for ITL to understand the needs of stakeholders  in this arena. The information will be used by IDA in their  further development of the Trustworthy Supplier Framework  and by ITL in future updates to SP 800-161 and other related  publications.  In FY 2017, ITL will continue to collaborate with  stakeholders in government, industry, and academia to  conduct research, produce needed standards and guidance,  and seek opportunities to create greater awareness across all  sectors and types and sizes of organizations. ITL will:  •  Conduct research and draft guidance on how  organizations identify critical systems and  components that need additional protections;  •  Conduct research on applicable metrics and  measures useful to cyber supply chain risk  management;  •  Conduct an effectiveness study with the goal of  demonstrating cause-and-effect relationships  between cyber supply chain capability levels  and organizational performance outcomes over  time;  •  Continue to co-chair the interagency working group  on cyber supply chain risk management, and also  to co-chair and sponsor the Software and Supply  Chain Assurance Forum;  •  Continue to engage stakeholders in identifying  opportunities to create greater awareness about  cyber supply chain risks and available standards,  practices, guidance and related tools; and  •  Continue to engage stakeholders in identifying  opportunities and needs for providing additional  guidance regarding identifying and implementing  supply chain protections.

These test tools are  developed to promote the adoption of these standards  and to support users, product developers, and testing labs  that require conformance to selected biometric standards.  ITL contributes to the development of biometric standards  and participates in the INCITS Technical Committee M1  – Biometrics and related subcommittees and in ISO/IEC  Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 37 –  Biometrics standards bodies. ITL plans to continue this work  in FY 2017.  In FY 2016, the BioCTS team released refined  versions of existing software and researched the use of  machine-readable data to accelerate conformance test  development and increase support for profiles and user- defined requirements.  There were two updates to the BioCTS for ANSI/ NIST-ITL (AN) software suite in FY 2016. These updates were  primarily focused on enhancing the underlying codebase,  increasing performance, and adding more user-friendly  features. The testing architecture has been updated to be  more maintainable and more robust. The update represents  a complete overhaul of the BioCTS for AN’s initial release  in 2012. A list of changes made to BioCTS for AN can be  found in the Changelog (see https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ Biometric-Conformance-Test-Software).  In addition to updates to BioCTS software, the  team released an updated ANSI/NIST-ITL Data Extractor,  illustrated in Figure 4: ANSI/NIST-ITL Extractor Software  which shows the internal data records within an ANSI/NIST- ITL file. The Data Extractor allows data (images, text, etc.)  to be saved from an ANSI/NIST-ITL formatted file, as well  as providing a high-level overview of the file and its internal  structure.  Figure 4: ANSI/NIST-ITL Extractor Software  The BioCTS team researched the new Machine Readable  Tables (MRTs) for the ANSI/NIST-ITL Biometric Standard  (AN-MRTs) to determine their suitability for integration into  conformance testing efforts. The AN-MRTs encode many  of the human-readable requirements specified in the base  ANSI/NIST-ITL Biometric Standard (and related profiles,  such as Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Electronic  Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS)) in a manner  that can be parsed and understood by software. The BioCTS  team developed software capable of parsing and testing  these tables to ensure a valid MRT format using MRT Schema  documents and MRT element definitions. The results of our  tests were documented and provided to the authors of  the AN-MRTs for incorporation into future versions of the  tables for the benefit of all MRT users. The software used  to develop these results may be released in the future as  a standalone tool for validating and analyzing AN-MRT  files. The new BioCTS software will use the AN-MRTs as an  external resource. This will allow updates to be made to the  MRTs to incorporate the latest conformance requirements,  correct errors, or conduct experiments without releasing an  updated version of BioCTS itself.  An initial version of this software began development in  FY 2016, and this effort is expected to continue in FY 2017.

Specifically, ITL supports the  effort by providing cybersecurity and privacy expertise to  address CPS-specific cybersecurity and privacy challenges.  Such challenges are related to emerging technical areas, such  as personalized health care, emergency response, traffic-flow  management, and electric power generation and delivery.  Other phrases that are often referenced along with CPS  technologies include:  • Internet of Things (IoT);  • Industrial Internet;  • Smart Cities;  • Smart Grid; and  •  “Smart” Anything (e.g., Cars, Buildings, Homes,  Manufacturing, Hospitals, Appliances)  (see http://www.nist.gov/cps/).  CPS aims for increased efficiency and interaction  between the digital and physical worlds. Ensuring that these  emerging and evolving systems are reliable, trustworthy,  secure, and that they protect the privacy of information poses  a unique cybersecurity challenge. Other challenges of CPS  include the need for an integration with legacy components  and allowance for emerging technologies as well as real- time response in support of extremely high availability,  predictability, and reliability.  Cybersecurity and privacy considerations are critical to  the safe and resilient design, development, and operation  of CPS. Addressing both the opportunities and challenges  of CPS requires a broad collaboration to develop a common  foundation, including a consensus definition, vocabulary,  reference architecture, and a shared understanding of  the essential roles of timing, cybersecurity, and data  interoperability. ITL is researching the cybersecurity and  privacy needs of the broader landscape of CPS by applying  their subject-matter expertise in cybersecurity and privacy  to various instances of CPS. These instances may include  industrial control systems, the smart grid, hardware-enabled  security, and embedded systems, to name a few.  In FY 2016, ITL provided leadership for the Cybersecurity  and Privacy subgroup of the CPS Public Working Group  (PWG)—which focused on identifying strategies for  cybersecurity and privacy in CPS as well as working  collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure the  inclusion of cybersecurity as a design principle during the  development processes.  After publishing a Draft Framework for CPS in  September 2015—which compiled the work of the five PWG  technical subgroups—the CPS PWG published version 1.0  of the Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems in May 2016.  The document is the culmination of several years’ work by  the CPS PWG, which includes several hundred members  drawn primarily from industry, academia, and government.  As a follow-on to the Framework’s release, in August 2016,  ITL, in collaboration with NIST’s Engineering Lab, hosted the  Trustworthiness Launch Workshop at NIST in Gaithersburg,  MD. A key goal for the workshop was to promote interaction  around integrated goals for trustworthy cyber-physical  systems to lay the foundation for future trustworthiness in  science.  In July 2016, ITL published NIST SP 800-183, Networks  of ‘Things’, which offers an underlying and foundational  understanding of IoT by exploring the components that  belong to most distributed systems. In FY 2017, foundational  and applied research will be conducted in the areas of CPS  and IoT. ITL will also continue to participate in the International  Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee, which develops  and establishes standards, recommended practices, technical  reports, and related information that define procedures for  implementing electronically secure industrial automation  and control systems and security practices.

ITL,  in collaboration with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory, is  developing and implementing guidance aimed at effectively  securing ICS—initially focusing on Smart Manufacturing  Environments. Utilizing a cybersecurity performance test  bed for ICS, NIST will measure the performance of these  systems when instrumented with cybersecurity protections,  in accordance with the best practices and requirements  prescribed by national and international standards and  guidelines. Examples of such standards and guidelines  include ISA/IEC-62443, Industrial Automation and Control  Systems (IACS) Security, and NIST SP 800-82, Revision 2,  Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security.  Industrial control systems are an essential component  in manufacturing environments; increasing reliance on  technology, communication, and the interconnectivity of ICS  and IT has expanded the number of potential vulnerabilities  and increased the potential risk to manufacturing operations.  While these manufacturing systems become ‘smarter’ and  increasingly connected (providing a tremendous increase  of value and efficiency), they also present a new challenge  regarding how cybersecurity can be effectively applied to  the connected domain.  The ICS team has utilized existing standards, in  conjunction with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,  to develop a target Profile for applying cybersecurity  protections within manufacturing environments. The  development of this profile helps establish a roadmap for  reducing cybersecurity risk for manufacturers in a way that  is aligned with manufacturing-sector goals and industry best  practices. The profile also tailors the existing cybersecurity  control language to account for unique requirements in  these operational environments.  In FY 2016, leading a session during the 2016  Cybersecurity Framework Workshop, the team solicited  feedback from industry partners to help advance the  development of the profile. The draft Cybersecurity  Framework Manufacturing Profile was published as a  whitepaper that solicited comments from the public. The  Profile focuses on desired cybersecurity outcomes and can  be used as a roadmap to identify opportunities for improving  the current cybersecurity posture of a manufacturing system.  In FY 2017, NIST will continue its research in the  ICS domain to include incorporating feedback and  finalizing the Manufacturing Profile, implementing the  defined cybersecurity protections onto the cybersecurity  performance test bed, and measuring and understanding  the performance impacts of implemented cybersecurity  protections.

NIST remains committed to the value of  communicating its R&D efforts to other federal colleagues  and identifying the opportunities to support R&D efforts  throughout the Federal Government.  In FY 2016, the NITRD Cybersecurity and Information  Assurance (CSIA) Interagency Working Group (IWG)  monthly meetings provided an opportunity to learn  and share information about NIST’s ongoing research.

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of  NIST. HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in efforts related to human factors, security,  and laboratory accreditation. Voting security team members  from ITL conduct research and develop guidelines and best  practices for voting system security.  The primary objective of NIST’s work is to support the  development of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines  (VVSG), a broad set of equipment guidelines used by the  EAC to certify voting systems. The current version of these  guidelines is VVSG 1.1, which was approved by the EAC in  March 2015. Initial efforts on the next revision of the VVSG  have already begun. Beginning in 2015, NIST established  public working groups to gather input and conduct the  collaborative research necessary for the development of  further guidelines/standards. These working groups consist  of three election groups and four technology groups focused  on human factors, cybersecurity, interoperability, and  testing. The overall goal of the working groups is to lay the  groundwork for a revision of the VVSG, as many jurisdictions  are facing the need for a technology refresh since many  voting systems are more than ten years old.  In the months leading up to the November 2016 election,  NIST engaged with DHS, EAC, and the Department of  Justice (DOJ) to help states better identify and manage their  cybersecurity risks to election systems and voting systems  for the upcoming election. This group ensured that election  officials were aware of existing resources that are available to  help them (including the guidelines and best practices that  exist for voting and other IT systems, cyber hygiene scanning  services by DHS, and threat and vulnerability bulletins).  In FY 2017, the voting working group will focus its  efforts on the next revision of the VVSG. Based on feedback  from the TGDC and election officials around the country,  the new revision is expected to address new technologies  and election use cases that have become commonplace in  election systems. Additionally, the cybersecurity group plans  to investigate security considerations and develop guidance  in the areas of voter registration, electronic pollbooks, blank  ballot delivery, ballot marking, auditing, and election-night  reporting.

The SARD also contains real software  applications with known bugs and vulnerabilities.  The set is intended to encompass a wide variety  of possible vulnerabilities, languages, platforms,  and compilers. The SARD is a large-scale effort,  gathering test cases from many contributors. ITL  has more information about the SARD, including  goals, structure, test suite selection, etc. at https:// samate.nist.gov/index.php/SARD.html. In FY 2016,  the SARD was increased by approximately 40,000  PHP (PHP is a server-side scripting language  designed primarily for web development but  also used as a general-purpose programming  language) and over 30,000 C# test cases (C# is a  new programming language designed for building  a wide range of enterprise applications that run on  the .NET Framework).  •  SATE is designed to advance research (based  on large test sets) in, and improvement of, static  analysis tools that find security-relevant defects  in source code. Participating toolmakers run their  tools on a set of programs. Researchers, led by  NIST, analyze the tool reports. The results and  experiences are reported at a workshop. The tool  reports and analysis are made publicly available  at a later date. SATE’s purpose is NOT to evaluate  nor to choose the “best” tools. Rather, it is aimed  at exploring the following characteristics of tools:  relevance of warnings to security, their correctness,  and prioritization. SATE’s goals are:  o To enable empirical research based on  large test sets,  o To encourage the improvement of tools,  and  o To speed the adoption of tools by  objectively demonstrating their use on real  software.  There have been five SATEs since the program  began in 2008. The most recent exposition was  held in 2014. In FY 2016, planning commenced for  SATE VI.

Digital evidence can be a part of  investigating most crimes, since material relevant to the  crime may be recorded in digital form. Methods for securely  acquiring, storing and analyzing digital evidence quickly  and efficiently are critical. ITL promotes the efficient and  effective use of computer technology to investigate crimes.  The project team develops tools for testing computer  forensic software, including test criteria and test sets. ITL  also maintains the National Software Reference Library  – a vast archive of published software applications that is  an important resource for both criminal investigators and  historians.  National Software Reference Library  The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) is  designed to collect software from various sources and  incorporate file profiles computed from this software into  a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information. The RDS can  be used by law enforcement, government, and industry  organizations to review files on a computer by matching  file profiles in the RDS. This will help alleviate much of the  effort involved in determining which files are important as  evidence on computers or file systems that have been seized  as part of criminal investigations. The NSRL also provides a  research environment to promote the development of new  forensics techniques and other applications in computer  science.  In FY 2016, the NSRL published four releases of the RDS,  which continues to be the premier software resource. There  are currently 21,000 applications and 200,000,000 files.  The project team completed a project with the Stanford  University Library to preserve thousands of first-generation  computer packages. In FY 2017, the NSRL was expanded to  include mobile apps.

The goal  of the Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) project at  NIST is to establish a methodology for testing computer  forensic software tools by the development of general tool  specifications, test procedures, test criteria, test sets, and test  hardware. The project is intended to provide the information  necessary for toolmakers to improve tools, for users to make  informed choices about acquiring and using computer  forensics tools, and for interested parties to understand the  capabilities of the tools. A capability is required to ensure  that forensic software tools consistently produce accurate  and objective test results. The project team’s approach for  testing computer forensic tools is based on well-recognized  international methodologies for conformance testing and  quality testing.  In FY 2016, the CFTT project was expanded to allow  forensics testers to use the NIST testing methodology in  their own labs and to produce standardized test reports.  Currently, the project supports disk imaging testing and  will be expanded to support hard-disk write blocking and  mobile forensics in 2017. The CFTT project also maintains  the Forensics Tool Catalog and the Computer Forensics  Reference Dataset.

One portion  of this legislation calls for the  establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public-safety  broadband network based on the  3rd Generation Partnership Project’s  (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be  deployed and operated by the  First Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned Nationwide Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) will “create a much-needed nationwide  interoperable broadband network that will help police,  firefighters, emergency medical service professionals and  other public safety officials stay safe and do their jobs”  (see http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety).  NIST is directed to establish a list of certified devices and  required components to be used by public safety officials,  vendors, and other interested parties for interacting with  the nationwide network. NIST is also directed to conduct  research and development that supports the acceleration  and advancement of the nationwide network.  In FY 2016, CSD, ACD, and the NCCoE supported the joint  National Telecommunications and Information Administration  (NTIA) and NIST Public Safety Communications Research  (PSCR) program with efforts in public-safety mobile- application security, identity management, data and  application isolation technologies, and enabling cybersecurity  capabilities on the PSCR 700 MHz LTE demonstration  network located in Boulder, Colorado (see http://www.pscr. gov). At PSCR’s Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder  Conference in June 2016, CSD and ACD organized and  moderated a panel called “Public Safety and Network Security  Enhancements,” led two breakout sessions on LTE Network  Security, and had a booth highlighting the cybersecurity- related efforts of PSCR.

In  addition, CSD and ACD broadened its scope within the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to include efforts  related to public safety.  In FY 2017, CSD and ACD will work to implement and  exercise cybersecurity capabilities in the PSCR 700 MHz  LTE demonstration network, conduct research into mobile  authentication solutions to support the different public- safety disciplines, and investigate mobile application- security services to support the security requirements  of public-safety mobile applications. CSD and ACD will  continue to engage the public-safety communications  community by organizing workshops and conferences and  participating in events such as the Association of Public- Safety Communications Officials (APCO) Annual Meeting,  PSRC’s Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder  Conference, and the International Wireless Communications  Expo (IWCE).

The  infrastructure is used  to send command  information across the  electric grid from the generation systems to the distribution  systems, and to exchange usage and billing information  between utilities and their customers. The key to the  successful deployment of the smart grid infrastructure is  the development of a cybersecurity strategy that includes  cybersecurity as a design consideration for new and  emerging systems and an approach to adding cybersecurity  into existing systems. The electric grid is critical to the  economic and physical well-being of the nation, and  emerging cyber threats targeting power systems highlight  the need to integrate advanced security to protect critical  assets.  The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) became a  membership-supported organization in January 2013. The  SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed  the Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC), and  continues to be led by a NIST representative in support of  responsibilities identified in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007. The SGCC chair is a voting member of  the SGIP Technical Committee and serves as an ex-officio  Director of the Board.

The researchers  concentrated on authenticating the provenance of multicast  data streams from emerging power system sensors called  Phasor Measurement Units. By authenticating the sensors to  the utility, the utility can trust that their sensor measurements  are coming from the correct sensors and have not been  hijacked.  Multicast authentication of sensor data is challenging,  due to the need for low-security overhead, tolerance  of lossy networks, time-criticality, and high data rates.  Researchers augmented an existing authentication scheme  to accommodate high-data-rate sensor transmissions  that are unbounded in length (meaning that there is no  session expiration). Using dual-offset key chains to reduce  authentication delay and the computational overhead  associated with key chain commitment, they developed a  new protocol called inf-TESLA that meets the performance  requirements imposed by the physical dynamics of the  power system. Significant effort was made to integrate their  authentication protocol into existing network simulation  software, specifically Optimized Network Engineering Tools  (OPNET), thus providing potential users with the ability to  evaluate the protocol on their own networks and for their  own applications.  Furthermore, in an effort to address the growing  interest in co-optimizing cyber and physical components  to work together as a system, NIST researchers developed  mathematical formalism to trade off the sensitivity of a  dynamic system to attack or perturbation against the  authentication overhead incurred by their protocol. This  formalism was demonstrated on a power system use case  showing the limiting considerations between authentication  overhead and stability margins of a wide-area damping  controller. The project continues to be a work-in-progress  and was presented and published at ICT Systems Security  and Privacy Protection Conference 2016 in Ghent, Belgium.  Timing has also become a cyber-physical security issue  with the onset of utilities detecting issues in receiving and  distributing time to enable distributed real-time measurement  and control. In particular, the concern of the threat of spoofing  and jamming has led to efforts in determining redundant  sources of traceable time. The first step is developing  monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. The effort  included working with the North American Synchrophasor  Initiative (NASPI) Time Synchronization Task Force to begin  the effort in researching requirements and documenting  guidelines for industry to provide assured timing. One  alternative time distribution method to the Global Positioning  System (GPS) is the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol  (PTP)—a time synchronization protocol that is used for the  electric grid and other special-purpose industrial automation  and measurement networks. Discussions have begun with  the NIST Time and Frequency Division about experimental  designs to provide a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) scale  that would be maintained as a NIST (UTC(NIST)) PTP service  over a large geographical expanse.  In FY 2017, CSD will coordinate with NIST’s Engineering  Laboratory (EL) and Smart Grid Program Office on the  further development of a Cybersecurity Smart Grid Test  Lab—part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility now under  construction. CSD will also collaborate with the University  of New Hampshire and ITL’s Software and Systems Division  on cybersecurity research. The IEEE 1588 Security Working  Group is developing a new Annex to secure time distribution  through (a) PTP integrated authentication and integrity  verification, (b) external transport security mechanisms, (c)  architecture guidance, and (d) monitoring and management  guidance. The research will focus on developing a full security  scheme with emphasis on PTP integrated authentication  and integrity verification and monitoring/detection of the  network’s timing performance.

NICE is building on its current efforts based on its  Strategic Plan—delivered to Congress in April 2016 as  required by the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014— which was written with engagement and deliberation  among NICE partners. The three primary goals of the plan  are to: 1) accelerate learning and skills development, 2)  nurture a diverse learning community, and 3) guide career  development and workforce planning. NICE partners will  continue to develop appropriate implementation strategies  and metrics for this plan.  In FY 2016, the NICE team at NIST worked to set a solid  staffing foundation for future progress. They assembled  new internal team members that includes leads for  academic engagement, industry engagement, government  engagement, and a program manager. These, in combination  with the existing NICE Director and NICE Deputy Director,  completed the staffing needs for the NICE Program Office  at NIST.  Many NICE communication mechanisms were also  established in FY 2016. These include the NICE Public  Working Group (see https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied- cybersecurity/nice/about/working-group), the NICE  Quarterly eNewsletter (see https://www.nist.gov/news- events/news/search/enewsletter), and an increased  presence of NICE at cybersecurity education, training, and  workforce development events across the country.  Figure 6: The NICE Lead for Academic Engagement, Mrs.  Davina Pruitt-Mentle, speaking with an attendee at the  20th Annual Colloquium for Information Systems Securi- ty Education Conference in Philadelphia.  In addition to NICE’s continued coordination with  academic and industry partners, NICE also continued its  leadership in working with government partners on initiatives  such as the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, the Federal  Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy, and implementation of  the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act.  In FY 2016, NICE announced grant awards for five  Regional Alliances and Multi-stakeholder Partnerships to  Stimulate (RAMPS) cybersecurity education and workforce  development. The RAMPS grants will bring together K-12,  higher education, and local employers in regions across the  nation (see https://www.nist.gov/nice/regional-alliances- and-multistakeholder-partnerships-stimulate-ramps). NICE  also provided grant support for the 2015 NICE Conference  and Expo, the 2015 National K-12 Cybersecurity Education  Conference, the Center of Academic Excellence (CAE)  Community Meeting, the National Cybersecurity Summit,  the NICE Challenge Project, and the Cybersecurity Jobs  Heat Map.  In FY 2017, NICE plans to:  •  Support the 2016 NICE Conference on October 6-7,  2016;  •  Support the 2016 NICE Conference and Expo and  pre-conference seminars on October 31, 2016 –  November 2, 2016;  •  Launch a Cybersecurity Jobs Heat Map known as  “CyberSeek”;  •  Publish a draft of the NICE Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework; and  •  Provide a public webinar series (see  https://www.nist.gov/nice/webinars).

The CSRC website is home to many of the standards,  guidelines, and other technical series documents that are  valuable to the general public. The Publications Released  in FY 2016 section of this annual report provides additional  details. During FY 2016, CSRC had more than 6.2 million page  views and downloads.  The CSRC team maintains a publication announcement  mailing list with more than 73,630 subscribers from  government, industry, and academia—as well as individuals  with a personal interest in IT security worldwide. This free  email list notifies subscribers about publications that have  been posted to the CSRC website, along with announcing  new NIST-sponsored cybersecurity events and important  news and/or announcements.  During FY 2016, the CSRC was updated daily, providing  new information such as draft and final versions of technical  series documents (e.g., FIPS, SPs, NISTIRs and ITL Bulletins)  and updates to various program and project webpages.  The CSRC team has made progress on plans for a complete  redesign of the current CSRC website, including a content  management system (CMS). Updating CSRC with a CMS will  provide a user-friendly environment and experience. The  first phase of the project, the publications section; has been  completed. All technical and non-technical publications (e.g.,  white papers, conference papers, presentations) have been  successfully integrated into the new system.  The CSRC team has spent the last portion of FY 2016  migrating the content from the current website into the CMS,  and in FY 2017, a beta test site of the entire CSRC is expected  to be made available. The CSRC team plans to continue  testing the new website and to review feedback received,  with the plan for full transition to the updated site in FY 2017.

The Forum,  which serves more than 1,200 members, strives to provide  an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal information  security programs to exchange information security  materials in a timely manner, build upon the experiences of  other programs, and reduce possible duplication of effort.  It provides a mechanism for NIST to share information  directly with federal agency information security managers  in fulfillment of NIST’s leadership mandate (under FISMA). It  also assists NIST in establishing and maintaining relationships  with other individuals or organizations that are actively  addressing information security issues within the Federal  Government. During FY 2016, NIST’s Patricia Toth served as  the Chairperson, and ACD served as the Secretariat of the  Forum, with administrative and logistical support from NIST’s  Peggy Himes.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is restricted to those  Federal Government employees with a role in the management  of their organization’s information system security program.  The Forum conducts bi-monthly meetings and an annual  two-day conference for a discussion of current issues and  topics of interest to those responsible for protecting sensitive  (unclassified) federal systems. Events are open to federal  employees and their designated support contractors.  Topics of discussion at FCSM meetings in FY 2016 included  briefings on: software-aided security control selection, best  practices for privileged user personal identity verification,  the Cybersecurity Framework, the National Cybersecurity  Center of Excellence (NCCoE) - Federally Funded Research  and Development Center (FFRDC), an update on vetting  the security mobile applications, and the U.S. Government  Configuration Baselines (USGCB).

FISSEA strives to elevate the  general level of information system security knowledge for  the Federal Government and the federal workforce. It also  seeks to assist the professional development of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information system  security professionals, professional trainers and educators,  managers responsible for information system security  training programs in federal agencies, contractors of these  agencies, and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security training  and education. All that is required to become a FISSEA  member is a willingness to share products, information, and  experiences. A working group meets monthly to administer  business activities.  FISSEA communicates with its membership through a  website, a mailing list, and a social networking site. The ACD  staff assists FISSEA with its operations by providing staffing  support for several of its activities (and by acting as FISSEA’s  host agency).  The 29th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March  15-16, 2016 at NIST, and the theme was “The Quest for the  Unhackable Human: The Power of Cybersecurity Awareness  and Training.” The 250+ attendees were made up of  managers (specifically those responsible for information  systems security awareness, training, certifications,  workforce identification, compliance, etc. in federal  agencies), contractors providing awareness and training  support, and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security training  and education. The attendees learned about new techniques  for developing/conducting training, cost-effective practices,  workforce development, and free resources and contacts.  NIST’s Pat Toth, Peggy Himes, and members of the  FISSEA Technical Working Group were integral to the effort  to support the 2016 Annual Conference.

The attendees had an opportunity to visit vendors and  federal agencies on the second day to discuss their specific  awareness and training programs, and the Pecha Kucha fast- paced talks proved to be both entertaining and educational.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award is an annual  recognition to honor a contemporary individual who is  making special efforts to create, build, manage, or inspire  an information systems security awareness, training, or  education program. Susan Hansche (DHS) presented the  FISSEA 2016 Educator of the Year Award to Gretchen Morris  (DB Consulting Group/NASA). Gretchen’s vast knowledge- base, strong work ethic, her dedication to the improvement  of information security awareness and training, and her  commitment to coordinating the annual FISSEA Security  Contest made her the perfect recipient for the award.  Figure 7: Susan Hansche, DHS, presented the FISSEA 2015  Educator of the Year Award to Gretchen Morris, DB Con-  sulting/NASA on March 15, 2016.  Other traditional FISSEA conference events include  announcing the winners of the FISSEA Security Awareness,  Training & Education Contest, which includes six categories  from one of FISSEA’s three key areas: awareness, training,  and education. A winner is selected from each category  and awarded a certificate. The categories covered the topics  described below, including a new section this year related to  video-based training.  In FY 2016, awarded certificates were selected by an  impartial judging committee and included:  •  Poster Winner: K. Rudolph, John Ippolito, G. Mark  Hardy, Andrew Ellis, and Charles A. Filius, from  Native Intelligence, Inc. and friends;  •  Website Winner: Lisa Dorr, Sarah Moffat,  Toney Rogers, and Jennifer Kimberly from U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  Office of Information Security (OIS), Governance,  Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) –  Governance Division;  •  Motivational Item Winner: K.

I n f o r m a t i o n  S e c u r i t y  a n d  P r i v a c y  A d v i s o r y  B o a r d  ( I S P A B )  The Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board  (ISPAB) was initiated in 1987 and has successfully renewed  its charter with proper authority every two years. The  legislative history for Public Law 100-235 and Public Law  107-347 underscores that Congress intended that the Board  should be a continuing body. The Board plays a central and  unique role in providing the government with expert advice  concerning information security and privacy issues that may  affect federal information systems. No other similar group of  experts meets regularly to review information security issues  involved in unclassified Federal Government computer  systems and networks. Title III of the E-Government Act  of 2002 reaffirmed the need for this Board by giving it  additional responsibilities: to thoroughly review all proposed  information technology standards and guidelines developed  under Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-3), as amended.  The ISPAB is a federal advisory committee with specific  statutory objectives to identify emerging managerial,  technical, administrative, and physical safeguard issues  related to information security and privacy.  The duties of the Board, as dictated in the Act, are:  •  To identify emerging managerial, technical,  administrative, and physical safeguard issues  relative to information security and privacy;  •  To advise NIST and the Director of OMB on  information security and privacy issues pertaining  to Federal Government information systems,  including a thorough review of proposed standards  and guidelines developed under section 278g–3 of  this title; and  •  To provide an annual report of its findings to the  Secretary of Commerce, the Director of OMB,  the Director of the NSA, and the appropriate  committees of Congress.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the Board  by setting the terms of Board members to four years. The  Board’s charter requires that the NIST Director appoint the  Chairperson and all twelve members of the Board, each of  whom is selected for her/his preeminence in the IT industry  or related disciplines.  Mr. Chris Boyer took over leadership from Dr. Peter  Weinberger and was officially appointed by the NIST Director  as the ISPAB Chair on May 1, 2016. Chris Boyer (Assistant Vice  President, Global Public Policy at AT&T Services Inc.) has  been a member of the Board since June 2012. In addition to  his official role representing AT&T, he serves as AT&T’s point  of contact to the National Security Telecommunications  Advisory Council (NSTAC), a federal advisory committee  tasked with providing advice to the president on matters of  national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP).  The ISPAB Board currently has ten members  supporting the Chair (see http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ SMA/ispab/membership.html). This year, the Board was  pleased to welcome Ms. Patricia Hatter as a new member  (see https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/08/ nists-information-security-and-privacy-advisory-board- adds-industry-member). The following are current Board  members:  •  Ana (Annie) Antón, Professor and Chair, School  of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of  Technology;  •  John R.

Daniel Toler, Deputy Director, Federal Network  Resilience, U.S. Department of Homeland  Security.  During FY 2016, ISPAB held three meetings that were  located at the U.S. Access Board Conference Room in  Washington, D.C:  • October 21-23, 2015;  • March 23-25, 2016; and  • June 15-17, 2016.  The presenters at each Board meeting were leaders  and experts representing private industry, academia, federal  agency CIOs, Inspectors General, and Chief Information  Security Officers.  In keeping with previous practices, at the first meeting of  the fiscal year, the Board established a work plan for FY 2016.  The resulting plan included the following areas of focus:  •  Quantum (physics, pre-shared keys, quantum key  distribution, block chains);  • Cybersecurity;  •  OMB topics, including Circular A-130 revisions,  cyber-marathon, CyberStats, measuring outcomes  for cybersecurity, and cybersecurity protections in  Federal Government acquisitions;  •  DHS topics, including Fly-Away (Incident Response)  Team, Einstein, Continuous Diagnostics and  Mitigation (CDM), and outcome measurement  methods;  •  Networking and Information Technology Research  and Development (NITRD) and the Build-it- in initiative and NITRD – on how competent  companies acquire IT;  •  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) and automotive cybersecurity;  •  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) – security,  protecting data;  •  Facial recognition, technologies, biometrics, and  users;  •  Privacy technologies;  •  Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board  (PCLOB);  • Safe Harbor; and  • Acquisition.  Aligning with work-plan focus areas, the Board  continues to monitor the following critical areas:  •  Updates from the senior staff of federal agencies  (e.g., the Deputy Under Secretary, Cybersecurity  and Communications, National Protection  Directorate, DHS, and Senate and Congressional  staff);  •  PCLOB and the establishment of the Federal  Privacy Council;  • OMB Circular A-130 revisions;  •  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  autonomous vehicle technology, gaps, challenges,  security and privacy;  • P rivacy, transparency, and accountability for  commercial unmanned aircraft systems;  •  Cryptography and NIST cryptographic standards  processes;  •  Emerging technologies: cloud computing, big data,  Internet of Things, cyber physical systems, smart  cities, drones and unmanned aircraft systems,  medical devices, transportation sector and vehicle- to-vehicle communication, blockchain protocol, and  impacts on security and privacy;  •  Commission on Enhancing National  Cybersecurity;  • The NIST Cybersecurity Framework;  • Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA);  • Information sharing and analysis;  • The DHS CDM program;  • The Trusted Identities Group (TIG);  •  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE); and  • Realignment of IT Laboratory.  The Board submitted two recommendation letters based  on the Board work from each meeting in this fiscal year.  Records of the submitted letters and the received responses  are accessible from http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/ documentation.html.  •  At the close of the October 2015 meeting, the  Board submitted a recommendation letter  regarding quantum computing to the NIST Director.  The NIST Director responded to the Board in a letter  dated January 2016.  •  At the close of the March 2016 meeting, the Board  submitted a recommendation letter regarding  FIPS 140 and the use of ISO/IEC 19790 to the NIST  Director. The Board received a response from the  NIST Director in August 2016.

A computer failure or system breach could  jeopardize the company’s reputation and may result in  significant damage and recovery cost—or even business  closure. The small business owner who recognizes the threat  of computer crime and takes steps to deter inappropriate  activities is less likely to become a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports  that over 27 million U.S. companies − more than 99 % of  all U.S. businesses − are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer  (see http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12. pdf). While the threats to individual small and medium-size  businesses may not be significantly different from those  facing larger organizations, a SMB frequently has fewer  resources available to protect systems, detect attacks, or  respond to security issues. A vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the nation’s  information infrastructure and economic base.  To help address information security risks, these  businesses require assistance with the identification of  security mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective  training. Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources  most effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In  response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the FBI InfraGard  program co-sponsor a series of cybersecurity training  workshops for small businesses. These workshops provide  an overview of cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and  corresponding protective tools and techniques, with a special  emphasis on information that small business personnel can  apply directly.  In FY 2016, SMB outreach workshops took place in:  • Minneapolis, Minnesota;  • McHenry, Maryland;  • Harrisonburg, Virginia;  • Arlington, Virginia;  • Ocala, Florida;  • The Villages, Florida;  • Orlando, Florida;  • Clermont, Florida;  • Charlestown, West Virginia; and  • Detroit, Michigan.  Additionally, as part of the President’s Cybersecurity  National Action Plan (CNAP), NIST partnered with the SBA,  the FTC, and the Department of Energy (DoE) to develop  and provide five cybersecurity training webinars to reach  small businesses and small business stakeholders through  68 SBA District Offices, nine NIST Manufacturing Extension  Partnership Centers, and other regional networks across the  country.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, planning  is underway to identify locations and plan cybersecurity  workshops in FY 2017.

The “SHA-3” competition ended in October  2012. NIST standardized the winning algorithm, Keccak, in  FIPS 202 as the new SHA-3 Standard. Announced on August  5, 2015, FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions, is available at:  https://csrc.nist.gov/Publications/Search?requestSeriesList=  3 & re q u e st S t a t u s L i s t = 1 , 3 & re q u e st D i s p l ay O p t i o n .  =brief&requestSortOrder=5&itemsPerPage=All.  FIPS 202 defines four fixed-length hash functions (SHA3- 224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512), and two variable- length eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs), SHAKE128 and  SHAKE256. FIPS 202 also supports a flexible scheme for  domain separation between different functions derived from  Keccak, which ensures that different named functions will  produce unrelated outputs.  NIST extended this scheme to allow users to customize  their use of the function by defining a new, customizable  version of the SHAKE functions, called cSHAKE, and specifying  two cSHAKE variants—cSHAKE128 and cSHAKE256—for a  128- and 256-bit security strength, respectively, in DRAFT  SP 800-185, SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC,  TupleHash and ParallelHash.  Draft SP 800-185 defines three additional SHA-3-derived  functions that provide new functionality. They are:  •  KMAC128 and KMAC256, providing pseudorandom  functions (PRFs) and keyed-hash functions with  variable-length outputs;  •  TupleHash128 and TupleHash256, providing  functions that hash tuples of input strings without  trivial collisions; and  •  ParallelHash128 and ParallelHash256, providing  efficient hash functions to hash long messages in  parallel.  Published on August 4, 2016, Draft SP 800-185 is  available on the CSRC website. NIST invited the public to  review the draft and provide comments before September  30, 2016. NIST is in the process of addressing the received  comments, and will post the final version of SP 800-185 when  the comments are resolved.

For example, random numbers are  used to generate the keys needed for encryption and digital  signature applications. The CSD Cryptographic Technology  Group (CTG) began work on the specification of random bit  generators in the late 1990s. SP 800-90, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random  Bit Generators, was published in 2007, and revised as SP  800-90A in 2012 and 2015. This document specifies several  deterministic algorithms that can be used for the generation  of pseudorandom bits – a sequence of bits produced by an  algorithm, rather than a random physical phenomenon that  produces a truly random sequence.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B and SP 800- 90C) are under development, and drafts were made available  for public comment in 2012 and 2016.  SP 800-90B, Recommendation for the Entropy Sources  Used for Random Bit Generation:  SP 800-90B addresses the development and testing of  entropy sources.

Health  tests are intended to detect whether the noise source  and the entropy source (as a whole) continues to operate  as expected. The optional conditioning component is  responsible for reducing bias and/or increasing the entropy  rate of the bits to eventually be output by the entropy source.  SP 800-90B includes descriptions of the tests for NIST’s  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) to  validate candidate entropy sources. During FY 2016, the  CTG continued the development and testing of methods for  estimating the amount of entropy per noise-source output.  A draft of the document was provided for public  comment in January 2016. A companion python code  package was also made available to assist reviewers in  evaluating the entropy estimation methods published in  the draft (see https://github.com/usnistgov/SP800-90B_ EntropyAssessment).  A workshop was held in May 2016 to discuss the  document, and the public comment period ended shortly  thereafter. The SP 800-90B development team has been  reviewing the comments received during the public  comment period and plans to finalize an initial version of the  document in FY 2017.  The latest draft of SP 800-90B is available via the  Special Publications page: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-90C, Recommendation for Random Bit  Generator (RBG) Constructions:  SP 800-90C provides basic guidance on the construction  of Random Bit Generators (RBGs) from the entropy sources  validated against the requirements of SP 800-90B and the  Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG) algorithms of  SP 800-90A. SP 800-90C includes constructions for both  non-deterministic random bit generators (NRBGs; also  known as true random number generators) and deterministic  random bit generators (also known as pseudorandom  number generators). Two general models are provided in SP  800-90C, as shown in Figures 8 and 9.  Figure 9: XOR-NRBG  Figure 9: XOR-NRBG depicts the construction of one  of the NRBGs – the XOR-NRBG. In this construction, each  bit output by the entropy source (as discussed in SP 800- 90B) is exclusive-ORed with a bit of output from a DRBG  algorithm specified in SP 800-90A.  Figure 10: DRBG and Oversampling NRBG  Figure 10: DRBG and Oversampling NRBG depicts the  construction used for the DRBGs and the second NRBG  design – the Oversampling NRBG. The difference between  the two is the availability of the entropy source and the  frequency of requesting output from the entropy source. For  a DRBG, an entropy source is only required for seeding the  DRBG; after the initial seeding process, further requests for  entropy-source output depend on the implementation and  application. For the Oversampling NRBG, the entropy source  must always be available and is accessed whenever bits are  requested from the NRBG by a consuming application.  The latest draft of SP 800-90C is available via the  Special Publications page: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ PubsSPs.html.  P L A N S  F O R  F Y  2 0 1 7 :  The RBG development team has the following goals for  FY 2017:  •  Complete the initial version of SP 800-90B and  post the comments received, along with their  resolution. The testing of entropy sources by the  CMVP will begin as soon as possible after the test  code is ported to another language for increased  performance. Members of the CMVP staff have  been participating in the development of SP 800- 90B to more easily prepare for such testing. Not  all comments received will be addressed in this  version, since the development team is anxious to  begin getting feedback from the CMVP labs about  the adequacy of the tests specified in SP 800-90B.  Addressing some of the comments would result in  a significant delay in finalizing the initial version of  the document.  •  Complete SP 800-90C, posting the comments  received and their resolution, along with the  document.  •  Monitor the testing of SP 800-90B and SP 800- 90C in the CMVP labs to determine problems  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

A block cipher transforms  some fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”) into seemingly  random data of the same length. The transformation is  determined by the choice of some secret data called the  “key.” The same key is used to reverse the transformation and  recover the original block of data. A cryptographic technique  (e.g., for encryption and/or authentication) that is constructed  from a block cipher is called a ‘mode of operation.’  Several modes of operation have been specified in the  SP 800-38 series of publications. The latest installment in  the series, Special Publication 800-38G, Recommendation  for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format- Preserving Encryption, was published in March 2016. It  specifies two AES modes of operation, called FF1 and FF3,  for inclusion in the “toolkit” of approved cryptographic  algorithms. FF1 and FF3 are format-preserving encryption  (FPE) modes, based on proposals that were submitted from  the private sector.  Previously approved confidentiality modes are designed  for binary data; ciphertext resulting from these modes may  be longer than the original plaintext and may result in format  problems when used by existing devices or software.  FPE modes such as FF1 and FF3 are designed for any  kind of data, including non-binary formats, such as credit  card numbers and social security numbers. The ciphertext  resulting from an FPE mode has the same length and format  as the original plaintext.  Consequently, FPE modes can  facilitate the retrofitting of encryption technology to existing  devices or software, where a conventional encryption mode  might not be feasible.

The Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG)  began providing guidance in managing the keys used for  cryptographic applications in the late 1990s to early 2000s.  NIST Special Publications have been periodically updated  to address new algorithms and handling procedures. These  documents are coordinated with federal agencies and  with the cryptographic community, including national and  international organizations, industry, and academia.  During the development and subsequent revision of  these key-management documents, the development  team coordinates with members of NIST’s Cryptographic  Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and Cryptographic  Module Validation Program (CMVP) to develop validation  tests and address issues that arise during the validation  processes.  In FY 2016, the following publications were either created  or revised:  SP 800-57, Part 1, Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 1: General:  SP 800-57, was first published in 2005, and later revised  in 2007 and 2012. SP 800-57, Part 1 contains basic key- management guidance, including:  •  Defining the security services that may be obtained  using NIST-approved algorithms;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Another revision of the document was completed in  January 2016 that includes information on and references  to new and revised documents developed by the CTG (e.g.,  SP 800-152, as discussed below); the removal of references  to the Dual_EC_DRBG, which was removed from SP 800- 90A: Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators; a revision of  the security-strength tables; and a revision of the key-state  discussion to provide more clarification.  SP 800-57, Part 1 is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf.  SP 800-131A: Transitions: Recommendation for  Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key  Lengths:  SP 800-131A was originally published in January 2011.  This document provides specific guidance for transitions  to the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust  algorithms. An update of SP 800-131A was completed in  November 2015. This update removes approval for the Dual_ EC_DRBG that was specified in SP 800-90A; deprecates the  use of non-approved key-establishment schemes; disallows  the use of non-approved key-wrapping methods after 2017;  and indicates that the use of the SHA-3 family of hash  functions is acceptable, in addition to the use of the SHA-2  family of hash functions and some applications of SHA-1.  SP 800-131A is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar1.pdf.  SP 800-152: A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key  Management Systems (CKMS):  SP 800-152 provides guidance on the CKMS to be  used by the Federal Government. This document contains  requirements for CKMS design, implementation, procurement,  installation, configuration, management, operation and  use. Many of these requirements are refinements of the  requirements for CKMS designers that are specified in SP  800-130: A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key  Management Systems. Other requirements are intended for  the service providers of a CKMS used by federal agencies and  their contractors. Guidance is also provided for the federal  agencies in selecting CKMSs that support the security and  management policies of those agencies.  This document was completed in October 2015  and is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-152.pdf.  SP 800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography:  SP 800-56A was originally published in 2006, and revised  in 2007 and 2013. This document specifies Diffie-Hellman  (DH) and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV) key-establishment  schemes, both elliptic curve and finite field versions. Key  establishment is a procedure that results in keying material  that is shared between the participants. A key-establishment  scheme is defined by a cryptographic algorithm, together  with an identification of other information that must be  available by both parties when establishing keys. The  schemes are intended for use in communication protocols  (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), one of the protocols  used by the Internet). The key-establishment schemes in SP  800-56A use public key algorithms, and each participant in  a key-agreement transaction uses a pair of keys—a public  key and a private key.  Both key-agreement and key-transport schemes are  specified in the document. A key-agreement scheme is a  procedure in which both parties in a key-establishment  transaction contribute information that is used in generating  a cryptographic key. The key-agreement process includes the  generation of a shared secret (which is not itself considered  to be a cryptographic key), and the derivation of keying  material using the shared secret. Several key-agreement  schemes are specified in SP 800-56A. Figure 11: (See next  page) Key-Agreement Example below provides a simplified  example of a key-agreement scheme. In this example, each  party:  1. Generates a key pair (either prior to or during  the key-agreement transaction);  2. Obtains the public key of the other party;  3. Computes a shared secret using one’s own  keys and the other party’s public key; and  4. Derives one or more keys from the shared  secret.

In SP 800-56A, key transport can  be performed following the key-agreement process depicted  in Figure 11 using a key that was derived during that process.  Figure 12: Key-Transport Example provides an example of a  key transport scheme. In this example,  1. The sender (either party A or party B in Figure  11: Key-Agreement Example), generates a  symmetric key;  2. Wraps (i.e., encrypts) that key using a  key-wrapping algorithm (see SP 800-38F:  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping; SP  800-38F is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-38F. pdf);  3. Sends the resulting ciphertext key to the other  party (i.e., the receiver); and  4. The receiver unwraps (i.e., decrypts) the  received ciphertext key using a key derived  during the key-agreement process to obtain  the original plaintext key that was generated by  the sender.

SP.800-53Ar4.pdf.  SP 800-56A has been under revision during FY 2016.  This revision will:  •  Approve the use of additional parameter/key sizes  for the finite field schemes; currently, only key  sizes of 2048 and 3072 bits are specified. Larger  key sizes will be allowed and defined in the next  version.  •  Allow the use of pre-defined domain parameter  groups that are not currently allowed by SP 800- 56A. Domain parameters are used to generate  keys and compute the shared secret. Methods  for generating domain parameters are specified  for the finite field schemes in FIPS 186-4: Digital  Signature Standard (DSS). The revision of SP 800- 56A will allow the use of domain-parameter groups  using “safe primes” that are used in the Transport  Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Key Exchange  (IKE) protocols, which were not generated using  the methods in FIPS 186-4. These pre-defined  groups will be listed in Annex A of FIPS 140-2.  •  Move all key-derivation functions to SP 800-56C:  Recommendation for Key Derivation Through  Extraction-then-Expansion. SP 800-56A currently  specifies two versions of a single step key- derivation function, refers to SP 800-56C for a  two-step key-derivation procedure, and refers  to SP 800-135: Recommendation for Existing  Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions, for  application-specific key-derivation functions.  The revision of SP 800-56A will be available for public  comment in FY 2017.  SP 800-56C: Recommendation for Key Derivation Through  Extraction-then-Expansion:  SP 800-56C specifies techniques for the derivation  of keys from a shared secret generated during a key- establishment scheme defined in SP 800-56A and SP  800-56B using a two-step extraction-then-expansion  procedure. SP 800-56A is discussed above. SP 800-56B:  Recommendation for Pairwise Key-Establishment Schemes  Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, is available at  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST. SP.800-56Br1.pdf.  SP 800-56C uses either HMAC or the Cipher- based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) algorithm  during the two-step process. HMAC is specified in FIPS  198-1: The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code  (HMAC), and CMAC is specified for AES in SP 800-38B:  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:  the CMAC Mode of Authentication. FIPS 198-1 is available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_ final.pdf; SP 800-38B is available at: http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38b.pdf.  The current version of SP 800-56C is available  at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/ nistspecialpublication800-56c.pdf.  SP 800-56C is being revised to:  •  Move the key derivation functions specified in SP  800-56A into SP 800-56C as well as the references  to SP 800-135: Recommendation for Existing  Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions;  •  Allow the use of KMAC, as specified in Draft SP  800-185, SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE,  Keccak Message Authentication Code (KMAC),  TupleHash and ParallelHash, for key derivation;  •  Define additional Message Authentication Code  (MAC) lengths for the new parameter-size sets  that will be allowed in the revision of SP 800-56A;  and  •  Provide a formula for estimating the security  strength for the parameter-size sets that are  not explicitly listed in SP 800-56A and SP 800- 56B.  The revision of SP 800-56C will be available for public  comment in FY 2017.  N e w  D o c u m e n t s  U n d e r  D e v e l o p m e n t :  A new NIST publication is under development that  provides guidance on the search resistance of a bit string  output from an approved cryptographic algorithm (e.g.,  a cryptographic key or encrypted data). Search resistance  is a (rough) measure of the amount of secrecy that can be  provided by a bit string, given the genealogy (i.e., how it was  generated), handling (i.e., what happened to it after it was  generated), the usage (i.e., what algorithm it will be used  with), length, and any other secret values and processes  associated with the generation and handling of that bit  string. When approved algorithms are used, this document  is intended to provide methods for determining the search  resistance of the bit string. This document, SP 800-158: Key  Management: The Search resistance of Bit Strings Output  by Cryptographic Algorithms, has involved a considerable  amount of new research, since it is an area that has not  been addressed to date. This publication will be available for  public comment in FY 2017.

This second revision will be posted for public review and  comment in FY 2017.  CTG has been contributing to the development of  testssl.sh (see https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh),  an open-source program that tests TLS-enabled servers,  providing information about the protocols and cipher suites  supported, in addition to checking for some well-known  flaws. In FY 2017, CTG will be contributing code to testssl.sh  that tests a TLS server’s configuration for conformance to SP  800-52 Revision 2. CTG intends to make a draft version of  this code available when the draft of SP 800-52 Revision 2 is  posted for public comment.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is actively  developing extensions that can be used to add functionality  to TLS. CTG will continue to review updates and additions to  the TLS protocol in FY 2017.

NIST has standardized elliptic curve cryptography  for digital signature algorithms in FIPS 186: Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), and for key establishment schemes in SP  800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment  Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography.  In FIPS 186-4, NIST recommends fifteen elliptic curves  of varying security strengths for use in these elliptic curve  cryptographic standards. However, the provenance of the  curves is not fully specified in the standard, leading to recent  public concerns that there could be a hidden weakness in  these curves. NIST is not aware of any vulnerability in these  curves when they are implemented correctly and used as  described in NIST standards and guidelines.  More than fifteen years have now passed since these  curves were developed, and the community now knows more  about the security of elliptic curve cryptography and practical  implementation issues. Advances within the cryptographic  community have led to the development of new elliptic  curves and algorithms whose designers claim to offer better  performance and are easier to implement in a secure manner.  Some of these curves are under consideration in voluntary,  consensus-based Standards Developing Organizations.  In FY 2016, NIST solicited comments on possible  improvements to FIPS 186-4. In particular, comments were  requested on the possibility of adding new elliptic curves to  the current recommended set—as well as adding new digital  signature schemes. Throughout 2016, NIST began resolving  the comments and revising FIPS 186-4.

If large- scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to  break the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography.  The focus of the Post-Quantum Cryptography project is  to identify candidate quantum-resistant systems that are  secure against both quantum and classical computers—as  well as the impact that such post-quantum algorithms will  have on current protocols and security infrastructures.  NIST researchers have held regular seminars throughout  FY 2016. The presentation topics include the latest published  results and security analyses, as well as status reports on  quantum computation, hash-based signatures, coding- based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and  multivariate cryptography. Through these presentations and  discussions, the project team has made significant progress  in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the  existing cryptographic schemes in each category.  In April 2016, NIST published NISTIR 8105: Report on Post- Quantum Cryptography, which shared the team’s current  understanding about the status of quantum computing  and post-quantum cryptography. The report also outlined  NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this area. At Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto) 2016, NIST announced  that it would begin the Post-Quantum Standardization  Process, a thorough multi-year effort with the objective of  creating new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards  for public-key encryption and digital signatures (see  www.nist.gov/pqcrypto). These functionalities are much  more complex than AES or SHA-3, and will require  fundamentally new techniques to address several open  research questions in this area (for example, how to  measure security against quantum attacks when a quantum  computer has not yet been built). In August 2016, NIST  issued draft submission requirements and evaluation criteria  for public comment. (see https://www.federalregister.gov/ articles/2016/08/02/2016-18150/request-for-comments-on- post-quantum-cryptography-requirements-and-evaluation- criteria)  The NIST team also continues to be productive in post- quantum cryptography research. The results have been  published at major conferences, such as Embedded Security  in Cars (ESCARS), Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC),  PQCrypto, and Eurocrypt. NIST researchers have given  presentations at conferences and workshops to increase  awareness of the upcoming migration. NIST has also  sponsored other research, education, and research events.  In FY 2017, NIST will continue to explore the security  and feasibility of purported quantum-resistant technologies,  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and cost- effective information assurance in the post-quantum era.  The Post-Quantum Standardization Process will begin in  early FY 2017, with the issuance of the finalized submission  requirements and evaluation criteria. There will be a one-year  period during which quantum-resistant algorithms may be  submitted for possible standardization. After the submission  period, there will be a public workshop in FY 2018, followed  by multiple rounds of evaluation and analysis.

In practice, it  is important to be able to minimize the size of these  circuits. This problem is closely related to designing small  combinational circuits. These circuits use only binary AND,  XOR and NEGATION gates, i.e., multiplication, addition, and  “+1” in arithmetic modulo 2. A combinational circuit on four  variables (X1, X2, X3, and X4) using AND and XOR gates is  depicted in Figure 13.

In practice, this  means that it is necessary to settle for methods that design  “good” circuits, as opposed to provably optimal circuits.  The CTG has developed and implemented new solutions for  the circuit-minimization problem. Two patents have been  granted related to this work, the last one in FY 2014. These  are held jointly between NIST and the University of Southern  Denmark.  The CTG is also researching circuit-based security metrics  for cryptographic functions. For a function to be secure (in  particular, one-way), it must be the case that any circuit that  implements it is sufficiently complex. In particular, a function  is insecure if it can be implemented by a circuit containing  too few Boolean AND gates. This security metric, namely the  number of AND gates necessary and sufficient to implement  a function, is referred to as its multiplicative complexity.  Unfortunately, determining multiplicative complexity is  extremely hard.  The CTG has published circuits that are provably  optimal or close to optimal (with respect to multiplicative  complexity) for important classes of functions. In the process,  we developed tools that have wide applicability for both  theoretical and applied research in security and cryptography.  Multiparty computation is a technique that allows a  group of people to compute a function of their inputs without  revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this are: i)  holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions in  which only the winning bid is determined; and iii) proving to a  third party that a person’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as “over 21 and (U.S. citizen or Canadian  citizen).” The protocols that solve multiparty computation  problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2. The  complexity of such protocols largely depends on the number  of multiplications required. Hence, expressing functions as  circuit computations with only a few multiplication (AND)  gates is important. Some of the published circuits are now  the standard reference for benchmarking tools in multiparty  computation.  The following is a partial list of new results by our team:  •  Better recursions for Karatsuba multiplication,  which yielded the smallest known circuits for binary  multiplication (i.e., multiplication of polynomials of  degree n over the Galois Field with two elements).  This yields important speed increases in elliptic  curve cryptography and other applications.  •  Optimal circuits were constructed - with respect  to multiplicative complexity - for all predicates on  four bits (see the example below). There are 65,536  such predicates. Surprisingly, the multiplicative  complexity of all these functions turned out to  be at most three. Additionally, our circuits use no  more than seven non-linear gates (XOR, XNOR).  This is quite hard. Consider the following predicate  (arithmetic is modulo 2):  f = x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 +x2x4 + x1x2x3 + x1x2x4 + x1x2x3x4.  •  Computing the last term requires three  multiplications. So, it is quite surprising that the  full expression can be computed using only three  multiplications. But, we have shown this to be  true for f and all other predicates on four bits. The  circuit depicted above computes f using three  multiplications and six additions.  •  A proof was developed that the maximum  multiplicative complexity of predicates on five bits  (there are more than 4 billion such predicates) is  four. The proof is constructive, meaning that the  circuits can actually be built.  •  A proof was developed that an explicit function  requires at least 3.01n gates. This constitutes the  only improvement on this problem for more than  30 years. The result is due to Magnus Find, in  collaboration with mathematicians from New York  University (NYU) and from the Steklov Institute, St.  Petersburg, Russia.  In 2017, plans are in place to begin the implementation  of combinational circuits in ASIC (application-specific  integrated circuit) hardware. The team will also map the  multiplicative complexity of all functions of six variables  and will code a new heuristic for simultaneously reducing  the size and depth of circuits.

Examples of these areas  include automotive systems, sensor networks, healthcare,  distributed control systems, the Internet of Things (IoT),  cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. Security and  privacy can be very important in these areas. Because most  of the modern cryptographic algorithms were designed for  desktop/server environments, many of these algorithms  cannot be implemented in the constrained devices used  by these applications. When current NIST-approved  algorithms can be engineered to fit into the limited  resources of constrained environments, their performance  may not be acceptable.  For these reasons, NIST started a  lightweight cryptography project in 2013 that was tasked  with determining the need and developing a strategy for the  standardization of lightweight cryptographic algorithms.  CTG staff are examining applications in constrained  environments to determine whether NIST should develop  lightweight cryptographic standards. This includes  communicating with industry experts to understand the  challenges and limitations and following the work of  other standardization bodies in this area. In FY 2015, CTG  organized a Lightweight Cryptography Workshop to discuss  issues related to the security and resource requirements of  applications in constrained environments and potential future  standardization of lightweight primitive algorithms. Using  input gathered at the workshop in FY 2016, CTG released  draft NISTIR 8114, Draft Report on Lightweight Cryptography  for public comments. This report provides an overview of  the lightweight cryptography project at NIST, and describes  a plan for the standardization of lightweight cryptographic  algorithms. This plan involves the creation of profiles that  will target specific applications and requirements where  conventional cryptography may not be suitable.  CTG is organizing the second NIST workshop on  Lightweight Cryptography, taking place at the beginning of  FY 2017 to discuss the plan outlined in the draft report before  it is finalized. The next steps in the plan include working with  industry to create an initial set of profiles and the selection  of algorithms that meet profile requirements.

It  uses two independent, commercially-available sources of  randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy  source and SP 800-90A-approved components.  The NIST Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability,  autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that  users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are  made available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the  distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set  of users can access the source in such a way that they are  confident of receiving the same random string.  The NIST Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits  every 60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and  signed to form a packet that also includes the hash of the  previous value to chain the sequence of values together.  This prevents all parties, even the source, from retroactively  changing an output packet without being detected. The  NIST Beacon keeps all output packets. At any point in time,  the full history of outputs is available to users.  Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In the digital age, algorithmic pseudorandom number  generators (PRNGs) have largely replaced these tables. The  NIST Beacon expands the use of randomness to multiple  scenarios in which neither tables nor PRNGs can be used.  The extra functionalities stem mainly from three features.  First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted  before they are published. Second, the public, time-bound,  and authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user  application to prove to anybody that it used truly random  numbers not known before a certain point in time. Third, this  proof can be presented offline and at any point in the future.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned implementations of the NIST Beacon, the NIST  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In collaboration with  NIST physicists from the Physical Measurement Laboratory  (PML), the project team aims to use quantum non-locality to  build an entropy source whose unpredictability is guaranteed  by the laws of physics. In FY 2016, a major milestone was  achieved, namely, a strong loophole-free test of local realism  (where individual particles are governed by elements of  reality, even if these elements are hidden from us) (see  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team- proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real).  The project team has also made progress in reaching a  goal of helping other institutions set up other interoperable  sources. This is important because multiple sources can be  combined in such a way that all sources would have to be  compromised in order to degrade the common random  strings.  As of the end of FY 2016, the NIST Beacon has been  functioning without interruption for more than three years.  During this time, the project team has received valuable input  from a growing community of users. As a result, the project  team will provide an enhanced version of the service during  FY 2017. The enhancements are mainly intended to enable  interoperability.  NIST encourages the community-at-large to research  and publish novel ways in which this tool can be used.

In FY 2016, NIST researchers continuously collaborated  with the IEEE 802.21 Working Group to develop solutions  for multicast group key distribution and coauthored a paper  titled “Security Multicast Group Key Management and Key  Distribution in IEEE 802.21.” The paper has been accepted by  the Security Standardization Research Conference 2016 (SSR  2016) and will be presented on December 5-6, 2016.  In FY 2017, the NIST team will continue to contribute  to IEEE 802 wireless standards and provide guidance for  NIST cryptographic standard usage in wireless and mobility  applications.

A blockchain is a  distributed database that maintains a continuously growing  list of records called blocks that are secured from revision  using a hash function. Each block contains a link to the  previous block. A new block is added to the chain only when  multiple parties (possibly mutually untrusting parties) agree  to its accuracy. In essence, a blockchain is a mutually agreed- upon record of history.

However, the use of  blockchains has been proposed for other applications, such  as smart contracts and various ledgering applications.  Many organizations have suggested applications for the  use of blockchains, some of which may not be appropriate.  The CSD is investigating the use of blockchains to determine  which application types are appropriate for using blockchains  and which are not. The CTG is monitoring the proposed  uses of cryptography to assure that current cryptographic  techniques are used properly and whether new techniques  are required.  During FY 2016, the CTG participated in two blockchain  workshops: the “DC Blockchain Summit” in March and the  “Blockchain and Healthcare Workshop” in September.  The CTG took an active role in the September workshop  by reviewing papers and providing presentations on  blockchains and the CTG standards that might be useful for  future blockchain work. The CSD also began testing the use  of several blockchain nodes.  During FY 2017, in addition to continuing familiarization  with the use of blockchains and monitoring the cryptography  proposed, the CTG is planning to participate in a blockchain  study group sponsored by American Standards Committee  X9, the financial services committee of the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI).

The ability to generate  strong cryptographic keys is directly related to having  access to unpredictable random data, but generating truly  unpredictable random data on computing devices is hard  and unreliable. As a result, weak keys are widely used in  cryptographic applications, thus compromising the security  of the sensitive data protected by them − potentially with  disastrous consequences.  A primary goal of this project is to provide high-quality,  truly unpredictable random data to devices on the Internet  to enable them to generate strong cryptographic keys and  attest the strength of the keys used to protect data in transit  or at rest, thereby enabling cryptographic system strength  attestation. Achieving this goal would provide a solid basis  for achieving the goals of the Automated Cryptographic  Validation Testing project (see http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ acvt/ ) as well as addressing the problems targeted by the  Cryptographic Programs and Laboratory Accreditation (see  the next section: Validated Programs, the first project in that  section), where entropy estimation has persisted as one of  the most difficult and labor-consuming activities, causing  problems for all parties involved: the industry, the testing  laboratories and the government validators.  Random data obtained from sources of true  randomness that are based on unpredictable physical  phenomena, such as quantum effects, is much better  suited for cryptographic applications. CSD is collaborating  with the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML)  to build a quantum source. The aim is to use quantum  effects to generate sequences that are guaranteed to be  unpredictable, even if an attacker has access to the random  source. For more information on this collaboration, see  https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_ test.cfm/  This project aims to develop a system and protocols  for obtaining random data with high entropy from one or  more remote sources. The high-level architecture is shown  in Figure 15: (See next page) High-level Architecture of EaaS.  The architecture of the Entropy-as-a-Service system consists  of two main parts: the client-side and the server-side. The  critical components of the system are the quantum device,  the EaaS server and a secure device in the client systems  that is capable of providing strong isolation and protection  for the cryptographic keys stored inside the device and  offering a set of basic cryptographic services.  The EaaS server is continuously fed random data from  the attached quantum source. The data enters a FIFO (first in,  first out)-like buffer in the server’s Random Access Memory  (RAM), and, when a client request arrives, the server reads  the top value from the buffer, signs and encrypts it, and then  sends it to the requester. The FIFO buffer shifts after every  request and when new data comes from the random source.  The EaaS server ensures that the FIFO buffer is erased  prior to server shutdown and never paged to disk. Open  implementations can help ensure that this occurs.  The client system consists of a classic computing device  enabled with a dedicated hardware component capable of  storing secret cryptographic keys and seeds.

Examples of secure  hardware components are the Trusted Platform Module (TPM),  TrustZone technology in Advanced Reduced Instruction Set  Computing (RISC) Machine (ARM) processors, and Identity  Protection Technology in Intel processors. If a client system  or device doesn’t have a secure hardware component, it can  still use EaaS. The presence of a hardware component simply  provides further guarantees to the system or device user,  when present.  EaaS uses HTTP to transfer entropy payloads from the  service to clients. To secure this transmission, the server  encrypts the data using the client’s provided public key and  digitally signs the payload with the server’s own private key.  Client devices mix this data with locally available random  data to seed random number generators to generate strong  cryptographic keys and other random values independently  from the remote sources.  With the conceptual system architecture and protocols  defined, the project team continues to engage with industry  and academia to obtain feedback on the approach and  identify possibilities for collaborative approaches to solving  important cybersecurity challenges in the domains of  cryptography and supply-chain management (e.g., integrated  circuit counterfeiting). The team published a peer-reviewed  paper on EaaS in IEEE Computer, a top professional journal,  in September 2016. The team also started a collaboration  with a team of researchers at the University of Florida who  won a NIST research grant to explore ways to leverage  EaaS in protecting against integrated circuit counterfeiting  and thereby help secure the supply chain. The University of  Florida researchers will start their project in FY 2017.  The team continues to develop the system to provide  a publicly accessible NIST EaaS instance in FY 2017. During  the summer of FY 2016, the team hosted a Summer  Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) student who  developed a sample EaaS-client implementation with a  Figure 15: High-level Architecture of EaaS  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Related to this,  the project team is planning to work on developing public  criteria for reputable EaaS hosts.

FIPS 140-2 was released on  May 25, 2001 and supersedes FIPS 140-1.  The current implementation of the CMVP is shown in  Figure 16: Current Validation Flow below. The CMVP leverages  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP) accredited Cryptographic and Security testing  (CST) laboratories for validation testing against the derived  test requirements (DTR), implementation guidance (IG),  and applicable CMVP programmatic guidance. According  to existing guidance, the CST laboratories must perform  100 % independent testing of the modules submitted by the  vendors.  The structure and the rules under which the CMVP  operates worked well for the level of the technology utilized  by the Federal Government when the program was created  more than two decades ago. As technology has advanced,  however, the module testing process no longer satisfies  the current industry and government operational needs.  Testing is exceedingly long—well beyond typical product- development cycles across a wide range of technologies.  The resulting validated modules often do not provide useful  interfaces for integration into IT systems to enable run-time  monitoring of modules for compliance with FISMA.  NIST recognizes the need to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of cryptographic module testing to reduce the  time and cost required for testing, while providing a high  level of assurance for Federal Government consumers.  The principal goals of this project are to collaborate  with commercial or open source producers of cryptographic  capabilities and government consumers of FIPS 140-validated  modules to:  Figure 16: Current Validation Flow  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

At this stage, we  have only partially concluded the research on this  and can point to examples at https://github.com/ usnistgov/ACVP); and  •  Identify techniques and procedures that provide  continued assurance of operational compliance to  FIPS 140 for cryptographic modules throughout  their lifecycle.  The scope of this project is broken into multiple  phases to be performed over several years.  P H A S E  1  • Identify potential approaches,  •  Select the best technical approach or approaches  to prototype, and  • Document the technical approach.  P H A S E  2  • Develop working prototypes, and  •  Evaluate the prototypes against the principal  goals.  P H A S E  3  •  Publish a draft, provide a review period, adjudicate  the comments, and publish the final version.  P H A S E  4  •  Integrate the final version into the operational  CMVP program.  Currently, the project is focused on completing the  documentation of the technical approach for automating  the algorithm testing and researching the approaches  for automating the software module testing. The team  working on this project, in collaboration with the industry,  demonstrated successful automated algorithm validations  at the International Cryptographic Module Conference in  May 2017 for some algorithms (see https://acvts.nist.gov/ acvp/home) and continues to develop the automation of  the rest of algorithms currently tested by the traditional  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (http://csrc. nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/index.html) with the goal of  replacing it by the second quarter of 2018.  The project activities are structured by work areas in  order for subject-matter experts to more narrowly focus and  make progress.  1. Algorithm and Protocol Testing;  2. Cryptographic Module Testing, a. Hardware, b. Software, and c.  Modules in cloud environments;  and 3.  Positioning and relationships to other  Government Validation Programs.  The project has several planned deliverables, including  the identification of prospective technical approaches that  adopt industry best practices and produce artifacts that  are machine readable and map to DTR requirements, and a  selection of the best technical and feasible approaches.

Poor  implementations of these standards or specifications may  render a product insecure, potentially placing sensitive  information at risk. ITL operates several validation programs  that help provide a level of assurance that products meet  established security requirements and conform to published  specifications. To that end, the CSD Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group (STVMG) develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation guidance  and technical support to industry forums; and conducts  education, training, and outreach programs.  STVMG’s validation programs work together with  independent laboratories that are accredited by the National  Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP).

C r y p t o g r a p h i c  P r o g r a m s  a n d  L a b o r a t o r y  A c c r e d i t a t i o n  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)  The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)  was developed to support the federal user communities for  strong, independently tested, and commercially available  cryptographic modules. Through this program, the CMVP  works with international government, public and private  sectors as a part of the cryptographic community to  achieve standards-based security and assurance of correct  implementation. The goal is to provide federal agencies  with a security metric to use in procuring and deploying  cryptographic modules, and promote the use of validated  modules by industry and the public. The testing performed  by independent third-party laboratories accredited by  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CMVP  program provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry,  and the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or  products containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP  Validated Modules List and have confidence in the claimed  level of security and assurance of correct implementation.  Cryptographic module testing and validation are  based on published NIST standards. Since federal agencies  are required to use validated cryptographic modules for  the protection of sensitive unclassified information, the  validated modules and the validated algorithms that the  modules contain represent the culmination and delivery of  CSD’s cryptography-based work to the end user.  The CMVP validates modules that are used in a wide  variety of products, including Internet browsers, radios, smart  cards, space-based communications, munitions, security  tokens, mobile phones, network and storage devices, and  products supporting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and  electronic commerce. While a module may be a standalone  product (e.g., a virtual private network (VPN) or smart  card), in many cases, a module (e.g., a cryptographic-based  toolkit) is embedded into many products. Because a small  number of modules may be incorporated within hundreds of  products, the validation process has significant impact.  The theme for the CMVP in FY 2016 was change. The  CMVP is evolving to be more efficient and consistent.  The CMVP implemented an automated system, modified  workflow processes to provide better transparency and  strengthened collaboration with the Cryptographic Modules  User Forum (CMUF).  On October 1, 2015, the CMVP began using a new  automated system to manage the validation workflow. The  impact to the CMVP’s efficiency was dramatic. In FY 2016,  the CMVP awarded 307 new certificates, 111 more than in FY  2015. Figure 17: FY 2016 CMVP Certificates by Security Level  displays the number of certificates by security level for FY  2016.  Figure 17: FY 2016 CMVP Certificates by Security Level  The automated system tracks the status of each  submission and identifies the order in which the submissions  should be reviewed, based on when each submission is  added to the CMVP queue. Automating this housekeeping  task significantly increased the efficiency of the validation  process. Not only does this allow the CMVP time to focus  on other tasks, it reduces the number of status messages  from the laboratories that request a status for their specific  submission. Status messages have dropped from 4 to 6 per  week to 0 to 1 per week.  The number of submissions sitting in the CMVP queue  and the average queue time have been reduced in part due  to this automation. The number of modules in the queue has  dropped from an average of 120 to an average of 65. The  average queue length (e.g., the amount of time between  the arrival of a submission and when the review begins)  has dropped from an average of four months to an average  of less than two months. The average amount of time to  validate a module is six months, with some validations being  completed within two months. In the last quarter of FY 2016,  the queue was, at times, empty.

Generating an invoice was reduced from an average of three  weeks to one day. Similarly, receiving a notification that an  invoice was paid went from an average of one week to one  day. These are contributing factors to the reduction in the  queue length. This achievement was due to the cooperative  relationship between the CMVP and NIST Receivables, who  worked through technical challenges to allow the systems to  exchange information.  In May 2015, to provide greater transparency to the  laboratories, the CMVP began sending a weekly report  to each laboratory, providing the status of each of their  submissions. Before the capability to prepare and send this  report was available, the CMVP and laboratories would, at  times, find that each thought the other had the next action,  resulting in unnecessary delays.  In August 2015, to provide greater transparency to  users, the CMVP separated the Implementation-Under-Test  (IUT) list from the rest of the Modules-In-Process (MIP) list.  Separating the lists allows the users to quickly and easily see  that the CMVP does not have any information on the modules  currently being tested (i.e., those listed in the IUT list). In fact,  the IUT list is provided as a marketing service for vendors that  have made a commitment to achieving validation, but whose  module(s) are not yet in the MIP.  The CMVP strengthened its relationship with the CMUF by  supporting the monthly CMUF general membership meetings  and five CMUF working groups. The working groups are chaired  by a member of industry and/or by laboratory personnel.  Each working group includes a representative from the CMVP.  The current working group topics include the Security Policy  Template; Testing Equivalency; Revalidation in Response to  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs); Proposed IG  Integrity Testing using Random Sampling and IG Updates (IG  3.5 Documentation Requirements for Cryptographic Module  Services, IG 1.20 Sub-Chip Cryptographic Subsystems, and  7.7 Key Establishment and Key Entry and Output). This CMUF  collaboration allows greater progress on technical guidance  and incorporates differing perspectives.  For FY 2017, the CMVP team is:  •  Anticipating the approval of FIPS 140-3. When  approved, the CMVP will create the necessary  documents and processes to support the transition  from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3;  •  Continuing to invest in automation to streamline the  validation process and improve review consistency.  One effort that started in FY 2016 was the ability  for a laboratory to request an invoice while the  laboratory finalizes the submission to CMVP. If  laboratories leverage this new capability, the  CMVP could see a further reduction in the queue  length;  •  Anticipating the rollout of the new Computer  Security Resource Center (CSRC) web site. This  will allow the CMVP to replace the static validation  pages with an interactive capability for users, along  with other improvements for users. Following this,  the CMVP will begin the transition to a web-based  submission process to replace the current email- based process;  •  Continuing to strengthen its relationship with  the CMUF by collaborating on new and improved  technical guidance and programmatic issues;  and  •  Joining the International Cryptographic Module  Conference (ICMC) program committee to  continue strengthening partnership within the  community.

The CAVP was established in 2013 as  a joint program in collaboration between NIST and the  Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of Canada.  Prior to this date, the CAVP’s functions were included in the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). With the  increase in the number and complexity of FIPS-Approved  and NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms, it was  deemed necessary to establish the CAVP as an independent  program.  The CAVP’s goal is to provide federal agencies with a  security metric to use in validating cryptographic algorithm  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The testing is carried  out by independent third-party laboratories accredited by  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CAVP  program provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry,  and the public can choose validated implementations  of cryptographic algorithms from the CAVP Validated  Algorithms List and have confidence in the claimed level of  security and assurance of correct implementation.  The validation of cryptographic algorithms by the  CAVP is a prerequisite to the validation of a cryptographic  module by the CMVP and is also used by other programs  outside of NIST as well. Since federal agencies are required  to use validated cryptographic modules for the protection of  sensitive unclassified information, the validated modules and  the validated algorithms that the modules contain represent  the culmination and delivery of CSD’s cryptography-based  work to the end user.  The CAVP validation program provides documented  methodologies for conformance testing through defined  sets of security requirements. For the CAVP, a validation  system document is designed for each FIPS-approved  or NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithm. See the  website for a listing (see http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/ cavp/). The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the  underlying cryptographic algorithm standards or methods.  By the end of 2016, the CAVP had issued approximately  23,559 validations, representing the algorithm validations of  approximately 18 approved algorithms, including 5 modes of  operation.  The CAVP issued approximately 4,000 algorithm  validations in FY 2016, an increase of approximately 600  validations from the previous year. The increase in validations  is attributed to an increase in cryptographic modules being  validated and other outside programs now requiring CAVP  validated implementations, e.g., the National Information  Assurance Partnership (NIAP).  The number of algorithms submitted for validation  continues to grow, representing significant growth in the  number of validations expected to be available in the future.

A u t o m a t e d  S e c u r i t y  T e s t i n g  a n d  T e s t  S u i t e  D e v e l o p m e n t  The CAVP utilizes the requirements and specifications  of the NIST standards (i.e., FIPS and Special Publications) to  develop algorithm validation test suites and an automated  security testing tool. The CAVP is responsible for providing  assurance that the cryptographic algorithm implementations  contained in cryptographic modules are implemented  according to the specifications in the standards. The CAVP  accomplishes this by designing and developing conformance  testing specific to each cryptographic algorithm.  The conformance testing consists of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm. These  validation tests exercise the algorithmic requirements  and mathematical formulas to assure that the detailed  specifications are implemented correctly and completely.  If the implementer deviates from the specifications in the  standard or excludes any part of these specifications or  requirements, the validation test will detect the deviations  and fail. The validation testing will indicate that the algorithm  implementation does not function properly or is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests designed  and developed by the CAVP are used by independent third- party laboratories accredited by NVLAP. The laboratory  works with vendors to validate their cryptographic  algorithm implementations. The suite of validation tests for  each algorithm ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency of results across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are  not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests,  and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests  are designed to examine the individual components of  the algorithm by supplying known values to the variables  and verifying the expected result. Negative testing is also  performed by supplying known incorrect values to assure  that the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise the  entire implementation-under-test (IUT). This test is designed  to detect the presence of implementation flaws that are not  detected with the controlled input of the Known-Answer  Tests. The types of implementation flaws detected by  this validation test include pointer problems, insufficient  allocation of space, improper error handling, and incorrect  behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT)  is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which requires the chaining  of information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, the CSD Cryptographic  Technology Group (CTG) has expanded its publications  to contain not only the algorithm’s specifications, but  also requirements for an algorithm’s use. Many of these  usage requirements do not fall within the scope of the  CAVP, because the CAVP focuses on the correctness of  the instructions within the algorithm’s boundary. If these  additional algorithm usage requirements are not considered  applicable to the algorithm’s implementation, they cannot  be tested at the algorithm level by the CAVP, but may be  tested by the CMVP if the requirements are considered  applicable to the cryptographic module. However, some of  these usage requirements may be outside the scope of both  the algorithm implementation and cryptographic module.  In this latter case, the fulfillment of the requirements is the  responsibility of entities using, installing, or configuring  applications or protocols that use the cryptographic  algorithms. For example, depending on the design of a  cryptographic module, it may not be possible for the module  to determine whether a specific key is used for multiple  purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.

In general, vendors  may opt for product validation for one or more SCAP  capabilities or operating systems. Currently, the program  offers testing on Microsoft Windows and Red Hat Enterprise  Linux platforms. The validation process starts when a vendor  voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled product to an NVLAP- accredited laboratory. Once the lab completes product  testing, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation  Program at NIST for review. NIST reviews the test report and  awards a validation if all requirements have been met. Once  a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation Record is sent  to the lab, and the information about the newly validated  product is posted on the SCAP Validated Products web page.  Figure 21: SCAP 1.2 Validation Process illustrates the SCAP 1.2  Validation Process.  All resources and information necessary for preparing  products for SCAP 1.2 validation are published on the SCAP  Validation Program web pages (see the url below). The most  current NISTIR 7511 revision, as well as SCAP capabilities  and supported platforms, are available on the home  page (see http://scap.nist.gov/validation). The resources  page includes documentation, a list of Frequently Asked  Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test content, and  tools for validating and processing SCAP data streams. The  SCAP validation-test content should be used by vendors  for quality assurance testing prior to entering formal SCAP  testing with an NVLAP-accredited laboratory. The open- source tools that are available for download may be used by  SCAP content authors for testing the SCAP source content.  The SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to  determine if the content conforms to the SCAP specification.  Open-source SCAP reference implementation tools, such as  the SCAP Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to  process SCAP data streams.  End users may use information on the SCAP Validation  web page to learn about SCAP validation and find products  that have been awarded validations. The validation records  that are posted on the SCAP Validated Products page identify  the product versions that were tested in the laboratory,  along with details about each validation, such as the tested  platforms, SCAP capabilities, the validation test suite version,  and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2016, several products successfully completed  testing and were awarded validations, bringing the total  Figure 21: SCAP 1.2 Validation Process  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Most  vendors of configuration scanning products are SCAP  validated, and vendors continually pursue validation for new  platforms, capabilities, and versions of SCAP. The current  list of SCAP 1.2-validated products may be found on the  SCAP Validated Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/scap/ validated-tools.  In FY 2017, NISTIR 7511 will be updated, adding  requirements to test products for conformance to  SCAP 1.3. New capabilities include testing the ability of  products to process the most recent Open Vulnerability  and Assessment Language (OVAL) versions and to read  Software Identification (SWID) tags. The modular structure  of the SCAP Validation Program supports the addition  of these new test requirements, as well as new platforms  and capabilities, without needing to re-design the entire  program. Vendors benefit from the modular structure by  choosing the capabilities and platforms that satisfy the  needs of their customers.  F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  http://scap.nist.gov/validation  C O N T A C T :  Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  I D E N T I T Y  A N D  A C C E S S  M A N A G E M E N T  N I S T  P e r s o n a l  I d e n t i t y  V e r i f i c a t i o n  P r o g r a m  ( N P I V P )  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity  Verification Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components  for conformance to the specifications in FIPS 201, Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors, and its companion documents (detailed below).  The two PIV components that come under the scope of NPIVP  are the PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware.  NPIVP test facilities that perform conformance tests for  these two components are Cryptographic and Security  Testing (CST) Laboratories accredited by the NVLAP. As of  September 2016, there were seven such facilities (see http:// csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/testing_facilities.html).  The interface specifications for the PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware are found in a FIPS 201  companion document, namely, SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for  Personal Identity Verification. The conformance tests for  these specifications are detailed in SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card  Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines. To  implement these tests and to generate conformance test  reports, CSD also developed and maintains an integrated  toolkit called the “PIV Interface Test Runner,” which  conducts tests on both PIV Smart Card Applications and PIV  Middleware products. This toolkit is provided to accredited  NPIVP test facilities for product testing and to the general  public as open source software.  The NPIVP team is also closely involved in activities  related to the revision of specifications of the PIV companion  documents, such as SP 800-73, SP 800-76, Biometric  Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, and SP 800- 78, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal  Identity Verification. This ensures that specification revisions  in the PIV documents are fully reflected in the conformance  test documents, SP 800-85A-4 and SP 800-85B (PIV  Data Model Conformance Test Guidelines) as well as in  the “PIV Interface Test Runner” toolkit. The changes to PIV  specifications in PIV companion documents necessitated  that NPIVP make a major update to the conformance  test documents and consequently to the “PIV Interface  Test Runner” toolkit in 2016. The updated Test Runner is  available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/sw- downloads.html.  The NPIVP team also maintains the Validation List for  PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware products  that are PIV-conformant implementations. Updates to the  PIV Smart Card Application validation list were necessary  in 2016 to comply with the sunset date for some Random  Number Generators (RNGs), as outlined in SP 800-131A,  Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic  Algorithms and Key Lengths. More information about the  sunset can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/ npivp/announcements.html.  In FY 2017, the NPIVP team will continue to fine-tune its  toolkit and perform acceptance testing for PIV Smart Card  Applications and PIV Middleware.

HSPD-12 called for  the creation of a new identity credential for federal employees  and contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical specification for  both the PIV identity credential and the PIV system that  produces, manages, and uses the credential. Within NIST’s  Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), this work is a  collaborative effort of the CSD and the Information Access  Division (IAD). CSD activities in FY 2016 directly supported  the latest revision of FIPS 201 (i.e., FIPS 201-2) by updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2 and by  developing several new publications. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2016 in support of HSPD-12:  •  Published Draft SP 800-116 Revision 1, A  Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials  in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). This  document provides best practice guidelines  for integrating the PIV Card with the PACS that  authenticate the PIV cardholders in federal facilities.  The document recommends a risk-based approach  for selecting appropriate PIV authentication  mechanisms to manage physical access to Federal  Government facilities and assets.  •  Published SP 800-156, Representation of PIV Chain- of-Trust for Import and Export. This document  provides the data representation of a chain-of-trust  record for the exchange of records between issuers.  The exchanged record can be used by an agency to  personalize a PIV Card for a transferred employee,  or by a service provider to personalize a PIV Card  on behalf of client federal agencies. The data  representation is based on a common XML schema  to facilitate interoperable information sharing  and data exchange. The document also provides  support for data integrity through digital signatures  and confidentiality through encryption of chain-of- trust data in transit and at rest.  •  Published a white paper, Best Practices for  Privileged User PIV Authentication, in response  to OMB’s 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint effort  and subsequent OMB Memorandum M-16-04,  Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan  (CSIP) for the Federal Civilian Government, which  requires federal agencies to use PIV credentials for  authenticating privileged users. The white paper  outlines the risks of password-based single-factor  authentication, and describes best practices for the  use of multi-factor PIV-based user authentication  for privileged users.  •  Published SP 800-166, Derived PIV Application and  Data Model Test Guidelines. SP 800-166 contains  the derived test requirements and test assertions  for testing the Derived PIV Application and  associated Derived PIV data objects residing on a  mobile device. The tests verify the conformance of  these artifacts to the technical specifications of SP  800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Credentials. SP 800-157 specifies  standards-based, secure, reliable, interoperable  public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based identity  credentials. SP 800-166 is targeted at vendors  of Derived PIV Applications, issuers of Derived  PIV Credentials, and entities that will conduct  conformance tests on these applications and  credentials.  •  Published SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Application and  Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4  Compliance), to align the testing requirements with  FIPS 2012, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  In FY 2017, CSD will continue to focus on updating  relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2, including  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/  C O N T A C T S :  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972  (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  david.cooper@nist.gov  Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli  (301) 975-5013  mouli@nist.gov  A u t h e n t i c a t i o n To support Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) requirements, CSD developed SP 800-63, Electronic  Authentication Guideline. OMB defines four levels of  assurance that a federal agency must select, based on a risk  assessment to determine the impact of an authentication  failure. This guideline covers remote authentication of users  (such as private individuals) interacting with government IT  systems over the Internet. It defines technical requirements  for each of the four levels of assurance in the areas of identity  proofing, authenticators, credential binding, management  processes, authentication protocols and federation. The  newest revision underway in 2016 establishes three individual  assurance categories that can map into the original OMB  levels of assurance. The categories are:  •  Identity Assurance Level - the robustness of the  identity proofing process and the binding between  an authenticator and the records pertaining to a  specific individual;  •  Authentication Assurance Level - the robustness  of the authentication process itself; and,  •  Federation Assurance Level - the robustness  of the assertion protocol utilized by a federation  to communicate authentication and attribute  information (if applicable) to a relying party.  Since the initial release of SP 800-63, CSD has released  two revisions to address changes in modern technology and  lessons learned from practical implementations by federal  departments and agencies.  In addition, market forces have resulted in an inflexion  point in how departments and agencies authenticate users.  NIST and the private-sector partners have observed that  some public and private-sector identity assurance standards  have become outdated or have simply not been adopted.  Specifically, SP 800-63 was originally written to address an  online world that is much different than today. Innovation  has offered new perspectives in how trusted identities can  be established. Practical implementations of SP 800-63  have informed us of areas of strengths, weaknesses, and  techniques not utilized by federal agencies or the private  sector. Note that our online adversaries are targeting user  names and passwords as the simplest point of entry to gain  unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.  CSD, in collaboration with the ACD Trusted Identities  Group, hosted the two-day workshop “Applying  Measurement Science in the Identity Ecosystem” in January  2016. NIST gathered critical feedback from over 200 industry,  academic, and public-sector stakeholders regarding new  directions that NIST should take in authentication guidance  and in methods for measuring the strength of relevant  technologies and processes. The workshop culminated in  the release of NISTIR 8103, Advanced Identity Workshop on  Applying Measurement Science in the Identity Ecosystem:  Summary and Next Steps.  In May 2016, ITL released a public preview draft of NIST  SP 800-63-3, with an updated name, Digital Authentication  Guideline. This body of work represents a significant departure  from prior versions of the special publication. The guideline  has been divided into a family of standalone documents that  focus on outcomes and innovation where possible, rather  than prescriptive processes and technologies (see Figure  23). A significant number of requirements were updated  Figure 23: New SP 800-63-3 Structure  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

SP 800-63-3, while required for  federal agencies, suggests requirements for solutions often  provided by the private sector; hence, many updates were  garnered from innovation in the market, workshop feedback,  and a dialog with all sectors while the guideline was open  for comment. CSD and ACD also piloted a new approach  to managing stakeholder feedback and document updates.  During the development of the SP 800-63 revision, drafts  of the documents were made available on GitHub, an online  version management and collaboration tool that allowed us  to openly discuss comments in real time and accept edits  directly into the document from ITL stakeholders. This was  the first time that an 800 series draft Special Publication was  published on GitHub; the use of GitHub proved successful  and will continue to be used to manage SP 800-63-3 as the  document transitions from public preview to final version.  In FY 2017, CSD will publish the final SP 800-63-3  revision, giving agencies an increased set of secure, privacy- enhancing, and user-friendly options to deliver safe digital  services to their constituents. The final version may also serve  as a foundation for future authentication shared services  that the government will offer, such as those directed by the  Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP).  Work on 800-63-3 will continue after the document  becomes final. ITL will work on identifying ways to measure  authentication systems in a more systematic and scientific  way, allowing NIST to specify additional metrics that would  be required in future authentication systems, based on risk.  Work on biometric authentication will capitalize on the  opportunity to enhance the authentication performance and  security of a range of modalities (e.g., fingerprint, voice, or  iris recognition). NIST will explore the inclusion of additional  industry best practices into future revisions of SP 800-63-3.  NIST will also research methods to ensure that practices align  with the security and privacy demands of digital services  offered by government. In addition to the topics described  above, the team will research approaches that harmonize  U.S. Government requirements on an international scale,  promoting easy-to-implement cross-border trusted identity  solutions. This helps avoid challenges that result from  disparate, nationally unique authentication guidelines that  may disrupt international interoperability.

Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics is needed.  In FY 2016, the following activities were accomplished  for this project:  •  Researched the requirement and capabilities  for Access Control (AC) policy composing and  verification technology;  •  Studied attribute considerations for access  mechanism implementation; the results are  presented in the internal draft of a NIST SP,  Attribute Consideration for Access Control Systems  (no publication number has been assigned to this  internal draft SP), which is scheduled to be released  during FY 2017);  •  Researched the AC requirements and functions for  distributed systems, including Big Data, Cloud, IoT,  and the Smart Grid; and  •  Published NIST SP 800-178, A Comparison of  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Standards  for Data Services, and worked on two internal draft  NIST SPs: 1) Draft SP 800-192: Verification and Test  Methods for Access Control Polices/Models, and  2) Draft SP (no number yet assigned), Attribute  Consideration for Access Control Systems; both  SPs are related to access control and privilege  management.  In FY 2017, CSD will continue the above research. CSD  expects that this project will:  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared  resources and common trust-management  schemes;  •  Provide guidance for implementing access control  models and mechanisms for standalone or network  systems;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Faulty policies,  misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementation can  result in serious vulnerabilities. The specification of access  control policies is often a challenging problem. Often, a  system’s privacy and security are compromised due to  the misconfiguration of access control policies, instead of  the failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This  problem becomes increasingly severe as software systems  become more and more complex, and are deployed to  manage a large amount of sensitive information and  resources that are organized into sophisticated structures.  Identifying discrepancies between policy specifications and  their properties (their intended function) is crucial because  the correct implementation and enforcement of policies  by applications is based on the premise that the policy  specifications are correct. As a result, policy specifications  must undergo rigorous verification and validation through  systematic testing to ensure that the policy specifications  truly encapsulate the desires of the policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security properties  that AC should adhere to, access control models are usually  written to bridge the rather wide gap in abstraction between  policy and mechanism. Thus, an access control model  provides unambiguous and precise expression as well as  a reference for the design and implementation of security  requirements. Techniques are required for verifying whether  an access control model is correctly expressed in the access  control policies, and whether the properties are satisfied in  the model.

Even though  correct verification is achieved, and counter-examples may  be generated when faults are found, those methods provide  no information about the source of faults that might allow  conflicts in privilege assignment, the leakage of privileges, or  a conflict-of-interest in permissions. The difficulty in finding  the source of faults is increased, especially when the AC  rules are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree  of complexity. The complexity is because a fault might not  be caused by one particular access rule. Thus, it requires  manually analyzing each rule in the policy to find the correct  solution for correcting the fault.  To address the issue, CSD developed the Access Control  Property Tool (ACPT), shown in Figure 25, which allows a user  to compose, verify, test, and generate access control policies.  CSD also researched the AC Rule Logic Circuit Simulation  (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the AC authors to detect  a fault when the fault-causing AC rule is added to the policy,  so the fix can be implemented in real time before adding  other rules that further complicate the detecting effort,  rather than checking by retracing the interrelations between  rules after the policy is completed.  In FY 2016, CSD accomplished the following:  •  Funded and supported two Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II projects for  access control tool developments;  •  Enhanced the usability and fixed bugs of the  ACRLCS (the Access Control Rule Logic Circuit  Simulation System) to provide more capability for  policy fault detection;  •  Published a conference paper: General Methods for  Access Control Policy Verification, and an article:  Access Control Policy Verification for policy test  case generation;  •  Worked with industrial and academic organizations  in exploring new capabilities that helped to  improve the usability of the AC tools (ACPT and  ACRLCS), resulting in additional usage; ACPT  was downloaded by 405 users and organizations;  and  •  Enhanced the capability of ACPT by adding an  object inheritance capability for basic access  control models.

Figure 25 (See previous page) shows the system  architecture of the NIST Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT),  which allows access control policy authors to compose,  verify, and test access control policy implementation.  This project is expected to:  •  Provide a generic paradigm and framework of  access control model/property conformance  testing;  •  Provide templates for specifying access control  rules in popular access control models, such as  the Attribute Based, Multilevel, and Workflow  models;  •  Provide tools or services for checking the security  and safety of an access control implementation,  policy combination, and eXtensible Access Control  Markup Language (XACML) policy generation;  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  combinatorial testing for large-system testing  (such as an access control system);  •  Promote the concept of detecting AC policy faults  in real-time AC rule composing;  •  Provide an innovative method for specifying  AC rules formed by Boolean logic expressions  operated on variables of AC rules;  •  Provide techniques for preventing faults in  enforcing fundamental security properties,  including Cyclic Inheritance, Privilege Escalation,  and Separation of Duty; and  •  Provide new methods for composing standard  mandatory AC models, such as Attribute-Based  Access Control (ABAC) and Multi-Level Security  (MLS) as well as some fundamental security  properties.

For  example, access to a database could be restricted to users  with particular attributes, such as membership in a group  (e.g., employees) and other conditions (e.g., part of the  Human Resource Department). ABAC represents a point on  the spectrum of logical access control, from simple access  control lists to more capable role-based access (RBAC), and  finally, to a highly flexible method for providing access based  on the evaluation of attributes.  CSD is conducting research that provides information  for using ABAC to improve information sharing within  and among organizations based on the planning, design,  implementation, and operational considerations. The  research also includes technologies such as attribute  assurance, attribute engineering/management, identity  system integration, attribute federation, situational  awareness (real-time or contextual) mechanisms, policy  management, and natural-language policy translation  to digital policy. Figure 26 (See next page) illustrates the  interaction of many of these components. The goal of this  research is to improve information sharing, while maintaining  control of that information for federal agencies.  In FY 2016, the project team:  •  Worked on the book Attribute-Based Access  Control – Models & Deployments; publishing is  planned for March 2017 by Artech House;  •  Published NIST Special Publication 800-178, A  Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control  (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications  document; and  •  Continued research, in partnership with the  Trusted Identities Group (TIG) and the National  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE),  on the attribute assurance of ABAC.  In FY 2017, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as details and extended topics of  ABAC capabilities, such as attribute considerations, ABAC  implementation examples, ABAC mechanisms, and ABAC  standards.

Through the promotion of government and commercial  adoption of privacy-enhancing, secure, interoperable,  and easy-to-use identity solutions, the TIG drives trust,  convenience, and innovation in digital identity.  The TIG is a partnership model that supports the private  sector, advances risk management practices, develops  and revises guidance and standards to be co-developed  with private and public stakeholders, assists agencies in  the implementation of identity solutions in their systems,  promotes international interoperability of identity standards  and solutions, and funds innovative projects through pilots  and other funding mechanisms.  To achieve these ends, the TIG is working to advance  measurement science, technology, and standards adoption  in digital identity by focusing on four primary tactics:  partnerships, publications, market intelligence, and  communications.  P a r t n e r s h i p s  External Projects. The TIG funds external projects,  including a pilot program that impacted more than 6.7  million individuals in its first four years. These projects aim  to catalyze the marketplace to begin developing solutions  aligned with the guiding principles. The marketplace  is currently transitioning from broad market issues to  targeting specific gaps and market impediments as the  identity ecosystem matures. The pilots develop and  deploy technology, models, and frameworks that wouldn’t  otherwise exist in the marketplace. In FY 2016, the pilot  programs made remarkable progress; the 24 projects include  more than 170 partner organizations across 12 sectors— including the development or deployment of 14 multi-factor  authentication solutions. Over the course of the fiscal year,  six new pilots were launched (including five supporting state  services and one driving federated identity in healthcare)  (See https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/pilot-projects).  Figure 27: NIST employs four primary tactics:  partnerships, publications, market intelligence, and  communications  Identity Ecosystem Framework. The privately- led Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG) laid the  groundwork for better digital identity transactions with  the release of the Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF) in  early FY 2016. The IDEF lays a foundation for the Identity  Ecosystem by providing a baseline set of requirements that  define how to execute transactions involving digital identity  that puts users at the center by aligning with the four  guiding principles, continually improving online commerce,  the efficiency of digital services, and online interactions  (see http://www.idesg.org/News-Events/Press-Releases/ ID/74/Identity-Ecosystem-Framework-Released-Creating- Unprecedented-Rules-of-the-Road-for-Online-Identity).  Strategic partners. The TIG works alongside many  professional organizations, agencies, and entities in the  identity community on a daily basis. Their partnerships allow  them to gain stronger insights, evolve their thinking and  ideas, create more robust publications, orchestrate successful  events, participate in speaking engagements across the  country, bring in outside experts to review TIG federal funding  opportunities, and allow for a broader reach of messaging  and announcements. Under this model, the TIG works to co- develop NIST publications, creating an increasingly inclusive  approach to producing the best possible documents. The  TIG also works directly with agencies on their solutions to  provide expert advice in the risk management of identity  solutions and the implementation of those solutions.  Several publications were released in 2016 (many  through the use of GitHub, to best ensure that the broad  community can stay involved in their efforts and that they  are transparent and informative every step of the way).  Details are provided below; the list is current as of the end  of FY 2016. The updated publications list can be found on  the TIG resources page (see https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/ resources).

This work aids NIST  in measuring the market shift toward these solutions  and  honing efforts moving forward so NIST most effectively uses  program resources. This increases the likelihood that, with  each new initiative, the TIG meets the market—rather than  expecting the market to meet them.  C o m m u n i c a t i o n s  The TIG also leverages external communications to  inform the public about its work and engage a variety of  audiences to collaborate on projects as well as to align  efforts and maximize the impact of NIST’s investment in  cybersecurity initiatives. The TIG works with government and  industry groups to raise public awareness of cybersecurity  tools and concepts, such as by collaborating with the  National Cybersecurity Alliance on campaigns, including  Lock Down Your Login, National Cybersecurity Awareness  Month, and Data Privacy Day. The TIG also regularly shares  achievements and announcements via published documents,  speaking engagements all over the country, webinars, their  website and blog, social media engagement and outreach,  and customized events for stakeholders. For instance, in FY  2016, the TIG coordinated the Advanced Identity Workshop,  which brought together over 200 technology vendors,  cybersecurity researchers, policy makers, and other experts  from the public and commercial sectors.  In FY 2017, the TIG will continue to work to advance  measurement science, technology, and standards adoption  in identity management and focus on their four primary  tactics of partnerships, publications, market intelligence,  and communications. The TIG plans to also move on to new  endeavors, such as:  •  The identification of opportunities and  mechanisms to complement the work of their pilot  programs;  •  Increased work alongside federal agencies to  address specific identity challenges through the  NCCoE;  • New research projects;  • Additional standards work;  •  Increased communication efforts to educate  audiences of all types;  •  Continued engagement with various NIST programs  to further integrate the Identity Ecosystem into  NIST cybersecurity efforts; and,  • Continued focus on industry engagement.

CSD tracks software security vulnerabilities (in  the National Vulnerability Database), and seeks techniques  for the measurement of security vulnerabilities and  techniques that reduce the impact and prevalence of  security vulnerabilities in newly developed products or in  new versions of existing products.  One approach to reducing the number of security  vulnerabilities in software is to improve the development  tools that are available. By identifying languages and  software development tools that support a reduction of  vulnerabilities, and by stimulating the creation of better  tools and tool usage techniques, the approach should help  developers produce applications with fewer vulnerabilities.  While it is impossible to assure the total absence of security  vulnerabilities in this way, it might well be possible to rule out  specific, significant classes of vulnerabilities that currently  provide the basis for many serious exploits.  CSD is developing an empirical, competitive approach  to finding the most effective and usable combinations of  tools to produce software systems that are relatively free  of exploitable vulnerabilities. Multiple competitions are  planned that will be based on an idea developed during  the Designing a Secure Systems Engineering Competition  Workshop that was conducted by the National Science  Foundation in 2010. The workshop proposed a competition  for the development of a set of tools to help non-security- expert developers to rapidly build a significant application  with zero vulnerabilities, as detected by an extensive public  test suite.  The participants in the planned competitions would  implement software systems to solve challenge problems  using software development tool chains (“toolchains”)  of their own choosing, within specified time periods. The  toolchains may include existing technologies (e.g., existing  software libraries and frameworks, code generators, reusable  source code, or bug-finding tools), novel technologies, or any  combination thereof. Each competition would apply a time  pressure by simulating a deadline in the software development  process, increasing the likelihood of an introduction of  security flaws. The objective of the toolchains would be to  detect or prevent security flaws while still supporting the  quick-paced software development of applications with  rich feature sets. Through the demonstration of security- flaw avoidance in a time-constrained setting, CSD would  seek to show that wide-scale improvements in the overall  security of software products could be realized without  sacrificing a time-to-market goal. The competitions, which  would be open to all interested parties, would aim to provide  consistent application and measurement of commercial and  research software development, composition, and reuse  techniques.  In FY 2016, CSD partially reformulated the existing  toolchain testing infrastructure to mitigate test infrastructure  reliability problems uncovered by a dry run of the competition  and by subsequent inspections. A key part of this  reformulation was the consolidation of multiple operating  systems into a single operating system for all components.  Additionally, CSD developed an installation guide to assist  with the building, installing, and operating of the toolchain  testing infrastructure. The current infrastructure uses several  third-party components and concurrently-running virtual  machines. The installation guide describes the required  system configurations, account provisioning on local hosts,  installation and integration of third-party components  and packages, and the network configuration. An updated  version of these elements as well as a document describing  the manual steps for performing simplified, script-oriented  testing in the absence of a continuous integration system  was also developed.  In FY 2017, CSD plans to substantially simplify portions  of the testing infrastructure to improve reliability and  reproducibility, to perform a second round of testing, and to  publicly announce the first toolchain competition.

This means that they should exhibit secure, reliable,  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Privacy is particularly important because IoT-based systems  will likely produce huge amounts of data as a result of  sensing and surveillance (see references 1, 3, and 4 below).  This is the “big data” challenge associated with IoT. Therefore,  techniques, tools, and methods to mitigate the numerous  “trust” challenges are needed before these automated IoT- based networks manage much of daily life.  Historically, there has been little in the way of formal,  analytic, or even descriptive information about the building  blocks that govern the operation, trustworthiness, and life  cycle of the Internet of Things. A composability model and  vocabulary that defines principles common to most, if not  all networks of things, was needed to address the question:  “What is the science, if any, underlying IoT?” NIST SP 800- 183, Networks of ‘Things’ does exactly that – it offers an  underlying and foundational science to IoT that is based on a  belief that IoT involves sensing, computing, communication,  and actuation. The document describes five core building  blocks (called primitives): (1) sensor, (2) aggregator, (3)  communication channel, (4) eUtility, and (5) decision trigger.  SP 800-183 is unique in that it uses two acronyms, IoT and  NoT (Network of Things), extensively and interchangeably. IoT  is the outward facing acronym that most people are familiar  with; a NoT is an unfamiliar term, but has the advantage of  referencing a more specific set of interconnected objects to  which one can apply the building blocks described above.  The relationship between IoT and NoT is subtle—IoT is an  instantiation of a NoT, whereby IoT has its “things” tethered  to the Internet. A different type of NoT could be a Local Area  Network (LAN), with none of its “things” connected to the  Internet. Social media networks, sensor networks, and the  Industrial Internet are all variants of NoTs. This differentiation  in terminology helps to separate use cases of varying vertical  and quality domains (transportation, medical, financial,  agricultural, safety-critical, security-critical, performance- critical, and high assurance, to name a few). The distinctions  are useful since there is no singular IoT, and it is meaningless  to speak of comparing one IoT to another. But one NoT can  be compared to another NoT – that makes this viewpoint and  the associated definition actionable.  Future work in this area will refine the definitions of the  five core NoT building blocks. For example, instead of just  considering an all-purpose sensor, categories of sensors will  be explored. This will involve a decomposition of the building  blocks. The research team will also demonstrate how to apply  these definitions to vertical markets. In addition, the team will  present these results in Revision 1 of NIST SP 800-183, which  should be produced in late 2017 or early 2018.  F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  1.

During his  talk, titled “Intermediaries in Cloud-Computing”, which was  presented at the Institute for Operations Research and the  Management Sciences (INFORMS) meeting in Dallas, Texas,  he referred to a cloud as an important new “computing  paradigm where the boundaries of computing will be  determined by economic rationale rather than technical  limits alone.” The international IT literature and media later  provided many definitions, models, and architectures, but it  was not until 2011, when NIST published SP 800-145, The NIST  Definition of Cloud Computing, that the world coalesced on  the cloud deployment and service models, definitions and  descriptions provided in SP 800-145.  Following the December 2010 Federal Government’s  “Cloud First” policy issued as part of the 25-point plan for  the U.S. Federal Government’s (USG) IT modernization  and reform, NIST assumed a technical leadership role for  the federal agencies’ efforts related to the adoption and  development of cloud computing standards. The goal was  to accelerate the Federal Government’s adoption of secure  and effective cloud computing solutions to reduce costs and  improve services.  In addition to the initial definition of cloud computing,  NIST built a USG cloud computing technology roadmap  that focused on security, interoperability, and portability  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

NIST also developed a  cloud computing reference architecture, a security reference  architecture and, during 2016, focused on developing  the guidance for applying a risk-based approach to cloud  adoption and the guidance for applying the SP 800-53  Revision 4 security and privacy controls to cloud-based  federal information systems.  During FY 2016, NIST also started researching the  security challenges encountered when leveraging application  containers and microservices for the implementation of  cloud-based federal information systems and the security  challenges encountered when implementing cloud-based  federated identity solutions, along with the impact on the  system’s security posture. Some of the current work is  focusing on the development of an open security controls  assessment language (OSCAL) that aims to revolutionize  every step in the life cycle of a cloud-based information  system and on the development of a cloud forensics  reference architecture that is derived from the cloud security  reference architecture mentioned above. Details regarding  the latest projects are provided below.  C S D  R o l e  i n  t h e  N I S T  C l o u d  C o m p u t i n g  P r o g r a m  During FY 2016, NIST continued to promote the  development of publications, national and international  standards, and specifications in support of the USG’s effective  and secure use of cloud computing, as well as providing  technical guidance to federal agencies for secure and  effective cloud-computing adoption. During FY 2016, NIST’s  cloud computing security and forensic science activities  included the development of the following guidance and/or  recommendations:  •  NIST Draft SP 800-173, Guide for Applying the  Risk Management Framework to Cloud-based  Federal Information Systems. This publication  provides guidance in using the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision  1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems:  a Security Life Cycle Approach, to issue an  authorization to operate for cloud-based  information systems. The draft document will  be posted for public comment by December 31,  2016.  •  NIST Draft SP 800-174, Security and Privacy  Controls for Cloud-based Federal Information  Systems. This document, which is anticipated to  be available for public comments by the end of the  first quarter of 2017, provides a cloud overlay of the  SP 80053 Revision 4 security controls for cloud- based ecosystems.  NIST is also leading the research and development  of the projects listed below:  •  Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group, in collaboration with the Cloud Security  Alliance’s members are researching the security  challenges encountered when leveraging  application containers and microservices for  the implementation of cloud-based information  systems. Based on this research, NIST will issue  an interagency report documenting the findings  and will provide recommendations based on  best practices for mitigating the identified  challenges.  •  Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group are researching the security challenges  encountered when implementing cloud-based  federated identity solutions and the impact on  the overall system’s security posture. Based  on this research, NIST will issue an interagency  report documenting the findings and will provide  recommendations based on the best practices for  mitigating the identified challenges.  •  Members of the NIST Cloud Forensic Science  Working Group are working on defining a cloud  forensics reference architecture that leverages NIST  SP 500-299: Cloud Security Reference Architecture  and NISTIR 8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic  Science Challenges.  •  Members of a NIST-led Tiger Team is developing  an OSCAL, a hierarchical, formal language that  aims to support the transfer of security information  in formats that are compliant with the security  controls catalog of choice.  In support of U.S. cloud-computing mandates, CSD  staff members provide leadership for several public  cloud working groups operating under the NIST Cloud  Computing Program. These working groups focus on  meeting the high-priority requirements described in  NIST SP 500-293, U.S. Government Cloud Computing  Technology Roadmap.  CSD staff co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2016:  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Security  Working Group and led the working group on  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

CSD staff members participated in various standards  development organizations, all listed in the section of this  report dedicated to international standards.  In FY 2017, NIST will continue collaboration with the  private sector, academia and other public-sector entities  on developing guidance and specifications that support the  broad adoption of innovative cloud solutions. Some of the  very effective frameworks for such collaborations that NIST  is hosting are the public working groups with international  participation.

The Policy Machine (PM) is a fundamental reworking of  traditional access control into a form suited to the needs of  a modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise. The PM is  based on a flexible infrastructure that can provide access  control services for several different types of resources that  are accessed by different types of applications and users.  The PM infrastructure is scalable and can support policies of  various types simultaneously while remaining manageable in  the face of changing technology, organizational restructuring,  and increasing amounts of data. The PM provides a framework  capable of supporting combinations of both current access  control approaches and newly conceived types of policy  without extension.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are continuing to develop a three-part NGAC standard.  This work is being conducted under three sub-projects:  •  Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols and API  Definitions;  •  Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture; and  •  Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Generic Operations and Abstract Data  Structures.  An initial standard from this work was published  in 2013 and is now available from ANSI as INCITS 499:  NGAC Functional Architecture (NGAC–FA). However, based  on experience with similar efforts (e.g., Project 2193-D,  Project 2195-D, and the revised NISTIR 7987, Policy Machine:  Features, Architecture, and Specification), work is underway  to update this standard.  In 2016, the standard for Project 2195-D was approved  and is now available from the ANSI e-standards store as  INCITS 526: NGAC Generic Operations and Abstract Data  Structures (NGAC-GOADS).  The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language  (XACML) and NGAC are very different ABAC standards with  similar goals and objectives. What are the similarities and  differences between these two standards? What are their  comparative advantages and disadvantages? To answer  these questions, in October 2016 NIST published SP 800- 178, A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)  Standards for Data Service Applications: Extensible Access  Control Markup Language (XACML) and Next Generation  Access Control (NGAC), to describe and compare these  standards with respect to the criteria derived from ABAC  issues or considerations identified by NIST SP 800-162, Guide  to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and  Considerations: operational efficiency, attribute and policy  management, scope and type of policy support, and support  for administrative review and resource discovery.

The new version will reflect new features and enhanced  performance, and will complete (for purposes of balloting)  the revised INCITS 499, and the Project 2193–D standard.

This  technology has been used not only for configuring and  deploying virtualized hosts (Server Virtualization) but also  for virtual networks (Network Virtualization) and virtualized  storage (Storage Virtualization). Together, these three  components constitute the virtualized infrastructure in a  data center.  The core component of a virtualized infrastructure is  the virtualized host (i.e., a physical host running a server  virtualization product) that can support multiple computing  stacks (called Virtual Machines or VMs), each with a different  platform configuration (e.g., operating system (OS)) and  each with unique security needs. Application programs  loaded into a VM are often valuable server programs (e.g.,  webserver, database management system) that support  important business processes and generally need more  security protection than do other virtual hosts such as  workstations. Protection for application programs in a  VM (in fact for the entire VM) can be provided through a  combination of the following: the secure configuration of  the virtualized host, the secure configuration of the virtual  network and the secure configuration of the virtualized  storage associated with the VM.  Just like their physical counterparts (i.e., physical servers),  VMs can be protected through host-level and network-level  security measures. Hence, the focus of research in FY 2014  and prior years was on the secure configuration of the  virtualized hosts (specifically Hypervisor configuration and  deployment). Recognizing the fact that VMs are the end- nodes of a virtual network, research on the secure virtual  network configuration for VM protection was started in FY  2015 and continued in FY 2016. The outcome of the research  was the identification of four virtual network configuration  areas impacting VM security: network segmentation,  network path redundancy, traffic control using firewalls,  and VM traffic monitoring. Each area was analyzed, and  the corresponding security recommendations have been  provided.  In FY 2016, the project team produced the following  two publications: Analysis of Virtual Networking Options  for Securing Virtual Machines which was submitted to the  Seventh International Conference on Cloud Computing,  GRIDs, and Virtualization (CLOUD COMPUTING 2016) (Note:  The abstract to this paper can be found in the Publications  Released FY 2016 – Conference Papers section later in this  Annual Report), and SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network  Configuration for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection.  In FY 2017, research on the secure configuration of  the third component of a virtualized infrastructure (i.e.,  virtualized storage) will continue. The resulting findings  and security recommendations will either be included as  additions to SP 800-125A, Security Recommendations for  Hypervisor Deployment, or as a separate document.

Cyber threat  information includes indicators (i.e., artifacts or observable  events that suggest that an attack is imminent, that an  attack is underway, or that a compromise may have already  occurred); information about the tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) of actors; recommended courses of  action; and other information that is used to characterize  threats. Because threat actors often use the same  TTPs against multiple targets, exchanging cyber threat  information allows organizations to leverage the collective  knowledge, experience, and analysis capabilities of their  peers, thereby increasing the overall awareness and security  of an entire sharing community.

CSD has established a cyber threat information sharing  initiative, which is focused on providing guidance on how  an organization can establish information sharing and  coordination capabilities that enhance or augment their  existing cybersecurity practices. The guidance covers threat- informed detection, protection and response capabilities;  data privacy and sensitivity; data collection and retention  practices; the use of open standards for information exchange;  de-identification and anonymization; and guidance on how  an organization can establish, participate in, and maintain  coordination and information sharing relationships. The  guidance will help incident responders, network defenders,  and operations personnel consider what information is  sharable, the circumstances under which sharing is permitted,  with whom the information may be shared, and how the  information should be protected.  As an example of this guidance, in FY 2016, CSD  released a second draft of SP 800-150, Guide to Cyber Threat  Information Sharing. The draft publication was released for  public comment on April 21, 2016. This publication is intended  to help organizations prepare for an exchange of cyber  threat information, both consuming cyber threat information  from external sources and producing information for other  organizations to use. Organizations may have substantially  different capabilities for detecting threats, responding to  attacks, diagnosing causes, and handling sensitive incident- related information, but this guidance is intended to help  organizations collaborate and exchange cyber threat  information despite these organizational differences. CSD  will release the final version of SP 800-150, in October 2016.  In FY 2017, CSD plans to continue to conduct research,  prepare guidance, and participate in standards development  activities that are focused on increased interoperability  and operational tempo through near real-time cyber threat  information sharing, including:  •  Expressing cyber threat information using machine- readable formats,  •  Developing automated mechanisms for exchanging  cyber threat information,  •  Describing automated courses of action,  •  Publishing cyber threat information metadata,  and  •  Safeguarding cyber threat information.  NIST will also help foster cyber threat information sharing  by supporting information sharing initiatives by public and  private sector organizations, including:  •  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers  (ISACs),  •  Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations  (ISAOs),  • Federal/State/Local agencies,  • Law Enforcement,  • Fusion Centers, and  • Sector Coordinating Councils.

Recommendations have included the usage of passwords,  biometrics, authentication hardware devices, and Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI) solutions in enterprise settings. In FY  2015, CSD began researching the classification of general  authentication features. This investigation was prompted  by the general call to move away from passwords toward  the growing number of alternative authentication methods  (e.g., biometrics, smart cards, etc.). A notional ontology  of authentication was developed that included a detailed  taxonomy, a metrology, and a framework for assessing  alternatives.  Research over the past year led to updates to the  authentication taxonomy (see Figure 28) to encapsulate  current and emerging mechanisms and was the basis for  Expanding Continuous Authentication with Mobile Devices,  which was published in the IEEE Computer magazine. The  taxonomy now covers a wide assortment of commonly used  human-machine, machine-machine, human-human, and  attribute attestation methods. Human-human authentication  was included due to the number of systems that use human  interaction as a backup system when a user has trouble with  a man-machine interface. In addition, the research uncovered  an emerging branch of authentication –continuous  authentication – that supports user monitoring as a part of  the authentication.

The measurement framework separates metrics  into security, usability, deployability, and manageability  categories (see Figure 29). It is important to note that  each category may overlap or impact the others. Security  and usability are of special interest; while usability is often  thought of as a tradeoff to security, both must be satisfied  for the user to support the security of the system.  Figure 29: Suitability Framework for Authentication  The security category is broken down into the following  foundational areas:  • Uniqueness of the relationship to the entity,  •  Protection and resilience of a token against  compromise,  • Protection of a token during delivery,  • Protection of metadata in storage, and  • Protection / resilience of storage backup.  The usability category follows the ISO 9241-11 (1988)  areas of:  • Effectiveness,  • Efficiency, and  • Satisfaction.  Specific methods of calculating measurements in these  categories are not currently included and may be unique  to each authentication mechanism and environment. The  framework supports integration with the programmatic  categories of deployability and manageability, but  measurement areas in these categories are not currently  defined, as they are often well specified within organizations.  Future programmatic efforts will be focused toward  a NISTIR to describe the research results, encourage  further discussion with the community, and provide  recommendations for future standards development efforts,  with the goal of moving toward specifying independently  measurable strength requirements rather than specific  implementation requirements.

As  this program is to eventually define the future development  of standards, concerns as to the immediate adoptability  were received and will inform future research. Additional  work to identify interdependencies, such as with identity  management and authorization controls and requirements,  should help allay these concerns.  In addition, NIST CSD will work with the community in FY  2017 to identify and address common areas of authentication  requirements to create a framework for researching and  developing authentication mechanisms using this ontology.  If a clear metrology can be established, future access control  process implementations should be less susceptible to  vulnerabilities specific to individual implementations.

As a public-private partnership, industry  experts and technology partners—from Fortune 50 market  leaders to smaller companies specializing in IT security— choose to work with the NCCoE to develop practical, example  cybersecurity solutions using standards, best practices, and  commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents  these example solutions in the NIST Special Publication  1800 series, which maps technical capabilities to the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework and details the steps needed to  recreate the example solution in the real world. The NCCoE  aims to provide practical cybersecurity solutions that are  cost-effective, repeatable, and scalable to increase the rate of  adoption and accelerate effective innovation across business  sectors.

The research  focuses on the measurement and modeling techniques  necessary to understand, predict, and control the behavior  of Internet-scale networked information systems. The ITL  staff use these insights to guide the design, analysis, and  standardization of new technologies aimed at improving  the robustness of the Internet’s core infrastructure. Recent  efforts have focused on enhancing the security of the  Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS), the Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP), and Electronic mail (Email) and messaging  Figure 31: Gavin O’Brien (NCCoE, NIST) provided a demonstration on securing electronic health records on  mobile devices.

In addition, the IIP program addresses other  systemic vulnerabilities in core Internet technologies, such as  those that enable massive-scale Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) attacks.  In FY 2016, ITL  staff made significant  contributions to the  design, standardization,  test and measurement  of technologies to  improve the security  and robustness of the  Internet’s global routing  protocol BGP. NIST staff  were key contributors to Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF) standards to add cryptographic validation to BGP (see,  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol/),  and to address the robustness issues associated with  large-scale routing policy violations (see, https://www.rfc- editor.org/rfc/rfc7908.txt). In addition, NIST developed and  released open-source reference implementations of these  emerging IETF specifications, online test tools to foster their  adoption and measurement systems to track their operational  deployment. Figure 32 below is a visualization generated by  one such monitoring tool of the emerging global structure of  the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The RPKI has  been designed to provide the trust infrastructure upon which  Internet routing security technologies can be based.  Figure 32: NIST Visualization of the Evolving Coverage  and Depth of the Internet’s Global Resource Public Key  Infrastructure for BGP security.  In FY 2016, as technology specifications and  implementations matured, the ITL staff began a series of  outreach efforts with the networking industry to increase  the understanding and foster the adoption of BGP security  mechanisms. The ITL staff organized and led a workshop  at the June North American Network Operators Group  (NANOG) meeting aimed at addressing the practical issues,  state of vendor support and existing operational experience  with emerging BGP security technologies (see, https://www. nanog.org/meetings/abstract?id=2846). The ITL staff also  initiated a nationwide BGP security pilot deployment project  with the Internet2 research and education community.  ITL’s High Assurance  Domains (HAD) project  aims to leverage NIST’s  previous successes in  the development and  deployment of Domain  Name System Security  Extentions (DNSSEC)  technologies to enable  scalable solutions of long standing Internet security issues.  In FY 2016, the project focused on addressing the issues of  Email phishing attacks and developing scalable techniques  to enable the cryptographic protection of Email message  exchanges. NIST published NIST SP 800-177, Trustworthy  Email, a comprehensive guidance on the deployment and  use of emerging DNS-based authentication mechanisms to  combat email phishing and spam. In addition, ITL developed  and deployed online test tools to assist network operators  in the configuration and verification of their deployment of  emerging anti-phishing technologies.  The second focus area for the HAD project in FY 2016  was the advancement of specifications, implementations and  deployment of IETF DNS-based Authentication of Named  Entities (DANE) technology that leverages a secured DNS as  a ubiquitous key discovery and management infrastructure.  In FY 2016, the ITL staff contributed to the development of  IETF DANE specifications and developed distributed test and  measurement tools to assist in their adoption and use in the  global Internet. Figure 33 (See next page) shows the user  interface to the recently released NIST DANE test system  that enables product developers and network operators to  test their use of the DANE technologies to store, retrieve and  validate various types of cryptographic keying material for  end-to-end email security, and for general transport-layer  security (TLS) for web and other applications.

The ITL staff in the  Advanced Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS)  Mitigation Techniques  project are working  with the community  to document and  quantitatively characte- rize the applicability,  effectiveness and impact of various approaches to filtering  spoofed Internet Protocol (IP) traffic streams and develop  consensus recommendations and deployment guidance that  can drive their adoption in Federal network environments and  throughout the Internet industry. In FY 2016, the NIST staff  developed benchmarking methodologies to characterize  the performance implications of various techniques to block  spoofed IP packets in commercial routers and developed  draft deployment guidance for these mechanisms in a  variety of network interconnection scenarios.  In addition to understanding the barriers to deployment  and adoption of existing DDoS mitigation techniques, the  ITL staff began the research and evaluation of new, scalable  means of DDoS detection and mitigation, based upon  Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies.  In FY 2017, the major milestones for Internet Infrastructure  Program will include:  •  Completing the publication of IETF standards  for BGP security and increasing outreach and  pilot deployment activities to foster commercial  deployment of these technologies;  •  Continuing to develop and mature DANE  specifications and technologies for scalable key  management in the Internet and conducting  research on their applicability to emerging problem  domains, such as authentication in consumer  networks; and  •  Publishing NIST guidance on current DDoS  mitigation techniques and continuing to research  and develop new approaches based upon  emerging SDN technologies.

These IT environments are under  constant threat of attack and are frequently undergoing  change, with new and updated software being deployed  along with updated configurations. The wide variety of  computing products, the dynamic nature of software, the  speed of configuration change, and the diversity of threats  require organizations to maintain situational awareness over  their IT assets and to utilize this information to make informed  risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged  between business, operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  •  Identifying IT assets, including hardware, software,  and data;  •  Providing awareness over the operational state of  computing devices;  •  Enabling security reference data to be collected  from internal and external sources; and  •  Supporting analysis processes that measure the  effectiveness of security controls and provide  visibility into security risks, enabling risk-based  decision making.  Commercial solutions built using security automation  specifications enable the collection and harmonization of  vast amounts of operational and security data into coherent,  comparable information streams to achieve situational  awareness that allows the timely and active management of  diverse IT systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance, and the international recognition of flexible,  open standards, the NIST security automation program  works to improve the interoperability, broad acceptance, and  adoption of security automation solutions to address current  and future security challenges, creating opportunities for  innovation.  S p e c i f i c a t i o n ,  S t a n d a r d s ,  a n d  G u i d a n c e  D e v e l o p m e n t  To support the overarching security automation vision, it  is necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance for  product developers and implementers. Through close work  with partners in government, industry, and academia, CSD  continues to facilitate the definition and development of  security automation approaches that enable organizations to  understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2016, CSD has continued to work to build on  previous security automation work, as follows:  •  Identified and addressed gaps in the current  specifications;  •  Evolved existing approaches to achieve greater  scalability and impact;  •  Participated in working groups in standards  development organizations to promote  international consensus around standardized  approaches;  •  Provided additional guidance on architectural,  design, and analysis concerns; and  •  Developed and maintained tools and reference  implementations.  CSD is currently working with its partners in various  standards-development organizations, including ISO, IETF,  Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information  Standards (OASIS), the Forum of Incident Response and  Security Teams (FIRST), and the Trusted Computing Group  (TCG), to further mature and broaden the adoption of  security automation specifications, reference data, and  techniques. This area of work is focused on evolving security  automation specifications to integrate with existing transport  protocols to provide for the secure, interoperable exchange  of security automation data. Additional work is focused on  evolving security metrics and providing consensus guidance  on security automation approaches. Through the definition  and adoption of security automation standards and  guidelines, IT vendors will be able to provide standardized  security solutions to their customers. These solutions support  continuous monitoring and automated, dynamic network  defense capabilities, based on the analysis of data from  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Additionally, CSD is working with the vulnerability  community to enable the automated analysis of metrics  such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),  establishing a baseline of the minimum information needed  to properly inform the vulnerability management process,  and facilitating the sharing of vulnerability information  across language barriers. To assist in this work, a public draft  of NISTIR 8138, Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO): A  Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities, was created  to foster a conversation and collect feedback on the best  mechanisms to improve the degree of automation within  vulnerability management processes. CSD is planning to  develop this document iteratively with the vulnerability  community to ensure participation from as many  stakeholders as possible.  Security automation standardization work has been  focused in three areas: the evolution and international  adoption of the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP), the development of software asset management  standards to support operational and cybersecurity  use cases, and the development of security automation  consensus standards. The following sections detail this work.  S e c u r i t y  C o n t e n t  A u t o m a t i o n  P r o t o c o l  ( S C A P )  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides an  automated means to collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability checking, verifying  the installation of patches, checking security configuration  settings, verifying technical-control compliance, measuring  security, and examining systems for indicators of a  compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information about  software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects of  the device state. SCAP enables security automation content,  also known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using  standardized formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This  content can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifications to collect and evaluate the state of software  installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software  and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information-security-management and  governance programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently  being used by the U.S. Government, critical infrastructure  companies, academia, and other businesses, both  domestically and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own mission  and to enable other agencies and private-sector entities  to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component  of the SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2.  That document describes the 11 component specifications  composing SCAP. See Table 2 (below): SCAP 1.2 Specifications  for details.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked to  improve guidance around the use of SCAP specifications. In  FY 2015, CSD released draft NISTIR 8058, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Content Style  Guide: Best Practices for Creating and Maintaining SCAP  1.2 Content, which provides guidance for SCAP 1.2 content  creators to ensure that stylistic variations in SCAP 1.2  content are addressed in a way that improves the accuracy  and consistency of results, avoids performance problems,  reduces user effort, lowers content maintenance burdens, and  enables content reuse. To achieve this, the report documents  best practices for content creation and encourages their use  by SCAP content authors and maintainers. Feedback on  this report is welcomed and will help CSD to work toward  producing a final version of this document.  CSD is actively working on an SCAP 1.3 revision. In July  2016, CSD posted drafts for public comment of SP 800-126  Revision 3 and SP 800-126A. SP 800-126 Revision 3, is The  Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.3. SP 800-126A is SCAP 1.3  Component Specification Version Updates: An Annex to NIST  Special Publication 800-126 Revision 3. These publications  collectively document the draft requirements for SCAP 1.3.  SP 800-126A is a new publication that allows SCAP 1.3 to  take advantage of selected minor version updates of SCAP  component specifications, as well as designated Open  Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) platform  schema revisions. The SCAP 1.3 revision includes the  following changes:  •  Adoption of the Open Vulnerability and  Assessment Language (OVAL) 5.11.1, which was  released in April 2015;  •  Adoption of the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS) v3, which was released in June  2015;  • Removal of support for CVSSv2; and  •  Deprecation of support for older specification  revisions and SCAP 1.0.

More information on SCAP 1.3 can be found  at: https://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.3/.  CSD is also starting to plan a SCAP 2.0 release. This release  will further define the interfaces and use of transport protocols  for SCAP tools to provide component-level interoperability  between products supporting various SCAP functions.  By providing more interoperability, SCAP v2 will provide  the basic software and configuration posture information  needed to make and automate management decisions for  networked devices as part of the license, vulnerability and  TABLE 2:  SCAP 1.2 SPECIFICATIONS  SPECIFICATIONS DESCRIPTION  Languages  Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format  (XCCDF) 1.2  Used for authoring security checklists/benchmarks and  for reporting the results of evaluating them  Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)  5.11.1  Used for representing system-configuration information,  assessing machine state, and reporting assessment results  Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) 2.0 Used for representing checks that collect information from  people or from existing data stores populated by other  data collection methods  Reporting Formats  Asset Reporting Format (ARF) 1.1 Used to express information about assets and to define  the relationships between assets and reports  Asset Identification 1.1 Used to uniquely identify assets based on known  identifiers and other asset information  Identification Schemes  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3 A nomenclature and dictionary of hardware, operating  systems, and applications; a method to identify the  applicability to platforms  Software Identification (SWID) Tags 2015 A structured metadata format for describing a released  software product  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) 5 A nomenclature and dictionary of software-security  configurations  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) A nomenclature and dictionary of security-related  software flaws  Measurement and Scoring Systems  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Used for measuring the relative severity of software flaws  Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS)  Used for measuring the relative severity of device security  (mis-)configuration issues  Content and Result Integrity  Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD) Guidance for using digital signatures in a common trust  model applied to security automation specifications  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Furthermore, the posture  information provided by SCAP v2 products will provide  much of the context needed to prevent, detect, and respond  to network attacks. This additional context will enable SCAP  v2 information to be applied for application whitelisting, the  detection of anomalous behavior, the gathering and use of  indicators, the use of machine-readable threat information,  and orchestrating courses of action. CSD is preparing a draft  whitepaper for release in early FY 2017 that will outline an  approach, a development plan identifying the new and  revised specifications that will be needed, and a transition  plan for moving from SCAP 1.x to SCAP 2.0.  S o f t w a r e  A s s e t  M a n a g e m e n t  S t a n d a r d s  CSD has been collaborating with industry partners  in support of ISO/IEC’s revision  of standard ISO/IEC  19770-2:2009, Information technology—Software asset  management—Part 2: Software identification tag, which  establishes a specification for tagging software to support  identification and management. An updated revision of  this standard, ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015, was published on  October 1, 2015. The software identification (SWID) data  model defined by this standard describes an XML format for  software publishers to provide authoritative identification,  categorization, software relationships (e.g., dependency,  bundling, and patch), executable and library footprint  details, and other metadata for software. This information  can be used to support operational and cybersecurity use  cases around managing software deployments, managing  software licenses, managing software vulnerabilities and  related software patches, and assessing secure software  configurations.  To supplement the requirements in ISO/IEC 19770- 2:2015, CSD collaborated with DHS, NSA, and MITRE on the  development of NISTIR 8060, Guidelines for the Creation  of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags.  NISTIR 8060, published in April 2016, provides an overview  of the capabilities and usage of SWID tags as part of a  comprehensive software lifecycle. This report introduces  SWID tags in an operational context, provides guidelines for  the creation of interoperable SWID tags, and highlights key  usage scenarios for which SWID tags are applicable. Figure  34 illustrates several types of SWID tags and how these  support multiple elements of the software product life cycle,  including deployment, installation, patching, upgrading and  removal.  Additionally, NIST has worked with the TCG to integrate  SWID tags into the Trusted Network Communications (TNC)  protocol, through the SCAP Messages for IF-M specification.  The information provided within SWID tags enhances  the SCAP use cases by providing authoritative information  that can be used to create Common Platform Enumeration  (CPE) names, to support the targeting of checklists, and to  associate software flaws to products, based on a defect in a  software library or executable. CSD is currently working on  a SWID tag validation tool, called SWIDVal, that will validate  a SWID tag document against the ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015  and NISTIR 8060 requirements. This tool is planned for an  Figure 34: SWID Tags Support the Software Product Lifecycle  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

D e v e l o p m e n t  o f  S e c u r i t y  A u t o m a t i o n  C o n s e n s u s  S t a n d a r d s  CSD has been promoting the broad international adoption  of SCAP by encouraging the integration of SCAP into other  standards, and by adapting SCAP to address specific gaps  and challenges. CSD has continued its collaboration with  its industry partners in the IETF Security Automation and  Continuous Monitoring (SACM) working group. This working  group provides a venue for advancing appropriate SCAP  specifications into international standards and addressing  identified gap areas. The current scope of work for SACM  includes identifying and/or defining the transport protocols  and data formats needed to support the collection and  evaluation of a device state against the expected values.  The SACM working group has been working on identifying  use cases, requirements, and architectural models to  provide information to facilitate decisions about existing  specifications and standards that can be referenced, required  modifications or extensions to existing specifications and  standards, and any gaps that need to be addressed. CSD is  working with DHS, the Center for Internet Security (CIS), and  the TCG to bring existing work into the IETF SACM working  group, including OVAL and specifications related to the TNC  protocol.  The working group has been developing the following  Internet Drafts:  For more information, please refer to: http://datatracker. ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/  Also, within the IETF, CSD has been collaborating  with the Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (MILE)  working group in order to develop the Resource-Oriented  Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) specification.  This specification seeks to address the security automation  information discovery and dissemination use cases by  defining how tools are expected to communicate with security  automation information repositories. ROLIE allows for the  transport, retrieval, and storage of any security automation- relevant information types. The ROLIE draft has undergone  two major revisions, with the final draft nearing completion.  In addition, CSD has begun the process of collaborating with  MILE and other stakeholders to create extension drafts for  ROLIE that address a number of information types, including  vulnerability, configuration checklist, and software metadata  information types.  The main ROLIE draft can be found at https://datatracker. ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/. Additional information on  ROLIE and on the extension drafts can be found in the working  repository on GitHub: https://github.com/CISecurity/ROLIE/.  CSD also worked with its government and industry  partners in the TCG to define a number of specifications  related to the TNC protocol. The first such publication is the  TNC SCAP Messages for IF-M specification that supports  carrying the SCAP content and results over the TNC protocols.  The second is the TNC Enterprise Compliance Profile (ECP)  and related specifications that support the exchange of SWID  data over the TNC protocols. The ECP enables the collection  of SWID data from a device for use by external tools to  provide software inventory information. SCAP and SWID  data collected using these mechanisms may be optionally  used for network access control decision making, allowing  the device state to be evaluated when devices connect and  on an ongoing basis thereafter.

Finally, CSD has worked with the FIRST by participating  in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The CVSS SIG (CVSS- SIG) is focused on maintaining and improving the CVSS  scoring model, based on community feedback. The CVSS- SIG published CVSS Revision 3 (CVSS v3) in June 2015. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit: http://www.first.org/ global/sigs.  Through work with international standards-developing  organizations (SDOs), SCAP and its related security  automation capabilities are expected to evolve and expand  in support of the growing need to define and measure  effective security controls, assess and monitor ongoing  aspects of information security, remediate noncompliance,  and successfully manage systems in accordance with the Risk  Management Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision  1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to  Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  Standards that are developed and published by these SDOs  will be considered for inclusion in future revisions of SCAP.

SCAP and  the programs that leverage it are moving the information  assurance industry toward being able to standardize  communications and toward the collection and storage of  relevant data in standardized formats, as well as providing  an automated means for the assessment and remediation  of systems for both vulnerabilities and configuration  compliance.  N a t i o n a l  V u l n e r a b i l i t y  D a t a b a s e  ( N V D )  Security automation reference data is currently housed  within the NVD. The NVD is a comprehensive cybersecurity  vulnerability database that allows the tracking of vulnerability  trends over time. This trending service allows users to assess  changes in vulnerability discovery rates within specific  products or within specific types of vulnerabilities. NVD  data is represented using the SCAP specifications. The NVD  includes databases of security configuration checklists for  the NCP, listings of publicly known software flaws, product  names, and impact metrics. A formal validation program  tests the ability of vendor products to use some forms of  security automation data, based on a product’s conformance  in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software  flaws and security configuration reference data, also known  as SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD.  As of the end of September 2016, the NVD contained  the following resources:  •  Over 79,000 vulnerability advisories, with an  average of 30 new vulnerabilities added daily;  •  83 SCAP-expressed checklists containing  thousands of low-level security configuration  checks that can be used by SCAP-validated  security products to perform automated  evaluations of the system state;  •  293 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English  prose guidance and configuration scripts);  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds (i.e., mechanisms that provide updated data  from data sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the  NVD website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  The NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit  card systems. The PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability  severity scores in measuring the risk to payment card servers  worldwide and for prioritizing vulnerability patching. The  PCI’s use of NVD severity scores helps enhance credit card  transaction security and protects consumers’ personal  information.  In the past year, the NVD began providing Common  Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores following  the CVSS v3 specification and will soon include this  information in the data feeds (see https://www.first.org/ cvss/specification-document). An update of the web site is  planned to enhance the user’s experience.  F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  https://nvd.nist.gov  C O N T A C T S :  Mr. Harold Booth  Mr. Robert Byers  (301) 975-8441  (301) 975-3279  harold.booth@nist.gov  robert.byers@nist.gov  N a t i o n a l  C h e c k l i s t  P r o g r a m  ( N C P ) There are many threats to IT, ranging from remotely  launched network service exploits to malicious code spread  through infected emails, websites, and downloaded files.  Vulnerabilities in IT products are discovered daily, and many  ready-to-use exploitation techniques are widely available on  the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a  wide variety of audiences, restrictive security configuration  controls are usually not enabled by default. As a result, many  out-of-the box IT products are immediately vulnerable. In  addition, identifying a reasonable set of security settings  that achieve balanced risk management is a complicated,  arduous, and time-consuming task, even for experienced  system administrators.  To facilitate the development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, CSD established the National Checklist  Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities  under the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and also under the  Cybersecurity Research and Development Act, which  mandates that NIST “develop, and revise as necessary, a  checklist setting forth settings and option selections that  minimize the security risks associated with each computer  hardware or software system that is, or is likely to become,  widely used within the Federal Government.” In February  2008, a revision of Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states,  “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include  the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official  to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, OMB mandated the use of  SCAP-validated products for the continuous monitoring of  Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance. The  NCP strives to encourage and assist federal agencies with  these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  •  Facilitate the development and sharing of checklists  by providing a formal framework for checklist  developers to submit checklists to NIST;  •  Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform  to common operation environments;  •  Help developers and users by providing guidelines  for making checklists better documented and more  usable;  •  Encourage software vendors and other parties to  develop checklists;  •  Provide a managed process for the review, update,  and maintenance of checklists;  •  Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists;  and  •  Encourage the use of automation technologies  (e.g., SCAP) for checklist application.

Of that total, 154 of the checklists, addressing 96 platforms,  are SCAP-expressed and can be used with SCAP-validated  products.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the  NCP website for automated security configuration patch  assessment. The NCP currently provides metadata and links  to the latest operating systems and applications checklists,  including MacOS 10.10, Windows 10, Internet Explorer 11.0,  Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2016, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist content,  NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from Tier I to Tier IV.  The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists according to their  automation capability. Tier III and IV checklists include fully  vetted SCAP content that has successfully demonstrated  conformance to the requirements outlined in SP 800-126.  Tier III & IV checklists are considered production-ready and  are intended for use with SCAP-validated products.  Tier II checklists document the recommended security  settings in a machine-readable format such as the XCCDF- only (i.e., no OVAL content), proprietary format, or product- specific configuration script. Tier I checklists are prose- based and contain no machine-readable content. Users can  browse the checklists, based on the checklist tier, IT product,  IT product category, or authority, and through a keyword  search that searches the checklist name and summary for  user-specified terms. The search results show the detailed  checklist metadata and a link to any SCAP content for  the checklist, as well as links to any supporting resources  associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate the submission  and maintenance processes. The manual interface consists  of a web application that guides the submitter through the  data entry process to ensure that all the required information  is submitted. The submission is validated upon review,  and a report is returned to the submitting organization,  verifying either acceptance or rejection, based on the criteria  requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier IV checklists  require validation using the SCAP Content Validation Tool  (this tool is available for download via https://scap.nist.gov/ validation/resources.html).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 3, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for Checklist  Users and Developers, which can be found at http://csrc.nist. gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

The configurations are based on a collection of  resources, including the existing NIST OS X configuration  guidance, the DOD OS X Recommended Settings, the  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) OS X Security  Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), and the Center for  Internet Security (CIS) OS X Security Benchmark.  The project team researched and tested 250 settings  for OS X 10.10. Among other collected data, each setting has  a designated Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)  number, which aids in long-term tracking of the setting.  Figure 35 illustrates the various categories that comprise  the baselines. Note that a higher quantity of settings in a  category does not imply greater importance over other  categories.  The team finished developing shell scripts that apply the  settings to an OS X 10.10 system. The settings are organized  into three key baselines, which are appropriate for different  environments:  •  The Standalone baseline describes small, informal  computer installations that are used for home or  business purposes,  •  The Managed baseline is appropriate for centrally  managed, networked systems, and  •  The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality  (SSLF) baseline is appropriate for systems where  security requirements are more stringent and  where the implementation of security safeguards is  likely to reduce functionality.  In FY 2016, the security configuration was updated to  have 250 settings after the internal testing on select CSD  systems was completed. In June 2016, the draft SP 800- 179, Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for IT  Professionals, was published for public comment  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p s : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software  applications that are exploited to stage cyber attacks.  System administrators need objective metrics to guide and  justify decision making as they manage the security risk  of enterprise networks. The objective of this research is  to develop a standard model for the security risk analysis  of computer networks. A standard model will enable an  organization to answer questions such as “Are we more  secure now than yesterday?” or “How does the security of  one network configuration compare with another one?”  Also, having a standard model to measure network security  will allow users, vendors, and researchers to evaluate  methodologies and products for network security in a  coherent and consistent manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies  and measuring security, based on how real attackers have  penetrated networks. The methodology used for security  risk analysis is based on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic metric  of the overall system risk. Through this metric, trade-offs  between security costs and security benefits are analyzed.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and  zero-day attacks. Enterprises have begun to move parts  of their networks from a traditional infrastructure into  cloud computing environments. Cloud providers offer  virtual servers that can be rented on demand by users. This  paradigm enables cloud customers to acquire computing  resources with high efficiency, low cost and great flexibility.  However, it also introduces many security problems that need  to be solved. Diversity has long been regarded as a security  mechanism for improving the resilience of software and  networks against various attacks. More recently, diversity has  found new applications in cloud computing security, moving  target defense, and improving the robustness of network  routing. However, most existing efforts rely on intuitive and  imprecise notions of diversity, and the few existing models  of diversity are designed for a single system running diverse  software replicas or variants. In FY 2016, CSD has attempted  to formally model network diversity as a security metric by  designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics. In  particular, CSD has devised a biodiversity-inspired metric  based on the effective number of distinct resources. CSD  has also proposed two complementary diversity metrics,  based on the least and the average attacking efforts,  respectively. CSD published two papers in this area:  1. Network Diversity: A Security Metric for Evaluating  the Resilience of Networks Against Zero Day  Attacks, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics  and Security, 11(5) May 2016 (see http://ieeexplore. ieee.org/document/7378495/).  2.

In FY 2017, CSD plans to develop new techniques and  metrics for Cloud Computing threat modeling and network  forensics analysis using Bayesian networks. CSD also plans  to publish the results as a NIST report and as white papers in  conferences and journals.

In performing this work, the AIM project  seeks to enhance the nation’s ability to defend itself from  network-borne attacks.

However, research solutions are made publicly  available and are designed to be generally applicable to as  many environments as possible.  In FY 2016, the AIM project completed research in several  areas: algorithms for measuring the ease at which networks  can be broken apart, efficient representations for attack  graphs, and an analysis of how to increase the robustness  of the African Internet. More specifically, the project team  accomplished the following:  •  The team discovered a linear-time algorithm to  implement a heuristic for vertex partitioning that  enables effective partitioning on massive graphs  (tested on graphs up to 34 million nodes). This  enables one to measure the ease at which terrorist  activity or global conflicts can break apart large  networks, for example, the entire Internet (the  research was published in the International Journal  of Computer Science: Theory and Application).  •  The team discovered an efficient representation  for attack graphs that grows linearly in the number  of nodes, while most attack graph research uses  an inefficient graph representation that grows  quadratically in the number of nodes and that  creates unnecessary edge connections (this  research was published in the proceedings of  the Tenth International Conference on Software  Engineering Advances).  •  The team studied how to increase the robustness  of the African Internet, creating the first country- level topology maps of Africa, and measured the  growth of Internet connectivity (this research was  a precursor to more global connectivity studies;  it was published in the proceedings of the 7th  European Alliance for Innovation International  Conference on e-Infrastructure and e-Services for  Developing Countries).  In FY 2017, the AIM project will work on new methods  for assuring private communication on the Internet, network  anomaly detection, efficient graph algorithms for access  control computations (to restrict external leakage of insider  information), and methods for using attack graphs to perform  defense-in-depth measurements.

NIST  investigation of actual failures has shown that most failures  are triggered by one or two parameters, and progressively  fewer by three, four, or more parameters (see Figure 36 - next  page); this relationship is called the Interaction Rule. These  results have important implications for testing software  and systems. If all faults in a system can be triggered by a  combination of n or fewer parameters, then testing all n-way  combinations of parameters with a doable number of tests  can provide strong fault-detection efficiency. These methods  are being applied to software and hardware testing for  reliability, safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical  results and the impact on real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2016 include the development  of an efficient method for testing rule-based systems using  covering arrays and the development of a prototype tool;  invited lectures at conferences and universities; leading the  Fifth International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing, held in  conjunction with the eighth IEEE International Conference on  Software Testing; development of a real-time combinatorial  coverage measurement tool; and analyzing the factors  involved in different types of software faults. Collaborators  include researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington,  the University of Texas at Dallas, East Carolina University, and  Duke University.  NIST also submitted a patent on an oracle-free testing  method based on two-layer covering arrays (see below). In  software testing, the oracle problem refers to determining the  expected output for a given set of inputs. A determination of  the expected output requires expert knowledge and normally  cannot be automated without a mathematical model of  the specification. The test settings for an input factor may  represent ranges of values (called equivalence classes) for  which the output is expected to remain unchanged. For  example, a shipping program may charge the same rate for  any package under one pound, a second rate for packages  one pound to 10 pounds, and a third rate for packages over  10 pounds. Values within each of these ranges are equivalent  with respect to the cost calculation. Thus, any value within an  equivalent range may be substituted for any other, and the  program output should be unchanged. Similarly, equivalent  values for any combination of input variables will also  produce the same output.  The test method works by generating two test arrays: a  primary array and a secondary array. The entries of a primary  array represent the names of equivalence classes of input  factors. For each test row of the primary array, a second  array is computed. The settings in the second array are the  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

If the outputs  corresponding to one row of the primary array differ, then  either the equivalence classes were defined incorrectly or  the code is faulty in some way. This method can detect a  large class of software faults automatically after equivalence  classes have been defined, without a conventional test  oracle.  Technology transfer activities included the publication  of a number of technical papers and software distributions;  publication of the results of a Cooperative R&D (CRADA)  project with Lockheed Martin; release of enhanced  combinatorial measurement tools; input modeling and  fault location tools; a provisional patent application on the  oracle-free testing method; and seminars at a number of  conferences, universities, and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2017 include the development of a  mathematical model for the evolution of t-way faults in  software; combinatorial testing for big data software;  measurement of input model combination coverage of  network protocol software; trial use of prototype methods  and tools for oracle-free testing methods; analysis of  empirical data on failures; further development of methods  and tools for fault localization; and seminars, workshops,  and tutorials at professional meetings and research labs.

Many security and protection  mechanisms are currently rooted in software that, along  with all underlying components, must be trusted and not  tampered with. A vulnerability in any of those components  could compromise the trustworthiness of the security  mechanisms that rely upon those components. Stronger  security assurances may be possible by grounding security  mechanisms in roots of trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure  hardware, firmware, and software components that perform  specific, critical security functions. Because roots of trust  are inherently trusted, they must be secure by their design.  As such, many roots of trust are implemented in hardware  or protected firmware so that malware cannot tamper with  the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  This project aims to encourage the use of roots of trust in  computers to provide stronger security assurances. A focus  area for this work has been securing firmware.

There is a belief that there is an inherent  tradeoff between cybersecurity and usability. Computers  can be theoretically secure but so unusable that they do  not improve security because users are forced to perform  in less secure ways. The opposite is true as well; systems  that are easy to use and not secure are eventually unusable  due to worms, viruses, and botnets. The usability principles  of efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction must be  incorporated to ensure that it is easy for users to do the right  thing and hard for them to do the wrong thing. NIST has been  working to develop usability and security metrics, facilitate  the integration of usability principles into product design  processes, and lead research projects to investigate methods  for aligning user goals with organizational security goals.  During FY 2016, the usability team’s research focused  primarily in four areas: passwords, understanding user  behavior, cryptography, and privacy.  1 .  P a s s w o r d  R e s e a r c h :  The password research included examining password  policies from two perspectives. The Password Policy  Taxonomy project is exploring the relationship between  usability and security by focusing on the password policy  itself and how users of a policy understand it. To tackle the  ambiguity inherent in many password policies, a formal  language for representing a password policy was previously  developed. Having clear, unambiguous policy statements  enables us to explore password policies in much greater  detail, discuss the relative merits of different statements,  compare and contrast policies, explore plain language policy  representations and user interpretations, and examine the  interplay between usability and security in password policies.  A Password Policy Question-Answer System (PPQAS) was  designed, developed and tested. The system is a flexible  application and is designed to collect users’ interpretations  of various password policies and map each interpretation of  a policy’s regulating statements to elements of the formal  language via a dynamic set of questions and answers and to  store those mappings for analysis.  The second effort examines how users interpret and  apply password rules. Ambiguous terminology in password  rules affects user comprehension. This research investigated  user comprehension of ambiguous terminology in password  rules, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative  methods in a usable security study with 60 participants.  Results showed:  •  That manipulating password rule terminology  causes users’ interpretation of the allowed  character space to shrink or expand.  •  Users are confused by the terms “non- alphanumeric,” “symbols,” “special characters,” and  “punctuation marks” in password rules.  •  Additionally, users are confused by partial lists of  allowed characters using “e.g.” or “etc.”  This research provides data-driven usability guidance  on constructing clearer language for password policies.  2 .  U n d e r s t a n d i n g  U s e r  B e h a v i o r :  Understanding user behavior is critical to achieving  security objectives. One example of this achieving security  objectives is preventing successful phishing attacks. Phishing  is the attempt to obtain sensitive information by posing  as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication,  often in the form of emails appearing to be from legitimate  parties that contains links or attachments. It is a major  cyber threat facing government organizations.

To ultimately  improve awareness training, it is important to understand  why the staff do or do not fall victim to phishing attacks.  For example, an employee opening an email attachment  could be a means of conducting the attack. This project  partnered with the NIST Office of Information Systems  Management (OISM) and Office of Safety, Health and  Environment (OSHE) to better understand operational  phishing awareness training. Results showed that user  context is the key to understanding user behavior regarding  phishing attacks. For example, staff who are responsible for  paying bills and invoices are more likely to be victimized by  fake unpaid invoice emails.  Another noteworthy program in user behavior is the  research into Security Fatigue. People are repeatedly  bombarded with messages about the dangers lurking  on the Internet, about the security breaches of major  corporations and the U.S. government, and about the need  to be constantly attentive while online. To combat these  dangers and stay safe while online, users are forced to  update passwords, run antivirus software programs, and  accept unwieldy terms of agreements, often without a  clear understanding of why and to what end. The research  team interviewed 40 participants to understand their  relationships with cybersecurity.  The team discovered that:  •  People reach a saturation point and become inured  to the issue of cybersecurity.  •  People are told they need to be constantly on alert,  constantly doing “something,” but they are not  even sure what that something is or what might  happen if they do or do not do it.  The team calls this “security fatigue.” This security fatigue  and the resignation and loss of control associated with it  certainly presents a challenge to efforts aimed at promoting  online security and the protection of online privacy.  This research on security fatigue was a popular topic  with users and many media outlets interested in it. According  to the NIST Public Affairs Office, there were:  •  17,550 page views of the news story on NIST.gov  (the fourth most visited page in 2016 on the NIST  website);  •  7.9K total views for Facebook posts on the  story;  •  2,327 views of the story on Eurekalert (an online  news release repository operated by The American  Association for the Advancement of Science  (AAAS));  •  2,172 plays of the video on Kaltura (the platform  hosting the video on the NIST news story page), 81  shares, 51 downloads; and  • 918 video views on YouTube.  The news outlets included: BBC News, MSN.com,  Politico, Federal News Radio, Bloomberg BNA, the Register,  and McClatchy DC, and many others included quotes by the  authors, such as: “ ‘Users are tired of being overwhelmed by  the need to be constantly on alert…’ said the study by the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, a unit of the  Department of Commerce.”  3 .  C r y p t o g r a p h y  The team’s cryptographic research is concerned with  creating a baseline understanding of the current practices  and challenges of organizations that are developing products  that use cryptography. The research team considered  the entire process, from the identification of a market  opportunity and the conceptualization of the product; the  assembling of the product team; the design, implementation  and testing of the product; and finally, the marketing, sale  and end-user support. Based on the research, ITL will use  this new understanding to help improve the assurance  of cryptographic tools and the usability of cryptographic  software and resources.  The following contributions were made:  •  The research team identified opportunities to  better characterize the cryptographic practices  and types of resources and standards used by  cryptographic developers.  •  Research offers new insights into the challenges  that cryptographic implementations introduce  into organizational practices, such as recruitment,  product lifecycle and transitions, the management  of employees, the evaluation of cryptographic  work, and product explanation to customers.

P r i v a c y  A new area was initiated to examine privacy and de- identification. A Federal Government stakeholder’s meeting  was organized to discuss the topic, after which NIST provided  additional guidance through multiple training sessions to  other federal agencies, a NIST Interagency Report, and a  NIST Special Publication.  De-identification regarding private data set release,  or the release of other information about a private data set  (such as summarizing statistics), is a  class of procedures  intended to restrict or limit the ability of a recipient of  such a release to re-identify a particular individual in the  data set and infer potentially sensitive information about  the individual (whether in an absolute, or  in a probabilistic  sense). De-identification is a collection of methods with  the goal of  protecting the privacy  of the individual, while  simultaneously preserving the utility of the released data (or  other summarizing statistics).  ITL researchers are evaluating differentially private  algorithms, a subset of de-identification techniques. The team  is considering the possible tradeoffs between protecting the  privacy of individuals and the usefulness of information, such  as might occur when a research database with de-identified  personal information is released.

These were published as NIST technical  series documents (e.g., Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS), Special Publications (SP), NIST Internal or  Interagency Reports (NISTIRs), and Information Technology  Laboratory (ITL) Bulletins), other NIST publications, or  as externally-published documents (e.g., journal articles,  conference papers, books, and other papers).  Additionally, the NCCoE began posting public drafts of  documents in two new series: Concept Papers and Project  Descriptions. Concept Papers identify potential project  topics for NCCoE to explore with stakeholders and  technology collaborators. After reviewing public comments  on a draft Concept Paper, NCCoE can better understand  specific challenges and needs, and may possibly draft  a Project Description. Formerly issued as “Building  Blocks” and “Use Cases,” Project Descriptions describe a  particular problem that is relevant across a sector. Through  collaboration with community members and vendors of  cybersecurity solutions, NCCoE will develop a reference  design that can be used by sector organizations to address  that challenge.  In FY 2016, ITL published 20 NIST Special Publications, 18  NISTIRs and 12 ITL Bulletins in the areas of cybersecurity and  privacy. Additionally, ITL continued to engage stakeholders  by posting numerous draft documents for public comment,  including 23 Special Publications, 13 NISTIRs, 6 NCCoE  Project Descriptions, 1 NCCoE Concept Paper, and 3 NIST  “white papers.” ITL research was also published externally, as  18 journal articles and 18 conference papers. They are listed  below, with abstracts and full text links, under (External  Publications).  In the October 19, 2015 Federal Register, NIST  announced the withdrawal of six FIPS that had become  obsolete: FIPS 181, 185, 188, 190, 191, and 196. NIST had  received only one comment in response to a January 16,  2015 Federal Register Notice requesting public feedback  on their proposed withdrawal. (The titles of the withdrawn  FIPS are: 181 - Automated Password Generator (APG), 185  - Escrowed Encryption Standard, 188 - Standard Security  Label for Information Transfer, 190 - Guideline for the Use  of Advanced Authentication Technology Alternatives,  191 - Guideline for The Analysis of Local Area Network  Security, and 196 - Entity Authentication Using Public Key  Cryptography.)  Two significant efforts to revise major publications were  begun. ACD solicited public input to develop preliminary  drafts of SP 800-63-3, Digital Authentication Guideline,  during a “Public Preview” phase that enabled stakeholders  to provide dynamic, interactive feedback. A subseries  of documents that will revise the current SP 800-63-2,  Electronic Authentication Guideline, will be posted for public  comment as official public drafts in early FY 2017 (see https:// pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/). Meanwhile, CSD posted a call for  comments on SP 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy  Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  to begin preparing for the release of a draft of Revision 5 for  public comment in FY 2017.  The ITL Cybersecurity Framework team worked closely  with the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program to  develop the Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder  (BCEB): Key questions for improving your organization’s  cybersecurity performance, which was posted for public  comment on the Baldridge Cybersecurity Initiative website  (see https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/ baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative). The BCEB is a voluntary  self-assessment tool that enables organizations to better  understand the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk  management efforts.

N I S T  S P s  SP 800-188 (DRAFT)  De-Identifying Government Datasets  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-188  De-identification removes identifying information  from a dataset so that the remaining data cannot be  linked with specific individuals. Government agencies  can use de-identification to reduce the privacy risk  associated with collecting, processing, archiving,  distributing or publishing government data. Previously,  NIST published NISTIR 8053, “De-Identifying Personal  Data,” which provided a survey of de-identification and  re-identification techniques. This document provides  specific guidance to government agencies that wish to  use de-identification. Before using de-identification,  agencies should evaluate their goals in using  de-identification and the potential risks that  de-identification might create. Agencies should  decide upon a de-identification release model, such  as publishing de-identified data, publishing synthetic  data based on identified data, and providing a query  interface to the identified data that incorporates  de-identification. Agencies can use a Disclosure Review  Board to oversee the process of de-identification; they  can also adopt a de-identification standard with  measurable performance levels. Several specific  techniques for de-identification are available,  including de-identification by removing identifiers and  transforming quasi-identifiers and the use of formal  de-identification models that rely upon Differential  Privacy. De-identification is typically performed  with software tools that may have multiple features;  however, not all tools that mask personal information  provide sufficient functionality for performing de- identification. This document also includes an extensive  list of references, a glossary, and a list of specific de- identification tools, although the mention of these tools  is only to be used to convey the range of tools currently  available, and is not intended to imply recommendation  or endorsement by NIST.  SP 800-185 (DRAFT)  SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC,  TupleHash, and ParallelHash  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-185  This Recommendation specifies four SHA-3-derived  functions: cSHAKE, KMAC, TupleHash, and ParallelHash.  cSHAKE is a customizable variant of the SHAKE functions  defined in FIPS 202. KMAC (for Keccak Message  Authentication Code) is a variable-length message  authentication code algorithm based on Keccak; it can  also be used as a pseudorandom function. TupleHash  is a variable-length hash function that is designed to  hash tuples of input strings unambiguously. ParallelHash  is a variable-length hash function that can hash non- overlapping subsets of very long messages in parallel.  SP 800-184 (DRAFT)  Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-184  In light of an increasing number of cybersecurity  events, organizations can improve resilience by  ensuring that their risk management processes include  comprehensive recovery planning. Identifying and  prioritizing organization resources helps to guide  effective plans and realistic test scenarios. This  preparation enables rapid recovery from incidents  when they occur and helps to minimize the impact  on the organization and its constituents. Additionally,  continually improving recovery planning by learning  lessons from past events, including those of other  organizations, helps to ensure the continuity of  important mission functions. This publication provides  tactical and strategic guidance regarding the planning,  playbook developing, testing, and improvement of  recovery planning. It also provides an example scenario  that demonstrates guidance and informative metrics  that may be helpful for improving resilience of the  information systems.

In this work, five core  primitives belonging to most distributed systems are  presented. These primitives apply well to systems  with large amounts of data, scalability concerns,  heterogeneity concerns, temporal concerns, and  elements of unknown pedigree with possible nefarious  intent. These primitives are the basic building blocks  for a Network of ‘Things’ (NoT), including the Internet  of Things (IoT). This document offers an underlying  and foundational understanding of IoT based on  the realization that IoT involves sensing, computing,  communication, and actuation. The material presented  here is generic to all distributed systems that employ  IoT technologies (i.e., ‘things’ and networks). The  expected audience is computer scientists, IT managers,  networking specialists, and networking and cloud  computing software engineers.  SP 800-182  Computer Security Division 2015 Annual Report  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-182  Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, entitled  the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, requires NIST to prepare an annual  public report on activities undertaken in the previous  year, and those planned for the coming year, to carry  out responsibilities under this law. The primary goal of  the Computer Security Division (CSD), a component  of NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL),  is to provide standards and technology that protects  information systems against threats to the con- fidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and  services. During FY 2015, CSD successfully responded to  numerous challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that  mission. Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and  engagement in many national priority initiatives, high- quality, cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms  were developed and applied that improved information  security across the Federal Government and the greater  information security community. This annual report  highlights the research agenda and activities in which  CSD was engaged during FY 2015.  SP 800-180 (DRAFT)  NIST Definition of Microservices, Application  Containers and System Virtual Machines  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-180  Many variations and definitions of application  containers exist in industry, causing considerable  confusion among those who attempt to explain what  a container is. This document provides a NIST-standard  definition to application containers, microservices that  reside in application containers and operating system  virtual machines. Furthermore, this document explains  the similarities and differences between a Services  Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Microservices, as well  as the similarities and differences between Operating  System Virtual Machines and Application Containers.  SP 800-179 (DRAFT)  Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for  IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration  Checklist  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-179  This publication assists IT professionals in securing  Apple OS X 10.10 (i.e., Yosemite) desktop and laptop  systems within various environments. It provides detailed  information about the security features of OS X 10.10  and security configuration guidelines. The publication  recommends and explains tested, secure settings with  the objective of simplifying the administrative burden of  improving the security of OS X 10.10 systems in three  types of environments: Standalone, Managed, and  Specialized Security-Limited Functionality.  SP 800-177  Trustworthy Email  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-177  This document gives recommendations and  guidelines for enhancing trust in email. The primary  audience includes enterprise email administrators,  information security specialists and network managers.  This guideline applies to federal IT systems and will  also be useful for small or medium-sized organizations.  Technologies recommended in support of core Simple  Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the Domain Name  System (DNS) include mechanisms for authenticating  a sending domain: Sender Policy Framework (SPF),  Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based  Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance  (DMARC). Recommendations for email transmission  security include the Transport Layer Security (TLS)  protocols and the associated certificate authentication  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

SP 800-171 Revision 1 (DRAFT)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in  Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 171-Rev-1  The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information  (CUI) while residing in nonfederal information systems  and organizations is of paramount importance to  federal agencies and can directly impact the ability  of the Federal Government to successfully carry out  its designated missions and business operations. This  publication provides federal agencies with recommended  requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI:  (i) when the CUI is resident in nonfederal information  systems and organizations; (ii) when the information  systems where the CUI resides are not used or operated  by contractors of federal agencies or other organizations  on behalf of those agencies; and (iii) where there are  no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting  the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the authorizing  law, regulation, or government-wide policy for the CUI  category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The  requirements apply to all components of nonfederal  information systems and organizations that process,  store, or transmit CUI, or provide security protection for  such components. The CUI requirements are intended  for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or  other agreements established between those agencies  and nonfederal organizations.  SP 800-167  Guide to Application Whitelisting  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-167  An application whitelist is a list of applications and  application components that are authorized for use in an  organization. Application whitelisting technologies use  whitelists to control which applications are permitted  to be executed on a host. This helps to stop the  execution of malware, unlicensed software, and other  unauthorized software. This publication is intended  to assist organizations in understanding the basics of  application whitelisting. It also explains planning and  implementation for whitelisting technologies throughout  the security deployment lifecycle.  SP 800-166  Derived PIV Application and Data Model Test  Guidelines  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-166  SP 800-157 contains technical guidelines for the  implementation of standards-based, secure, reliable,  interoperable PKI-based identity credentials that are  issued for mobile devices by federal departments and  agencies to individuals who possess and prove control  over a valid PIV Card.

It starts with and builds upon a set of well- established International Standards for systems and  software engineering published by the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and infuses  systems security engineering techniques, methods, and  practices into those systems and software engineering  processes. The ultimate objective is to address security  issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements  and protection needs and to use established engineering  processes to ensure that such requirements and needs  are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor early  and in a sustainable manner throughout the life cycle of  the system.  SP 800-156  Representation of PIV Chain-of-Trust for Import and  Export  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-156  This document provides a common XML-based data  representation of a chain-of-trust record to facilitate the  exchange of PIV Card enrollment data. The exchanged  record is the basis for personalizing a PIV Card for a  transferred employee and, also for service providers  to personalize a PIV Card on behalf of client federal  agencies.  SP 800-154 (DRAFT)  Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-154  Threat modeling is a form of risk assessment  that models aspects of the attack and defense sides  of a particular logical entity, such as a piece of data,  an application, a host, a system, or an environment.  This publication examines data-centric system threat  modeling, which is threat modeling that is focused on  protecting particular types of data within systems. The  publication provides information on the basics of data- centric system threat modeling so that organizations  can successfully use it as part of their risk management  processes. The general methodology provided by  the publication is not intended to replace existing  methodologies, but rather to define fundamental  principles that should be part of any sound data-centric  system threat modeling methodology.

SP 800-57, Part 1 was  the first document produced in this effort, and includes  a general approach for transitioning from one algorithm  or key length to another. This Recommendation (SP 800- 131A) provides more specific guidance for transitions to  the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust  algorithms.  SP 800-126 Revision 3 (DRAFT)  The Technical Specification for the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.3  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 126-Rev-3  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)  is a suite of specifications that standardize the format  and nomenclature by which software flaw and security  configuration information is communicated, both to  machines and humans. This publication defines the  technical composition of SCAP version 1.3 in terms of its  component specifications, their interrelationships and  interoperation, and the requirements for SCAP content.  SP 800-126A (DRAFT)  SCAP 1.3 Component Specification Version Updates:  An Annex to NIST Special Publication 800-126  Revision 3  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 126A  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is  a multi-purpose framework of component specifications  that support automated configuration, vulnerability, and  patch checking, security measurement, and technical  control compliance activities. The SCAP version 1.3  specification is defined by the combination of SP 800- 126 Revision 3 and this document. This document allows  the use of particular minor version updates to SCAP 1.3  component specifications and the use of particular Open  Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) core  schema and platform schema versions. Allowing the  use of these updates and schemas provides additional  functionality for SCAP 1.3 without causing any loss of  existing functionality.  SP 800-125B  Secure Virtual Network Configuration for Virtual  Machine (VM) Protection  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-125B  Virtual machines (VMs) are key resources to be  protected, since they are the compute engines hosting  mission-critical applications. Since VMs are the end  nodes of a virtual network, the configuration of the  virtual network is an important element in the security  of the VMs and their hosted applications. The virtual  network configuration areas discussed in this document  are network segmentation, network path redundancy,  traffic control using firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring.  This document analyzes the configuration options  under these areas and presents a corresponding  set of recommendations for secure virtual network  configuration for VM protection.  SP 800-116 Revision 1 (DRAFT)  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in  Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 116-Rev.%201  This recommendation provides a technical guideline  to use Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards in  physical access control systems (PACS), enabling federal  agencies to operate as government-wide interoperable  enterprises. This recommendation covers the risk- based strategy to select appropriate PIV authentication  mechanisms as expressed within Federal Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2.  SP 800-114 Revision 1  User’s Guide to Telework and Bring Your Own Device  (BYOD) Security  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-114r1  Many people telework, and they use a variety  of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers,  smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access  websites, review and edit documents, and perform many  other tasks. Each telework device is controlled by the  organization, a third party (such as the organization’s  contractors, business partners, and vendors), or the  teleworker; the latter is known as bring your own device  (BYOD). This publication provides recommendations  for securing BYOD devices used for telework and  remote access, as well as those directly attached to the  enterprise’s own networks.

SP 800-70 Revision 3  National Checklist Program for IT Products:  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-70r3  A security configuration checklist is a document that  contains instructions or procedures for configuring an  IT product for an operational environment, for verifying  that the product has been configured properly, and/or  for identifying unauthorized changes to the product.  Using these checklists can minimize the attack surface,  reduce vulnerabilities, lessen the impact of successful  attacks, and identify changes that might otherwise go  undetected. To facilitate the development of checklists  and to make checklists more organized and usable, NIST  established the National Checklist Program (NCP). This  publication explains how to use the NCP to find and  retrieve checklists, and it also describes the policies,  procedures, and general requirements for participation  in the NCP.  SP 800-57 Part 1 Revision 4  Recommendation for Key Management, Part 1:  General  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4  This publication provides general cryptographic  key management guidance and is the first of three  parts. Part 1 defines cryptographic security services  that may be provided, provides background information  regarding the NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms,  classifies keys and other cryptographic information  according to their functions, specifies the protections  required for each key type, identifies the functions  involved in key management and discusses a variety of  key management issues related to the use of keys. Part  2 provides guidance on policy and security planning  requirements for U.S. government agencies, and Part  3 provides guidance when using the cryptographic  features of current systems.  SP 800-46 Revision 2  Guide to Enterprise Telework, Remote Access, and  Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Security  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-46r2  For many organizations, their employees,  contractors, business partners, vendors, and/or  others use enterprise telework or remote access  technologies to perform work from external locations.  All components of these technologies, including  organization-issued BYOD client devices, should be  secured against expected threats as identified through  threat models. This publication provides information  on security considerations for several types of remote  access solutions, and it makes recommendations for  securing a variety of telework, remote access, and BYOD  technologies. It also gives advice on creating related  security policies.

Both of these methods are modes of operation  for an underlying, approved symmetric-key block cipher  algorithm. FPE transforms data that is formatted as  a sequence of symbols (e.g., a sequence of decimal  numbers) so that the encrypted form of the data has  the same format and length as the original plaintext  data. Thus, an FPE-encrypted Social Security Number  would be a sequence of nine decimal digits, rather than a  sequence of symbols that may not be decimal numbers  and would very likely be longer than the original plaintext,  as is the case for other encryption modes.  SP 500-316  Framework for Cloud Usability  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.500-316  Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud- based services to meet their business needs. However,  due to the complexity and diversity of cloud systems it   is important to evaluate the user experience using within  a framework that encompasses the characteristics that  define the user experience.   In this paper, we propose  a cloud usability framework to provide a structure to  evaluate the key attributes of the cloud user experience.  The framework includes five attributes and 19 elements  that characterize this user experience.   Generally these  describe the consumer’s expectations of the cloud. The  framework can be the foundation for developing usability  metrics for organizations interested in measuring the  user experience when adopting the cloud.  SP 1800-5 (DRAFT)  IT Asset Management: Financial Services  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-1800-5  While a physical asset management system can  tell you the location of a computer, it cannot answer  questions like, “What operating systems are our laptops  running?” and “Which devices are vulnerable to the  latest threat?” An effective IT asset management (ITAM)  solution can tie together physical and virtual assets and  provide management with a complete picture of what,  where, and how assets are being used. ITAM enhances  visibility for security analysts, which leads to better asset  utilization and security. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide provides a reference build of an ITAM solution.  The build contains descriptions of the architecture, all  products used in the build and their individual  configurations. Additionally, this guide provides  a mapping of each product to multiple relevant  security standards. While the reference solution was  demonstrated with a certain suite of products, the  guide does not endorse these specific products. Instead,  it presents the characteristics and capabilities of the  products that an organization’s security experts can use  to identify similar standards-based products that can be  integrated quickly and cost-effectively with a financial  service company’s existing tools and infrastructure.  SP 1800-4 (DRAFT)  Mobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid Builds  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-1800-4  This document proposes a reference design on how  to architect enterprise-class protection for mobile devices  accessing an organization’s resources. The example  solutions presented here can be used by any organization  implementing an enterprise mobility management  solution. This project contains two distinct builds: cloud  and hybrid. The cloud build uses cloud-based services  and solutions, while the hybrid build achieves the same  functionality, but hosts at least some of the data and  services within an enterprise’s own infrastructure. The  example solutions and architectures presented here are  based on open standards and commercially available  products.

NISTIR 8144 (DRAFT)  Assessing Threats to Mobile Devices & Infrastructure:  the Mobile Threat Catalogue  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8144  Mobile devices pose a unique set of threats, yet  typical enterprise protections fail to address the larger  picture. To fully address the threats presented by mobile  devices, a wider view of the mobile security ecosystem  is necessary. This document discusses the Mobile Threat  Catalogue, which describes, identifies, and structures  the threats posed to mobile information systems.  NISTIR 8138 (DRAFT)  Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO): a  Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8138  This document aims to describe a more effective  and efficient methodology for characterizing the  vulnerabilities found in various forms of software and  hardware implementations, including, but not limited  to, information technology systems, industrial control  systems or medical devices to assist in the vulnerability  management process. The primary goal of the described  methodology is to enable automated analysis using  metrics such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS). Additional goals include establishing  a baseline of the minimum information needed to  properly inform the vulnerability management process,  and facilitating the sharing of vulnerability information  across language barriers.  NISTIR 8136 (DRAFT)  Mobile Application Vetting Services for Public Safety:  an Informal Survey  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8136  The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012 mandated  the creation of the Nation’s first nationwide, high-speed  communications network dedicated for public safety.  The law instantiated a new federal entity, the Federal  Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), to build,  maintain, and operate a new Long Term Evolution (LTE)  network. This network has the potential to equip first  responders with a modern array of network devices.  Mobile applications stand to be an important resource  that will be utilized by this network. However, current  mobile application developers may not be equipped  with the unique needs and requirements that must  be met for operation on FirstNet’s network. It would  benefit the public safety community to leverage the  mobile application vetting services and infrastructures  that already exist. These services currently target the  general public and enterprise markets. The purpose of  this document is to be an overview of existing mobile  application vetting services, the features these services  provide and how they relate to public safety’s needs. This  document is intended to aid public safety organizations  when selecting mobile application vetting services for  use in analyzing mobile applications.  NISTIR 8135  Identifying and Categorizing Data Types for Public  Safety Mobile Applications: Workshop Report  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8135  The Association of Public-Safety Communications  Officials (APCO), in cooperation with FirstNet and the  Department of Commerce held a half-day workshop on  June 2, 2015, “Identifying and Categorizing Data Types  for Public Safety Mobile Applications.” The goal of this  workshop was to begin identifying different types of  data that will flow through applications that operate  on the National Public Safety Broadband Network  (NPSBN). A diverse group of first responders, industry  leaders, and government representatives attended  the workshop. This document describes the workshop  and captures the input received from the workshop  attendees.  NISTIR 8114 (DRAFT)  Report on Lightweight Cryptography  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8114  NIST-approved cryptographic standards are  designed to perform well using general-purpose  computers. In recent years, there has been an  increased deployment of small computing devices  that have limited resources with which to implement  cryptography. When current NIST-approved algorithms  can be engineered to fit into the limited resources of  constrained environments, their performance may  not be acceptable.  For these reasons, NIST started  a lightweight cryptography project that was tasked  with learning more about the issues and developing  a strategy for the standardization of lightweight  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

NISTIR 8113  SATE V Ockham Sound Analysis Criteria  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8113  Static analyzers examine the source or executable  code of programs to find problems. Many static analyzers  use some heuristics or approximations to handle  programs up to millions of lines of codes. We established  the Ockham Sound Analysis Criteria to recognize static  analyzers whose findings are always correct. In brief  the criteria are (1) the analyzer’s findings are claimed to  always be correct, (2) it produces findings for most of a  program, and (3) even one incorrect finding disqualifies  an analyzer. This document begins by explaining the  background and requirements of the Ockham Criteria in  more detail. In Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) V,  one tool, Frama-C, examined pertinent parts of the Juliet  1.2 test suite to participate. We reviewed eight classes  of warnings, including improper buffer access, NULL  pointer dereference, integer overflow, and others. This  document details the many technical and theoretical  challenges we addressed to classify and review the  warnings against the Criteria. It also reports anomalies,  our observations, and interpretations. Frama-C reports  led to the discovery of three unintentional, systematic  flaws in the Juliet test suite involving 416 test cases. Our  conclusion is that Frama-C satisfied the SATE V Ockham  Sound Analysis Criteria.  NISTIR 8112 (DRAFT)  Attribute Metadata  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8112  This NIST Internal Report contains a metadata  schema for attributes that may be asserted about an  individual during an online transaction. The schema  can be used by relying parties to enrich access control  policies, as well as during runtime evaluation of an  individual’s ability to access protected resources.  Attribute metadata could also create the possibility for  data sharing permissions and limitations on individual  data elements. There are other possible applications of  attribute metadata, such as the evaluation and execution  of business logic in decision support systems; however,  the metadata contained in this document is focused on  supporting an organization’s risk-informed authorization  policies and evaluation.  NISTIR 8105  Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105  In recent years, there has been a substantial amount  of research on quantum computers – machines that  exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve  mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable  for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum  computers are ever built, they will be able to break many  of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This  would seriously compromise the confidentiality and  integrity of digital communications on the Internet and  elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also  called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop  cryptographic systems that are secure against both  quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate  with existing communications protocols and networks.  This Internal Report shares NIST’s current understanding  about the status of quantum computing and post- quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to  move forward in this space. The report also recognizes  the challenge of moving to new cryptographic  infrastructures and, therefore, emphasizes the need for  agencies to focus on crypto agility.  NISTIR 8103  Advanced Identity Workshop on Applying  Measurement Science in the Identity Ecosystem:  Summary and Next Steps  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8103  On January 12-13, 2016, ACD hosted a workshop  on “Applying Measurement Science in the Identity  Ecosystem” to discuss the application of measurement  science to digital identity management. This document  summarizes the concepts and ideas presented at the  workshop and serves as a platform to receive feedback  on the major themes discussed at that event.  NISTIR 8101  A Rational Foundation for Software Metrology  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8101  Much software research and practice involves  ostensible measurements of software, yet little progress  has been made on an SI-like metrological foundation for  those measurements since the work of Gray, Hogan, et al.  in 1996-2001. Given a physical object, one can determine  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In contrast, most software  metrics are simple counts that are used as indicators  of complex, abstract qualities. In this report we revisit  software metrology from two directions: first, top  down, to establish a theory of software measurement;  second, bottom up, to identify specific purposes for  which software measurements are needed, quantifiable  properties of software, relevant units, and objects of  measurement. Although there are structural obstacles  to realizing the vision of software metrology that works  like physical metrology for all desired measurands,  progress is possible if we start with a rational foundation.  NISTIR 8085 (DRAFT)  Forming Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)  Names from Software Identification (SWID) Tags  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8085  This report describes the association between  the use of SWID Tags and the Common Platform  Enumeration (CPE) specifications. The publication is  intended as a supplement to NIST Internal Report 8060,  Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software  Identification (SWID) Tags. Both SWID and CPE support  automated and accurate software asset management.  Such automation, in turn, helps organizations to  minimize exposure to publicly disclosed software  vulnerabilities, enforce organizational policies regarding  authorized software, and control network resource  access from potentially vulnerable endpoints. NISTIR  8085 provides guidance to support CPE naming using  information from a SWID tag based on the International  Organization for Standardization/International  Electrotechnical Commission 19770-2:2015 standard.  NISTIR 8080  Usability and Security Considerations for Public  Safety Mobile Authentication  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8080  There is a need for cybersecurity capabilities  and features to protect the National Public Safety  Broadband Network (NPSBN). However, cybersecurity  requirements should not compromise the ability of first  responders to complete their missions. In addition, the  diversity of public safety disciplines means that one  solution may not meet the usability and security needs  of different disciplines. Understanding how public safety  users operate in their different environments will allow  for usable cybersecurity capabilities and features to  be deployed and used. Although first responders work  in a variety of disciplines, this report is focused on the  Fire Service, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and  Law Enforcement. This report describes the constraints  presented by their personal protective equipment (PPE),  specialized gear, and unique operating environments  and how such constraints may interact with mobile  authentication requirements. The overarching goal of  this work is analyzing which authentication solutions  are the most appropriate and usable for first responders  using mobile devices in operational scenarios in the field.  NISTIR 8074 (2 volumes)  Volume 1: Report on Strategic U.S. Government  Engagement in International Standardization to  Achieve U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8074v1  This interagency report sets out proposed U.S.  Government strategic objectives for pursuing the  development and use of international standards  for cybersecurity and makes recommendations to  achieve those objectives. The recommendations cover  interagency coordination, collaboration with the U.S.  private sector and international partners, agency  participation in international standards development,  standards training and education, the use of international  standards to achieve mission and policy objectives, and  other issues.  Volume 2: Supplemental Information  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8074v2  This report provides background information  and analysis in support of NISTIR 8074 Volume 1,  “Interagency Report on Strategic U.S. Government  Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve  U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity.” It provides a current  summary of ongoing activities in critical international  cybersecurity standardization and an inventory of U.S.  Government and U.S. private sector engagement. It also  provides information for federal agencies and other  stakeholders to help plan more effective participation in  international cybersecurity standards development and  related conformity assessment activities.

One of the main drivers making this change possible  is the deployment of 4th generation (4G) LTE cellular  technologies. This document serves as a guide to  the fundamentals of how LTE networks operate and  explores the LTE security architecture. This is followed  by an analysis of the threats posed to LTE networks and  supporting mitigations.  NISTIR 8063 (DRAFT)  Primitives and Elements of Internet of Things (IoT)  Trustworthiness  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-8063/ nistir_8063_draft.pdf  System primitives allow formalisms, reasoning,  simulations, and reliability and security risk tradeoffs to  be formulated and argued. In this document, five core  primitives belonging to most distributed systems are  presented. These primitives apply well to systems with  large amounts of data, scalability concerns, heterogeneity  concerns, temporal concerns, and elements of unknown  pedigree with possible nefarious intent. These primitives  form the basic building blocks for a Network of ‘Things’  (NoT), including the Internet of Things (IoT). This report  offers an underlying and foundational science to IoT.  NISTIR 8060  Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software  Identification (SWID) Tags  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8060  This report provides an overview of the capabilities  and usage of SWID tags as part of a comprehensive  software lifecycle. As instantiated in the International  Organization for Standardization/International  Electrotechnical Commission 19770-2 standard, SWID  tags support numerous applications for software asset  management and information security management. This  report introduces SWID tags in an operational context,  provides guidelines for the creation of interoperable  SWID tags, and highlights key usage scenarios for which  SWID tags are applicable.  NISTIR 8055  Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Credentials (DPC) Proof of Concept Research  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8055  This report documents proof-of-concept research  for DPC. Smart card-based PIV Cards cannot be readily  used with most mobile devices, such as smartphones  and tablets, but DPC can be used instead to PIV-enable  these devices and provide multi-factor authentication  for mobile device users. This report captures existing  requirements related to DPC, proposes an architecture  that supports these requirements, and then demonstrates  how such an architecture could be implemented and  operated.  NISTIR 8053  De-Identification of Personal Information  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8053  De-identification removes identifying information  from a dataset so that individual data cannot be linked  with specific individuals. De-identification can reduce  the privacy risk associated with collecting, processing,  archiving, distributing or publishing information. De- identification attempts to balance the contradictory  goals of using and sharing personal information while  protecting privacy. Several U.S. laws, regulations and  policies specify that data should be de-identified prior  to sharing. In recent years, researchers have shown that  some de-identified data can sometimes be re-identified.  Many kinds of information can be de-identified, including  structured information, free-format text, multimedia, and  medical imagery. This document summarizes roughly  two decades of de-identification research, discusses  current practices, and presents opportunities for future  research.  NISTIR 8040  Measuring the Usability and Security of Permuted  Passwords on Mobile Platforms  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8040  Password entry on mobile devices significantly  impacts both usability and security, but there is a lack  of usable security research in this area, specifically for  complex password entry. To address this research gap,  we set out to assign strength metrics to passwords for  which we already had usability data to have a more  meaningful comparison between usability and security.  This document reports a method of optimizing the  input of randomly generated passwords on mobile  devices via password permutation to allow for a  comparison of password usability data. We found that  the number of keystrokes saved—the efficiency gained— via permutation depends on the number of onscreen  keyboard changes required in the original password  rather than on password length. Additionally, we created  and are releasing Python scripts (publicly available from  https://github.com/usnistgov/PasswordMetrics) for  the experiments on entropy loss we conducted across  passwords ranging in length from 5 to 20 characters.

This NISTIR represents a joint effort between NIST  and the Department of Homeland Security to provide  an operational approach for automating security control  assessments in order to facilitate information security  continuous monitoring (ISCM), ongoing assessment,  and ongoing security authorizations in a way that is  consistent with the NIST Risk Management Framework  overall and the guidance in NIST SPs 800-53 and 800- 53A in particular.  NISTIR 8011 will ultimately consist of 13 volumes.  Volume 1 introduces the general approach to automating  security control assessments, 12 ISCM security  capabilities, and terms and concepts common to all  12 capabilities. Volume 2 provides details specific to  the hardware asset management security capability.  The remaining 11 ISCM security capability volumes will  provide details specific to each capability but will be  organized in a very similar way to Volume 2.  Volume 1: Overview  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8011-1.pdf  Volume 1 of NISTIR 8011 introduces concepts to  support an automated assessment of most of the  security controls in SP 800-53. Referencing SP 800- 53A, the controls are divided into more granular parts  (determination statements) to be assessed. The parts of  the control assessed by each determination statement  are called control items. These control items are then  grouped into the appropriate security capabilities. As  suggested by SP 800-53 Revision 4, security capabilities  are groups of controls that support a common purpose.  For effective automated assessment, testable defect  checks are defined that bridge the determination  statements to the broader security capabilities to be  achieved and to the SP 800-53 security control items  themselves. The defect checks correspond to security  sub-capabilities—called sub-capabilities because  each is part of a larger capability. Capabilities and  sub-capabilities are both designed with the purpose  of addressing a series of attack steps. Automated  assessments (in the form of defect checks) are  performed using the test assessment method defined  in SP 800-53A by comparing a desired and actual state  (or behavior).  Volume 2: Hardware Asset Management Assets  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8011-2.pdf  This document, Volume 2 of NISTIR 8011, addresses  the Hardware Asset Management (HWAM) information  security capability. The focus of the HWAM capability  is to manage risk created by unmanaged devices on a  network. Unmanaged devices are targets that attackers  can use to gain and more easily maintain a persistent  platform from which to attack the rest of the network.  NISTIR 7987 Revision 1  Policy Machine: Features, Architecture, and  Specification  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7987r1  The ability to control access to sensitive data in  accordance with policy is perhaps the most fundamental  security requirement. Despite over four decades of  security research, the limited ability for existing access  control mechanisms to enforce a comprehensive range  of policy persists. While researchers, practitioners and  policy makers have specified a large variety of access  control policies to address real-world security issues,  only a relatively small subset of these policies can be  enforced through off-the-shelf technology, and even a  smaller subset can be enforced by any one mechanism.  This report describes an access control framework,  referred to as the Policy Machine (PM), which  fundamentally changes the way policy is expressed and  enforced. The report gives an overview of the PM and  the range of policies that can be specified and enacted.  The report also describes the architecture of the PM and  the properties of the PM model in detail.  NISTIR 7977  NIST Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines  Development Process  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7977  This document describes the principles, processes  and procedures that drive cryptographic standards  and guidelines development efforts at NIST. This  document reflects public comments received on two  earlier versions, and will serve as the basis to guide  NIST’s future cryptographic standards and guidelines  development efforts. It will be reviewed and updated  every five years, or more frequently if a need arises, to  help ensure that NIST fulfills its role and responsibilities  for producing robust, effective cryptographic standards  and guidelines.

This is often accomplished using the SSH  protocol. The SSH protocol supports several mechanisms  for interactive and automated authentication. The  management of this access requires proper provisioning,  termination, and monitoring processes. However, the  security of SSH key-based access has been largely  ignored to date. This publication assists organizations  in understanding the basics of SSH interactive and  automated access management in an enterprise,  focusing on the management of SSH user keys.  NISTIR 7904  Trusted Geolocation in the Cloud: Proof of Concept  Implementation  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7904  This publication explains selected security  challenges involving Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  cloud computing technologies and geolocation. It then  describes a proof-of-concept implementation that was  designed to address those challenges. The publication  provides sufficient details about the proof-of-concept  implementation so that organizations can reproduce it  if desired. The publication is intended to be a blueprint  or template that can be used by the general security  community to validate and implement the described  proof of concept implementation.  NISTIR 7511 Revision 4  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version  1.2 Validation Program Test Requirements  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7511r4  This report defines the requirements and associated  test procedures necessary for products or modules  to achieve one or more SCAP validations.

Through research and discussion, the  NCCoE has identified several areas of interest within a  broader cybersecurity subject, in this case, improved  security for connected devices, or the “Internet of  Things.” Public comments on this concept paper will  help the NCCoE understand specific challenges and  needs, and may be used to help define a challenge  statement, use cases, and/or a project description.  Comments will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Our  hope is that stakeholders will help identify models,  methodologies, protocols, best practices, or standards  from other industries that may be relevant to securing  smart home technology.  P r o j e c t  D e s c r i p t i o n s  ( N C C o E )  Authentication for Law Enforcement Vehicle Systems  (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/authentication- law-enforcement-vehicle-systems  Law enforcement vehicles often serve as mobile  offices. In-vehicle laptops or other computer systems are  used to access a wide range of software applications and  databases hosted and operated by federal, state, and  local agencies, with each typically requiring a different  username and password. This operational environment  presents unique security challenges. Officers must  frequently leave the vehicle unattended, perhaps on  short notice, and must be able to gain access to systems  quickly once they return or possibly while the vehicle  is in motion. These needs discourage the use of screen  locks and traditional single sign-on solutions. This  project demonstrated an integrated set of authentication  mechanisms, improving system security, usability, and  safety. This project also explored additional capabilities,  such as proximity authentication, Distributed Control  System (DPC) integration with First Responder  Network Authority (FirstNet), and integration with  vehicle drive-away protection and Computer Assisted  Dispatch systems to indicate whether the officer is in the  vehicle. This project will result in a freely available NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide that will enable members of  the community to more easily and effectively incorporate  proximity access and reduced-sign-on technologies.  Data Integrity: Recovering from a Destructive Malware  Attack  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building_blocks/data_ integrity  Threats of destructive malware, malicious insider  activity, and even honest mistakes create the imperative  for organizations to be able to quickly recover from  an event that alters or destroys any form of data  (database records, system files, configurations, user  files, application code, etc.). Organizations must be  confident that recovered data is accurate and safe.  The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE)—in collaboration with members of the  business community and vendors of cybersecurity  solutions—built an example solution to address these  complex data integrity challenges. Multiple systems  need to work together to prevent, detect, notify, and  recover when data integrity is jeopardized. This project  explored methods to effectively monitor and detect data  corruption in commodity components (server, operating  system, applications, and software configurations)  as well as custom applications and data. The project  also explored issues of auditing and reporting (user  activity monitoring, file system monitoring, database  monitoring, scanning backups/snapshots for malware  and rapid recovery solutions) to support recovery and  investigations. To address real-world business challenges  around data integrity, the resulting example solution was  composed of open-source and commercially available  components. Ultimately, this project resulted in a  publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide—a  description of the solution and practical steps needed  to implement an example solution that addresses these  existing challenges.  Domain Name System-Based Security for Electronic Mail  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building_blocks/secured_ email  The Domain Name System-Based Security for  Electronic Mail project produced a proof-of-concept  security platform that demonstrated trustworthy email  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The  product of the project was a security platform that  included the authentication of mail servers, the signing  and encryption of email, and binding cryptographic key  certificates to the servers; it also included a practice  guide that explained how to configure and use the  demonstrated platform to satisfy both operational and  security requirements. Domain Name System Security  Extension (DNSSEC) protocols were used to authenticate  server addresses and certificates by binding the X.509  certificates used for TLS to DNS names verified by  DNSSEC. The business value of the security platform  resulted from this project not only improves privacy  and security protection for users’ operations, but also  expands the set of available DNS security applications  and encourages wider implementation of the protocols  that provide Internet users with confidence that  entities to which they believe they are connecting are  the entities to which they are actually connecting.  This project resulted in one or more demonstration  prototype DNS-based secure email platforms, a  publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide  that explains how to employ the platform(s) to meet  federal and industry security and privacy requirements,  platform documentation necessary to compose a  DNS-based email security platform from off-the- shelf components, and any recommendations for  improvements to applicable standards documentation.  The secure email project involved the composition  of a variety of components that were provided by a  number of different vendors. Client systems, DNS/ DNSSEC services, mail transfer agents, and certificate  providers (Certificate Authorities or CAs) were included.  The NCCoE entered into cooperative research and  development agreements with technology providers for  components and expertise that included DNS resolvers  (stub and recursive) for DNSSEC, authoritative DNS  servers for DNSSEC signed zones, mail servers and  mail security components, and extended validation and  domain validation TLS certificates.  Mobile Application Single Sign-on: for Public Safety and  First Responders (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/mobile-sso  Mobile platforms offer a significant operational  advantage to public safety stakeholders by giving them  access to mission critical information and services while  deployed in the field, during training and exercises,  or participating in the day-to-day business and  preparations during non-emergency periods. However,  these advantages can be limited if unnecessary or  complex authentication requirements stand in the  way of an official providing emergency services,  especially when any delay – even seconds – is a matter  of containing or exacerbating an emergency situation.  The vast diversity of public safety personnel, missions,  and operational environments magnifies the need for  a nimble authentication solution for public safety. This  project is exploring various multi-factor authenticators  currently in use, or expected to be offered in the future,  by the public safety community as their next generation  networks are brought online. The effort is not only  building an interoperable solution that can accept various  authenticators to speed access to online systems while  maintaining an appropriate amount of security, but the  project also focuses on delivering single sign-on (SSO)  capabilities to both native and web/browser-based  applications. It is not enough to have an authenticator  that is easy to use. This project is working to identify  technical options for the public safety community to  consider for deployment to ensure individuals in the  field are not kept from meeting their mission goals by  unnecessary authentication prompts. This project will  result in a freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide that details the technical decisions, tradeoffs,  lessons-learned, and build instructions, based on  market-dominant standards, such that public safety  organizations can accelerate the deployment of a range  of mobile authentication and SSO services to their  population of users.  Multifactor Authentication for e-Commerce: Online  Authentication for the Retail Sector (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/multifactor- authentication-ecommerce  As greater security control mechanisms are  implemented at the point of sale, retailers in the United  States may see a drastic increase in e-commerce fraud,  similar to what has been widely observed in the UK and  Europe following the rollout of Europay, MasterCard and  Visa (EMV) chip-and-PIN technology approximately ten  years ago. Consumers, retailers, payment processors,  banks, and card issuers are all impacted by the security  risks of e-commerce transactions. Retailers bear the  cost for fraudulent, card-not-present transactions,  motivating them to reduce fraud to avoid damage  to reputation and eliminate potential revenue losses,  which have been estimated to be over $3 billion.

In  collaboration with stakeholders in the retail and  e-commerce ecosystem, the NCCoE has determined that  implementing multifactor authentication for e-commerce  transactions can help reduce the risk of false online  identification and authentication fraud. Consumers  and retailers will adopt multi-factor authentication  mechanisms if they do not unnecessarily encumber the  purchasing process, or if they are applied evenly across  the entire sector. Building on this collaboration with  the business community and vendors of cybersecurity  solutions, the NCCoE explored methods to effectively  identify and authenticate purchasers during e-commerce  transactions and develop an example solution composed  of open-source and commercially available components.  This project produced a NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide—a publicly available description of the solution  and practical steps needed to implement practices that  effectively identify and authenticate purchasers during  e-commerce transactions.  Securing Non-Credit Card, Sensitive Consumer Data:  Consumer Data Security for the Retail Sector (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/securing- sensitive-consumer-data  As a result of payment card industry standards  and a strong understanding of the value of valid credit  card information in the black market, the retail industry  has already invested in security mechanisms to protect  credit card data, also referred to as cardholder data.  However, this cardholder data is not the only valuable  consumer information that is transmitted and stored by  retailers. Other data that can be personally identifiable  and is transmitted and stored in this ecosystem includes,  but is not limited to, consumer purchasing habits  (including geographical locations, preferences, search  history), the dates of birth, home or business addresses,  phone numbers, email addresses, user ids, passwords,  IP addresses, and Social Security Numbers. As seen  following high-profile data breaches in the healthcare  sector, PII is valued at up to 20 times more than credit  card data, with a single credit card number sold at $1 and  the average individual’s PII sold at $20. In collaboration  with stakeholders in the retail and commercial  payment ecosystem, the NCCoE has determined that  implementing data masking and tokenization, coupled  with fine-grained access control such as Attribute  Based Access Control2, may significantly improve the  security of PII transmitted and stored during commercial  payment transactions, as well as PII shared internally  within a retail organization and externally with business  partners. Building on this collaboration with the business  community and vendors of cybersecurity solutions, the  NCCoE is exploring methods of effectively masking and  tokenizing PII during commercial payment transactions  and developing an example solution composed of  open-source and commercially available components  to address these real-world business challenges. This  project will produce a NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide—a publicly available description of the solution  and practical steps needed to implement practices that  more effectively secure the handling of non-credit card,  sensitive consumer data.

It  helps organizational leaders identify opportunities for  improvement, based on their cybersecurity needs and  objectives, as well as their larger organizational needs,  objectives, and outcomes. This self-assessment, can be  used to:  • Determine cybersecurity-related activities that are  important to business strategy and critical service  delivery;  • Prioritize investments in managing cybersecurity  risk;  • Determine how best to enable the workforce,  customers, suppliers, partners, and collaborators to  be risk conscious and security aware, and to fulfill  their cybersecurity roles and responsibilities;  • Assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of  cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices;  • Assess the cybersecurity results achieved; and  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

It is adaptable and scalable  to an organization’s needs, goals, capabilities, and  environment. It does not prescribe how an organization’s  cybersecurity policies and operations should be  structured. Through interrelated sets of open-ended  questions, it encourages the use of approaches that  best fit the organization.  Best Practices for Privileged User PIV Authentication  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/papers/2016/best- practices-privileged-user-piv-authentication.pdf  The Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation  Plan (CSIP), published by the OMB on October 30,  2015, requires that federal agencies use PIV credentials  for authenticating privileged users. This will greatly  reduce unauthorized access to privileged accounts by  attackers impersonating system, network, security, and  database administrators, as well as other IT personnel  with administrative privileges. This white paper further  explains the need for multi-factor PIV-based user  authentication to take the place of password-based  single-factor authentication for privileged users. It also  provides best practices for agencies implementing PIV  authentication for privileged users.

In effect, a BCM is  an authenticated bit commitment scheme, which is  AND-homomorphic. We show that a BCM has natural  and important applications. In particular, we use a  BCM to construct a mechanism for transmitting alerts  undetectably in a message-passing system of n nodes.  Our algorithms allow an alert to quickly propagate to  all nodes without its source or existence being detected  by an adversary, who controls all message traffic. Our  proofs of security are based on a new subgroup escape  problem, which seems hard on certain groups with  bilinear pairings and on elliptic curves over the ring Zn.  J. Boyar, M. Find and R.

Namely, we study three  circuit models: monotone OR-circuits, monotone SUM- circuits (addition of non-negative integers), and non- monotone XOR-circuits (addition modulo 2). Our focus  is on separating OR-circuits from the two other models  in terms of circuit complexity:  1. We show how to obtain matrices that admit OR- circuits of size O(n)O(n), but require SUM-circuits of  size Ω(n3/2/log2n).  2. We consider the task of rewriting a given OR-circuit  as an XOR-circuit and prove that any subquadratic- time algorithm for this task violates the strong  exponential time hypothesis.  M.

This has  the potential to greatly benefit many organizations. The  key to the successful implementation of a cloud-based  information system is a level of transparency into the  cloud provider’s service. This article focuses on security  risks related to the operation and use of cloud-based  information systems.  M. Iorga and K.

Identifying, defining, selecting, and prioritizing these  functional capabilities and the security components that  implement and enforce them is surprisingly challenging.  This article explains recent developments by NIST in  addressing these challenges. The article focuses on the  capability-oriented methodology for orchestrating a  secure cloud ecosystem proposed as part of the NIST  Cloud Computing Security Reference Architecture. The  methodology recognizes that risk can vary for cloud  actors within a single ecosystem, so it takes a risk- based approach to functional capabilities. The result  is an assessment of which cloud actor is responsible  for implementing each security component and how  implementation should be prioritized. Cloud actors,  especially cloud consumers, that follow the methodology  can more easily make well-informed decisions regarding  their cloud ecosystems.  C. Kolias, A. Stavrou, J. Voas, I.

This study identifies the  affective manifestations resulting from decision fatigue  and the role it plays in users’ security decisions. A semi  structured interview protocol was used to collect data  (N = 40). Interview questions addressed online activities;  computer security perceptions; and the knowledge and  use of security icons, tools, and terminology. Qualitative  data techniques were used to code and analyze the data  identifying security fatigue and contributing factors,  symptoms, and outcomes of fatigue. Although fatigue  was not directly part of the interview protocol, more  than half of the participants alluded to fatigue in their  interviews. Participants expressed a sense of resignation,  loss of control, fatalism, risk minimization, and decision  avoidance, all characteristics of security fatigue. The  authors found that the security fatigue users experience  contributes to their cost-benefit analyses in how to  incorporate security practices and reinforces their ideas  of lack of benefit for following security advice.  M. Theofanos, S. Garfinkel, and Y. Choong, Secure and  Usable Enterprise Authentication: Lessons from the Field.  IEEE Security & Privacy, 14(5), pp.14-21 (February 2016).  There are now more than 5.4 million Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) and Common Access Card (CAC)  identity cards deployed to US government employees  and contractors. These cards are widely used to gain  physical access to federal facilities, but their use to  authenticate logical access to government information  systems has been uneven. We report the reasons for  the uneven deployment and then compare the results  of a 26,691-person survey within the Department of  Defense (DoD) and a 4,573-person survey within the  Department of Commerce (DOC) to show that the use  of smart-cards for 2-factor authentication results in  improved usability and security when compared with  1-factor, password-only systems. We show that these  benefits extend beyond the smart cards to other systems  within the organizations that solely employ password  authentication. We argue that PKI token-based  authentication systems, such as smartcards, are likely  to provide authentication that is simultaneously more  secure and more usable than other 2-factor approaches,  such as combining strong passwords with cell phones or  with time-based hardware identity tokens.

Estimates are often based on error rates in initial testing,  or on code coverage. For example, tests may be run  until a desired level of statement or branch coverage  is achieved. Combinatorial methods present an  opportunity for a different approach to estimating the  required test set size, using characteristics of the test  set. This paper describes methods for estimating the  coverage of, and ability to detect, the t-way interaction  faults of a test set based on a covering array. We also  develop a connection between (static) combinatorial  coverage and (dynamic) code coverage, such that if a  specific condition is satisfied, 100 % branch coverage  is assured. Using these results, we propose practical  recommendations for using combinatorial coverage  in specifying test requirements, and for improving  estimates of the fault detection capacity of a test set.

Prior work  has provided near optimal heuristics with a high time  complexity that function on up to hundreds of nodes  and less optimal but faster techniques that function on  up to thousands of nodes. In this work, we analyze how  to perform vertex partitioning on massive graphs of tens  of millions of nodes. We use a previously known and  very simple heuristic technique: iteratively removing  the node of the largest degree and all its edges. This  approach has an apparent quadratic complexity since,  upon removal of a node and adjoining set of edges,  the node degree calculations must be updated prior  to choosing the next node. However, we describe a  linear time complexity solution using an array whose  indices map to node degree and whose values are hash  tables indicating the presence or absence of a node at  that degree value.

More  recently, this diversity has found new applications in  cloud computing security, moving-target defense, and  improving the robustness of network routing. However,  most existing efforts rely on intuitive and imprecise  notions of diversity, and the few existing diversity models  are mostly designed for a single system running diverse  software replicas or variants. At a higher abstraction  level, as a global property of the entire network, network  diversity and its effect on security have received limited  attention. In this paper, we take the first step toward  formally modeling network diversity as a security metric  by designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics.  In particular, we first devise a biodiversity-inspired metric  based on the effective number of distinct resources. We  then propose two complementary diversity metrics,  based on the least and the average attacking efforts,  respectively. We provide guidelines for instantiating the  proposed metrics and present a case study on estimating  software diversity. Finally, we evaluate the proposed  metrics through simulation.

Recent work show that this  diversity can be modeled and quantified as a security  metric at the network level. However, such an effort  does not directly provide a solution for improving the  network diversity, and existing network hardening  approaches are largely limited to handling previously  known vulnerabilities by disabling existing services. In  this paper, we take the first step toward an automated  approach to diversifying network services under various  cost constraints in order to improve the network’s  resilience against unknown attacks. Specifically, we  provide a model of network services and formulate the  diversification requirements as an optimization problem.  We devise optimization and heuristic algorithms for  efficiently diversifying relatively large networks under  different cost constraints. We also evaluate our approach  through simulations.  S.

In this work, we propose inf- TESLA, Infinite Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant  Authentication, a multicast, delayed authentication  protocol for communication links that are used to  stream synchrophasor data for wide area control of  electric power networks. Our approach is based on  the authentication protocol TESLA, but is augmented  to accommodate high frequency transmissions of  unbounded length. The inf-TESLA protocol utilizes  the Dual Offset Key Chains mechanism to reduce  authentication delay and the computational cost  associated with key chain commitment. We provide a  description of the mechanism using two different modes  for disclosing keys and demonstrate its security against  a man-in-the-middle attack attempt. We compare  our approach against the TESLA protocol in a 2-day  simulation scenario, showing a reduction of 15.82  %  and 47.29  % in computational cost by the sender and  receiver, respectively, and a cumulative reduction in the  communication overhead.

Published in the Proceedings of the Human Factors and  Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting (Vol. 60, No. 1, pp.  760-764). Sage CA: Los Angeles, CA: SAGE Publications.  (September 2016).  Although many aspects of passwords have  been studied, no research to date has systematically  examined how ambiguous terminology affects the  user experience during password rule comprehension,  a necessary precursor to password generation. Our  research begins to address this gap by focusing on users  comprehension of password generation rules. Varying  terms special characters, symbols, non-alphanumeric  characters, and punctuation are used in different  password rules, but mostly without explicit definition.  In this laboratory study, we used character-selection  and compliance-checking tasks with 60 participants to  investigate effects of varying terms on users’ password  rule comprehension. Results show that manipulating  terminology caused participants conception of the  allowed character space to shrink or expand. Our  quantitative and qualitative data show that participants  were extremely confused by the variety of terms for  special character. Seemingly small changes in language  have large, observable impacts on users understanding  of password rules. Language in password requirements  must be carefully constructed to ensure that people  fully comprehend the allowable character space. This  research is an important first step to providing data- driven guidance on constructing clearer language for  password rules.

Do  these two tools generally find the same set of bugs, or  different, complimentary sets? Can we guarantee that  a new technique discovers all problems of this type? To  answer such questions, we need a vastly improved way to  describe classes of vulnerabilities and chains of failures.  This paper presents a descriptive framework that will lift  the current realm of best efforts and useful heuristics.  Our framework includes rigorous definitions and (static)  characteristics of bug classes, along with their related  dynamic properties, such as proximate, secondary, and  tertiary causes and consequences (CCC), and sites. The  paper discusses the buffer overflow class, the injection  class, and the interaction frequency control class, and  provides examples of applying our taxonomy to describe  particular vulnerabilities.

Test Suites 45 and 46 are analyzed,  discussed, and updated to improve accuracy, con- sistency, reciseness, and automation. Empirical results  show metrics such as recall, precision, and F-Measure  are all impacted by invalid base assumptions regarding  the test suites.  B. Stivalet and E. N.

The IARPA  (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity)  STONESOUP (Securely Taking on Software of Uncertain  Provenance) Program [1] has produced such a test suite.  Our presentation will characterize this test suite called  the STONESOUP Phase 3 Test Suite. This test suite  consists of 7769 individual test cases, of which 4581 are  in C and 3188 are in Java. All of these test cases may be  accessed independently. Each test case is derived from  real-world open source applications. This test suite is  significant in that it is the first test suite of its kind (to our  knowledge) to be based on large real-world code sets.  Our presentation will describe the test suite format and  contents, as well as the structure of the test cases in the  test suite. Additional relevant information pertaining to  the test suite including the test case naming convention  and how to specify the metadata xml file will also be  provided, containing all the instructions needed to build,  execute and score a given test case.

The networking infrastructure in a  cloud (virtualized) data center, therefore, consists of the  combination of physical IP network (data center fabric)  and the virtual network residing in virtualized hosts.  Network Segmentation (Isolation), Traffic flow control  using firewalls and Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion  Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) form the primary network- based security techniques, with the first one as the  foundation for the other two. In this paper, we describe  and analyze three generations of network segmentation  techniques: Virtual Switches & Physical NIC-based,  Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)-based & Overlay- based. We take a detailed look at the overlay-based  virtual network segmentation and its characteristics,  such as scalability and ease of configuration.  D. Ferraiolo, R. Chandramouli, D. R. Kuhn and V.

An objective of both is to provide a  standardized way for expressing and enforcing vastly  diverse access control policies in support of various  types of data services. The two standards differ with  respect to the way that access control policies and  attributes are specified and managed, and decisions are  computed and enforced.

In IFIP Advances in  Information and Communication Technology 484, pp. 189- 210.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46279-0_10  Modern-day attackers use sophisticated multi-  stage and/or multi-host attack techniques and anti- forensic tools to cover their attack traces. Due to the  limitations of current intrusion detection systems and  forensic analysis tools, evidence often has false positive  errors or is incomplete. Additionally, because of the  large number of security events, discovering an attack  pattern is much like finding a needle in a haystack.  Consequently, reconstructing attack scenarios and  holding attackers accountable for their activities are  major challenges.  This chapter describes a probabilistic model that  applies Bayesian networks to construct evidence  graphs. The model helps address the problems posed  by false positive errors, analyze the reasons for missing  evidence and compute the posterior probabilities and  false positive rates of attack scenarios constructed  using the available evidence. A companion software tool  for network forensic analysis was used in conjunction  with the probabilistic model. The tool, which is written  in Prolog, leverages vulnerability databases and an  anti-forensic database similar to the NIST National  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Restricting attack graph  size is vital for the execution of high degree polynomial  analysis algorithms. However, we find that the most widely  cited and recently used “condition/exploit” attack graph  representation has a worst-case quadratic node growth  with respect to the number of hosts in the network when  a linear representation will suffice. In 2002, a node linear  representation in the form of a “condition” approach was  published but was not significantly used in subsequent  research. In analyzing the condition approach, we find  that (while node linear) it suffers from edge explosions:  the creation of unnecessary complete bipartite sub- graphs. To address the weaknesses in both approaches,  we provide a new hybrid “condition/vulnerability”  representation that regains linearity in the number of  nodes and that removes unnecessary complete bipartite  sub-graphs, mitigating the edge explosion problem. In  our empirical study modeling an operational 5968-node  network, our new representation had 94 % fewer nodes  and 64 % fewer edges than the currently used condition/ exploit approach.  D.

This paper demonstrates attacks that are  significantly cheaper than the claimed security level of the  parameters given by Gligoroski et al. We implemented an  attack on the proposed 80-bit parameters that recovered  private keys for both encryption and signatures in  approximately two hours on a single laptop. We further  find that increasing the parameters to avoid our attack  will require parameters to grow by (at least) two orders  of magnitude for encryption, and may not be achievable  at all for signatures.

Due to the  current limitations of intrusion detection and forensic  analysis tools, reconstructing attack scenarios from  evidence left behind by the attackers of an enterprise  system is challenging. In particular, reconstructing attack  scenarios by using the information from IDS alerts and  system logs that have a large number of false positives  is a big challenge. In this poster, we present a model  and an accompanying software tool that systematically  addresses how to resolve the above problems to  reconstruct the attack scenario. These problems include  a large amount of data, including non-relevant data  and evidence destroyed by anti-forensic techniques.  Our system is based on a Prolog system using known  vulnerability databases and an anti-forensics database  that we plan to extend to a standardized database like  the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In this  model, we use different methods, including mapping the  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The goal of this work is to reduce the investigators’ time  and effort in reaching a definite conclusion about how  an attack occurred. Our results indicate that such a  reasoning system can be useful for network forensics  analysis.  X. Sun, A. Singhal and P. Liu, Who Touched My Mission:  Towards Probabilistic Mission Impact Assessment, 2015  Workshop on Automated Decision Making for Active Cyber  Defense (SafeConfig ’15), Denver, Colorado, United States,  October 12, 2015, pp 21-26.  https://doi.org/10.1145/2809826.2809834  Cyber attacks inevitably have negative impacts  on relevant missions. However, concrete methods to  accurately evaluate such impacts are rare. In this paper,  we propose a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian  networks for quantitative mission impact assessment.  A System Object Dependency Graph (SODG) is first  built to capture the intrusion propagation process at  the low operating system level. On top of the SODG,  a mission-task-asset (MTA) map can be established  to associate the system objects with corresponding  tasks and missions. Based on the MTA map, a Bayesian  network can be constructed to leverage the collected  intrusion evidence and infer the probabilities of tasks  and missions being tainted. This approach is promising  for effective quantitative mission impact assessment.

So, too, are the challenges. When it comes to cybersecurity, the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) has a long history of conducting path-breaking research and development, cultivating standards  and best practices, and facilitating technology transitions. We rely on open, transparent, and collaborative processes that  engage private and public sector participation and attract expertise from around the world. This 2016 report captures our  most noteworthy accomplishments.  In 2016, NIST continued to advance fundamental research to support security and interoperability standards and  guidelines. This work was led by the Computer Security Division (CSD) in the NIST Information Technology Laboratory  (ITL). Among other things, CSD is responsible for developing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, tests, and metrics for  the protection of non-national security federal information systems. Recognizing the agency’s need to respond to and  anticipate increasing demands for its cybersecurity expertise, NIST established the Applied Cybersecurity Division (ACD)  within ITL to support additional applied research and to transition effective cybersecurity technology approaches to  government and business sectors nationwide. ACD helps to drive the adoption of appropriate cybersecurity solutions by  government and commercial organizations – enabling solutions-oriented collaborative interactions and offering guidance  on the use of research results, standards, and best practices. Other parts of NIST also are key contributors to NIST’s  cybersecurity portfolio.  Strong partnerships with industry, academia and government are critical to NIST’s cybersecurity program. In 2016,  NIST continued to collaborate with stakeholders from across the country and around the world to raise awareness and  encourage use of the voluntary Cybersecurity Framework. In this spirit, NIST began to develop an update to the version first  published in 2014. NIST also prepared a draft Cybersecurity Framework profile aligned with manufacturing sector goals and  industry best practices. In addition, NIST developed the draft Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder self-assessment tool  that complements the Cybersecurity Framework and helps organizations to better understand the effectiveness of their  cybersecurity risk management efforts.  Looking ahead is vital in the realm of cybersecurity. Knowing that if large-scale quantum computers are ever built,  they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use and compromise the confidentiality and  integrity of digital communication on the Internet and elsewhere, NIST is working closely with the academic community and  industry to develop protective cryptographic standards that we all rely upon. Building on its successful tradition of working  openly with the worldwide cryptographic community, in 2016 NIST called for submissions for quantum-resistant public-key  cryptographic algorithms for standards. These algorithms must be secure against both quantum and classical computers,  and should interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. After submissions are received late in  2017, NIST plans to spend 3-5 years working with the research community and industry to analyze the candidates before  selecting algorithms for standardization.  Identity management is fundamental to security management. In 2016, NIST continued to advance solutions in identity  management through projects with partners who manage innovative but practical real-world solutions. Also in the past  year, NIST produced an introduction to the concepts of privacy engineering and risk management for federal information  systems. The goal is to help decrease privacy risks and enable organizations to make purposeful decisions about resource  allocation and effective implementation of controls in information systems. NIST also initiated an update to our Digital  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Building from these foundational resources, NIST’s efforts will focus on strengthening the  security, privacy, usability and interoperability of digital identity solutions that meet an organization’s identity and access  management needs throughout the system lifecycle.  During 2016, NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) moved into a new permanent facility that  expanded the Center’s workspace from four to 23 separate, flexible laboratories—including two larger areas capable of  safely hosting large equipment, such as automobiles. This additional space allows NCCoE to increase its collaborations  and projects. In 2016, the Center published draft practice guides to support industry sectors, including healthcare, financial  services, and energy; these guides are now beginning to be put to productive use. NCCoE also published draft documents  to support security in key technology areas, such as cloud computing and mobile applications.  The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE), led by NIST, is a partnership between government, academia,  and the private sector that is focused on promoting a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education,  training, and workforce development. In 2016, NIST released an update to the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework  (NCWF); it already is being used in the private and public sectors to more effectively identify, recruit, develop and maintain  cybersecurity talent. The NICE framework provides a common language to categorize and describe cybersecurity work that  helps organizations to build a strong staff to protect systems and data.  Our dedicated staff has accomplished a great deal in 2016, developing standards and working closely with scores  of partners and drawing upon hundreds of private and public sector organizations and individuals. This is not a static  endeavor. For example, NIST is fully aware of the urgent need to more aggressively address the security challenges of the  Internet of Things and, more broadly, our connected world.  We welcome any and all suggestions about where and how we can better provide the nation with the kind of  cybersecurity information and tools that it needs in order to advance and protect our economy and our country.

Title III of the E-Government Act, titled  the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  of 2002, included the duties and responsibilities for the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information  Technology Laboratory. There are multiple divisions within  ITL that are involved with cybersecurity programs/projects.  The work is being conducted collaboratively between the  divisions. In December 2014, the 113th Congress updated  FISMA as the Federal Information Security Modernization  Act (Public Law 113-283). NIST ITL responsibilities were  unchanged in the update. In 2016, the ITL Cybersecurity  Program addressed its assignment through the following  major activities:  •  Forty-three NIST Special Publications (SP) (20  approved as final and 23 drafts) were issued,  providing management, operational, and  technical security guidelines in topic areas  including:  The 2015 annual report; cryptography  (cryptographic standards used for the Federal  Government, block cipher modes of operation,  key management, random bit generator (RBG),  Secure Hash Algorithm-3 (SHA-3) cryptography,  transitioning the use of cryptographic algorithms  and key lengths); mobile security (enterprise  telework, remote access and bring-your-own  device (BYOD), mobile device security – cloud  and hybrid builds): application whitelisting; cyber  threat sharing; cybersecurity event recovery; data- centric system threat modeling; de-identifying  government datasets; asset management –  financial services; guidelines for checklist users  and developers; networks of “things”; personal  identification verification (PIV); protecting  Controlled Unclassified Information within  nonfederal information systems and organizations;  securing Apple Operating System (OS) X; security  content automation protocol (SCAP); systems  engineering; trustworthy email; and virtual  machine (VM) protection.  •  Thirty-one NIST Interagency/Internal Reports  (NISTIR) (18 approved as final and 13 drafts)  were issued on a variety of topics, including:  Cryptography (post-quantum cryptography,  lightweight cryptography, NIST cryptographic  standards and guidelines development process);  mobile security (mobile devices, infrastructure  and platforms); attribute metadata; automation  support for security control assessments;  catalyzing the identity ecosystem; de-identification  of personal information; Long-Term Evolution  (LTE) architecture overview and security analysis;  PIV; policy machine (access control framework);  public safety mobile applications; SCAP; security  of interactive and automated access management  using Secure Shell (SSH); software identification  (SWID) tags; strategic U.S. Government  engagement in international standardization;  trusted geolocation in the cloud; and vulnerability  description ontology (VDO).  • T he National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) moved into a new permanent facility:  This facility was made possible by the state of  Maryland and Montgomery County, Maryland,  and has almost 60,000 square feet of modern  physical space and IT systems. The new facility  expanded the Center’s workspace from four  to twenty-two separate, flexible laboratories— including two larger areas capable of safely  housing large equipment (including a vehicle that  will be used in an upcoming project on auto- related cybersecurity issues). This additional  space allows NCCoE to increase its collaboration  and to undertake new projects.  •  The Strategic Plan for the National Initiative for  Cybersecurity Education (NICE) was issued:  With a mission of energizing and promoting a  robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity  education, training, and workforce development,  this plan lays out important goals for the  cybersecurity workforce. (See:  http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/about/strategicplan. html)  •  A draft Cybersecurity Framework profile for  manufacturers was developed and issued:  This profile can be used as a roadmap for reducing  cybersecurity risk for manufacturers and is aligned  with manufacturing sector goals and industry best  practices.

(See:  https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/ baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative)  •  Continued to research, evaluate and develop  standards for Post-Quantum Cryptography  (PQC):  NIST announced a Call for Proposals to solicit,  evaluate, and standardize quantum-resistant  public key cryptography (a.k.a. post-quantum  cryptography (PQC)) algorithms through a Federal  Register Notice (FRN). The team solicited public  comments regarding requirements and evaluation  criteria, which were subsequently finalized. NIST  plans to spend three to five years analyzing the  submitted algorithms before selecting algorithms  for standardization, during which time NIST will  engage with the research community through  conferences and workshops.  •  Initiated a lightweight cryptography project  to study the performance of the current  NIST-approved cryptographic standards on  constrained devices:  To better understand the need for dedicated  lightweight cryptography, ITL has created a  portfolio of lightweight primitives through an  open process. ITL will evaluate and recommend  algorithms based on profiles, which consist of a set  of design goals, physical characteristics of target  devices, performance characteristics imposed by  the applications, and security characteristics.  •  Continued to develop expertise in several critical  research areas in cryptography:  ITL continues to conduct research into post- quantum cryptography (PQC), quantum  algorithms, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC),  privacy-enhancing cryptography, and lightweight  cryptographic schemes for constrained  environments.  •  A NIST/Industry joint working group was created  to study the automation of cryptographic  implementation testing:  After working with industry on the protocol  necessary to exchange cryptographic test data  in an automated fashion, the development of  the cryptographic algorithm testing service  to be hosted at NIST was begun, with the full  implementation expected to take approximately  one year. (See: http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ acvt)  •  Continued research and reporting results in  software testing:  In software testing, the oracle problem refers  to determining the expected output for a given  set of inputs. A determination of the expected  output normally requires human involvement or a  mathematical model of the specification. ITL has  developed an oracle-free software testing method  for which NIST filed a patent application. The test  settings for an input factor may represent ranges  of values (called equivalence classes) for which the  output is expected to remain unchanged.  •  Continued research and development of a new  conformance test tool for the ANSI/NIST-ITL  Machine Readable Table (MRT) Biometric Data  Formats:  A command-line interface was developed that  tests the MRTs themselves for conformance to  the specification, in addition to testing American  National Standards Institute (ANSI)/NIST-ITL  Transactions. An initial graphical user interface was  also developed to allow an easy-to-use software  suite for end users. National standard bodies  were encouraged to further the advancements of  biometric data interchange format standards.  •  Represented the NIST/NTIA PSCR (Public Safety  Communications Research Program), FirstNet  (the US First Responders’ Network Authority),  and Public Safety stakeholders in the 3GPP (Third  Generation Partnership Project):  The International Standards Organization,  which is developing the next-generation  telecommunications standard, LTE (Long Term  Evolution), is ensuring that features critical to Public  Safety are incorporated into the standards.  •  Continued refinement and support for the USG  Federal Identity Program:  In continued support of Homeland Security  Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal  Information Processing Standard 201-2 (FIPS 201- 2), the NIST Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Program updated and refined several supporting  documents.

C O N T A C T :  Mr. Salvatore Francomacaro  (301) 975-6414  salvatore.francomacaro@nist.gov  N e x t  G e n e r a t i o n  A c c e s s  C o n t r o l  S t a n d a r d s  ITL has continued the development of an advanced  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) framework called  the Policy Machine, which was designed to be in alignment  with an emerging ANSI/INCITS standard under the title of  “Next Generation Access Control” (NGAC).  The NIST Policy Machine research and development  effort has resulted in three ongoing national standards  projects in CS1 in the early stages of development. They  include:  •  Next Generation Access Control –Functional  Architecture (NGAC-FA). Project number INCITS  499-2013, was published in FY 2013 and is  currently under revision.  •  Next Generation Access Control – Generic  Operations & Abstract Data Structures (NGAC- GOADS). Serban Gavrila, ITL, is the editor. The  project is assigned project number 2195-D, and the  document was published during FY 2016.  •  Next Generation Access Control -Implementation  Requirements, Protocols and API Definitions  (NGAC-IRPADS). Project number 2193-D has been  assigned. This part will be published as a technical  report in FY 2018.

ISO/IEC 19790 specifies the  security requirements for a cryptographic module utilized  within a security system protecting sensitive information  in computer and telecommunication systems. These  efforts bring consistent testing of cryptographic modules  to the global community by providing ISO-equivalent  standards representing FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements  for Cryptographic Modules and Derived Test Requirements  [DTR] for FIPS 140-2, Security Requirements for  Cryptographic Modules. Mr. Randall Easter (CSD) continues  as the principal editor for these standards.  ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 Working Group (WG) 3 completed  and published revisions, followed with updated corrections,  of ISO/IEC 19790:2006 and ISO/IEC 24759:2008. The  revision of ISO/IEC 19790 was published on August 15, 2012.  The revision of ISO/IEC 24759 was published on January  31, 2014. Both ISO/IEC standards were also adopted by the  American National Standards Institute (ANSI) (see:  http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO  %2FIEC+19790%3A2012). The two ISO/IEC revisions were  developed with international support and the collaboration  of governments, industry and academia. Revised corrections  of both standards were published on December 15, 2015.  The revision of ISO/IEC 19790:2012 addresses new  security areas, such as defined software module boundaries,  degraded modes of operation, trusted channels, two- factor authentication, software security, mitigation of fault  induction and side-channel attacks, operational self-tests for  algorithms, and lifecycle assurance from design to end-of- life.  Figure 2: Cryptographic Module Testing – ISO Standards  is a chart of the ISO/IEC standards, as ex-plained above,  in which CSD has played a part during the development  process.

Mr. Easter was the editor of both standards.  International Standard ISO/IEC 17825 specifies the  non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics for determining  conformance to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790  for Security Levels 3 and 4. The test metrics are associated  with the security functions specified in ISO/IEC 19790.  Testing will be conducted at the defined boundary of the  cryptographic module and using Input/Output (I/O) available  at the defined boundary .  International Standard ISO/IEC 18367 describes  conformance testing methods for cryptographic algorithms  and security mechanisms. Conformance testing assures that  an implementation of a cryptographic algorithm or security  mechanism is correct whether implemented in hardware,  software or firmware. It also confirms that it runs correctly  in a specific operating environment. Testing may consist  of known-answer or Monte Carlo testing, or a combination  of test methods. Testing may be performed on the actual  implementation or modeled in a simulation environment.  The test methods used by testing laboratories to  test whether the cryptographic module conforms to the  requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790 and the test  metrics specified in this International Standard for each of  the associated security functions specified in ISO/IEC 19790  are specified in ISO/IEC 24759. The test approach employed  in this International Standard is an efficient “push-button”  approach: the tests are technically sound, repeatable and  have moderate costs.  ITL is also the principal editor or co-editor of other ISO/ IEC documents. ITL’s contributions to the development of  these international standards create a strong foundation  for the adoption of and migration from currently used  national standards. In particular, this adoption will promote  international harmonization for the implementation and  testing of cryptographic algorithms and modules, while  accommodating individual country preferences in the choice  of approved security functions.

GICS enables Personal Identity  Verification (PIV), PIV-Interoperable (PIV-I) and Common  Access Card (CAC) applications, and others, to be built from  a single platform. GICS defines an open platform where  identity applications can be instantiated, deployed, and used  in an interoperable way between the credential issuers and  credential users that aligns with the last revision of the NIST  SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification,  (PIV) specifications.  During FY 2017, ITL staff plans to:  •  Contribute to the publication of several revisions of  the ISO/IEC 7816 family of standards (Identification  cards - Integrated circuit cards), which are all  relevant to FIPS 201, Personal Identity Verification  (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors,  specifications;  •  Pursue the standardization and harmonization of  identity standards developed in the U.S.;  •  Develop requirements and identify standards gaps  for Mobile Driving Licenses;  •  Enhance the Machine-Readable Travel Documents  (ePassport) data model to address privacy and  security concerns; and  •  Contribute to the development of privacy- enhanced security protocols.  ITL staff will continue to actively support relevant ID  management standard initiatives, such as ISO/IEC 19286,  Integrated circuit card (ICC) Privacy-enhancing protocols  and services, and ISO/IEC 18328, ICC managed devices.  Web Authentication/FIDO: ITL participates in the  development of online authentication specifications.  These specifications are developed by the Fast Identities  Online (FIDO) alliance, which is a consortium of private  organizations. ITL also participates in the development of  similar specifications (called WebAuthn) for web browsers  that are being developed by the W3C consortium. Both the  FIDO and WebAuthn specifications enable relying parties to  create cryptographic tokens on the end-user’s device and  subsequently use this cryptographic token to authenticate  the end user. These specifications provide multi-factor  authentication directives, and they are designed to mitigate  common threat vectors for Internet communications, such  as phishing, man-in-the-middle, and replay attacks.  ePassport: ITL participates in the development of an  ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 7501) for electronic Passports.  Specifically, ITL is contributing to the development of  passport data structure and its access control. ITL reviews  and comments on authentication protocols that are  developed to ensure strong user authentication and to  protect personally identifiable passport data.  Mobile Driver License: ITL is also participating in the  development of an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 18013) for an  International Mobile Driver License (DL). During 2016, ITL  gathered and discussed functional and security requirements  for Mobile DLs. ITL is now developing two models for the  Mobile DLs, namely, offline and online models. Once these  models are correctly defined, ITL plans to write technical  specification for each model.

Where standards are needed, ITL works closely with U.S.  industry, standards developers, other government agencies,  and leaders in the global standards community to develop  standards that will support secure cloud computing.  This standardization effort supports federal agencies in  adopting and implementing cloud computing infrastructures.  This standard work includes standards development within  the voluntary, consensus-based standards ecosystem and  the development of NIST standards and guidelines for  federal agencies, as required by government mandates.  The ITL staff participates in developing standards for many  aspects of cloud computing. ITL participation helps to  ensure the alignment of NIST standards with those of ISO/ IEC sub-committees, such as SC 27, SC 38 and their U.S.  counterparts, ANSI/INCITS CS1 and Cloud 38.

This EO directed NIST to work with  stakeholders to develop a voluntary framework—based on  existing standards, guidelines, and practices—for reducing  cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructures.  The Cybersecurity Framework that was developed  provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based,  and cost-effective approach to help critical infrastructure  owners and operators—as well as other interested entities— to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity-related risk,  while protecting business confidentiality, individual privacy,  and civil liberties.  In FY 2016, ITL continued to work with a diverse  stakeholder community to support the use and understanding  of the Cybersecurity Framework. This process included:  •  Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) to formally  gather stakeholder input about Framework  use, evolution, and future governance of the  Framework;  •  Conducting a public workshop at NIST in  Gaithersburg, MD to gather input about the current  use of the Framework and the need for an update  to the Framework as well as future governance of  the Framework;  •  Releasing the draft Baldrige Cybersecurity  Excellence Builder, a self-assessment tool to help  organizations better understand the effectiveness  of their cybersecurity risk management efforts;  •  Coordinating with critical infrastructure owners  and operators, regulators, and other industry  organizations through a variety of meetings and  industry events to ensure the understanding and  use of the Framework;  •  Analyzing various industry work products  (such as mapping documents) for Framework  correctness;  •  Consulting with state and local governments,  and the governments of other nations regarding  their alignment with both the principles and the  cybersecurity outcomes of the Framework;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Since the release of the Framework, NIST’s primary  goal has been to raise awareness of the Framework, and  encourage its use as a tool to help industry sectors and  organizations manage cybersecurity risks.  In FY 2017, ITL will continue to conduct stakeholder  outreach and will work collaboratively to further understand  stakeholder needs regarding tools and resources to enable  more effective use of the Framework. Additionally, in early  2017, NIST will publish a minor update to the Framework  and will minimize any disruption to current Framework  users by focusing on clarification and refinement. NIST will  also publish guidance on how Federal agencies can use  the Cybersecurity Framework, particularly illustrating how  the Risk Management Framework (Special Publication (SP)  800-37 Revision 1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems: A Security  Life Cycle Approach) and Cybersecurity Framework can  work together to help agencies develop, implement, and  continuously improve their information security programs.

During FY 2016, the ITL FISMA Implementation project  continued to strengthen collaboration through the Joint Task  Force (JTF) Transformation Initiative, which includes the  Department of Defense (DOD), the Intelligence Community  (IC), and the Committee on National Security Systems  (CNSS), and various federal agencies. The JTF partners  continue to develop and update key cybersecurity guidelines  for protecting federal information and information systems  as part of the Unified Information Security Framework.  Previously, the JTF developed common security guidance  in the critical areas of security controls for information  systems and organizations, security assessment procedures  to demonstrate security control effectiveness, security  authorizations for risk acceptance decisions, and continuous  monitoring activities to ensure that decision makers receive  the most up-to-date information on the security state of  their information systems. In addition, ITL worked with  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop  guidelines for automation support for security control  assessments on a security capability basis and in accordance  with the NIST RMF.  In FY 2016, the ITL FISMA Team worked on the following  initiatives:  •  System Security Engineering Initiative: The  final public draft of SP 800-160, Systems Security  Engineering: Considerations for a Multidisciplinary  Approach in the Engineering of Trustworthy  Secure Systems, was published to address the  engineering-driven actions necessary to develop  more defensible and survivable systems—including  the components that compose and the services  that depend on those systems. To ensure that  the publication provides the utmost clarity and  focus for our customers, several of the supporting  appendices from the second public draft are being  recast into their own publications. SP 800-160  will become the flagship publication for the NIST  Systems Security Engineering Initiative. NIST  publications specifically addressing several key  systems security engineering considerations (i.e.,  resilience, software assurance, and hardware  assurance) will be developed and published,  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p s : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Additionally, the interaction of  the NIST RMF with the life cycle processes in SP  800-160, will be described in future updates to  existing RMF standards and guidelines.  •  Risk Management Guidelines: Work began on SP  800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls  for Systems and Organizations, with a pre-draft call  for comments, adjudication of those comments,  and coordination with our JTF partners. SP  800-53 provides organizations with the security  and privacy controls necessary to appropriately  strengthen their systems and the environments  in which those systems operate, and provides a  process for selecting the appropriate controls,  which contributes to systems that are resilient in  the face of attacks and other threats and protect  an individual’s privacy. The implementation of SP  800-53, SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal Information  Systems, and SP 800-137, Information Security  Continuous Monitoring for Federal Information  Systems and Organizations, provides organizations  with near real-time information that is essential for  senior leaders making ongoing risk-based decisions  affecting their critical missions and business  functions.  •  FISMA Outreach Activity to Public and Private- Sector Organizations: Cybersecurity outreach  briefings were conducted and support was  provided to all levels of private-sector organizations  and government (including federal, state and local  entities) on multiple information security topics of  interest. These included, for example, an effective  implementation of the NIST RMF, contingency  planning, interconnection security agreements,  security-focused configuration management,  and information security for small businesses.  In addition, the ITL FISMA Team responded to  hundreds of inquiries from customers, served on  cybersecurity advisory panels, and conducted  outreach activities with academic institutions,  providing information on NIST’s security standards  and guidelines, and exploring new areas of  cybersecurity research and development.  •  Collaboration with JTF partners and other  federal organizations: The FISMA Team worked  closely with JTF partners to ensure that the five  JTF publications remain current, and to designate  additional special publications as JTF guidance.  The five JTF publications are:  1. SP 800-30, Guide for Conducting Risk  Assessments;  2. SP 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk  Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems: a Security Life Cycle  Approach;  3. SP 800-39, Managing Information  Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and  Information System View;  4. SP 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls  for Federal Information Systems and  Organizations; and  5. SP 800-53A, Assessing Security and  Privacy Controls in Federal Information  Systems and Organizations: Building  Effective Assessment Plans.  The FISMA Team also collaborated with DOD, the IC, DHS,  the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA),  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),  the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB), the General Services  Administration (GSA), the Small Business Administration  (SBA), and the Inspectors General (IGs) on multiple projects  to ensure consistency with FISMA-related guidance and to  protect information in a way that is commensurate with  risk. In addition, the FISMA Team served as co-chairs on the  Committee on National Security Systems working groups.  In FY 2016, the FISMA Team completed the following  activities:  •  Published the final public draft of SP 800-160,  Systems Security Engineering: Considerations for  a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Engineering of  Trustworthy Secure Systems;  •  Started the development of SP 800-53, Revision  5, Security and Privacy Controls for Systems and  Organizations;  •  Published the Initial Public Draft (IPD) of  SP 800-171 Revision 1, Protecting Controlled  Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information  Systems and Organizations, to provide guidance  to federal agencies for the protection of  Controlled Unclassified Information when such  information is resident in nonfederal systems and  organizations;  •  Published the IPDs of NISTIR 8011, Automation  Support for Ongoing Assessments, Volume  1 - Overview, and Volume 2 - Hardware Asset  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p s : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Much of this  research pertains to the trustworthiness of these information  technologies and the systems in which they are incorporated.  Given concerns about how information technologies may  affect privacy at individual and societal levels, the ITL Privacy  Engineering Program (PEP) supports the development of  trustworthy information systems by applying measurement  science and system engineering principles to the creation of  frameworks, risk models, guidance, tools, and standards that  protect privacy, and by extension, civil liberties. The PEP also  seeks to promote NIST and ITL leadership in privacy research  and privacy-enhancing technologies.  The PEP was formally established as a program in FY  2016 as part of ACD. In 2014, the PEP team initiated research  with two workshops to explore the foundations of privacy  engineering and risk management and published a draft  of NISTIR 8062, An Introduction to Privacy Engineering  and Risk Management in Federal Systems, in May 2015 to  introduce a novel set of privacy engineering objectives and a  privacy risk assessment framework (see http://nvlpubs.nist. gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8062.pdf).  In FY 2016, the PEP focused resources in the following  areas: developing a near-term strategic plan, finalizing  NISTIR 8062, and coordinating with other NIST programs  and research efforts to address and integrate privacy.  The strategic plan is organized around the basic goals of  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Advancement of Privacy Engineering and Risk  Management  To further the development of processes for privacy  engineering and risk management (and inform its finalization  of NISTIR 8062), the PEP team conducted outreach with  stakeholders, researched privacy assessment and risk  mitigation methods, and supported the use of its Privacy Risk  Assessment Methodology (PRAM) inside and outside the  Federal Government. The PEP team also worked extensively  with OMB on the revision of Circular A-130, which lays out  new requirements for federal agencies to address privacy risk  in their information systems to ensure that the Circular and  the PEP were in alignment on privacy risk management.  As a result of these efforts, the PEP team has revised  NISTIR 8062 to more clearly introduce the concepts of  privacy engineering and risk management, clarify the  rationale for the introduction of a set of privacy engineering  objectives and a risk model, and include a roadmap for the  development of comprehensive privacy risk management  guidance for federal agencies that parallels NIST guidance  for information security.  The PEP also co-hosted a workshop in September 2016  with the Department of Transportation to gather input on  changes to the privacy controls in Appendix J of NIST SP  800-53, which is undergoing its fifth revision. The workshop  initiated the first stage of executing the guidance roadmap  that the PEP will continue in FY 2017.  Coordination with Other NIST Programs  An important role for the PEP is a collaboration and  coordination with other NIST programs and research efforts  to better integrate privacy in the pursuit of more trustworthy  systems.  Of particular note, the PEP put its preliminary concepts  into practice with the PRAM, a set of worksheets that take an  organization through a privacy risk assessment of its systems.  Working with the ITL Trusted Identities Group (TIG), the PEP  team supports the TIG grant awardees’ use of the PRAM  to evaluate privacy risks and develop mitigating controls in  their pilots. The PEP team also used the PRAM for privacy  evaluations of information systems in partnership with federal  agencies, including DHS and GSA. The lessons learned from  these PRAM evaluations have been critical to the PEP team’s  understanding of the practical aspects of applying privacy  risk management concepts in system development.  The program also collaborated on many other projects,  including a partnership PEP with TIG on a building block  at the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE) to use the new privacy engineering objectives (see  https://nccoe.nist.gov/sites/default/files/library/project- descriptions/privacy-enhanced-identity-brokers-project- description-draft.pdf). There was also collaboration with  CSD and NIST’s Engineering Laboratory (EL) on the big data  and cyber-physical systems frameworks and related efforts,  and with ITL’s Information Access Division (IAD) to support  a successful Build-the-Future proposal on de-identification,  a process used to prevent a person’s identity from being  associated with information.  Figure 3: Collaboration Between PEP and Other NIST  Programs in FY 2016 illustrates a number of projects from the  programs described above that PEP collaborated on in FY  2016. These projects can be categorized as applied privacy  projects or guidance and frameworks.  NIST Leadership in Privacy  The program worked across public and private-sector  organizations to advance NIST’s role in privacy. The PEP  team participated in the Internet Policy Task Force’s Privacy  Working Group (see https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/ internet-policy-task-force) and now hold leadership  positions in the Federal Privacy Council (established by  Executive Order in FY 2016), and the Networking and  Information Technology Research and Development  (NITRD) Program’s Privacy Research Interagency Working  Group, whose work included drafting the National Privacy  Research Strategy (see https://www.nitrd.gov/cybersecurity/ nationalprivacyresearchstrategy.aspx), the Identity  Ecosystem Steering Group, and the Fast Identity Online  Alliance.  The PEP team presented its research at major  conferences, including the RSA Conference, the International  Association of Privacy Professionals Global Summit and  Privacy Academy, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics  Engineers International Workshop on Privacy Engineering,  the Privacy + Security Forum, the TRUSTe Privacy Risk  Summit, and the Computing Community Consortium’s  Privacy by Design Workshop, among others.  The PEP team contributed to ongoing standards and  framework development efforts in various organizations,  including the Identity Ecosystem Steering Group, the Fast  Identity Online Alliance, and the ISO.  In FY 2017, the PEP will publish the final version of  NISTIR 8062, slated to be released in January 2017 (see  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8062. pdf).

The program will continue to collaborate with other NIST  programs as they seek to address privacy challenges and will  work with stakeholders to promote privacy engineering and  risk management practices. The PEP team will also continue  to seek leadership opportunities in public and private- sector organizations to position NIST on the leading edge  of privacy research. Finally, The PEP will explore new areas  for privacy research that have broad-based application and  support federal agency mission-critical needs in managing  privacy risk.

C y b e r  S u p p l y  C h a i n  R i s k  M a n a g e m e n t  ( S C R M )  Information and Communications Technology (ICT)  relies on a complex, globally distributed, and interconnected  supply chain ecosystem to provide highly refined, cost- effective, and reusable solutions. This ecosystem is composed  of various entities with multiple tiers of outsourcing, diverse  distribution routes, assorted technologies, laws, policies,  procedures, and practices, all of which interact to design,  manufacture, distribute, deploy, use, maintain, and manage  ICT products and services.  The factors that allow for low-cost, interoperability,  rapid innovation, a variety of product features, and other  benefits, also increase the risk of a compromise to the ICT  supply chain, which may result in risks to the end user.  These ICT supply chain risks may include an insertion of  counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, and  the insertion of malicious software and hardware as well as  poor manufacturing and development practices in the ICT  supply chain.  Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is the  process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks  associated with the distributed and interconnected nature  of ICT product and service supply chains. It covers the  Figure 3: Collaboration Between PEP and Other NIST Programs in FY 2016  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In FY 2016, ITL continued to research the state of Cyber  SCRM in both the public and private sectors, related standards  and initiatives, effective practices, and metrics. ITL partnered  with a team composed of representatives from the Federal  Government (GSA and DHS), the insurance industry (Zurich  and Beecher Carlson) and academia (the University of  Maryland) to begin fundamental research and build the tools  necessary to measure and assess the actual effectiveness  of cybersecurity strategies and controls. The effort will use  voluntary, secure and anonymized risk assessments based  on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to begin developing  a large-scale anonymized data set that will, for the first time,  demonstrate cause and effect relationships between cyber  supply chain capability levels and organizational performance  outcomes over time.  Also in FY 2016, ITL co-chaired, with the Department of  Defense, the primary interagency working group on cyber  SCRM to revise CNSS Directive (CNSSD) No. 505, Supply  Chain Risk Management, which assigns responsibilities  and establishes minimum criteria for the development and  deployment of capabilities for SCRM of National Security  Systems. ITL also co-chaired the Software and Supply Chain  Assurance (SSCA) Forum and Working Groups, the purpose  of which is to bring together a stakeholder community of  government, industry, and academic experts in this field.  Meetings are held quarterly and cover a variety of subjects of  interest to attendees.  In April 2016, ITL held a workshop regarding an update  to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). During the  workshop, information was gathered in a breakout session  regarding attendees’ views about improving how SCRM is  covered in the CSF. Several ideas were proposed, and NIST  plans to incorporate the feedback into an updated version  of the CSF.  In May 2016, ITL hosted a forum event led by the Institute  for Defense Analyses (IDA) about their Trustworthy Supplier  Framework (TSF), a prototype toolbox that maps various  existing standards and practices to the controls provided in  NIST SP 800-161, Supply Chain Risk Management Practices  for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The TSF  is intended to increase the utility of existing standards to  buyers and program managers making supplier selections,  while simultaneously allowing suppliers flexibility in  meeting procurement requirements. The forum provided an  opportunity for ITL to understand the needs of stakeholders  in this arena. The information will be used by IDA in their  further development of the Trustworthy Supplier Framework  and by ITL in future updates to SP 800-161 and other related  publications.  In FY 2017, ITL will continue to collaborate with  stakeholders in government, industry, and academia to  conduct research, produce needed standards and guidance,  and seek opportunities to create greater awareness across all  sectors and types and sizes of organizations. ITL will:  •  Conduct research and draft guidance on how  organizations identify critical systems and  components that need additional protections;  •  Conduct research on applicable metrics and  measures useful to cyber supply chain risk  management;  •  Conduct an effectiveness study with the goal of  demonstrating cause-and-effect relationships  between cyber supply chain capability levels  and organizational performance outcomes over  time;  •  Continue to co-chair the interagency working group  on cyber supply chain risk management, and also  to co-chair and sponsor the Software and Supply  Chain Assurance Forum;  •  Continue to engage stakeholders in identifying  opportunities to create greater awareness about  cyber supply chain risks and available standards,  practices, guidance and related tools; and  •  Continue to engage stakeholders in identifying  opportunities and needs for providing additional  guidance regarding identifying and implementing  supply chain protections.

These test tools are  developed to promote the adoption of these standards  and to support users, product developers, and testing labs  that require conformance to selected biometric standards.  ITL contributes to the development of biometric standards  and participates in the INCITS Technical Committee M1  – Biometrics and related subcommittees and in ISO/IEC  Joint Technical Committee (JTC) 1 Subcommittee (SC) 37 –  Biometrics standards bodies. ITL plans to continue this work  in FY 2017.  In FY 2016, the BioCTS team released refined  versions of existing software and researched the use of  machine-readable data to accelerate conformance test  development and increase support for profiles and user- defined requirements.  There were two updates to the BioCTS for ANSI/ NIST-ITL (AN) software suite in FY 2016. These updates were  primarily focused on enhancing the underlying codebase,  increasing performance, and adding more user-friendly  features. The testing architecture has been updated to be  more maintainable and more robust. The update represents  a complete overhaul of the BioCTS for AN’s initial release  in 2012. A list of changes made to BioCTS for AN can be  found in the Changelog (see https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ Biometric-Conformance-Test-Software).  In addition to updates to BioCTS software, the  team released an updated ANSI/NIST-ITL Data Extractor,  illustrated in Figure 4: ANSI/NIST-ITL Extractor Software  which shows the internal data records within an ANSI/NIST- ITL file. The Data Extractor allows data (images, text, etc.)  to be saved from an ANSI/NIST-ITL formatted file, as well  as providing a high-level overview of the file and its internal  structure.  Figure 4: ANSI/NIST-ITL Extractor Software  The BioCTS team researched the new Machine Readable  Tables (MRTs) for the ANSI/NIST-ITL Biometric Standard  (AN-MRTs) to determine their suitability for integration into  conformance testing efforts. The AN-MRTs encode many  of the human-readable requirements specified in the base  ANSI/NIST-ITL Biometric Standard (and related profiles,  such as Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Electronic  Biometric Transmission Specification (EBTS)) in a manner  that can be parsed and understood by software. The BioCTS  team developed software capable of parsing and testing  these tables to ensure a valid MRT format using MRT Schema  documents and MRT element definitions. The results of our  tests were documented and provided to the authors of  the AN-MRTs for incorporation into future versions of the  tables for the benefit of all MRT users. The software used  to develop these results may be released in the future as  a standalone tool for validating and analyzing AN-MRT  files. The new BioCTS software will use the AN-MRTs as an  external resource. This will allow updates to be made to the  MRTs to incorporate the latest conformance requirements,  correct errors, or conduct experiments without releasing an  updated version of BioCTS itself.  An initial version of this software began development in  FY 2016, and this effort is expected to continue in FY 2017.

Specifically, ITL supports the  effort by providing cybersecurity and privacy expertise to  address CPS-specific cybersecurity and privacy challenges.  Such challenges are related to emerging technical areas, such  as personalized health care, emergency response, traffic-flow  management, and electric power generation and delivery.  Other phrases that are often referenced along with CPS  technologies include:  • Internet of Things (IoT);  • Industrial Internet;  • Smart Cities;  • Smart Grid; and  •  “Smart” Anything (e.g., Cars, Buildings, Homes,  Manufacturing, Hospitals, Appliances)  (see http://www.nist.gov/cps/).  CPS aims for increased efficiency and interaction  between the digital and physical worlds. Ensuring that these  emerging and evolving systems are reliable, trustworthy,  secure, and that they protect the privacy of information poses  a unique cybersecurity challenge. Other challenges of CPS  include the need for an integration with legacy components  and allowance for emerging technologies as well as real- time response in support of extremely high availability,  predictability, and reliability.  Cybersecurity and privacy considerations are critical to  the safe and resilient design, development, and operation  of CPS. Addressing both the opportunities and challenges  of CPS requires a broad collaboration to develop a common  foundation, including a consensus definition, vocabulary,  reference architecture, and a shared understanding of  the essential roles of timing, cybersecurity, and data  interoperability. ITL is researching the cybersecurity and  privacy needs of the broader landscape of CPS by applying  their subject-matter expertise in cybersecurity and privacy  to various instances of CPS. These instances may include  industrial control systems, the smart grid, hardware-enabled  security, and embedded systems, to name a few.  In FY 2016, ITL provided leadership for the Cybersecurity  and Privacy subgroup of the CPS Public Working Group  (PWG)—which focused on identifying strategies for  cybersecurity and privacy in CPS as well as working  collaboratively with the other subgroups to ensure the  inclusion of cybersecurity as a design principle during the  development processes.  After publishing a Draft Framework for CPS in  September 2015—which compiled the work of the five PWG  technical subgroups—the CPS PWG published version 1.0  of the Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems in May 2016.  The document is the culmination of several years’ work by  the CPS PWG, which includes several hundred members  drawn primarily from industry, academia, and government.  As a follow-on to the Framework’s release, in August 2016,  ITL, in collaboration with NIST’s Engineering Lab, hosted the  Trustworthiness Launch Workshop at NIST in Gaithersburg,  MD. A key goal for the workshop was to promote interaction  around integrated goals for trustworthy cyber-physical  systems to lay the foundation for future trustworthiness in  science.  In July 2016, ITL published NIST SP 800-183, Networks  of ‘Things’, which offers an underlying and foundational  understanding of IoT by exploring the components that  belong to most distributed systems. In FY 2017, foundational  and applied research will be conducted in the areas of CPS  and IoT. ITL will also continue to participate in the International  Society of Automation (ISA) 99 Committee, which develops  and establishes standards, recommended practices, technical  reports, and related information that define procedures for  implementing electronically secure industrial automation  and control systems and security practices.

ITL,  in collaboration with NIST’s Engineering Laboratory, is  developing and implementing guidance aimed at effectively  securing ICS—initially focusing on Smart Manufacturing  Environments. Utilizing a cybersecurity performance test  bed for ICS, NIST will measure the performance of these  systems when instrumented with cybersecurity protections,  in accordance with the best practices and requirements  prescribed by national and international standards and  guidelines. Examples of such standards and guidelines  include ISA/IEC-62443, Industrial Automation and Control  Systems (IACS) Security, and NIST SP 800-82, Revision 2,  Guide to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security.  Industrial control systems are an essential component  in manufacturing environments; increasing reliance on  technology, communication, and the interconnectivity of ICS  and IT has expanded the number of potential vulnerabilities  and increased the potential risk to manufacturing operations.  While these manufacturing systems become ‘smarter’ and  increasingly connected (providing a tremendous increase  of value and efficiency), they also present a new challenge  regarding how cybersecurity can be effectively applied to  the connected domain.  The ICS team has utilized existing standards, in  conjunction with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,  to develop a target Profile for applying cybersecurity  protections within manufacturing environments. The  development of this profile helps establish a roadmap for  reducing cybersecurity risk for manufacturers in a way that  is aligned with manufacturing-sector goals and industry best  practices. The profile also tailors the existing cybersecurity  control language to account for unique requirements in  these operational environments.  In FY 2016, leading a session during the 2016  Cybersecurity Framework Workshop, the team solicited  feedback from industry partners to help advance the  development of the profile. The draft Cybersecurity  Framework Manufacturing Profile was published as a  whitepaper that solicited comments from the public. The  Profile focuses on desired cybersecurity outcomes and can  be used as a roadmap to identify opportunities for improving  the current cybersecurity posture of a manufacturing system.  In FY 2017, NIST will continue its research in the  ICS domain to include incorporating feedback and  finalizing the Manufacturing Profile, implementing the  defined cybersecurity protections onto the cybersecurity  performance test bed, and measuring and understanding  the performance impacts of implemented cybersecurity  protections.

HAVA established the Election  Assistance Commission (EAC) and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee (TGDC), chaired by the Director of  NIST. HAVA directs NIST to provide technical support to the  EAC and TGDC in efforts related to human factors, security,  and laboratory accreditation. Voting security team members  from ITL conduct research and develop guidelines and best  practices for voting system security.  The primary objective of NIST’s work is to support the  development of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines  (VVSG), a broad set of equipment guidelines used by the  EAC to certify voting systems. The current version of these  guidelines is VVSG 1.1, which was approved by the EAC in  March 2015. Initial efforts on the next revision of the VVSG  have already begun. Beginning in 2015, NIST established  public working groups to gather input and conduct the  collaborative research necessary for the development of  further guidelines/standards. These working groups consist  of three election groups and four technology groups focused  on human factors, cybersecurity, interoperability, and  testing. The overall goal of the working groups is to lay the  groundwork for a revision of the VVSG, as many jurisdictions  are facing the need for a technology refresh since many  voting systems are more than ten years old.  In the months leading up to the November 2016 election,  NIST engaged with DHS, EAC, and the Department of  Justice (DOJ) to help states better identify and manage their  cybersecurity risks to election systems and voting systems  for the upcoming election. This group ensured that election  officials were aware of existing resources that are available to  help them (including the guidelines and best practices that  exist for voting and other IT systems, cyber hygiene scanning  services by DHS, and threat and vulnerability bulletins).  In FY 2017, the voting working group will focus its  efforts on the next revision of the VVSG. Based on feedback  from the TGDC and election officials around the country,  the new revision is expected to address new technologies  and election use cases that have become commonplace in  election systems. Additionally, the cybersecurity group plans  to investigate security considerations and develop guidance  in the areas of voter registration, electronic pollbooks, blank  ballot delivery, ballot marking, auditing, and election-night  reporting.

To achieve fewer vulnerabilities,  it is essential to know what kinds of vulnerabilities and  weaknesses there are and to know how to find them so  they can be fixed. The Software Assurance Metrics and Tool  Evaluation (SAMATE) program has two primary components:  the Static Analysis Reference Dataset (SARD) and the Static  Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE). In FY 2016, NIST produced  a report on Dramatically Reducing Software Vulnerabilities  and a workshop report on Software Measure and Metrics to  Reduce Security Vulnerabilities.  •  The purpose of SARD is to provide users,  researchers, and software security assurance tool  developers with a set of computer programs with  known security flaws. This allows end users to  evaluate tools and tool developers to test their  methods. The set includes “wild” (production),  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The SARD also contains real software  applications with known bugs and vulnerabilities.  The set is intended to encompass a wide variety  of possible vulnerabilities, languages, platforms,  and compilers. The SARD is a large-scale effort,  gathering test cases from many contributors. ITL  has more information about the SARD, including  goals, structure, test suite selection, etc. at https:// samate.nist.gov/index.php/SARD.html. In FY 2016,  the SARD was increased by approximately 40,000  PHP (PHP is a server-side scripting language  designed primarily for web development but  also used as a general-purpose programming  language) and over 30,000 C# test cases (C# is a  new programming language designed for building  a wide range of enterprise applications that run on  the .NET Framework).  •  SATE is designed to advance research (based  on large test sets) in, and improvement of, static  analysis tools that find security-relevant defects  in source code. Participating toolmakers run their  tools on a set of programs. Researchers, led by  NIST, analyze the tool reports. The results and  experiences are reported at a workshop. The tool  reports and analysis are made publicly available  at a later date. SATE’s purpose is NOT to evaluate  nor to choose the “best” tools. Rather, it is aimed  at exploring the following characteristics of tools:  relevance of warnings to security, their correctness,  and prioritization. SATE’s goals are:  o To enable empirical research based on  large test sets,  o To encourage the improvement of tools,  and  o To speed the adoption of tools by  objectively demonstrating their use on real  software.  There have been five SATEs since the program  began in 2008. The most recent exposition was  held in 2014. In FY 2016, planning commenced for  SATE VI.

Digital evidence can be a part of  investigating most crimes, since material relevant to the  crime may be recorded in digital form. Methods for securely  acquiring, storing and analyzing digital evidence quickly  and efficiently are critical. ITL promotes the efficient and  effective use of computer technology to investigate crimes.  The project team develops tools for testing computer  forensic software, including test criteria and test sets. ITL  also maintains the National Software Reference Library  – a vast archive of published software applications that is  an important resource for both criminal investigators and  historians.  National Software Reference Library  The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) is  designed to collect software from various sources and  incorporate file profiles computed from this software into  a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information. The RDS can  be used by law enforcement, government, and industry  organizations to review files on a computer by matching  file profiles in the RDS. This will help alleviate much of the  effort involved in determining which files are important as  evidence on computers or file systems that have been seized  as part of criminal investigations. The NSRL also provides a  research environment to promote the development of new  forensics techniques and other applications in computer  science.  In FY 2016, the NSRL published four releases of the RDS,  which continues to be the premier software resource. There  are currently 21,000 applications and 200,000,000 files.  The project team completed a project with the Stanford  University Library to preserve thousands of first-generation  computer packages. In FY 2017, the NSRL was expanded to  include mobile apps.

The goal  of the Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) project at  NIST is to establish a methodology for testing computer  forensic software tools by the development of general tool  specifications, test procedures, test criteria, test sets, and test  hardware. The project is intended to provide the information  necessary for toolmakers to improve tools, for users to make  informed choices about acquiring and using computer  forensics tools, and for interested parties to understand the  capabilities of the tools. A capability is required to ensure  that forensic software tools consistently produce accurate  and objective test results. The project team’s approach for  testing computer forensic tools is based on well-recognized  international methodologies for conformance testing and  quality testing.  In FY 2016, the CFTT project was expanded to allow  forensics testers to use the NIST testing methodology in  their own labs and to produce standardized test reports.  Currently, the project supports disk imaging testing and  will be expanded to support hard-disk write blocking and  mobile forensics in 2017. The CFTT project also maintains  the Forensics Tool Catalog and the Computer Forensics  Reference Dataset.

One portion  of this legislation calls for the  establishment of a nationwide,  interoperable public-safety  broadband network based on the  3rd Generation Partnership Project’s  (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE)  technology. The network will be  deployed and operated by the  First Responder Network Authority  (FirstNet). The planned Nationwide Public Safety Broadband  Network (NPSBN) will “create a much-needed nationwide  interoperable broadband network that will help police,  firefighters, emergency medical service professionals and  other public safety officials stay safe and do their jobs”  (see http://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/public-safety).  NIST is directed to establish a list of certified devices and  required components to be used by public safety officials,  vendors, and other interested parties for interacting with  the nationwide network. NIST is also directed to conduct  research and development that supports the acceleration  and advancement of the nationwide network.  In FY 2016, CSD, ACD, and the NCCoE supported the joint  National Telecommunications and Information Administration  (NTIA) and NIST Public Safety Communications Research  (PSCR) program with efforts in public-safety mobile- application security, identity management, data and  application isolation technologies, and enabling cybersecurity  capabilities on the PSCR 700 MHz LTE demonstration  network located in Boulder, Colorado (see http://www.pscr. gov). At PSCR’s Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder  Conference in June 2016, CSD and ACD organized and  moderated a panel called “Public Safety and Network Security  Enhancements,” led two breakout sessions on LTE Network  Security, and had a booth highlighting the cybersecurity- related efforts of PSCR.

In addition, CSD and ACD released draft  NISTIR 8136; Mobile Application Vetting Services for Public  Safety - an Informal Survey, for public comment.  CSD and ACD participated in the standards  development process for LTE technology within the 3rd  Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) supporting security  requirements for public safety that are related to Proximity  Services (ProSe), Group Communication System Enablers  (GCSE), and Mission Critical Push-to-Talk (MCPTT). In  addition, CSD and ACD broadened its scope within the  Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to include efforts  related to public safety.  In FY 2017, CSD and ACD will work to implement and  exercise cybersecurity capabilities in the PSCR 700 MHz  LTE demonstration network, conduct research into mobile  authentication solutions to support the different public- safety disciplines, and investigate mobile application- security services to support the security requirements  of public-safety mobile applications. CSD and ACD will  continue to engage the public-safety communications  community by organizing workshops and conferences and  participating in events such as the Association of Public- Safety Communications Officials (APCO) Annual Meeting,  PSRC’s Annual Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder  Conference, and the International Wireless Communications  Expo (IWCE).

The  infrastructure is used  to send command  information across the  electric grid from the generation systems to the distribution  systems, and to exchange usage and billing information  between utilities and their customers. The key to the  successful deployment of the smart grid infrastructure is  the development of a cybersecurity strategy that includes  cybersecurity as a design consideration for new and  emerging systems and an approach to adding cybersecurity  into existing systems. The electric grid is critical to the  economic and physical well-being of the nation, and  emerging cyber threats targeting power systems highlight  the need to integrate advanced security to protect critical  assets.  The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) became a  membership-supported organization in January 2013. The  SGIP Cybersecurity Working Group (CSWG) was renamed  the Smart Grid Cybersecurity Committee (SGCC), and  continues to be led by a NIST representative in support of  responsibilities identified in the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007. The SGCC chair is a voting member of  the SGIP Technical Committee and serves as an ex-officio  Director of the Board.

The researchers  concentrated on authenticating the provenance of multicast  data streams from emerging power system sensors called  Phasor Measurement Units. By authenticating the sensors to  the utility, the utility can trust that their sensor measurements  are coming from the correct sensors and have not been  hijacked.  Multicast authentication of sensor data is challenging,  due to the need for low-security overhead, tolerance  of lossy networks, time-criticality, and high data rates.  Researchers augmented an existing authentication scheme  to accommodate high-data-rate sensor transmissions  that are unbounded in length (meaning that there is no  session expiration). Using dual-offset key chains to reduce  authentication delay and the computational overhead  associated with key chain commitment, they developed a  new protocol called inf-TESLA that meets the performance  requirements imposed by the physical dynamics of the  power system. Significant effort was made to integrate their  authentication protocol into existing network simulation  software, specifically Optimized Network Engineering Tools  (OPNET), thus providing potential users with the ability to  evaluate the protocol on their own networks and for their  own applications.  Furthermore, in an effort to address the growing  interest in co-optimizing cyber and physical components  to work together as a system, NIST researchers developed  mathematical formalism to trade off the sensitivity of a  dynamic system to attack or perturbation against the  authentication overhead incurred by their protocol. This  formalism was demonstrated on a power system use case  showing the limiting considerations between authentication  overhead and stability margins of a wide-area damping  controller. The project continues to be a work-in-progress  and was presented and published at ICT Systems Security  and Privacy Protection Conference 2016 in Ghent, Belgium.  Timing has also become a cyber-physical security issue  with the onset of utilities detecting issues in receiving and  distributing time to enable distributed real-time measurement  and control. In particular, the concern of the threat of spoofing  and jamming has led to efforts in determining redundant  sources of traceable time. The first step is developing  monitoring and anomaly detection capabilities. The effort  included working with the North American Synchrophasor  Initiative (NASPI) Time Synchronization Task Force to begin  the effort in researching requirements and documenting  guidelines for industry to provide assured timing. One  alternative time distribution method to the Global Positioning  System (GPS) is the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol  (PTP)—a time synchronization protocol that is used for the  electric grid and other special-purpose industrial automation  and measurement networks. Discussions have begun with  the NIST Time and Frequency Division about experimental  designs to provide a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) scale  that would be maintained as a NIST (UTC(NIST)) PTP service  over a large geographical expanse.  In FY 2017, CSD will coordinate with NIST’s Engineering  Laboratory (EL) and Smart Grid Program Office on the  further development of a Cybersecurity Smart Grid Test  Lab—part of the NIST Smart Grid Testbed Facility now under  construction. CSD will also collaborate with the University  of New Hampshire and ITL’s Software and Systems Division  on cybersecurity research. The IEEE 1588 Security Working  Group is developing a new Annex to secure time distribution  through (a) PTP integrated authentication and integrity  verification, (b) external transport security mechanisms, (c)  architecture guidance, and (d) monitoring and management  guidance. The research will focus on developing a full security  scheme with emphasis on PTP integrated authentication  and integrity verification and monitoring/detection of the  network’s timing performance.

NICE is building on its current efforts based on its  Strategic Plan—delivered to Congress in April 2016 as  required by the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014— which was written with engagement and deliberation  among NICE partners. The three primary goals of the plan  are to: 1) accelerate learning and skills development, 2)  nurture a diverse learning community, and 3) guide career  development and workforce planning. NICE partners will  continue to develop appropriate implementation strategies  and metrics for this plan.  In FY 2016, the NICE team at NIST worked to set a solid  staffing foundation for future progress. They assembled  new internal team members that includes leads for  academic engagement, industry engagement, government  engagement, and a program manager. These, in combination  with the existing NICE Director and NICE Deputy Director,  completed the staffing needs for the NICE Program Office  at NIST.  Many NICE communication mechanisms were also  established in FY 2016. These include the NICE Public  Working Group (see https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied- cybersecurity/nice/about/working-group), the NICE  Quarterly eNewsletter (see https://www.nist.gov/news- events/news/search/enewsletter), and an increased  presence of NICE at cybersecurity education, training, and  workforce development events across the country.  Figure 6: The NICE Lead for Academic Engagement, Mrs.  Davina Pruitt-Mentle, speaking with an attendee at the  20th Annual Colloquium for Information Systems Securi- ty Education Conference in Philadelphia.  In addition to NICE’s continued coordination with  academic and industry partners, NICE also continued its  leadership in working with government partners on initiatives  such as the Cybersecurity National Action Plan, the Federal  Cybersecurity Workforce Strategy, and implementation of  the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act.  In FY 2016, NICE announced grant awards for five  Regional Alliances and Multi-stakeholder Partnerships to  Stimulate (RAMPS) cybersecurity education and workforce  development. The RAMPS grants will bring together K-12,  higher education, and local employers in regions across the  nation (see https://www.nist.gov/nice/regional-alliances- and-multistakeholder-partnerships-stimulate-ramps). NICE  also provided grant support for the 2015 NICE Conference  and Expo, the 2015 National K-12 Cybersecurity Education  Conference, the Center of Academic Excellence (CAE)  Community Meeting, the National Cybersecurity Summit,  the NICE Challenge Project, and the Cybersecurity Jobs  Heat Map.  In FY 2017, NICE plans to:  •  Support the 2016 NICE Conference on October 6-7,  2016;  •  Support the 2016 NICE Conference and Expo and  pre-conference seminars on October 31, 2016 –  November 2, 2016;  •  Launch a Cybersecurity Jobs Heat Map known as  “CyberSeek”;  •  Publish a draft of the NICE Cybersecurity  Workforce Framework; and  •  Provide a public webinar series (see  https://www.nist.gov/nice/webinars).

The CSRC website is home to many of the standards,  guidelines, and other technical series documents that are  valuable to the general public. The Publications Released  in FY 2016 section of this annual report provides additional  details. During FY 2016, CSRC had more than 6.2 million page  views and downloads.  The CSRC team maintains a publication announcement  mailing list with more than 73,630 subscribers from  government, industry, and academia—as well as individuals  with a personal interest in IT security worldwide. This free  email list notifies subscribers about publications that have  been posted to the CSRC website, along with announcing  new NIST-sponsored cybersecurity events and important  news and/or announcements.  During FY 2016, the CSRC was updated daily, providing  new information such as draft and final versions of technical  series documents (e.g., FIPS, SPs, NISTIRs and ITL Bulletins)  and updates to various program and project webpages.  The CSRC team has made progress on plans for a complete  redesign of the current CSRC website, including a content  management system (CMS). Updating CSRC with a CMS will  provide a user-friendly environment and experience. The  first phase of the project, the publications section; has been  completed. All technical and non-technical publications (e.g.,  white papers, conference papers, presentations) have been  successfully integrated into the new system.  The CSRC team has spent the last portion of FY 2016  migrating the content from the current website into the CMS,  and in FY 2017, a beta test site of the entire CSRC is expected  to be made available. The CSRC team plans to continue  testing the new website and to review feedback received,  with the plan for full transition to the updated site in FY 2017.

The Forum,  which serves more than 1,200 members, strives to provide  an ongoing opportunity for managers of federal information  security programs to exchange information security  materials in a timely manner, build upon the experiences of  other programs, and reduce possible duplication of effort.  It provides a mechanism for NIST to share information  directly with federal agency information security managers  in fulfillment of NIST’s leadership mandate (under FISMA). It  also assists NIST in establishing and maintaining relationships  with other individuals or organizations that are actively  addressing information security issues within the Federal  Government. During FY 2016, NIST’s Patricia Toth served as  the Chairperson, and ACD served as the Secretariat of the  Forum, with administrative and logistical support from NIST’s  Peggy Himes.  The Forum maintains an extensive email subscription  service. Participation in the service is restricted to those  Federal Government employees with a role in the management  of their organization’s information system security program.  The Forum conducts bi-monthly meetings and an annual  two-day conference for a discussion of current issues and  topics of interest to those responsible for protecting sensitive  (unclassified) federal systems. Events are open to federal  employees and their designated support contractors.  Topics of discussion at FCSM meetings in FY 2016 included  briefings on: software-aided security control selection, best  practices for privileged user personal identity verification,  the Cybersecurity Framework, the National Cybersecurity  Center of Excellence (NCCoE) - Federally Funded Research  and Development Center (FFRDC), an update on vetting  the security mobile applications, and the U.S. Government  Configuration Baselines (USGCB).  FY 2016’s annual two-day offsite was held at NIST  on August 16-17, 2016. Presentations included the current  technical, operational and management information systems  security topics and updates on the information system  security activities of OMB, GAO, National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA), NARA, Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), Census Bureau, DHS, and NIST. Most  presentations are available online (see http://csrc.nist.gov/ groups/SMA/forum/events.html).

FISSEA strives to elevate the  general level of information system security knowledge for  the Federal Government and the federal workforce. It also  seeks to assist the professional development of its members.  FISSEA membership is open to information system  security professionals, professional trainers and educators,  managers responsible for information system security  training programs in federal agencies, contractors of these  agencies, and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security training  and education. All that is required to become a FISSEA  member is a willingness to share products, information, and  experiences. A working group meets monthly to administer  business activities.  FISSEA communicates with its membership through a  website, a mailing list, and a social networking site. The ACD  staff assists FISSEA with its operations by providing staffing  support for several of its activities (and by acting as FISSEA’s  host agency).  The 29th Annual FISSEA Conference occurred March  15-16, 2016 at NIST, and the theme was “The Quest for the  Unhackable Human: The Power of Cybersecurity Awareness  and Training.” The 250+ attendees were made up of  managers (specifically those responsible for information  systems security awareness, training, certifications,  workforce identification, compliance, etc. in federal  agencies), contractors providing awareness and training  support, and faculty members of accredited educational  institutions who are involved in information security training  and education. The attendees learned about new techniques  for developing/conducting training, cost-effective practices,  workforce development, and free resources and contacts.  NIST’s Pat Toth, Peggy Himes, and members of the  FISSEA Technical Working Group were integral to the effort  to support the 2016 Annual Conference.

The attendees had an opportunity to visit vendors and  federal agencies on the second day to discuss their specific  awareness and training programs, and the Pecha Kucha fast- paced talks proved to be both entertaining and educational.  The FISSEA Educator of the Year Award is an annual  recognition to honor a contemporary individual who is  making special efforts to create, build, manage, or inspire  an information systems security awareness, training, or  education program. Susan Hansche (DHS) presented the  FISSEA 2016 Educator of the Year Award to Gretchen Morris  (DB Consulting Group/NASA). Gretchen’s vast knowledge- base, strong work ethic, her dedication to the improvement  of information security awareness and training, and her  commitment to coordinating the annual FISSEA Security  Contest made her the perfect recipient for the award.  Figure 7: Susan Hansche, DHS, presented the FISSEA 2015  Educator of the Year Award to Gretchen Morris, DB Con-  sulting/NASA on March 15, 2016.  Other traditional FISSEA conference events include  announcing the winners of the FISSEA Security Awareness,  Training & Education Contest, which includes six categories  from one of FISSEA’s three key areas: awareness, training,  and education. A winner is selected from each category  and awarded a certificate. The categories covered the topics  described below, including a new section this year related to  video-based training.  In FY 2016, awarded certificates were selected by an  impartial judging committee and included:  •  Poster Winner: K. Rudolph, John Ippolito, G. Mark  Hardy, Andrew Ellis, and Charles A. Filius, from  Native Intelligence, Inc. and friends;  •  Website Winner: Lisa Dorr, Sarah Moffat,  Toney Rogers, and Jennifer Kimberly from U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  Office of Information Security (OIS), Governance,  Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC) –  Governance Division;  •  Motivational Item Winner: K.

I n f o r m a t i o n  S e c u r i t y  a n d  P r i v a c y  A d v i s o r y  B o a r d  ( I S P A B )  The Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board  (ISPAB) was initiated in 1987 and has successfully renewed  its charter with proper authority every two years. The  legislative history for Public Law 100-235 and Public Law  107-347 underscores that Congress intended that the Board  should be a continuing body. The Board plays a central and  unique role in providing the government with expert advice  concerning information security and privacy issues that may  affect federal information systems. No other similar group of  experts meets regularly to review information security issues  involved in unclassified Federal Government computer  systems and networks. Title III of the E-Government Act  of 2002 reaffirmed the need for this Board by giving it  additional responsibilities: to thoroughly review all proposed  information technology standards and guidelines developed  under Section 20 of the National Institute of Standards and  Technology Act (15 U.S.C. 278g-3), as amended.  The ISPAB is a federal advisory committee with specific  statutory objectives to identify emerging managerial,  technical, administrative, and physical safeguard issues  related to information security and privacy.  The duties of the Board, as dictated in the Act, are:  •  To identify emerging managerial, technical,  administrative, and physical safeguard issues  relative to information security and privacy;  •  To advise NIST and the Director of OMB on  information security and privacy issues pertaining  to Federal Government information systems,  including a thorough review of proposed standards  and guidelines developed under section 278g–3 of  this title; and  •  To provide an annual report of its findings to the  Secretary of Commerce, the Director of OMB,  the Director of the NSA, and the appropriate  committees of Congress.  Congress indicated the long-term need for the Board  by setting the terms of Board members to four years. The  Board’s charter requires that the NIST Director appoint the  Chairperson and all twelve members of the Board, each of  whom is selected for her/his preeminence in the IT industry  or related disciplines.  Mr. Chris Boyer took over leadership from Dr. Peter  Weinberger and was officially appointed by the NIST Director  as the ISPAB Chair on May 1, 2016. Chris Boyer (Assistant Vice  President, Global Public Policy at AT&T Services Inc.) has  been a member of the Board since June 2012. In addition to  his official role representing AT&T, he serves as AT&T’s point  of contact to the National Security Telecommunications  Advisory Council (NSTAC), a federal advisory committee  tasked with providing advice to the president on matters of  national security and emergency preparedness (NS/EP).  The ISPAB Board currently has ten members  supporting the Chair (see http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ SMA/ispab/membership.html). This year, the Board was  pleased to welcome Ms. Patricia Hatter as a new member  (see https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/08/ nists-information-security-and-privacy-advisory-board- adds-industry-member). The following are current Board  members:  •  Ana (Annie) Antón, Professor and Chair, School  of Interactive Computing, Georgia Institute of  Technology;  •  John R.

Daniel Toler, Deputy Director, Federal Network  Resilience, U.S. Department of Homeland  Security.  During FY 2016, ISPAB held three meetings that were  located at the U.S. Access Board Conference Room in  Washington, D.C:  • October 21-23, 2015;  • March 23-25, 2016; and  • June 15-17, 2016.  The presenters at each Board meeting were leaders  and experts representing private industry, academia, federal  agency CIOs, Inspectors General, and Chief Information  Security Officers.  In keeping with previous practices, at the first meeting of  the fiscal year, the Board established a work plan for FY 2016.  The resulting plan included the following areas of focus:  •  Quantum (physics, pre-shared keys, quantum key  distribution, block chains);  • Cybersecurity;  •  OMB topics, including Circular A-130 revisions,  cyber-marathon, CyberStats, measuring outcomes  for cybersecurity, and cybersecurity protections in  Federal Government acquisitions;  •  DHS topics, including Fly-Away (Incident Response)  Team, Einstein, Continuous Diagnostics and  Mitigation (CDM), and outcome measurement  methods;  •  Networking and Information Technology Research  and Development (NITRD) and the Build-it- in initiative and NITRD – on how competent  companies acquire IT;  •  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) and automotive cybersecurity;  •  Federal Trade Commission (FTC) – security,  protecting data;  •  Facial recognition, technologies, biometrics, and  users;  •  Privacy technologies;  •  Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board  (PCLOB);  • Safe Harbor; and  • Acquisition.  Aligning with work-plan focus areas, the Board  continues to monitor the following critical areas:  •  Updates from the senior staff of federal agencies  (e.g., the Deputy Under Secretary, Cybersecurity  and Communications, National Protection  Directorate, DHS, and Senate and Congressional  staff);  •  PCLOB and the establishment of the Federal  Privacy Council;  • OMB Circular A-130 revisions;  •  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  autonomous vehicle technology, gaps, challenges,  security and privacy;  • P rivacy, transparency, and accountability for  commercial unmanned aircraft systems;  •  Cryptography and NIST cryptographic standards  processes;  •  Emerging technologies: cloud computing, big data,  Internet of Things, cyber physical systems, smart  cities, drones and unmanned aircraft systems,  medical devices, transportation sector and vehicle- to-vehicle communication, blockchain protocol, and  impacts on security and privacy;  •  Commission on Enhancing National  Cybersecurity;  • The NIST Cybersecurity Framework;  • Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA);  • Information sharing and analysis;  • The DHS CDM program;  • The Trusted Identities Group (TIG);  •  National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE); and  • Realignment of IT Laboratory.  The Board submitted two recommendation letters based  on the Board work from each meeting in this fiscal year.  Records of the submitted letters and the received responses  are accessible from http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/ documentation.html.  •  At the close of the October 2015 meeting, the  Board submitted a recommendation letter  regarding quantum computing to the NIST Director.  The NIST Director responded to the Board in a letter  dated January 2016.  •  At the close of the March 2016 meeting, the Board  submitted a recommendation letter regarding  FIPS 140 and the use of ISO/IEC 19790 to the NIST  Director. The Board received a response from the  NIST Director in August 2016.

A computer failure or system breach could  jeopardize the company’s reputation and may result in  significant damage and recovery cost—or even business  closure. The small business owner who recognizes the threat  of computer crime and takes steps to deter inappropriate  activities is less likely to become a victim.  The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) reports  that over 27 million U.S. companies − more than 99 % of  all U.S. businesses − are SMBs of 500 employees or fewer  (see http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/allprofiles12. pdf). While the threats to individual small and medium-size  businesses may not be significantly different from those  facing larger organizations, a SMB frequently has fewer  resources available to protect systems, detect attacks, or  respond to security issues. A vulnerability common to a  large percentage of SMBs could pose a threat to the nation’s  information infrastructure and economic base.  To help address information security risks, these  businesses require assistance with the identification of  security mechanisms and with practical, cost-effective  training. Training helps SMB’s use their limited resources  most effectively to address relevant and serious threats. In  response to this need, NIST, the SBA, and the FBI InfraGard  program co-sponsor a series of cybersecurity training  workshops for small businesses. These workshops provide  an overview of cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities, and  corresponding protective tools and techniques, with a special  emphasis on information that small business personnel can  apply directly.  In FY 2016, SMB outreach workshops took place in:  • Minneapolis, Minnesota;  • McHenry, Maryland;  • Harrisonburg, Virginia;  • Arlington, Virginia;  • Ocala, Florida;  • The Villages, Florida;  • Orlando, Florida;  • Clermont, Florida;  • Charlestown, West Virginia; and  • Detroit, Michigan.  Additionally, as part of the President’s Cybersecurity  National Action Plan (CNAP), NIST partnered with the SBA,  the FTC, and the Department of Energy (DoE) to develop  and provide five cybersecurity training webinars to reach  small businesses and small business stakeholders through  68 SBA District Offices, nine NIST Manufacturing Extension  Partnership Centers, and other regional networks across the  country.  In collaboration with the SBA and the FBI, planning  is underway to identify locations and plan cybersecurity  workshops in FY 2017.

The “SHA-3” competition ended in October  2012. NIST standardized the winning algorithm, Keccak, in  FIPS 202 as the new SHA-3 Standard. Announced on August  5, 2015, FIPS 202, SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based  Hash and Extendable-Output Functions, is available at:  https://csrc.nist.gov/Publications/Search?requestSeriesList=  3 & re q u e st S t a t u s L i s t = 1 , 3 & re q u e st D i s p l ay O p t i o n .  =brief&requestSortOrder=5&itemsPerPage=All.  FIPS 202 defines four fixed-length hash functions (SHA3- 224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512), and two variable- length eXtendable Output Functions (XOFs), SHAKE128 and  SHAKE256. FIPS 202 also supports a flexible scheme for  domain separation between different functions derived from  Keccak, which ensures that different named functions will  produce unrelated outputs.  NIST extended this scheme to allow users to customize  their use of the function by defining a new, customizable  version of the SHAKE functions, called cSHAKE, and specifying  two cSHAKE variants—cSHAKE128 and cSHAKE256—for a  128- and 256-bit security strength, respectively, in DRAFT  SP 800-185, SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC,  TupleHash and ParallelHash.  Draft SP 800-185 defines three additional SHA-3-derived  functions that provide new functionality. They are:  •  KMAC128 and KMAC256, providing pseudorandom  functions (PRFs) and keyed-hash functions with  variable-length outputs;  •  TupleHash128 and TupleHash256, providing  functions that hash tuples of input strings without  trivial collisions; and  •  ParallelHash128 and ParallelHash256, providing  efficient hash functions to hash long messages in  parallel.  Published on August 4, 2016, Draft SP 800-185 is  available on the CSRC website. NIST invited the public to  review the draft and provide comments before September  30, 2016. NIST is in the process of addressing the received  comments, and will post the final version of SP 800-185 when  the comments are resolved.

For example, random numbers are  used to generate the keys needed for encryption and digital  signature applications. The CSD Cryptographic Technology  Group (CTG) began work on the specification of random bit  generators in the late 1990s. SP 800-90, Recommendation  for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random  Bit Generators, was published in 2007, and revised as SP  800-90A in 2012 and 2015. This document specifies several  deterministic algorithms that can be used for the generation  of pseudorandom bits – a sequence of bits produced by an  algorithm, rather than a random physical phenomenon that  produces a truly random sequence.  Two additional documents (SP 800-90B and SP 800- 90C) are under development, and drafts were made available  for public comment in 2012 and 2016.  SP 800-90B, Recommendation for the Entropy Sources  Used for Random Bit Generation:  SP 800-90B addresses the development and testing of  entropy sources.

Health  tests are intended to detect whether the noise source  and the entropy source (as a whole) continues to operate  as expected. The optional conditioning component is  responsible for reducing bias and/or increasing the entropy  rate of the bits to eventually be output by the entropy source.  SP 800-90B includes descriptions of the tests for NIST’s  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) to  validate candidate entropy sources. During FY 2016, the  CTG continued the development and testing of methods for  estimating the amount of entropy per noise-source output.  A draft of the document was provided for public  comment in January 2016. A companion python code  package was also made available to assist reviewers in  evaluating the entropy estimation methods published in  the draft (see https://github.com/usnistgov/SP800-90B_ EntropyAssessment).  A workshop was held in May 2016 to discuss the  document, and the public comment period ended shortly  thereafter. The SP 800-90B development team has been  reviewing the comments received during the public  comment period and plans to finalize an initial version of the  document in FY 2017.  The latest draft of SP 800-90B is available via the  Special Publications page: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ PubsSPs.html.  SP 800-90C, Recommendation for Random Bit  Generator (RBG) Constructions:  SP 800-90C provides basic guidance on the construction  of Random Bit Generators (RBGs) from the entropy sources  validated against the requirements of SP 800-90B and the  Deterministic Random Bit Generators (DRBG) algorithms of  SP 800-90A. SP 800-90C includes constructions for both  non-deterministic random bit generators (NRBGs; also  known as true random number generators) and deterministic  random bit generators (also known as pseudorandom  number generators). Two general models are provided in SP  800-90C, as shown in Figures 8 and 9.  Figure 9: XOR-NRBG  Figure 9: XOR-NRBG depicts the construction of one  of the NRBGs – the XOR-NRBG. In this construction, each  bit output by the entropy source (as discussed in SP 800- 90B) is exclusive-ORed with a bit of output from a DRBG  algorithm specified in SP 800-90A.  Figure 10: DRBG and Oversampling NRBG  Figure 10: DRBG and Oversampling NRBG depicts the  construction used for the DRBGs and the second NRBG  design – the Oversampling NRBG. The difference between  the two is the availability of the entropy source and the  frequency of requesting output from the entropy source. For  a DRBG, an entropy source is only required for seeding the  DRBG; after the initial seeding process, further requests for  entropy-source output depend on the implementation and  application. For the Oversampling NRBG, the entropy source  must always be available and is accessed whenever bits are  requested from the NRBG by a consuming application.  The latest draft of SP 800-90C is available via the  Special Publications page: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/ PubsSPs.html.  P L A N S  F O R  F Y  2 0 1 7 :  The RBG development team has the following goals for  FY 2017:  •  Complete the initial version of SP 800-90B and  post the comments received, along with their  resolution. The testing of entropy sources by the  CMVP will begin as soon as possible after the test  code is ported to another language for increased  performance. Members of the CMVP staff have  been participating in the development of SP 800- 90B to more easily prepare for such testing. Not  all comments received will be addressed in this  version, since the development team is anxious to  begin getting feedback from the CMVP labs about  the adequacy of the tests specified in SP 800-90B.  Addressing some of the comments would result in  a significant delay in finalizing the initial version of  the document.  •  Complete SP 800-90C, posting the comments  received and their resolution, along with the  document.  •  Monitor the testing of SP 800-90B and SP 800- 90C in the CMVP labs to determine problems  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

A block cipher transforms  some fixed-length binary data (i.e., a “block”) into seemingly  random data of the same length. The transformation is  determined by the choice of some secret data called the  “key.” The same key is used to reverse the transformation and  recover the original block of data. A cryptographic technique  (e.g., for encryption and/or authentication) that is constructed  from a block cipher is called a ‘mode of operation.’  Several modes of operation have been specified in the  SP 800-38 series of publications. The latest installment in  the series, Special Publication 800-38G, Recommendation  for Block Cipher Modes of Operation: Methods for Format- Preserving Encryption, was published in March 2016. It  specifies two AES modes of operation, called FF1 and FF3,  for inclusion in the “toolkit” of approved cryptographic  algorithms. FF1 and FF3 are format-preserving encryption  (FPE) modes, based on proposals that were submitted from  the private sector.  Previously approved confidentiality modes are designed  for binary data; ciphertext resulting from these modes may  be longer than the original plaintext and may result in format  problems when used by existing devices or software.  FPE modes such as FF1 and FF3 are designed for any  kind of data, including non-binary formats, such as credit  card numbers and social security numbers. The ciphertext  resulting from an FPE mode has the same length and format  as the original plaintext.  Consequently, FPE modes can  facilitate the retrofitting of encryption technology to existing  devices or software, where a conventional encryption mode  might not be feasible.

The Cryptographic Technology Group (CTG)  began providing guidance in managing the keys used for  cryptographic applications in the late 1990s to early 2000s.  NIST Special Publications have been periodically updated  to address new algorithms and handling procedures. These  documents are coordinated with federal agencies and  with the cryptographic community, including national and  international organizations, industry, and academia.  During the development and subsequent revision of  these key-management documents, the development  team coordinates with members of NIST’s Cryptographic  Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) and Cryptographic  Module Validation Program (CMVP) to develop validation  tests and address issues that arise during the validation  processes.  In FY 2016, the following publications were either created  or revised:  SP 800-57, Part 1, Recommendation for Key Management,  Part 1: General:  SP 800-57, was first published in 2005, and later revised  in 2007 and 2012. SP 800-57, Part 1 contains basic key- management guidance, including:  •  Defining the security services that may be obtained  using NIST-approved algorithms;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Another revision of the document was completed in  January 2016 that includes information on and references  to new and revised documents developed by the CTG (e.g.,  SP 800-152, as discussed below); the removal of references  to the Dual_EC_DRBG, which was removed from SP 800- 90A: Recommendation for Random Number Generation  Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators; a revision of  the security-strength tables; and a revision of the key-state  discussion to provide more clarification.  SP 800-57, Part 1 is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4.pdf.  SP 800-131A: Transitions: Recommendation for  Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key  Lengths:  SP 800-131A was originally published in January 2011.  This document provides specific guidance for transitions  to the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust  algorithms. An update of SP 800-131A was completed in  November 2015. This update removes approval for the Dual_ EC_DRBG that was specified in SP 800-90A; deprecates the  use of non-approved key-establishment schemes; disallows  the use of non-approved key-wrapping methods after 2017;  and indicates that the use of the SHA-3 family of hash  functions is acceptable, in addition to the use of the SHA-2  family of hash functions and some applications of SHA-1.  SP 800-131A is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar1.pdf.  SP 800-152: A Profile for U.S. Federal Cryptographic Key  Management Systems (CKMS):  SP 800-152 provides guidance on the CKMS to be  used by the Federal Government. This document contains  requirements for CKMS design, implementation, procurement,  installation, configuration, management, operation and  use. Many of these requirements are refinements of the  requirements for CKMS designers that are specified in SP  800-130: A Framework for Designing Cryptographic Key  Management Systems. Other requirements are intended for  the service providers of a CKMS used by federal agencies and  their contractors. Guidance is also provided for the federal  agencies in selecting CKMSs that support the security and  management policies of those agencies.  This document was completed in October 2015  and is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-152.pdf.  SP 800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key  Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm  Cryptography:  SP 800-56A was originally published in 2006, and revised  in 2007 and 2013. This document specifies Diffie-Hellman  (DH) and Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (MQV) key-establishment  schemes, both elliptic curve and finite field versions. Key  establishment is a procedure that results in keying material  that is shared between the participants. A key-establishment  scheme is defined by a cryptographic algorithm, together  with an identification of other information that must be  available by both parties when establishing keys. The  schemes are intended for use in communication protocols  (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS), one of the protocols  used by the Internet). The key-establishment schemes in SP  800-56A use public key algorithms, and each participant in  a key-agreement transaction uses a pair of keys—a public  key and a private key.  Both key-agreement and key-transport schemes are  specified in the document. A key-agreement scheme is a  procedure in which both parties in a key-establishment  transaction contribute information that is used in generating  a cryptographic key. The key-agreement process includes the  generation of a shared secret (which is not itself considered  to be a cryptographic key), and the derivation of keying  material using the shared secret. Several key-agreement  schemes are specified in SP 800-56A. Figure 11: (See next  page) Key-Agreement Example below provides a simplified  example of a key-agreement scheme. In this example, each  party:  1. Generates a key pair (either prior to or during  the key-agreement transaction);  2. Obtains the public key of the other party;  3. Computes a shared secret using one’s own  keys and the other party’s public key; and  4. Derives one or more keys from the shared  secret.

In SP 800-56A, key transport can  be performed following the key-agreement process depicted  in Figure 11 using a key that was derived during that process.  Figure 12: Key-Transport Example provides an example of a  key transport scheme. In this example,  1. The sender (either party A or party B in Figure  11: Key-Agreement Example), generates a  symmetric key;  2. Wraps (i.e., encrypts) that key using a  key-wrapping algorithm (see SP 800-38F:  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of  Operation: Methods for Key Wrapping; SP  800-38F is available at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-38F. pdf);  3. Sends the resulting ciphertext key to the other  party (i.e., the receiver); and  4. The receiver unwraps (i.e., decrypts) the  received ciphertext key using a key derived  during the key-agreement process to obtain  the original plaintext key that was generated by  the sender.

SP.800-53Ar4.pdf.  SP 800-56A has been under revision during FY 2016.  This revision will:  •  Approve the use of additional parameter/key sizes  for the finite field schemes; currently, only key  sizes of 2048 and 3072 bits are specified. Larger  key sizes will be allowed and defined in the next  version.  •  Allow the use of pre-defined domain parameter  groups that are not currently allowed by SP 800- 56A. Domain parameters are used to generate  keys and compute the shared secret. Methods  for generating domain parameters are specified  for the finite field schemes in FIPS 186-4: Digital  Signature Standard (DSS). The revision of SP 800- 56A will allow the use of domain-parameter groups  using “safe primes” that are used in the Transport  Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Key Exchange  (IKE) protocols, which were not generated using  the methods in FIPS 186-4. These pre-defined  groups will be listed in Annex A of FIPS 140-2.  •  Move all key-derivation functions to SP 800-56C:  Recommendation for Key Derivation Through  Extraction-then-Expansion. SP 800-56A currently  specifies two versions of a single step key- derivation function, refers to SP 800-56C for a  two-step key-derivation procedure, and refers  to SP 800-135: Recommendation for Existing  Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions, for  application-specific key-derivation functions.  The revision of SP 800-56A will be available for public  comment in FY 2017.  SP 800-56C: Recommendation for Key Derivation Through  Extraction-then-Expansion:  SP 800-56C specifies techniques for the derivation  of keys from a shared secret generated during a key- establishment scheme defined in SP 800-56A and SP  800-56B using a two-step extraction-then-expansion  procedure. SP 800-56A is discussed above. SP 800-56B:  Recommendation for Pairwise Key-Establishment Schemes  Using Integer Factorization Cryptography, is available at  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST. SP.800-56Br1.pdf.  SP 800-56C uses either HMAC or the Cipher- based Message Authentication Code (CMAC) algorithm  during the two-step process. HMAC is specified in FIPS  198-1: The Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code  (HMAC), and CMAC is specified for AES in SP 800-38B:  Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation:  the CMAC Mode of Authentication. FIPS 198-1 is available at  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_ final.pdf; SP 800-38B is available at: http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/ nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38b.pdf.  The current version of SP 800-56C is available  at http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/ nistspecialpublication800-56c.pdf.  SP 800-56C is being revised to:  •  Move the key derivation functions specified in SP  800-56A into SP 800-56C as well as the references  to SP 800-135: Recommendation for Existing  Application-Specific Key Derivation Functions;  •  Allow the use of KMAC, as specified in Draft SP  800-185, SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE,  Keccak Message Authentication Code (KMAC),  TupleHash and ParallelHash, for key derivation;  •  Define additional Message Authentication Code  (MAC) lengths for the new parameter-size sets  that will be allowed in the revision of SP 800-56A;  and  •  Provide a formula for estimating the security  strength for the parameter-size sets that are  not explicitly listed in SP 800-56A and SP 800- 56B.  The revision of SP 800-56C will be available for public  comment in FY 2017.  N e w  D o c u m e n t s  U n d e r  D e v e l o p m e n t :  A new NIST publication is under development that  provides guidance on the search resistance of a bit string  output from an approved cryptographic algorithm (e.g.,  a cryptographic key or encrypted data). Search resistance  is a (rough) measure of the amount of secrecy that can be  provided by a bit string, given the genealogy (i.e., how it was  generated), handling (i.e., what happened to it after it was  generated), the usage (i.e., what algorithm it will be used  with), length, and any other secret values and processes  associated with the generation and handling of that bit  string. When approved algorithms are used, this document  is intended to provide methods for determining the search  resistance of the bit string. This document, SP 800-158: Key  Management: The Search resistance of Bit Strings Output  by Cryptographic Algorithms, has involved a considerable  amount of new research, since it is an area that has not  been addressed to date. This publication will be available for  public comment in FY 2017.

Since  the revision, CTG has been following developments in TLS  implementations, including updates and attacks. In FY 2016,  a second revision began that considers these developments.  This second revision will be posted for public review and  comment in FY 2017.  CTG has been contributing to the development of  testssl.sh (see https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh),  an open-source program that tests TLS-enabled servers,  providing information about the protocols and cipher suites  supported, in addition to checking for some well-known  flaws. In FY 2017, CTG will be contributing code to testssl.sh  that tests a TLS server’s configuration for conformance to SP  800-52 Revision 2. CTG intends to make a draft version of  this code available when the draft of SP 800-52 Revision 2 is  posted for public comment.  The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is actively  developing extensions that can be used to add functionality  to TLS. CTG will continue to review updates and additions to  the TLS protocol in FY 2017.

NIST has standardized elliptic curve cryptography  for digital signature algorithms in FIPS 186: Digital Signature  Standard (DSS), and for key establishment schemes in SP  800-56A: Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment  Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography.  In FIPS 186-4, NIST recommends fifteen elliptic curves  of varying security strengths for use in these elliptic curve  cryptographic standards. However, the provenance of the  curves is not fully specified in the standard, leading to recent  public concerns that there could be a hidden weakness in  these curves. NIST is not aware of any vulnerability in these  curves when they are implemented correctly and used as  described in NIST standards and guidelines.  More than fifteen years have now passed since these  curves were developed, and the community now knows more  about the security of elliptic curve cryptography and practical  implementation issues. Advances within the cryptographic  community have led to the development of new elliptic  curves and algorithms whose designers claim to offer better  performance and are easier to implement in a secure manner.  Some of these curves are under consideration in voluntary,  consensus-based Standards Developing Organizations.  In FY 2016, NIST solicited comments on possible  improvements to FIPS 186-4. In particular, comments were  requested on the possibility of adding new elliptic curves to  the current recommended set—as well as adding new digital  signature schemes. Throughout 2016, NIST began resolving  the comments and revising FIPS 186-4.

If large- scale quantum computers are ever built, they will be able to  break the existing infrastructure of public-key cryptography.  The focus of the Post-Quantum Cryptography project is  to identify candidate quantum-resistant systems that are  secure against both quantum and classical computers—as  well as the impact that such post-quantum algorithms will  have on current protocols and security infrastructures.  NIST researchers have held regular seminars throughout  FY 2016. The presentation topics include the latest published  results and security analyses, as well as status reports on  quantum computation, hash-based signatures, coding- based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and  multivariate cryptography. Through these presentations and  discussions, the project team has made significant progress  in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the  existing cryptographic schemes in each category.  In April 2016, NIST published NISTIR 8105: Report on Post- Quantum Cryptography, which shared the team’s current  understanding about the status of quantum computing  and post-quantum cryptography. The report also outlined  NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this area. At Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQCrypto) 2016, NIST announced  that it would begin the Post-Quantum Standardization  Process, a thorough multi-year effort with the objective of  creating new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards  for public-key encryption and digital signatures (see  www.nist.gov/pqcrypto). These functionalities are much  more complex than AES or SHA-3, and will require  fundamentally new techniques to address several open  research questions in this area (for example, how to  measure security against quantum attacks when a quantum  computer has not yet been built). In August 2016, NIST  issued draft submission requirements and evaluation criteria  for public comment. (see https://www.federalregister.gov/ articles/2016/08/02/2016-18150/request-for-comments-on- post-quantum-cryptography-requirements-and-evaluation- criteria)  The NIST team also continues to be productive in post- quantum cryptography research. The results have been  published at major conferences, such as Embedded Security  in Cars (ESCARS), Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC),  PQCrypto, and Eurocrypt. NIST researchers have given  presentations at conferences and workshops to increase  awareness of the upcoming migration. NIST has also  sponsored other research, education, and research events.  In FY 2017, NIST will continue to explore the security  and feasibility of purported quantum-resistant technologies,  with the ultimate goal of uncovering the fundamental  mechanisms necessary for efficient, trustworthy, and cost- effective information assurance in the post-quantum era.  The Post-Quantum Standardization Process will begin in  early FY 2017, with the issuance of the finalized submission  requirements and evaluation criteria. There will be a one-year  period during which quantum-resistant algorithms may be  submitted for possible standardization. After the submission  period, there will be a public workshop in FY 2018, followed  by multiple rounds of evaluation and analysis.

In practice, it  is important to be able to minimize the size of these  circuits. This problem is closely related to designing small  combinational circuits. These circuits use only binary AND,  XOR and NEGATION gates, i.e., multiplication, addition, and  “+1” in arithmetic modulo 2. A combinational circuit on four  variables (X1, X2, X3, and X4) using AND and XOR gates is  depicted in Figure 13.

In practice, this  means that it is necessary to settle for methods that design  “good” circuits, as opposed to provably optimal circuits.  The CTG has developed and implemented new solutions for  the circuit-minimization problem. Two patents have been  granted related to this work, the last one in FY 2014. These  are held jointly between NIST and the University of Southern  Denmark.  The CTG is also researching circuit-based security metrics  for cryptographic functions. For a function to be secure (in  particular, one-way), it must be the case that any circuit that  implements it is sufficiently complex. In particular, a function  is insecure if it can be implemented by a circuit containing  too few Boolean AND gates. This security metric, namely the  number of AND gates necessary and sufficient to implement  a function, is referred to as its multiplicative complexity.  Unfortunately, determining multiplicative complexity is  extremely hard.  The CTG has published circuits that are provably  optimal or close to optimal (with respect to multiplicative  complexity) for important classes of functions. In the process,  we developed tools that have wide applicability for both  theoretical and applied research in security and cryptography.  Multiparty computation is a technique that allows a  group of people to compute a function of their inputs without  revealing the inputs themselves. Examples of this are: i)  holding an election; ii) conducting closed-bid auctions in  which only the winning bid is determined; and iii) proving to a  third party that a person’s encrypted attributes satisfy some  requirement, such as “over 21 and (U.S. citizen or Canadian  citizen).” The protocols that solve multiparty computation  problems often encrypt bits using arithmetic modulo 2. The  complexity of such protocols largely depends on the number  of multiplications required. Hence, expressing functions as  circuit computations with only a few multiplication (AND)  gates is important. Some of the published circuits are now  the standard reference for benchmarking tools in multiparty  computation.  The following is a partial list of new results by our team:  •  Better recursions for Karatsuba multiplication,  which yielded the smallest known circuits for binary  multiplication (i.e., multiplication of polynomials of  degree n over the Galois Field with two elements).  This yields important speed increases in elliptic  curve cryptography and other applications.  •  Optimal circuits were constructed - with respect  to multiplicative complexity - for all predicates on  four bits (see the example below). There are 65,536  such predicates. Surprisingly, the multiplicative  complexity of all these functions turned out to  be at most three. Additionally, our circuits use no  more than seven non-linear gates (XOR, XNOR).  This is quite hard. Consider the following predicate  (arithmetic is modulo 2):  f = x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 +x2x4 + x1x2x3 + x1x2x4 + x1x2x3x4.  •  Computing the last term requires three  multiplications. So, it is quite surprising that the  full expression can be computed using only three  multiplications. But, we have shown this to be  true for f and all other predicates on four bits. The  circuit depicted above computes f using three  multiplications and six additions.  •  A proof was developed that the maximum  multiplicative complexity of predicates on five bits  (there are more than 4 billion such predicates) is  four. The proof is constructive, meaning that the  circuits can actually be built.  •  A proof was developed that an explicit function  requires at least 3.01n gates. This constitutes the  only improvement on this problem for more than  30 years. The result is due to Magnus Find, in  collaboration with mathematicians from New York  University (NYU) and from the Steklov Institute, St.  Petersburg, Russia.  In 2017, plans are in place to begin the implementation  of combinational circuits in ASIC (application-specific  integrated circuit) hardware. The team will also map the  multiplicative complexity of all functions of six variables  and will code a new heuristic for simultaneously reducing  the size and depth of circuits.

Examples of these areas  include automotive systems, sensor networks, healthcare,  distributed control systems, the Internet of Things (IoT),  cyber-physical systems, and the smart grid. Security and  privacy can be very important in these areas. Because most  of the modern cryptographic algorithms were designed for  desktop/server environments, many of these algorithms  cannot be implemented in the constrained devices used  by these applications. When current NIST-approved  algorithms can be engineered to fit into the limited  resources of constrained environments, their performance  may not be acceptable.  For these reasons, NIST started a  lightweight cryptography project in 2013 that was tasked  with determining the need and developing a strategy for the  standardization of lightweight cryptographic algorithms.  CTG staff are examining applications in constrained  environments to determine whether NIST should develop  lightweight cryptographic standards. This includes  communicating with industry experts to understand the  challenges and limitations and following the work of  other standardization bodies in this area. In FY 2015, CTG  organized a Lightweight Cryptography Workshop to discuss  issues related to the security and resource requirements of  applications in constrained environments and potential future  standardization of lightweight primitive algorithms. Using  input gathered at the workshop in FY 2016, CTG released  draft NISTIR 8114, Draft Report on Lightweight Cryptography  for public comments. This report provides an overview of  the lightweight cryptography project at NIST, and describes  a plan for the standardization of lightweight cryptographic  algorithms. This plan involves the creation of profiles that  will target specific applications and requirements where  conventional cryptography may not be suitable.  CTG is organizing the second NIST workshop on  Lightweight Cryptography, taking place at the beginning of  FY 2017 to discuss the plan outlined in the draft report before  it is finalized. The next steps in the plan include working with  industry to create an initial set of profiles and the selection  of algorithms that meet profile requirements.

It  uses two independent, commercially-available sources of  randomness, each with an independent hardware entropy  source and SP 800-90A-approved components.  The NIST Beacon is designed to provide unpredictability,  autonomy, and consistency. Unpredictability means that  users cannot algorithmically predict bits before they are  made available by the source. Autonomy means that the  source is resistant to attempts by outside parties to alter the  distribution of the random bits. Consistency means that a set  of users can access the source in such a way that they are  confident of receiving the same random string.  The NIST Beacon posts bit-strings in blocks of 512 bits  every 60 seconds. Each such value is time-stamped and  signed to form a packet that also includes the hash of the  previous value to chain the sequence of values together.  This prevents all parties, even the source, from retroactively  changing an output packet without being detected. The  NIST Beacon keeps all output packets. At any point in time,  the full history of outputs is available to users.  Tables of random numbers have probably been used for  multiple purposes at least since the Industrial Revolution.  In the digital age, algorithmic pseudorandom number  generators (PRNGs) have largely replaced these tables. The  NIST Beacon expands the use of randomness to multiple  scenarios in which neither tables nor PRNGs can be used.  The extra functionalities stem mainly from three features.  First, the Beacon-generated numbers cannot be predicted  before they are published. Second, the public, time-bound,  and authenticated nature of the Beacon allows a user  application to prove to anybody that it used truly random  numbers not known before a certain point in time. Third, this  proof can be presented offline and at any point in the future.  Although commercially available physical sources of  randomness are adequate as entropy sources for currently  envisioned implementations of the NIST Beacon, the NIST  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In collaboration with  NIST physicists from the Physical Measurement Laboratory  (PML), the project team aims to use quantum non-locality to  build an entropy source whose unpredictability is guaranteed  by the laws of physics. In FY 2016, a major milestone was  achieved, namely, a strong loophole-free test of local realism  (where individual particles are governed by elements of  reality, even if these elements are hidden from us) (see  https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2015/11/nist-team- proves-spooky-action-distance-really-real).  The project team has also made progress in reaching a  goal of helping other institutions set up other interoperable  sources. This is important because multiple sources can be  combined in such a way that all sources would have to be  compromised in order to degrade the common random  strings.  As of the end of FY 2016, the NIST Beacon has been  functioning without interruption for more than three years.  During this time, the project team has received valuable input  from a growing community of users. As a result, the project  team will provide an enhanced version of the service during  FY 2017. The enhancements are mainly intended to enable  interoperability.  NIST encourages the community-at-large to research  and publish novel ways in which this tool can be used.

In FY 2016, NIST researchers continuously collaborated  with the IEEE 802.21 Working Group to develop solutions  for multicast group key distribution and coauthored a paper  titled “Security Multicast Group Key Management and Key  Distribution in IEEE 802.21.” The paper has been accepted by  the Security Standardization Research Conference 2016 (SSR  2016) and will be presented on December 5-6, 2016.  In FY 2017, the NIST team will continue to contribute  to IEEE 802 wireless standards and provide guidance for  NIST cryptographic standard usage in wireless and mobility  applications.

A blockchain is a  distributed database that maintains a continuously growing  list of records called blocks that are secured from revision  using a hash function. Each block contains a link to the  previous block. A new block is added to the chain only when  multiple parties (possibly mutually untrusting parties) agree  to its accuracy. In essence, a blockchain is a mutually agreed- upon record of history.

However, the use of  blockchains has been proposed for other applications, such  as smart contracts and various ledgering applications.  Many organizations have suggested applications for the  use of blockchains, some of which may not be appropriate.  The CSD is investigating the use of blockchains to determine  which application types are appropriate for using blockchains  and which are not. The CTG is monitoring the proposed  uses of cryptography to assure that current cryptographic  techniques are used properly and whether new techniques  are required.  During FY 2016, the CTG participated in two blockchain  workshops: the “DC Blockchain Summit” in March and the  “Blockchain and Healthcare Workshop” in September.  The CTG took an active role in the September workshop  by reviewing papers and providing presentations on  blockchains and the CTG standards that might be useful for  future blockchain work. The CSD also began testing the use  of several blockchain nodes.  During FY 2017, in addition to continuing familiarization  with the use of blockchains and monitoring the cryptography  proposed, the CTG is planning to participate in a blockchain  study group sponsored by American Standards Committee  X9, the financial services committee of the American  National Standards Institute (ANSI).

The ability to generate  strong cryptographic keys is directly related to having  access to unpredictable random data, but generating truly  unpredictable random data on computing devices is hard  and unreliable. As a result, weak keys are widely used in  cryptographic applications, thus compromising the security  of the sensitive data protected by them − potentially with  disastrous consequences.  A primary goal of this project is to provide high-quality,  truly unpredictable random data to devices on the Internet  to enable them to generate strong cryptographic keys and  attest the strength of the keys used to protect data in transit  or at rest, thereby enabling cryptographic system strength  attestation. Achieving this goal would provide a solid basis  for achieving the goals of the Automated Cryptographic  Validation Testing project (see http://csrc.nist.gov/projects/ acvt/ ) as well as addressing the problems targeted by the  Cryptographic Programs and Laboratory Accreditation (see  the next section: Validated Programs, the first project in that  section), where entropy estimation has persisted as one of  the most difficult and labor-consuming activities, causing  problems for all parties involved: the industry, the testing  laboratories and the government validators.  Random data obtained from sources of true  randomness that are based on unpredictable physical  phenomena, such as quantum effects, is much better  suited for cryptographic applications. CSD is collaborating  with the NIST Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML)  to build a quantum source. The aim is to use quantum  effects to generate sequences that are guaranteed to be  unpredictable, even if an attacker has access to the random  source. For more information on this collaboration, see  https://www.nist.gov/pml/div684/random_numbers_bell_ test.cfm/  This project aims to develop a system and protocols  for obtaining random data with high entropy from one or  more remote sources. The high-level architecture is shown  in Figure 15: (See next page) High-level Architecture of EaaS.  The architecture of the Entropy-as-a-Service system consists  of two main parts: the client-side and the server-side. The  critical components of the system are the quantum device,  the EaaS server and a secure device in the client systems  that is capable of providing strong isolation and protection  for the cryptographic keys stored inside the device and  offering a set of basic cryptographic services.  The EaaS server is continuously fed random data from  the attached quantum source. The data enters a FIFO (first in,  first out)-like buffer in the server’s Random Access Memory  (RAM), and, when a client request arrives, the server reads  the top value from the buffer, signs and encrypts it, and then  sends it to the requester. The FIFO buffer shifts after every  request and when new data comes from the random source.  The EaaS server ensures that the FIFO buffer is erased  prior to server shutdown and never paged to disk. Open  implementations can help ensure that this occurs.  The client system consists of a classic computing device  enabled with a dedicated hardware component capable of  storing secret cryptographic keys and seeds.

Examples of secure  hardware components are the Trusted Platform Module (TPM),  TrustZone technology in Advanced Reduced Instruction Set  Computing (RISC) Machine (ARM) processors, and Identity  Protection Technology in Intel processors. If a client system  or device doesn’t have a secure hardware component, it can  still use EaaS. The presence of a hardware component simply  provides further guarantees to the system or device user,  when present.  EaaS uses HTTP to transfer entropy payloads from the  service to clients. To secure this transmission, the server  encrypts the data using the client’s provided public key and  digitally signs the payload with the server’s own private key.  Client devices mix this data with locally available random  data to seed random number generators to generate strong  cryptographic keys and other random values independently  from the remote sources.  With the conceptual system architecture and protocols  defined, the project team continues to engage with industry  and academia to obtain feedback on the approach and  identify possibilities for collaborative approaches to solving  important cybersecurity challenges in the domains of  cryptography and supply-chain management (e.g., integrated  circuit counterfeiting). The team published a peer-reviewed  paper on EaaS in IEEE Computer, a top professional journal,  in September 2016. The team also started a collaboration  with a team of researchers at the University of Florida who  won a NIST research grant to explore ways to leverage  EaaS in protecting against integrated circuit counterfeiting  and thereby help secure the supply chain. The University of  Florida researchers will start their project in FY 2017.  The team continues to develop the system to provide  a publicly accessible NIST EaaS instance in FY 2017. During  the summer of FY 2016, the team hosted a Summer  Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) student who  developed a sample EaaS-client implementation with a  Figure 15: High-level Architecture of EaaS  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Related to this,  the project team is planning to work on developing public  criteria for reputable EaaS hosts.

FIPS 140-2 was released on  May 25, 2001 and supersedes FIPS 140-1.  The current implementation of the CMVP is shown in  Figure 16: Current Validation Flow below. The CMVP leverages  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP) accredited Cryptographic and Security testing  (CST) laboratories for validation testing against the derived  test requirements (DTR), implementation guidance (IG),  and applicable CMVP programmatic guidance. According  to existing guidance, the CST laboratories must perform  100 % independent testing of the modules submitted by the  vendors.  The structure and the rules under which the CMVP  operates worked well for the level of the technology utilized  by the Federal Government when the program was created  more than two decades ago. As technology has advanced,  however, the module testing process no longer satisfies  the current industry and government operational needs.  Testing is exceedingly long—well beyond typical product- development cycles across a wide range of technologies.  The resulting validated modules often do not provide useful  interfaces for integration into IT systems to enable run-time  monitoring of modules for compliance with FISMA.  NIST recognizes the need to improve the efficiency and  effectiveness of cryptographic module testing to reduce the  time and cost required for testing, while providing a high  level of assurance for Federal Government consumers.  The principal goals of this project are to collaborate  with commercial or open source producers of cryptographic  capabilities and government consumers of FIPS 140-validated  modules to:  Figure 16: Current Validation Flow  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

At this stage, we  have only partially concluded the research on this  and can point to examples at https://github.com/ usnistgov/ACVP); and  •  Identify techniques and procedures that provide  continued assurance of operational compliance to  FIPS 140 for cryptographic modules throughout  their lifecycle.  The scope of this project is broken into multiple  phases to be performed over several years.  P H A S E  1  • Identify potential approaches,  •  Select the best technical approach or approaches  to prototype, and  • Document the technical approach.  P H A S E  2  • Develop working prototypes, and  •  Evaluate the prototypes against the principal  goals.  P H A S E  3  •  Publish a draft, provide a review period, adjudicate  the comments, and publish the final version.  P H A S E  4  •  Integrate the final version into the operational  CMVP program.  Currently, the project is focused on completing the  documentation of the technical approach for automating  the algorithm testing and researching the approaches  for automating the software module testing. The team  working on this project, in collaboration with the industry,  demonstrated successful automated algorithm validations  at the International Cryptographic Module Conference in  May 2017 for some algorithms (see https://acvts.nist.gov/ acvp/home) and continues to develop the automation of  the rest of algorithms currently tested by the traditional  Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (http://csrc. nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/index.html) with the goal of  replacing it by the second quarter of 2018.  The project activities are structured by work areas in  order for subject-matter experts to more narrowly focus and  make progress.  1. Algorithm and Protocol Testing;  2. Cryptographic Module Testing, a. Hardware, b. Software, and c.  Modules in cloud environments;  and 3.  Positioning and relationships to other  Government Validation Programs.  The project has several planned deliverables, including  the identification of prospective technical approaches that  adopt industry best practices and produce artifacts that  are machine readable and map to DTR requirements, and a  selection of the best technical and feasible approaches.

Poor  implementations of these standards or specifications may  render a product insecure, potentially placing sensitive  information at risk. ITL operates several validation programs  that help provide a level of assurance that products meet  established security requirements and conform to published  specifications. To that end, the CSD Security Testing,  Validation, and Measurement Group (STVMG) develops test  suites and test methods; provides implementation guidance  and technical support to industry forums; and conducts  education, training, and outreach programs.

C r y p t o g r a p h i c  P r o g r a m s  a n d  L a b o r a t o r y  A c c r e d i t a t i o n  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)  The Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)  was developed to support the federal user communities for  strong, independently tested, and commercially available  cryptographic modules. Through this program, the CMVP  works with international government, public and private  sectors as a part of the cryptographic community to  achieve standards-based security and assurance of correct  implementation. The goal is to provide federal agencies  with a security metric to use in procuring and deploying  cryptographic modules, and promote the use of validated  modules by industry and the public. The testing performed  by independent third-party laboratories accredited by  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CMVP  program provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry,  and the public can choose cryptographic modules and/or  products containing cryptographic modules from the CMVP  Validated Modules List and have confidence in the claimed  level of security and assurance of correct implementation.  Cryptographic module testing and validation are  based on published NIST standards. Since federal agencies  are required to use validated cryptographic modules for  the protection of sensitive unclassified information, the  validated modules and the validated algorithms that the  modules contain represent the culmination and delivery of  CSD’s cryptography-based work to the end user.  The CMVP validates modules that are used in a wide  variety of products, including Internet browsers, radios, smart  cards, space-based communications, munitions, security  tokens, mobile phones, network and storage devices, and  products supporting the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and  electronic commerce. While a module may be a standalone  product (e.g., a virtual private network (VPN) or smart  card), in many cases, a module (e.g., a cryptographic-based  toolkit) is embedded into many products. Because a small  number of modules may be incorporated within hundreds of  products, the validation process has significant impact.  The theme for the CMVP in FY 2016 was change. The  CMVP is evolving to be more efficient and consistent.  The CMVP implemented an automated system, modified  workflow processes to provide better transparency and  strengthened collaboration with the Cryptographic Modules  User Forum (CMUF).  On October 1, 2015, the CMVP began using a new  automated system to manage the validation workflow. The  impact to the CMVP’s efficiency was dramatic. In FY 2016,  the CMVP awarded 307 new certificates, 111 more than in FY  2015. Figure 17: FY 2016 CMVP Certificates by Security Level  displays the number of certificates by security level for FY  2016.  Figure 17: FY 2016 CMVP Certificates by Security Level  The automated system tracks the status of each  submission and identifies the order in which the submissions  should be reviewed, based on when each submission is  added to the CMVP queue. Automating this housekeeping  task significantly increased the efficiency of the validation  process. Not only does this allow the CMVP time to focus  on other tasks, it reduces the number of status messages  from the laboratories that request a status for their specific  submission. Status messages have dropped from 4 to 6 per  week to 0 to 1 per week.  The number of submissions sitting in the CMVP queue  and the average queue time have been reduced in part due  to this automation. The number of modules in the queue has  dropped from an average of 120 to an average of 65. The  average queue length (e.g., the amount of time between  the arrival of a submission and when the review begins)  has dropped from an average of four months to an average  of less than two months. The average amount of time to  validate a module is six months, with some validations being  completed within two months. In the last quarter of FY 2016,  the queue was, at times, empty.

Generating an invoice was reduced from an average of three  weeks to one day. Similarly, receiving a notification that an  invoice was paid went from an average of one week to one  day. These are contributing factors to the reduction in the  queue length. This achievement was due to the cooperative  relationship between the CMVP and NIST Receivables, who  worked through technical challenges to allow the systems to  exchange information.  In May 2015, to provide greater transparency to the  laboratories, the CMVP began sending a weekly report  to each laboratory, providing the status of each of their  submissions. Before the capability to prepare and send this  report was available, the CMVP and laboratories would, at  times, find that each thought the other had the next action,  resulting in unnecessary delays.  In August 2015, to provide greater transparency to  users, the CMVP separated the Implementation-Under-Test  (IUT) list from the rest of the Modules-In-Process (MIP) list.  Separating the lists allows the users to quickly and easily see  that the CMVP does not have any information on the modules  currently being tested (i.e., those listed in the IUT list). In fact,  the IUT list is provided as a marketing service for vendors that  have made a commitment to achieving validation, but whose  module(s) are not yet in the MIP.  The CMVP strengthened its relationship with the CMUF by  supporting the monthly CMUF general membership meetings  and five CMUF working groups. The working groups are chaired  by a member of industry and/or by laboratory personnel.  Each working group includes a representative from the CMVP.  The current working group topics include the Security Policy  Template; Testing Equivalency; Revalidation in Response to  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs); Proposed IG  Integrity Testing using Random Sampling and IG Updates (IG  3.5 Documentation Requirements for Cryptographic Module  Services, IG 1.20 Sub-Chip Cryptographic Subsystems, and  7.7 Key Establishment and Key Entry and Output). This CMUF  collaboration allows greater progress on technical guidance  and incorporates differing perspectives.  For FY 2017, the CMVP team is:  •  Anticipating the approval of FIPS 140-3. When  approved, the CMVP will create the necessary  documents and processes to support the transition  from FIPS 140-2 to FIPS 140-3;  •  Continuing to invest in automation to streamline the  validation process and improve review consistency.  One effort that started in FY 2016 was the ability  for a laboratory to request an invoice while the  laboratory finalizes the submission to CMVP. If  laboratories leverage this new capability, the  CMVP could see a further reduction in the queue  length;  •  Anticipating the rollout of the new Computer  Security Resource Center (CSRC) web site. This  will allow the CMVP to replace the static validation  pages with an interactive capability for users, along  with other improvements for users. Following this,  the CMVP will begin the transition to a web-based  submission process to replace the current email- based process;  •  Continuing to strengthen its relationship with  the CMUF by collaborating on new and improved  technical guidance and programmatic issues;  and  •  Joining the International Cryptographic Module  Conference (ICMC) program committee to  continue strengthening partnership within the  community.

The CAVP was established in 2013 as  a joint program in collaboration between NIST and the  Communications Security Establishment (CSE) of Canada.  Prior to this date, the CAVP’s functions were included in the  Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP). With the  increase in the number and complexity of FIPS-Approved  and NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithms, it was  deemed necessary to establish the CAVP as an independent  program.  The CAVP’s goal is to provide federal agencies with a  security metric to use in validating cryptographic algorithm  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The testing is carried  out by independent third-party laboratories accredited by  the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program  (NVLAP), and the validations performed by the CAVP  program provide this metric. Federal agencies, industry,  and the public can choose validated implementations  of cryptographic algorithms from the CAVP Validated  Algorithms List and have confidence in the claimed level of  security and assurance of correct implementation.  The validation of cryptographic algorithms by the  CAVP is a prerequisite to the validation of a cryptographic  module by the CMVP and is also used by other programs  outside of NIST as well. Since federal agencies are required  to use validated cryptographic modules for the protection of  sensitive unclassified information, the validated modules and  the validated algorithms that the modules contain represent  the culmination and delivery of CSD’s cryptography-based  work to the end user.  The CAVP validation program provides documented  methodologies for conformance testing through defined  sets of security requirements. For the CAVP, a validation  system document is designed for each FIPS-approved  or NIST-recommended cryptographic algorithm. See the  website for a listing (see http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/ cavp/). The four Annexes to FIPS 140-2 reference the  underlying cryptographic algorithm standards or methods.  By the end of 2016, the CAVP had issued approximately  23,559 validations, representing the algorithm validations of  approximately 18 approved algorithms, including 5 modes of  operation.  The CAVP issued approximately 4,000 algorithm  validations in FY 2016, an increase of approximately 600  validations from the previous year. The increase in validations  is attributed to an increase in cryptographic modules being  validated and other outside programs now requiring CAVP  validated implementations, e.g., the National Information  Assurance Partnership (NIAP).  The number of algorithms submitted for validation  continues to grow, representing significant growth in the  number of validations expected to be available in the future.

A u t o m a t e d  S e c u r i t y  T e s t i n g  a n d  T e s t  S u i t e  D e v e l o p m e n t  The CAVP utilizes the requirements and specifications  of the NIST standards (i.e., FIPS and Special Publications) to  develop algorithm validation test suites and an automated  security testing tool. The CAVP is responsible for providing  assurance that the cryptographic algorithm implementations  contained in cryptographic modules are implemented  according to the specifications in the standards. The CAVP  accomplishes this by designing and developing conformance  testing specific to each cryptographic algorithm.  The conformance testing consists of a suite of validation  tests for each approved cryptographic algorithm. These  validation tests exercise the algorithmic requirements  and mathematical formulas to assure that the detailed  specifications are implemented correctly and completely.  If the implementer deviates from the specifications in the  standard or excludes any part of these specifications or  requirements, the validation test will detect the deviations  and fail. The validation testing will indicate that the algorithm  implementation does not function properly or is incomplete.  The cryptographic algorithm validation tests designed  and developed by the CAVP are used by independent third- party laboratories accredited by NVLAP. The laboratory  works with vendors to validate their cryptographic  algorithm implementations. The suite of validation tests for  each algorithm ensures the repeatability of tests and the  equivalency of results across the testing laboratories.  There are several types of validation tests, all designed  to satisfy the testing requirements of the cryptographic  algorithms and their specifications. These include, but are  not limited to, Known-Answer Tests, Monte Carlo Tests,  and Multi-Block Message Tests. The Known-Answer Tests  are designed to examine the individual components of  the algorithm by supplying known values to the variables  and verifying the expected result. Negative testing is also  performed by supplying known incorrect values to assure  that the implementation recognizes values that are not  allowed. The Monte Carlo Test is designed to exercise the  entire implementation-under-test (IUT). This test is designed  to detect the presence of implementation flaws that are not  detected with the controlled input of the Known-Answer  Tests. The types of implementation flaws detected by  this validation test include pointer problems, insufficient  allocation of space, improper error handling, and incorrect  behavior of the IUT. The Multi-Block Message Test (MMT)  is designed to test the ability of the implementation to  process multi-block messages, which requires the chaining  of information from one block to the next.  During the last few years, the CSD Cryptographic  Technology Group (CTG) has expanded its publications  to contain not only the algorithm’s specifications, but  also requirements for an algorithm’s use. Many of these  usage requirements do not fall within the scope of the  CAVP, because the CAVP focuses on the correctness of  the instructions within the algorithm’s boundary. If these  additional algorithm usage requirements are not considered  applicable to the algorithm’s implementation, they cannot  be tested at the algorithm level by the CAVP, but may be  tested by the CMVP if the requirements are considered  applicable to the cryptographic module. However, some of  these usage requirements may be outside the scope of both  the algorithm implementation and cryptographic module.  In this latter case, the fulfillment of the requirements is the  responsibility of entities using, installing, or configuring  applications or protocols that use the cryptographic  algorithms. For example, depending on the design of a  cryptographic module, it may not be possible for the module  to determine whether a specific key is used for multiple  purposes, a situation that is strongly discouraged.

In general, vendors  may opt for product validation for one or more SCAP  capabilities or operating systems. Currently, the program  offers testing on Microsoft Windows and Red Hat Enterprise  Linux platforms. The validation process starts when a vendor  voluntarily submits an SCAP-enabled product to an NVLAP- accredited laboratory. Once the lab completes product  testing, the lab submits a test report to the SCAP Validation  Program at NIST for review. NIST reviews the test report and  awards a validation if all requirements have been met. Once  a validation is awarded, the SCAP Validation Record is sent  to the lab, and the information about the newly validated  product is posted on the SCAP Validated Products web page.  Figure 21: SCAP 1.2 Validation Process illustrates the SCAP 1.2  Validation Process.  All resources and information necessary for preparing  products for SCAP 1.2 validation are published on the SCAP  Validation Program web pages (see the url below). The most  current NISTIR 7511 revision, as well as SCAP capabilities  and supported platforms, are available on the home  page (see http://scap.nist.gov/validation). The resources  page includes documentation, a list of Frequently Asked  Questions (FAQ), the SCAP validation-test content, and  tools for validating and processing SCAP data streams. The  SCAP validation-test content should be used by vendors  for quality assurance testing prior to entering formal SCAP  testing with an NVLAP-accredited laboratory. The open- source tools that are available for download may be used by  SCAP content authors for testing the SCAP source content.  The SCAP Content Validation Tool (SCAPVal) may be used to  determine if the content conforms to the SCAP specification.  Open-source SCAP reference implementation tools, such as  the SCAP Reference Implementation Tool, may be used to  process SCAP data streams.  End users may use information on the SCAP Validation  web page to learn about SCAP validation and find products  that have been awarded validations. The validation records  that are posted on the SCAP Validated Products page identify  the product versions that were tested in the laboratory,  along with details about each validation, such as the tested  platforms, SCAP capabilities, the validation test suite version,  and the lab that performed the product test.  In FY 2016, several products successfully completed  testing and were awarded validations, bringing the total  Figure 21: SCAP 1.2 Validation Process  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Most  vendors of configuration scanning products are SCAP  validated, and vendors continually pursue validation for new  platforms, capabilities, and versions of SCAP. The current  list of SCAP 1.2-validated products may be found on the  SCAP Validated Products list at https://nvd.nist.gov/scap/ validated-tools.  In FY 2017, NISTIR 7511 will be updated, adding  requirements to test products for conformance to  SCAP 1.3. New capabilities include testing the ability of  products to process the most recent Open Vulnerability  and Assessment Language (OVAL) versions and to read  Software Identification (SWID) tags. The modular structure  of the SCAP Validation Program supports the addition  of these new test requirements, as well as new platforms  and capabilities, without needing to re-design the entire  program. Vendors benefit from the modular structure by  choosing the capabilities and platforms that satisfy the  needs of their customers.  F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  http://scap.nist.gov/validation  C O N T A C T :  Ms. Melanie Cook  (301) 975-5259  melanie.cook@nist.gov  I D E N T I T Y  A N D  A C C E S S  M A N A G E M E N T  N I S T  P e r s o n a l  I d e n t i t y  V e r i f i c a t i o n  P r o g r a m  ( N P I V P )  The objective of the NIST Personal Identity  Verification Program (NPIVP) is to validate PIV components  for conformance to the specifications in FIPS 201, Personal  Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and  Contractors, and its companion documents (detailed below).  The two PIV components that come under the scope of NPIVP  are the PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware.  NPIVP test facilities that perform conformance tests for  these two components are Cryptographic and Security  Testing (CST) Laboratories accredited by the NVLAP. As of  September 2016, there were seven such facilities (see http:// csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/testing_facilities.html).  The interface specifications for the PIV Smart Card  Application and PIV Middleware are found in a FIPS 201  companion document, namely, SP 800-73-4, Interfaces for  Personal Identity Verification. The conformance tests for  these specifications are detailed in SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card  Application and Middleware Interface Test Guidelines. To  implement these tests and to generate conformance test  reports, CSD also developed and maintains an integrated  toolkit called the “PIV Interface Test Runner,” which  conducts tests on both PIV Smart Card Applications and PIV  Middleware products. This toolkit is provided to accredited  NPIVP test facilities for product testing and to the general  public as open source software.  The NPIVP team is also closely involved in activities  related to the revision of specifications of the PIV companion  documents, such as SP 800-73, SP 800-76, Biometric  Specifications for Personal Identity Verification, and SP 800- 78, Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal  Identity Verification. This ensures that specification revisions  in the PIV documents are fully reflected in the conformance  test documents, SP 800-85A-4 and SP 800-85B (PIV  Data Model Conformance Test Guidelines) as well as in  the “PIV Interface Test Runner” toolkit. The changes to PIV  specifications in PIV companion documents necessitated  that NPIVP make a major update to the conformance  test documents and consequently to the “PIV Interface  Test Runner” toolkit in 2016. The updated Test Runner is  available at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/npivp/sw- downloads.html.  The NPIVP team also maintains the Validation List for  PIV Smart Card Application and the PIV Middleware products  that are PIV-conformant implementations. Updates to the  PIV Smart Card Application validation list were necessary  in 2016 to comply with the sunset date for some Random  Number Generators (RNGs), as outlined in SP 800-131A,  Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic  Algorithms and Key Lengths. More information about the  sunset can be found at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/ npivp/announcements.html.  In FY 2017, the NPIVP team will continue to fine-tune its  toolkit and perform acceptance testing for PIV Smart Card  Applications and PIV Middleware.

HSPD-12 called for  the creation of a new identity credential for federal employees  and contractors. FIPS 201 is the technical specification for  both the PIV identity credential and the PIV system that  produces, manages, and uses the credential. Within NIST’s  Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), this work is a  collaborative effort of the CSD and the Information Access  Division (IAD). CSD activities in FY 2016 directly supported  the latest revision of FIPS 201 (i.e., FIPS 201-2) by updating  the relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2 and by  developing several new publications. CSD performed the  following activities during FY 2016 in support of HSPD-12:  •  Published Draft SP 800-116 Revision 1, A  Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials  in Physical Access Control Systems (PACS). This  document provides best practice guidelines  for integrating the PIV Card with the PACS that  authenticate the PIV cardholders in federal facilities.  The document recommends a risk-based approach  for selecting appropriate PIV authentication  mechanisms to manage physical access to Federal  Government facilities and assets.  •  Published SP 800-156, Representation of PIV Chain- of-Trust for Import and Export. This document  provides the data representation of a chain-of-trust  record for the exchange of records between issuers.  The exchanged record can be used by an agency to  personalize a PIV Card for a transferred employee,  or by a service provider to personalize a PIV Card  on behalf of client federal agencies. The data  representation is based on a common XML schema  to facilitate interoperable information sharing  and data exchange. The document also provides  support for data integrity through digital signatures  and confidentiality through encryption of chain-of- trust data in transit and at rest.  •  Published a white paper, Best Practices for  Privileged User PIV Authentication, in response  to OMB’s 30-day Cybersecurity Sprint effort  and subsequent OMB Memorandum M-16-04,  Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation Plan  (CSIP) for the Federal Civilian Government, which  requires federal agencies to use PIV credentials for  authenticating privileged users. The white paper  outlines the risks of password-based single-factor  authentication, and describes best practices for the  use of multi-factor PIV-based user authentication  for privileged users.  •  Published SP 800-166, Derived PIV Application and  Data Model Test Guidelines. SP 800-166 contains  the derived test requirements and test assertions  for testing the Derived PIV Application and  associated Derived PIV data objects residing on a  mobile device. The tests verify the conformance of  these artifacts to the technical specifications of SP  800-157, Guidelines for Derived Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) Credentials. SP 800-157 specifies  standards-based, secure, reliable, interoperable  public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based identity  credentials. SP 800-166 is targeted at vendors  of Derived PIV Applications, issuers of Derived  PIV Credentials, and entities that will conduct  conformance tests on these applications and  credentials.  •  Published SP 800-85A-4, PIV Card Application and  Middleware Interface Test Guidelines (SP 800-73-4  Compliance), to align the testing requirements with  FIPS 2012, SP 800-73-4, and SP 800-78-4.  In FY 2017, CSD will continue to focus on updating  relevant publications associated with FIPS 201-2, including  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/  C O N T A C T S :  Ms. Hildegard Ferraiolo  Dr. David Cooper  (301) 975-6972  (301) 975-3194  hildegard.ferraiolo@nist.gov  david.cooper@nist.gov  Dr. Ramaswamy Chandramouli  (301) 975-5013  mouli@nist.gov  A u t h e n t i c a t i o n To support Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) requirements, CSD developed SP 800-63, Electronic  Authentication Guideline. OMB defines four levels of  assurance that a federal agency must select, based on a risk  assessment to determine the impact of an authentication  failure. This guideline covers remote authentication of users  (such as private individuals) interacting with government IT  systems over the Internet. It defines technical requirements  for each of the four levels of assurance in the areas of identity  proofing, authenticators, credential binding, management  processes, authentication protocols and federation. The  newest revision underway in 2016 establishes three individual  assurance categories that can map into the original OMB  levels of assurance. The categories are:  •  Identity Assurance Level - the robustness of the  identity proofing process and the binding between  an authenticator and the records pertaining to a  specific individual;  •  Authentication Assurance Level - the robustness  of the authentication process itself; and,  •  Federation Assurance Level - the robustness  of the assertion protocol utilized by a federation  to communicate authentication and attribute  information (if applicable) to a relying party.  Since the initial release of SP 800-63, CSD has released  two revisions to address changes in modern technology and  lessons learned from practical implementations by federal  departments and agencies.  In addition, market forces have resulted in an inflexion  point in how departments and agencies authenticate users.  NIST and the private-sector partners have observed that  some public and private-sector identity assurance standards  have become outdated or have simply not been adopted.  Specifically, SP 800-63 was originally written to address an  online world that is much different than today. Innovation  has offered new perspectives in how trusted identities can  be established. Practical implementations of SP 800-63  have informed us of areas of strengths, weaknesses, and  techniques not utilized by federal agencies or the private  sector. Note that our online adversaries are targeting user  names and passwords as the simplest point of entry to gain  unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.  CSD, in collaboration with the ACD Trusted Identities  Group, hosted the two-day workshop “Applying  Measurement Science in the Identity Ecosystem” in January  2016. NIST gathered critical feedback from over 200 industry,  academic, and public-sector stakeholders regarding new  directions that NIST should take in authentication guidance  and in methods for measuring the strength of relevant  technologies and processes. The workshop culminated in  the release of NISTIR 8103, Advanced Identity Workshop on  Applying Measurement Science in the Identity Ecosystem:  Summary and Next Steps.  In May 2016, ITL released a public preview draft of NIST  SP 800-63-3, with an updated name, Digital Authentication  Guideline. This body of work represents a significant departure  from prior versions of the special publication. The guideline  has been divided into a family of standalone documents that  focus on outcomes and innovation where possible, rather  than prescriptive processes and technologies (see Figure  23). A significant number of requirements were updated  Figure 23: New SP 800-63-3 Structure  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

SP 800-63-3, while required for  federal agencies, suggests requirements for solutions often  provided by the private sector; hence, many updates were  garnered from innovation in the market, workshop feedback,  and a dialog with all sectors while the guideline was open  for comment. CSD and ACD also piloted a new approach  to managing stakeholder feedback and document updates.  During the development of the SP 800-63 revision, drafts  of the documents were made available on GitHub, an online  version management and collaboration tool that allowed us  to openly discuss comments in real time and accept edits  directly into the document from ITL stakeholders. This was  the first time that an 800 series draft Special Publication was  published on GitHub; the use of GitHub proved successful  and will continue to be used to manage SP 800-63-3 as the  document transitions from public preview to final version.  In FY 2017, CSD will publish the final SP 800-63-3  revision, giving agencies an increased set of secure, privacy- enhancing, and user-friendly options to deliver safe digital  services to their constituents. The final version may also serve  as a foundation for future authentication shared services  that the government will offer, such as those directed by the  Cybersecurity National Action Plan (CNAP).  Work on 800-63-3 will continue after the document  becomes final. ITL will work on identifying ways to measure  authentication systems in a more systematic and scientific  way, allowing NIST to specify additional metrics that would  be required in future authentication systems, based on risk.  Work on biometric authentication will capitalize on the  opportunity to enhance the authentication performance and  security of a range of modalities (e.g., fingerprint, voice, or  iris recognition). NIST will explore the inclusion of additional  industry best practices into future revisions of SP 800-63-3.  NIST will also research methods to ensure that practices align  with the security and privacy demands of digital services  offered by government. In addition to the topics described  above, the team will research approaches that harmonize  U.S. Government requirements on an international scale,  promoting easy-to-implement cross-border trusted identity  solutions. This helps avoid challenges that result from  disparate, nationally unique authentication guidelines that  may disrupt international interoperability.

Practical and conceptual guidance for these topics is needed.  In FY 2016, the following activities were accomplished  for this project:  •  Researched the requirement and capabilities  for Access Control (AC) policy composing and  verification technology;  •  Studied attribute considerations for access  mechanism implementation; the results are  presented in the internal draft of a NIST SP,  Attribute Consideration for Access Control Systems  (no publication number has been assigned to this  internal draft SP), which is scheduled to be released  during FY 2017);  •  Researched the AC requirements and functions for  distributed systems, including Big Data, Cloud, IoT,  and the Smart Grid; and  •  Published NIST SP 800-178, A Comparison of  Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Standards  for Data Services, and worked on two internal draft  NIST SPs: 1) Draft SP 800-192: Verification and Test  Methods for Access Control Polices/Models, and  2) Draft SP (no number yet assigned), Attribute  Consideration for Access Control Systems; both  SPs are related to access control and privilege  management.  In FY 2017, CSD will continue the above research. CSD  expects that this project will:  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of community  computing that utilizes the power of shared  resources and common trust-management  schemes;  •  Provide guidance for implementing access control  models and mechanisms for standalone or network  systems;  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Faulty policies,  misconfigurations, or flaws in software implementation can  result in serious vulnerabilities. The specification of access  control policies is often a challenging problem. Often, a  system’s privacy and security are compromised due to  the misconfiguration of access control policies, instead of  the failure of cryptographic primitives or protocols. This  problem becomes increasingly severe as software systems  become more and more complex, and are deployed to  manage a large amount of sensitive information and  resources that are organized into sophisticated structures.  Identifying discrepancies between policy specifications and  their properties (their intended function) is crucial because  the correct implementation and enforcement of policies  by applications is based on the premise that the policy  specifications are correct. As a result, policy specifications  must undergo rigorous verification and validation through  systematic testing to ensure that the policy specifications  truly encapsulate the desires of the policy authors.  To formally and precisely capture the security properties  that AC should adhere to, access control models are usually  written to bridge the rather wide gap in abstraction between  policy and mechanism. Thus, an access control model  provides unambiguous and precise expression as well as  a reference for the design and implementation of security  requirements. Techniques are required for verifying whether  an access control model is correctly expressed in the access  control policies, and whether the properties are satisfied in  the model.

Even though  correct verification is achieved, and counter-examples may  be generated when faults are found, those methods provide  no information about the source of faults that might allow  conflicts in privilege assignment, the leakage of privileges, or  a conflict-of-interest in permissions. The difficulty in finding  the source of faults is increased, especially when the AC  rules are intricately covering duplicated variables to a degree  of complexity. The complexity is because a fault might not  be caused by one particular access rule. Thus, it requires  manually analyzing each rule in the policy to find the correct  solution for correcting the fault.  To address the issue, CSD developed the Access Control  Property Tool (ACPT), shown in Figure 25, which allows a user  to compose, verify, test, and generate access control policies.  CSD also researched the AC Rule Logic Circuit Simulation  (ACRLCS) technique, which enables the AC authors to detect  a fault when the fault-causing AC rule is added to the policy,  so the fix can be implemented in real time before adding  other rules that further complicate the detecting effort,  rather than checking by retracing the interrelations between  rules after the policy is completed.  In FY 2016, CSD accomplished the following:  •  Funded and supported two Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II projects for  access control tool developments;  •  Enhanced the usability and fixed bugs of the  ACRLCS (the Access Control Rule Logic Circuit  Simulation System) to provide more capability for  policy fault detection;  •  Published a conference paper: General Methods for  Access Control Policy Verification, and an article:  Access Control Policy Verification for policy test  case generation;  •  Worked with industrial and academic organizations  in exploring new capabilities that helped to  improve the usability of the AC tools (ACPT and  ACRLCS), resulting in additional usage; ACPT  was downloaded by 405 users and organizations;  and  •  Enhanced the capability of ACPT by adding an  object inheritance capability for basic access  control models.

Figure 25 (See previous page) shows the system  architecture of the NIST Access Control Policy Tool (ACPT),  which allows access control policy authors to compose,  verify, and test access control policy implementation.  This project is expected to:  •  Provide a generic paradigm and framework of  access control model/property conformance  testing;  •  Provide templates for specifying access control  rules in popular access control models, such as  the Attribute Based, Multilevel, and Workflow  models;  •  Provide tools or services for checking the security  and safety of an access control implementation,  policy combination, and eXtensible Access Control  Markup Language (XACML) policy generation;  •  Promote (or accelerate) the adoption of  combinatorial testing for large-system testing  (such as an access control system);  •  Promote the concept of detecting AC policy faults  in real-time AC rule composing;  •  Provide an innovative method for specifying  AC rules formed by Boolean logic expressions  operated on variables of AC rules;  •  Provide techniques for preventing faults in  enforcing fundamental security properties,  including Cyclic Inheritance, Privilege Escalation,  and Separation of Duty; and  •  Provide new methods for composing standard  mandatory AC models, such as Attribute-Based  Access Control (ABAC) and Multi-Level Security  (MLS) as well as some fundamental security  properties.

For  example, access to a database could be restricted to users  with particular attributes, such as membership in a group  (e.g., employees) and other conditions (e.g., part of the  Human Resource Department). ABAC represents a point on  the spectrum of logical access control, from simple access  control lists to more capable role-based access (RBAC), and  finally, to a highly flexible method for providing access based  on the evaluation of attributes.  CSD is conducting research that provides information  for using ABAC to improve information sharing within  and among organizations based on the planning, design,  implementation, and operational considerations. The  research also includes technologies such as attribute  assurance, attribute engineering/management, identity  system integration, attribute federation, situational  awareness (real-time or contextual) mechanisms, policy  management, and natural-language policy translation  to digital policy. Figure 26 (See next page) illustrates the  interaction of many of these components. The goal of this  research is to improve information sharing, while maintaining  control of that information for federal agencies.  In FY 2016, the project team:  •  Worked on the book Attribute-Based Access  Control – Models & Deployments; publishing is  planned for March 2017 by Artech House;  •  Published NIST Special Publication 800-178, A  Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control  (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications  document; and  •  Continued research, in partnership with the  Trusted Identities Group (TIG) and the National  Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE),  on the attribute assurance of ABAC.  In FY 2017, CSD will continue the research of ABAC  formal models, as well as details and extended topics of  ABAC capabilities, such as attribute considerations, ABAC  implementation examples, ABAC mechanisms, and ABAC  standards.

Through the promotion of government and commercial  adoption of privacy-enhancing, secure, interoperable,  and easy-to-use identity solutions, the TIG drives trust,  convenience, and innovation in digital identity.  The TIG is a partnership model that supports the private  sector, advances risk management practices, develops  and revises guidance and standards to be co-developed  with private and public stakeholders, assists agencies in  the implementation of identity solutions in their systems,  promotes international interoperability of identity standards  and solutions, and funds innovative projects through pilots  and other funding mechanisms.  To achieve these ends, the TIG is working to advance  measurement science, technology, and standards adoption  in digital identity by focusing on four primary tactics:  partnerships, publications, market intelligence, and  communications.  P a r t n e r s h i p s  External Projects. The TIG funds external projects,  including a pilot program that impacted more than 6.7  million individuals in its first four years. These projects aim  to catalyze the marketplace to begin developing solutions  aligned with the guiding principles. The marketplace  is currently transitioning from broad market issues to  targeting specific gaps and market impediments as the  identity ecosystem matures. The pilots develop and  deploy technology, models, and frameworks that wouldn’t  otherwise exist in the marketplace. In FY 2016, the pilot  programs made remarkable progress; the 24 projects include  more than 170 partner organizations across 12 sectors— including the development or deployment of 14 multi-factor  authentication solutions. Over the course of the fiscal year,  six new pilots were launched (including five supporting state  services and one driving federated identity in healthcare)  (See https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/pilot-projects).  Figure 27: NIST employs four primary tactics:  partnerships, publications, market intelligence, and  communications  Identity Ecosystem Framework. The privately- led Identity Ecosystem Steering Group (IDESG) laid the  groundwork for better digital identity transactions with  the release of the Identity Ecosystem Framework (IDEF) in  early FY 2016. The IDEF lays a foundation for the Identity  Ecosystem by providing a baseline set of requirements that  define how to execute transactions involving digital identity  that puts users at the center by aligning with the four  guiding principles, continually improving online commerce,  the efficiency of digital services, and online interactions  (see http://www.idesg.org/News-Events/Press-Releases/ ID/74/Identity-Ecosystem-Framework-Released-Creating- Unprecedented-Rules-of-the-Road-for-Online-Identity).  Strategic partners. The TIG works alongside many  professional organizations, agencies, and entities in the  identity community on a daily basis. Their partnerships allow  them to gain stronger insights, evolve their thinking and  ideas, create more robust publications, orchestrate successful  events, participate in speaking engagements across the  country, bring in outside experts to review TIG federal funding  opportunities, and allow for a broader reach of messaging  and announcements. Under this model, the TIG works to co- develop NIST publications, creating an increasingly inclusive  approach to producing the best possible documents. The  TIG also works directly with agencies on their solutions to  provide expert advice in the risk management of identity  solutions and the implementation of those solutions.  Several publications were released in 2016 (many  through the use of GitHub, to best ensure that the broad  community can stay involved in their efforts and that they  are transparent and informative every step of the way).  Details are provided below; the list is current as of the end  of FY 2016. The updated publications list can be found on  the TIG resources page (see https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/ resources).

This work aids NIST  in measuring the market shift toward these solutions  and  honing efforts moving forward so NIST most effectively uses  program resources. This increases the likelihood that, with  each new initiative, the TIG meets the market—rather than  expecting the market to meet them.  C o m m u n i c a t i o n s  The TIG also leverages external communications to  inform the public about its work and engage a variety of  audiences to collaborate on projects as well as to align  efforts and maximize the impact of NIST’s investment in  cybersecurity initiatives. The TIG works with government and  industry groups to raise public awareness of cybersecurity  tools and concepts, such as by collaborating with the  National Cybersecurity Alliance on campaigns, including  Lock Down Your Login, National Cybersecurity Awareness  Month, and Data Privacy Day. The TIG also regularly shares  achievements and announcements via published documents,  speaking engagements all over the country, webinars, their  website and blog, social media engagement and outreach,  and customized events for stakeholders. For instance, in FY  2016, the TIG coordinated the Advanced Identity Workshop,  which brought together over 200 technology vendors,  cybersecurity researchers, policy makers, and other experts  from the public and commercial sectors.  In FY 2017, the TIG will continue to work to advance  measurement science, technology, and standards adoption  in identity management and focus on their four primary  tactics of partnerships, publications, market intelligence,  and communications. The TIG plans to also move on to new  endeavors, such as:  •  The identification of opportunities and  mechanisms to complement the work of their pilot  programs;  •  Increased work alongside federal agencies to  address specific identity challenges through the  NCCoE;  • New research projects;  • Additional standards work;  •  Increased communication efforts to educate  audiences of all types;  •  Continued engagement with various NIST programs  to further integrate the Identity Ecosystem into  NIST cybersecurity efforts; and,  • Continued focus on industry engagement.

CSD tracks software security vulnerabilities (in  the National Vulnerability Database), and seeks techniques  for the measurement of security vulnerabilities and  techniques that reduce the impact and prevalence of  security vulnerabilities in newly developed products or in  new versions of existing products.  One approach to reducing the number of security  vulnerabilities in software is to improve the development  tools that are available. By identifying languages and  software development tools that support a reduction of  vulnerabilities, and by stimulating the creation of better  tools and tool usage techniques, the approach should help  developers produce applications with fewer vulnerabilities.  While it is impossible to assure the total absence of security  vulnerabilities in this way, it might well be possible to rule out  specific, significant classes of vulnerabilities that currently  provide the basis for many serious exploits.  CSD is developing an empirical, competitive approach  to finding the most effective and usable combinations of  tools to produce software systems that are relatively free  of exploitable vulnerabilities. Multiple competitions are  planned that will be based on an idea developed during  the Designing a Secure Systems Engineering Competition  Workshop that was conducted by the National Science  Foundation in 2010. The workshop proposed a competition  for the development of a set of tools to help non-security- expert developers to rapidly build a significant application  with zero vulnerabilities, as detected by an extensive public  test suite.  The participants in the planned competitions would  implement software systems to solve challenge problems  using software development tool chains (“toolchains”)  of their own choosing, within specified time periods. The  toolchains may include existing technologies (e.g., existing  software libraries and frameworks, code generators, reusable  source code, or bug-finding tools), novel technologies, or any  combination thereof. Each competition would apply a time  pressure by simulating a deadline in the software development  process, increasing the likelihood of an introduction of  security flaws. The objective of the toolchains would be to  detect or prevent security flaws while still supporting the  quick-paced software development of applications with  rich feature sets. Through the demonstration of security- flaw avoidance in a time-constrained setting, CSD would  seek to show that wide-scale improvements in the overall  security of software products could be realized without  sacrificing a time-to-market goal. The competitions, which  would be open to all interested parties, would aim to provide  consistent application and measurement of commercial and  research software development, composition, and reuse  techniques.  In FY 2016, CSD partially reformulated the existing  toolchain testing infrastructure to mitigate test infrastructure  reliability problems uncovered by a dry run of the competition  and by subsequent inspections. A key part of this  reformulation was the consolidation of multiple operating  systems into a single operating system for all components.  Additionally, CSD developed an installation guide to assist  with the building, installing, and operating of the toolchain  testing infrastructure. The current infrastructure uses several  third-party components and concurrently-running virtual  machines. The installation guide describes the required  system configurations, account provisioning on local hosts,  installation and integration of third-party components  and packages, and the network configuration. An updated  version of these elements as well as a document describing  the manual steps for performing simplified, script-oriented  testing in the absence of a continuous integration system  was also developed.  In FY 2017, CSD plans to substantially simplify portions  of the testing infrastructure to improve reliability and  reproducibility, to perform a second round of testing, and to  publicly announce the first toolchain competition.

This means that they should exhibit secure, reliable,  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Privacy is particularly important because IoT-based systems  will likely produce huge amounts of data as a result of  sensing and surveillance (see references 1, 3, and 4 below).  This is the “big data” challenge associated with IoT. Therefore,  techniques, tools, and methods to mitigate the numerous  “trust” challenges are needed before these automated IoT- based networks manage much of daily life.  Historically, there has been little in the way of formal,  analytic, or even descriptive information about the building  blocks that govern the operation, trustworthiness, and life  cycle of the Internet of Things. A composability model and  vocabulary that defines principles common to most, if not  all networks of things, was needed to address the question:  “What is the science, if any, underlying IoT?” NIST SP 800- 183, Networks of ‘Things’ does exactly that – it offers an  underlying and foundational science to IoT that is based on a  belief that IoT involves sensing, computing, communication,  and actuation. The document describes five core building  blocks (called primitives): (1) sensor, (2) aggregator, (3)  communication channel, (4) eUtility, and (5) decision trigger.  SP 800-183 is unique in that it uses two acronyms, IoT and  NoT (Network of Things), extensively and interchangeably. IoT  is the outward facing acronym that most people are familiar  with; a NoT is an unfamiliar term, but has the advantage of  referencing a more specific set of interconnected objects to  which one can apply the building blocks described above.  The relationship between IoT and NoT is subtle—IoT is an  instantiation of a NoT, whereby IoT has its “things” tethered  to the Internet. A different type of NoT could be a Local Area  Network (LAN), with none of its “things” connected to the  Internet. Social media networks, sensor networks, and the  Industrial Internet are all variants of NoTs. This differentiation  in terminology helps to separate use cases of varying vertical  and quality domains (transportation, medical, financial,  agricultural, safety-critical, security-critical, performance- critical, and high assurance, to name a few). The distinctions  are useful since there is no singular IoT, and it is meaningless  to speak of comparing one IoT to another. But one NoT can  be compared to another NoT – that makes this viewpoint and  the associated definition actionable.  Future work in this area will refine the definitions of the  five core NoT building blocks. For example, instead of just  considering an all-purpose sensor, categories of sensors will  be explored. This will involve a decomposition of the building  blocks. The research team will also demonstrate how to apply  these definitions to vertical markets. In addition, the team will  present these results in Revision 1 of NIST SP 800-183, which  should be produced in late 2017 or early 2018.  F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  1.

During his  talk, titled “Intermediaries in Cloud-Computing”, which was  presented at the Institute for Operations Research and the  Management Sciences (INFORMS) meeting in Dallas, Texas,  he referred to a cloud as an important new “computing  paradigm where the boundaries of computing will be  determined by economic rationale rather than technical  limits alone.” The international IT literature and media later  provided many definitions, models, and architectures, but it  was not until 2011, when NIST published SP 800-145, The NIST  Definition of Cloud Computing, that the world coalesced on  the cloud deployment and service models, definitions and  descriptions provided in SP 800-145.  Following the December 2010 Federal Government’s  “Cloud First” policy issued as part of the 25-point plan for  the U.S. Federal Government’s (USG) IT modernization  and reform, NIST assumed a technical leadership role for  the federal agencies’ efforts related to the adoption and  development of cloud computing standards. The goal was  to accelerate the Federal Government’s adoption of secure  and effective cloud computing solutions to reduce costs and  improve services.  In addition to the initial definition of cloud computing,  NIST built a USG cloud computing technology roadmap  that focused on security, interoperability, and portability  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

NIST also developed a  cloud computing reference architecture, a security reference  architecture and, during 2016, focused on developing  the guidance for applying a risk-based approach to cloud  adoption and the guidance for applying the SP 800-53  Revision 4 security and privacy controls to cloud-based  federal information systems.  During FY 2016, NIST also started researching the  security challenges encountered when leveraging application  containers and microservices for the implementation of  cloud-based federal information systems and the security  challenges encountered when implementing cloud-based  federated identity solutions, along with the impact on the  system’s security posture. Some of the current work is  focusing on the development of an open security controls  assessment language (OSCAL) that aims to revolutionize  every step in the life cycle of a cloud-based information  system and on the development of a cloud forensics  reference architecture that is derived from the cloud security  reference architecture mentioned above. Details regarding  the latest projects are provided below.  C S D  R o l e  i n  t h e  N I S T  C l o u d  C o m p u t i n g  P r o g r a m  During FY 2016, NIST continued to promote the  development of publications, national and international  standards, and specifications in support of the USG’s effective  and secure use of cloud computing, as well as providing  technical guidance to federal agencies for secure and  effective cloud-computing adoption. During FY 2016, NIST’s  cloud computing security and forensic science activities  included the development of the following guidance and/or  recommendations:  •  NIST Draft SP 800-173, Guide for Applying the  Risk Management Framework to Cloud-based  Federal Information Systems. This publication  provides guidance in using the Risk Management  Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision  1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management  Framework to Federal Information Systems:  a Security Life Cycle Approach, to issue an  authorization to operate for cloud-based  information systems. The draft document will  be posted for public comment by December 31,  2016.  •  NIST Draft SP 800-174, Security and Privacy  Controls for Cloud-based Federal Information  Systems. This document, which is anticipated to  be available for public comments by the end of the  first quarter of 2017, provides a cloud overlay of the  SP 80053 Revision 4 security controls for cloud- based ecosystems.  NIST is also leading the research and development  of the projects listed below:  •  Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group, in collaboration with the Cloud Security  Alliance’s members are researching the security  challenges encountered when leveraging  application containers and microservices for  the implementation of cloud-based information  systems. Based on this research, NIST will issue  an interagency report documenting the findings  and will provide recommendations based on  best practices for mitigating the identified  challenges.  •  Members of the NIST Cloud Security Working  Group are researching the security challenges  encountered when implementing cloud-based  federated identity solutions and the impact on  the overall system’s security posture. Based  on this research, NIST will issue an interagency  report documenting the findings and will provide  recommendations based on the best practices for  mitigating the identified challenges.  •  Members of the NIST Cloud Forensic Science  Working Group are working on defining a cloud  forensics reference architecture that leverages NIST  SP 500-299: Cloud Security Reference Architecture  and NISTIR 8006, NIST Cloud Computing Forensic  Science Challenges.  •  Members of a NIST-led Tiger Team is developing  an OSCAL, a hierarchical, formal language that  aims to support the transfer of security information  in formats that are compliant with the security  controls catalog of choice.  In support of U.S. cloud-computing mandates, CSD  staff members provide leadership for several public  cloud working groups operating under the NIST Cloud  Computing Program. These working groups focus on  meeting the high-priority requirements described in  NIST SP 500-293, U.S. Government Cloud Computing  Technology Roadmap.  CSD staff co-chaired several significant cloud  computing efforts in 2016:  •  Co-Chaired the NIST Cloud Computing Security  Working Group and led the working group on  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

CSD staff members participated in various standards  development organizations, all listed in the section of this  report dedicated to international standards.  In FY 2017, NIST will continue collaboration with the  private sector, academia and other public-sector entities  on developing guidance and specifications that support the  broad adoption of innovative cloud solutions. Some of the  very effective frameworks for such collaborations that NIST  is hosting are the public working groups with international  participation.

The Policy Machine (PM) is a fundamental reworking of  traditional access control into a form suited to the needs of  a modern, distributed, interconnected enterprise. The PM is  based on a flexible infrastructure that can provide access  control services for several different types of resources that  are accessed by different types of applications and users.  The PM infrastructure is scalable and can support policies of  various types simultaneously while remaining manageable in  the face of changing technology, organizational restructuring,  and increasing amounts of data. The PM provides a framework  capable of supporting combinations of both current access  control approaches and newly conceived types of policy  without extension.  NIST and other members of an Ad Hoc INCITS working  group are continuing to develop a three-part NGAC standard.  This work is being conducted under three sub-projects:  •  Project 2193–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Implementation Requirements, Protocols and API  Definitions;  •  Project 2194–D: Next Generation Access Control –  Functional Architecture; and  •  Project 2195–D: Next Generation Access  Control – Generic Operations and Abstract Data  Structures.  An initial standard from this work was published  in 2013 and is now available from ANSI as INCITS 499:  NGAC Functional Architecture (NGAC–FA). However, based  on experience with similar efforts (e.g., Project 2193-D,  Project 2195-D, and the revised NISTIR 7987, Policy Machine:  Features, Architecture, and Specification), work is underway  to update this standard.  In 2016, the standard for Project 2195-D was approved  and is now available from the ANSI e-standards store as  INCITS 526: NGAC Generic Operations and Abstract Data  Structures (NGAC-GOADS).  The eXtensible Access Control Markup Language  (XACML) and NGAC are very different ABAC standards with  similar goals and objectives. What are the similarities and  differences between these two standards? What are their  comparative advantages and disadvantages? To answer  these questions, in October 2016 NIST published SP 800- 178, A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC)  Standards for Data Service Applications: Extensible Access  Control Markup Language (XACML) and Next Generation  Access Control (NGAC), to describe and compare these  standards with respect to the criteria derived from ABAC  issues or considerations identified by NIST SP 800-162, Guide  to Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Definition and  Considerations: operational efficiency, attribute and policy  management, scope and type of policy support, and support  for administrative review and resource discovery.

The new version will reflect new features and enhanced  performance, and will complete (for purposes of balloting)  the revised INCITS 499, and the Project 2193–D standard.

This  technology has been used not only for configuring and  deploying virtualized hosts (Server Virtualization) but also  for virtual networks (Network Virtualization) and virtualized  storage (Storage Virtualization). Together, these three  components constitute the virtualized infrastructure in a  data center.  The core component of a virtualized infrastructure is  the virtualized host (i.e., a physical host running a server  virtualization product) that can support multiple computing  stacks (called Virtual Machines or VMs), each with a different  platform configuration (e.g., operating system (OS)) and  each with unique security needs. Application programs  loaded into a VM are often valuable server programs (e.g.,  webserver, database management system) that support  important business processes and generally need more  security protection than do other virtual hosts such as  workstations. Protection for application programs in a  VM (in fact for the entire VM) can be provided through a  combination of the following: the secure configuration of  the virtualized host, the secure configuration of the virtual  network and the secure configuration of the virtualized  storage associated with the VM.  Just like their physical counterparts (i.e., physical servers),  VMs can be protected through host-level and network-level  security measures. Hence, the focus of research in FY 2014  and prior years was on the secure configuration of the  virtualized hosts (specifically Hypervisor configuration and  deployment). Recognizing the fact that VMs are the end- nodes of a virtual network, research on the secure virtual  network configuration for VM protection was started in FY  2015 and continued in FY 2016. The outcome of the research  was the identification of four virtual network configuration  areas impacting VM security: network segmentation,  network path redundancy, traffic control using firewalls,  and VM traffic monitoring. Each area was analyzed, and  the corresponding security recommendations have been  provided.  In FY 2016, the project team produced the following  two publications: Analysis of Virtual Networking Options  for Securing Virtual Machines which was submitted to the  Seventh International Conference on Cloud Computing,  GRIDs, and Virtualization (CLOUD COMPUTING 2016) (Note:  The abstract to this paper can be found in the Publications  Released FY 2016 – Conference Papers section later in this  Annual Report), and SP 800-125B, Secure Virtual Network  Configuration for Virtual Machine (VM) Protection.  In FY 2017, research on the secure configuration of  the third component of a virtualized infrastructure (i.e.,  virtualized storage) will continue. The resulting findings  and security recommendations will either be included as  additions to SP 800-125A, Security Recommendations for  Hypervisor Deployment, or as a separate document.

Cyber threat  information includes indicators (i.e., artifacts or observable  events that suggest that an attack is imminent, that an  attack is underway, or that a compromise may have already  occurred); information about the tactics, techniques, and  procedures (TTPs) of actors; recommended courses of  action; and other information that is used to characterize  threats. Because threat actors often use the same  TTPs against multiple targets, exchanging cyber threat  information allows organizations to leverage the collective  knowledge, experience, and analysis capabilities of their  peers, thereby increasing the overall awareness and security  of an entire sharing community.

CSD has established a cyber threat information sharing  initiative, which is focused on providing guidance on how  an organization can establish information sharing and  coordination capabilities that enhance or augment their  existing cybersecurity practices. The guidance covers threat- informed detection, protection and response capabilities;  data privacy and sensitivity; data collection and retention  practices; the use of open standards for information exchange;  de-identification and anonymization; and guidance on how  an organization can establish, participate in, and maintain  coordination and information sharing relationships. The  guidance will help incident responders, network defenders,  and operations personnel consider what information is  sharable, the circumstances under which sharing is permitted,  with whom the information may be shared, and how the  information should be protected.  As an example of this guidance, in FY 2016, CSD  released a second draft of SP 800-150, Guide to Cyber Threat  Information Sharing. The draft publication was released for  public comment on April 21, 2016. This publication is intended  to help organizations prepare for an exchange of cyber  threat information, both consuming cyber threat information  from external sources and producing information for other  organizations to use. Organizations may have substantially  different capabilities for detecting threats, responding to  attacks, diagnosing causes, and handling sensitive incident- related information, but this guidance is intended to help  organizations collaborate and exchange cyber threat  information despite these organizational differences. CSD  will release the final version of SP 800-150, in October 2016.  In FY 2017, CSD plans to continue to conduct research,  prepare guidance, and participate in standards development  activities that are focused on increased interoperability  and operational tempo through near real-time cyber threat  information sharing, including:  •  Expressing cyber threat information using machine- readable formats,  •  Developing automated mechanisms for exchanging  cyber threat information,  •  Describing automated courses of action,  •  Publishing cyber threat information metadata,  and  •  Safeguarding cyber threat information.  NIST will also help foster cyber threat information sharing  by supporting information sharing initiatives by public and  private sector organizations, including:  •  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers  (ISACs),  •  Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations  (ISAOs),  • Federal/State/Local agencies,  • Law Enforcement,  • Fusion Centers, and  • Sector Coordinating Councils.

Recommendations have included the usage of passwords,  biometrics, authentication hardware devices, and Public Key  Infrastructure (PKI) solutions in enterprise settings. In FY  2015, CSD began researching the classification of general  authentication features. This investigation was prompted  by the general call to move away from passwords toward  the growing number of alternative authentication methods  (e.g., biometrics, smart cards, etc.). A notional ontology  of authentication was developed that included a detailed  taxonomy, a metrology, and a framework for assessing  alternatives.  Research over the past year led to updates to the  authentication taxonomy (see Figure 28) to encapsulate  current and emerging mechanisms and was the basis for  Expanding Continuous Authentication with Mobile Devices,  which was published in the IEEE Computer magazine. The  taxonomy now covers a wide assortment of commonly used  human-machine, machine-machine, human-human, and  attribute attestation methods. Human-human authentication  was included due to the number of systems that use human  interaction as a backup system when a user has trouble with  a man-machine interface. In addition, the research uncovered  an emerging branch of authentication –continuous  authentication – that supports user monitoring as a part of  the authentication.

The measurement framework separates metrics  into security, usability, deployability, and manageability  categories (see Figure 29). It is important to note that  each category may overlap or impact the others. Security  and usability are of special interest; while usability is often  thought of as a tradeoff to security, both must be satisfied  for the user to support the security of the system.  Figure 29: Suitability Framework for Authentication  The security category is broken down into the following  foundational areas:  • Uniqueness of the relationship to the entity,  •  Protection and resilience of a token against  compromise,  • Protection of a token during delivery,  • Protection of metadata in storage, and  • Protection / resilience of storage backup.  The usability category follows the ISO 9241-11 (1988)  areas of:  • Effectiveness,  • Efficiency, and  • Satisfaction.  Specific methods of calculating measurements in these  categories are not currently included and may be unique  to each authentication mechanism and environment. The  framework supports integration with the programmatic  categories of deployability and manageability, but  measurement areas in these categories are not currently  defined, as they are often well specified within organizations.  Future programmatic efforts will be focused toward  a NISTIR to describe the research results, encourage  further discussion with the community, and provide  recommendations for future standards development efforts,  with the goal of moving toward specifying independently  measurable strength requirements rather than specific  implementation requirements.

As  this program is to eventually define the future development  of standards, concerns as to the immediate adoptability  were received and will inform future research. Additional  work to identify interdependencies, such as with identity  management and authorization controls and requirements,  should help allay these concerns.  In addition, NIST CSD will work with the community in FY  2017 to identify and address common areas of authentication  requirements to create a framework for researching and  developing authentication mechanisms using this ontology.  If a clear metrology can be established, future access control  process implementations should be less susceptible to  vulnerabilities specific to individual implementations.

As a public-private partnership, industry  experts and technology partners—from Fortune 50 market  leaders to smaller companies specializing in IT security— choose to work with the NCCoE to develop practical, example  cybersecurity solutions using standards, best practices, and  commercially available technology. The NCCoE documents  these example solutions in the NIST Special Publication  1800 series, which maps technical capabilities to the NIST  Cybersecurity Framework and details the steps needed to  recreate the example solution in the real world. The NCCoE  aims to provide practical cybersecurity solutions that are  cost-effective, repeatable, and scalable to increase the rate of  adoption and accelerate effective innovation across business  sectors.

The research  focuses on the measurement and modeling techniques  necessary to understand, predict, and control the behavior  of Internet-scale networked information systems. The ITL  staff use these insights to guide the design, analysis, and  standardization of new technologies aimed at improving  the robustness of the Internet’s core infrastructure. Recent  efforts have focused on enhancing the security of the  Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS), the Border Gateway  Protocol (BGP), and Electronic mail (Email) and messaging  Figure 31: Gavin O’Brien (NCCoE, NIST) provided a demonstration on securing electronic health records on  mobile devices.

In addition, the IIP program addresses other  systemic vulnerabilities in core Internet technologies, such as  those that enable massive-scale Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) attacks.  In FY 2016, ITL  staff made significant  contributions to the  design, standardization,  test and measurement  of technologies to  improve the security  and robustness of the  Internet’s global routing  protocol BGP. NIST staff  were key contributors to Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF) standards to add cryptographic validation to BGP (see,  https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-sidr-bgpsec-protocol/),  and to address the robustness issues associated with  large-scale routing policy violations (see, https://www.rfc- editor.org/rfc/rfc7908.txt). In addition, NIST developed and  released open-source reference implementations of these  emerging IETF specifications, online test tools to foster their  adoption and measurement systems to track their operational  deployment. Figure 32 below is a visualization generated by  one such monitoring tool of the emerging global structure of  the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The RPKI has  been designed to provide the trust infrastructure upon which  Internet routing security technologies can be based.  Figure 32: NIST Visualization of the Evolving Coverage  and Depth of the Internet’s Global Resource Public Key  Infrastructure for BGP security.  In FY 2016, as technology specifications and  implementations matured, the ITL staff began a series of  outreach efforts with the networking industry to increase  the understanding and foster the adoption of BGP security  mechanisms. The ITL staff organized and led a workshop  at the June North American Network Operators Group  (NANOG) meeting aimed at addressing the practical issues,  state of vendor support and existing operational experience  with emerging BGP security technologies (see, https://www. nanog.org/meetings/abstract?id=2846). The ITL staff also  initiated a nationwide BGP security pilot deployment project  with the Internet2 research and education community.  ITL’s High Assurance  Domains (HAD) project  aims to leverage NIST’s  previous successes in  the development and  deployment of Domain  Name System Security  Extentions (DNSSEC)  technologies to enable  scalable solutions of long standing Internet security issues.  In FY 2016, the project focused on addressing the issues of  Email phishing attacks and developing scalable techniques  to enable the cryptographic protection of Email message  exchanges. NIST published NIST SP 800-177, Trustworthy  Email, a comprehensive guidance on the deployment and  use of emerging DNS-based authentication mechanisms to  combat email phishing and spam. In addition, ITL developed  and deployed online test tools to assist network operators  in the configuration and verification of their deployment of  emerging anti-phishing technologies.  The second focus area for the HAD project in FY 2016  was the advancement of specifications, implementations and  deployment of IETF DNS-based Authentication of Named  Entities (DANE) technology that leverages a secured DNS as  a ubiquitous key discovery and management infrastructure.  In FY 2016, the ITL staff contributed to the development of  IETF DANE specifications and developed distributed test and  measurement tools to assist in their adoption and use in the  global Internet. Figure 33 (See next page) shows the user  interface to the recently released NIST DANE test system  that enables product developers and network operators to  test their use of the DANE technologies to store, retrieve and  validate various types of cryptographic keying material for  end-to-end email security, and for general transport-layer  security (TLS) for web and other applications.

The ITL staff in the  Advanced Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS)  Mitigation Techniques  project are working  with the community  to document and  quantitatively characte- rize the applicability,  effectiveness and impact of various approaches to filtering  spoofed Internet Protocol (IP) traffic streams and develop  consensus recommendations and deployment guidance that  can drive their adoption in Federal network environments and  throughout the Internet industry. In FY 2016, the NIST staff  developed benchmarking methodologies to characterize  the performance implications of various techniques to block  spoofed IP packets in commercial routers and developed  draft deployment guidance for these mechanisms in a  variety of network interconnection scenarios.  In addition to understanding the barriers to deployment  and adoption of existing DDoS mitigation techniques, the  ITL staff began the research and evaluation of new, scalable  means of DDoS detection and mitigation, based upon  Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies.  In FY 2017, the major milestones for Internet Infrastructure  Program will include:  •  Completing the publication of IETF standards  for BGP security and increasing outreach and  pilot deployment activities to foster commercial  deployment of these technologies;  •  Continuing to develop and mature DANE  specifications and technologies for scalable key  management in the Internet and conducting  research on their applicability to emerging problem  domains, such as authentication in consumer  networks; and  •  Publishing NIST guidance on current DDoS  mitigation techniques and continuing to research  and develop new approaches based upon  emerging SDN technologies.

These IT environments are under  constant threat of attack and are frequently undergoing  change, with new and updated software being deployed  along with updated configurations. The wide variety of  computing products, the dynamic nature of software, the  speed of configuration change, and the diversity of threats  require organizations to maintain situational awareness over  their IT assets and to utilize this information to make informed  risk-based decisions.  Security automation utilizes standardized data formats  and transport protocols to enable data to be exchanged  between business, operational, and security systems that  support security processes by:  •  Identifying IT assets, including hardware, software,  and data;  •  Providing awareness over the operational state of  computing devices;  •  Enabling security reference data to be collected  from internal and external sources; and  •  Supporting analysis processes that measure the  effectiveness of security controls and provide  visibility into security risks, enabling risk-based  decision making.  Commercial solutions built using security automation  specifications enable the collection and harmonization of  vast amounts of operational and security data into coherent,  comparable information streams to achieve situational  awareness that allows the timely and active management of  diverse IT systems. Through the creation of reference data  and guidance, and the international recognition of flexible,  open standards, the NIST security automation program  works to improve the interoperability, broad acceptance, and  adoption of security automation solutions to address current  and future security challenges, creating opportunities for  innovation.  S p e c i f i c a t i o n ,  S t a n d a r d s ,  a n d  G u i d a n c e  D e v e l o p m e n t  To support the overarching security automation vision, it  is necessary to have specifications that describe the required  interactions between systems, standards that document  international consensus approaches, and guidance for  product developers and implementers. Through close work  with partners in government, industry, and academia, CSD  continues to facilitate the definition and development of  security automation approaches that enable organizations to  understand and manage IT security risks.  During FY 2016, CSD has continued to work to build on  previous security automation work, as follows:  •  Identified and addressed gaps in the current  specifications;  •  Evolved existing approaches to achieve greater  scalability and impact;  •  Participated in working groups in standards  development organizations to promote  international consensus around standardized  approaches;  •  Provided additional guidance on architectural,  design, and analysis concerns; and  •  Developed and maintained tools and reference  implementations.  CSD is currently working with its partners in various  standards-development organizations, including ISO, IETF,  Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information  Standards (OASIS), the Forum of Incident Response and  Security Teams (FIRST), and the Trusted Computing Group  (TCG), to further mature and broaden the adoption of  security automation specifications, reference data, and  techniques. This area of work is focused on evolving security  automation specifications to integrate with existing transport  protocols to provide for the secure, interoperable exchange  of security automation data. Additional work is focused on  evolving security metrics and providing consensus guidance  on security automation approaches. Through the definition  and adoption of security automation standards and  guidelines, IT vendors will be able to provide standardized  security solutions to their customers. These solutions support  continuous monitoring and automated, dynamic network  defense capabilities, based on the analysis of data from  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Additionally, CSD is working with the vulnerability  community to enable the automated analysis of metrics  such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS),  establishing a baseline of the minimum information needed  to properly inform the vulnerability management process,  and facilitating the sharing of vulnerability information  across language barriers. To assist in this work, a public draft  of NISTIR 8138, Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO): A  Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities, was created  to foster a conversation and collect feedback on the best  mechanisms to improve the degree of automation within  vulnerability management processes. CSD is planning to  develop this document iteratively with the vulnerability  community to ensure participation from as many  stakeholders as possible.  Security automation standardization work has been  focused in three areas: the evolution and international  adoption of the Security Content Automation Protocol  (SCAP), the development of software asset management  standards to support operational and cybersecurity  use cases, and the development of security automation  consensus standards. The following sections detail this work.  S e c u r i t y  C o n t e n t  A u t o m a t i o n  P r o t o c o l  ( S C A P )  SCAP is a multipurpose protocol that provides an  automated means to collect and assess the state of devices.  SCAP supports automated vulnerability checking, verifying  the installation of patches, checking security configuration  settings, verifying technical-control compliance, measuring  security, and examining systems for indicators of a  compromise. SCAP uses the Extensible Markup Language  (XML) to standardize the format and nomenclature by which  security software products communicate information about  software flaws, security configurations, and other aspects of  the device state. SCAP enables security automation content,  also known as “SCAP content,” to be expressed using  standardized formats, identifiers, and scoring models. This  content can be used by any tool that is conformant to the  specifications to collect and evaluate the state of software  installed on a device.  SCAP has been widely adopted by major software  and hardware manufacturers and has become a significant  component of information-security-management and  governance programs. SCAP-enabled tools are currently  being used by the U.S. Government, critical infrastructure  companies, academia, and other businesses, both  domestically and internationally. Currently, CSD is leveraging  SCAP in multiple areas, both to support its own mission  and to enable other agencies and private-sector entities  to meet their goals. For CSD, SCAP is a critical component  of the SCAP Validation Program, the National Vulnerability  Database (NVD), and the National Checklist Program (NCP).  In September 2012, CSD published SP 800-126  Revision 2, The Technical Specification for the Security  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.2.  That document describes the 11 component specifications  composing SCAP. See Table 2 (below): SCAP 1.2 Specifications  for details.  Since the release of SCAP 1.2, CSD has worked to  improve guidance around the use of SCAP specifications. In  FY 2015, CSD released draft NISTIR 8058, Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version 1.2 Content Style  Guide: Best Practices for Creating and Maintaining SCAP  1.2 Content, which provides guidance for SCAP 1.2 content  creators to ensure that stylistic variations in SCAP 1.2  content are addressed in a way that improves the accuracy  and consistency of results, avoids performance problems,  reduces user effort, lowers content maintenance burdens, and  enables content reuse. To achieve this, the report documents  best practices for content creation and encourages their use  by SCAP content authors and maintainers. Feedback on  this report is welcomed and will help CSD to work toward  producing a final version of this document.  CSD is actively working on an SCAP 1.3 revision. In July  2016, CSD posted drafts for public comment of SP 800-126  Revision 3 and SP 800-126A. SP 800-126 Revision 3, is The  Technical Specification for the Security Content Automation  Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.3. SP 800-126A is SCAP 1.3  Component Specification Version Updates: An Annex to NIST  Special Publication 800-126 Revision 3. These publications  collectively document the draft requirements for SCAP 1.3.  SP 800-126A is a new publication that allows SCAP 1.3 to  take advantage of selected minor version updates of SCAP  component specifications, as well as designated Open  Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) platform  schema revisions. The SCAP 1.3 revision includes the  following changes:  •  Adoption of the Open Vulnerability and  Assessment Language (OVAL) 5.11.1, which was  released in April 2015;  •  Adoption of the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS) v3, which was released in June  2015;  • Removal of support for CVSSv2; and  •  Deprecation of support for older specification  revisions and SCAP 1.0.

More information on SCAP 1.3 can be found  at: https://scap.nist.gov/revision/1.3/.  CSD is also starting to plan a SCAP 2.0 release. This release  will further define the interfaces and use of transport protocols  for SCAP tools to provide component-level interoperability  between products supporting various SCAP functions.  By providing more interoperability, SCAP v2 will provide  the basic software and configuration posture information  needed to make and automate management decisions for  networked devices as part of the license, vulnerability and  TABLE 2:  SCAP 1.2 SPECIFICATIONS  SPECIFICATIONS DESCRIPTION  Languages  Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format  (XCCDF) 1.2  Used for authoring security checklists/benchmarks and  for reporting the results of evaluating them  Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)  5.11.1  Used for representing system-configuration information,  assessing machine state, and reporting assessment results  Open Checklist Interactive Language (OCIL) 2.0 Used for representing checks that collect information from  people or from existing data stores populated by other  data collection methods  Reporting Formats  Asset Reporting Format (ARF) 1.1 Used to express information about assets and to define  the relationships between assets and reports  Asset Identification 1.1 Used to uniquely identify assets based on known  identifiers and other asset information  Identification Schemes  Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3 A nomenclature and dictionary of hardware, operating  systems, and applications; a method to identify the  applicability to platforms  Software Identification (SWID) Tags 2015 A structured metadata format for describing a released  software product  Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) 5 A nomenclature and dictionary of software-security  configurations  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) A nomenclature and dictionary of security-related  software flaws  Measurement and Scoring Systems  Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Used for measuring the relative severity of software flaws  Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS)  Used for measuring the relative severity of device security  (mis-)configuration issues  Content and Result Integrity  Trust Model for Security Automation Data (TMSAD) Guidance for using digital signatures in a common trust  model applied to security automation specifications  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Furthermore, the posture  information provided by SCAP v2 products will provide  much of the context needed to prevent, detect, and respond  to network attacks. This additional context will enable SCAP  v2 information to be applied for application whitelisting, the  detection of anomalous behavior, the gathering and use of  indicators, the use of machine-readable threat information,  and orchestrating courses of action. CSD is preparing a draft  whitepaper for release in early FY 2017 that will outline an  approach, a development plan identifying the new and  revised specifications that will be needed, and a transition  plan for moving from SCAP 1.x to SCAP 2.0.  S o f t w a r e  A s s e t  M a n a g e m e n t  S t a n d a r d s  CSD has been collaborating with industry partners  in support of ISO/IEC’s revision  of standard ISO/IEC  19770-2:2009, Information technology—Software asset  management—Part 2: Software identification tag, which  establishes a specification for tagging software to support  identification and management. An updated revision of  this standard, ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015, was published on  October 1, 2015. The software identification (SWID) data  model defined by this standard describes an XML format for  software publishers to provide authoritative identification,  categorization, software relationships (e.g., dependency,  bundling, and patch), executable and library footprint  details, and other metadata for software. This information  can be used to support operational and cybersecurity use  cases around managing software deployments, managing  software licenses, managing software vulnerabilities and  related software patches, and assessing secure software  configurations.  To supplement the requirements in ISO/IEC 19770- 2:2015, CSD collaborated with DHS, NSA, and MITRE on the  development of NISTIR 8060, Guidelines for the Creation  of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags.  NISTIR 8060, published in April 2016, provides an overview  of the capabilities and usage of SWID tags as part of a  comprehensive software lifecycle. This report introduces  SWID tags in an operational context, provides guidelines for  the creation of interoperable SWID tags, and highlights key  usage scenarios for which SWID tags are applicable. Figure  34 illustrates several types of SWID tags and how these  support multiple elements of the software product life cycle,  including deployment, installation, patching, upgrading and  removal.  Additionally, NIST has worked with the TCG to integrate  SWID tags into the Trusted Network Communications (TNC)  protocol, through the SCAP Messages for IF-M specification.  The information provided within SWID tags enhances  the SCAP use cases by providing authoritative information  that can be used to create Common Platform Enumeration  (CPE) names, to support the targeting of checklists, and to  associate software flaws to products, based on a defect in a  software library or executable. CSD is currently working on  a SWID tag validation tool, called SWIDVal, that will validate  a SWID tag document against the ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015  and NISTIR 8060 requirements. This tool is planned for an  Figure 34: SWID Tags Support the Software Product Lifecycle  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

D e v e l o p m e n t  o f  S e c u r i t y  A u t o m a t i o n  C o n s e n s u s  S t a n d a r d s  CSD has been promoting the broad international adoption  of SCAP by encouraging the integration of SCAP into other  standards, and by adapting SCAP to address specific gaps  and challenges. CSD has continued its collaboration with  its industry partners in the IETF Security Automation and  Continuous Monitoring (SACM) working group. This working  group provides a venue for advancing appropriate SCAP  specifications into international standards and addressing  identified gap areas. The current scope of work for SACM  includes identifying and/or defining the transport protocols  and data formats needed to support the collection and  evaluation of a device state against the expected values.  The SACM working group has been working on identifying  use cases, requirements, and architectural models to  provide information to facilitate decisions about existing  specifications and standards that can be referenced, required  modifications or extensions to existing specifications and  standards, and any gaps that need to be addressed. CSD is  working with DHS, the Center for Internet Security (CIS), and  the TCG to bring existing work into the IETF SACM working  group, including OVAL and specifications related to the TNC  protocol.  The working group has been developing the following  Internet Drafts:  For more information, please refer to: http://datatracker. ietf.org/wg/sacm/charter/  Also, within the IETF, CSD has been collaborating  with the Managed Incident Lightweight Exchange (MILE)  working group in order to develop the Resource-Oriented  Lightweight Information Exchange (ROLIE) specification.  This specification seeks to address the security automation  information discovery and dissemination use cases by  defining how tools are expected to communicate with security  automation information repositories. ROLIE allows for the  transport, retrieval, and storage of any security automation- relevant information types. The ROLIE draft has undergone  two major revisions, with the final draft nearing completion.  In addition, CSD has begun the process of collaborating with  MILE and other stakeholders to create extension drafts for  ROLIE that address a number of information types, including  vulnerability, configuration checklist, and software metadata  information types.  The main ROLIE draft can be found at https://datatracker. ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-mile-rolie/. Additional information on  ROLIE and on the extension drafts can be found in the working  repository on GitHub: https://github.com/CISecurity/ROLIE/.  CSD also worked with its government and industry  partners in the TCG to define a number of specifications  related to the TNC protocol. The first such publication is the  TNC SCAP Messages for IF-M specification that supports  carrying the SCAP content and results over the TNC protocols.  The second is the TNC Enterprise Compliance Profile (ECP)  and related specifications that support the exchange of SWID  data over the TNC protocols. The ECP enables the collection  of SWID data from a device for use by external tools to  provide software inventory information. SCAP and SWID  data collected using these mechanisms may be optionally  used for network access control decision making, allowing  the device state to be evaluated when devices connect and  on an ongoing basis thereafter.

Finally, CSD has worked with the FIRST by participating  in two Special Interest Groups (SIGs). The CVSS SIG (CVSS- SIG) is focused on maintaining and improving the CVSS  scoring model, based on community feedback. The CVSS- SIG published CVSS Revision 3 (CVSS v3) in June 2015. The  second SIG, the Vulnerability Reporting and Data eXchange  SIG (VRDX-SIG), researches and recommends methods for  identifying and exchanging vulnerability information across  disparate vulnerability databases.  For more information, please visit: http://www.first.org/ global/sigs.  Through work with international standards-developing  organizations (SDOs), SCAP and its related security  automation capabilities are expected to evolve and expand  in support of the growing need to define and measure  effective security controls, assess and monitor ongoing  aspects of information security, remediate noncompliance,  and successfully manage systems in accordance with the Risk  Management Framework described in SP 800-37 Revision  1, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to  Federal Information Systems: A Security Life Cycle Approach.  Standards that are developed and published by these SDOs  will be considered for inclusion in future revisions of SCAP.

SCAP and  the programs that leverage it are moving the information  assurance industry toward being able to standardize  communications and toward the collection and storage of  relevant data in standardized formats, as well as providing  an automated means for the assessment and remediation  of systems for both vulnerabilities and configuration  compliance.  N a t i o n a l  V u l n e r a b i l i t y  D a t a b a s e  ( N V D )  Security automation reference data is currently housed  within the NVD. The NVD is a comprehensive cybersecurity  vulnerability database that allows the tracking of vulnerability  trends over time. This trending service allows users to assess  changes in vulnerability discovery rates within specific  products or within specific types of vulnerabilities. NVD  data is represented using the SCAP specifications. The NVD  includes databases of security configuration checklists for  the NCP, listings of publicly known software flaws, product  names, and impact metrics. A formal validation program  tests the ability of vendor products to use some forms of  security automation data, based on a product’s conformance  in support of specific enterprise capabilities.  SCAP defines the structure of standardized software  flaws and security configuration reference data, also known  as SCAP content. This reference data is provided by the NVD.  As of the end of September 2016, the NVD contained  the following resources:  •  Over 79,000 vulnerability advisories, with an  average of 30 new vulnerabilities added daily;  •  83 SCAP-expressed checklists containing  thousands of low-level security configuration  checks that can be used by SCAP-validated  security products to perform automated  evaluations of the system state;  •  293 non-SCAP security checklists (e.g., English  prose guidance and configuration scripts);  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

NVD is hosted and maintained by NIST and is sponsored  by the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT.  The use of SCAP data by commercial security products,  deployed in thousands of organizations worldwide, has  extended NVD’s effective reach. Increasing demand for NVD  XML data feeds (i.e., mechanisms that provide updated data  from data sources) and SCAP-expressed content from the  NVD website demonstrates an increased adoption of SCAP.  The NVD continues to play a pivotal role in the Payment  Card Industry (PCI) efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities in credit  card systems. The PCI mandates the use of NVD vulnerability  severity scores in measuring the risk to payment card servers  worldwide and for prioritizing vulnerability patching. The  PCI’s use of NVD severity scores helps enhance credit card  transaction security and protects consumers’ personal  information.  In the past year, the NVD began providing Common  Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores following  the CVSS v3 specification and will soon include this  information in the data feeds (see https://www.first.org/ cvss/specification-document). An update of the web site is  planned to enhance the user’s experience.  F O R  M O R E  I N F O R M A T I O N ,  S E E :  https://nvd.nist.gov  C O N T A C T S :  Mr. Harold Booth  Mr. Robert Byers  (301) 975-8441  (301) 975-3279  harold.booth@nist.gov  robert.byers@nist.gov  N a t i o n a l  C h e c k l i s t  P r o g r a m  ( N C P ) There are many threats to IT, ranging from remotely  launched network service exploits to malicious code spread  through infected emails, websites, and downloaded files.  Vulnerabilities in IT products are discovered daily, and many  ready-to-use exploitation techniques are widely available on  the Internet. Because IT products are often intended for a  wide variety of audiences, restrictive security configuration  controls are usually not enabled by default. As a result, many  out-of-the box IT products are immediately vulnerable. In  addition, identifying a reasonable set of security settings  that achieve balanced risk management is a complicated,  arduous, and time-consuming task, even for experienced  system administrators.  To facilitate the development of security configuration  checklists for IT products and to make checklists more  organized and usable, CSD established the National Checklist  Program (NCP) in furtherance of its statutory responsibilities  under the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, Public Law 107-347, and also under the  Cybersecurity Research and Development Act, which  mandates that NIST “develop, and revise as necessary, a  checklist setting forth settings and option selections that  minimize the security risks associated with each computer  hardware or software system that is, or is likely to become,  widely used within the Federal Government.” In February  2008, a revision of Part 39 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR) was published. Paragraph (d) of section 39.101 states,  “In acquiring information technology, agencies shall include  the appropriate IT security policies and requirements,  including use of common security configurations available  from the NIST website at http://checklists.nist.gov. Agency  contracting officers should consult with the requiring official  to ensure the appropriate standards are incorporated.”  In Memorandum M-08-22, OMB mandated the use of  SCAP-validated products for the continuous monitoring of  Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC) compliance. The  NCP strives to encourage and assist federal agencies with  these mandates.  The goals of the NCP are to:  •  Facilitate the development and sharing of checklists  by providing a formal framework for checklist  developers to submit checklists to NIST;  •  Provide guidance to developers to help them create  standardized, high-quality checklists that conform  to common operation environments;  •  Help developers and users by providing guidelines  for making checklists better documented and more  usable;  •  Encourage software vendors and other parties to  develop checklists;  •  Provide a managed process for the review, update,  and maintenance of checklists;  •  Provide an easy-to-use repository of checklists;  and  •  Encourage the use of automation technologies  (e.g., SCAP) for checklist application.

Of that total, 154 of the checklists, addressing 96 platforms,  are SCAP-expressed and can be used with SCAP-validated  products.  Organizations can use checklists obtained from the  NCP website for automated security configuration patch  assessment. The NCP currently provides metadata and links  to the latest operating systems and applications checklists,  including MacOS 10.10, Windows 10, Internet Explorer 11.0,  Internet Explorer 10.0, Office 2016, Red Hat Enterprise Linux,  and other products.  To assist users in identifying automated checklist content,  NCP groups these checklists into tiers, from Tier I to Tier IV.  The NCP uses the tiers to rank checklists according to their  automation capability. Tier III and IV checklists include fully  vetted SCAP content that has successfully demonstrated  conformance to the requirements outlined in SP 800-126.  Tier III & IV checklists are considered production-ready and  are intended for use with SCAP-validated products.  Tier II checklists document the recommended security  settings in a machine-readable format such as the XCCDF- only (i.e., no OVAL content), proprietary format, or product- specific configuration script. Tier I checklists are prose- based and contain no machine-readable content. Users can  browse the checklists, based on the checklist tier, IT product,  IT product category, or authority, and through a keyword  search that searches the checklist name and summary for  user-specified terms. The search results show the detailed  checklist metadata and a link to any SCAP content for  the checklist, as well as links to any supporting resources  associated with the checklist.  To assist checklist developers, the NCP provides both  manual and automated interfaces to facilitate the submission  and maintenance processes. The manual interface consists  of a web application that guides the submitter through the  data entry process to ensure that all the required information  is submitted. The submission is validated upon review,  and a report is returned to the submitting organization,  verifying either acceptance or rejection, based on the criteria  requirements. For instance, Tier III and Tier IV checklists  require validation using the SCAP Content Validation Tool  (this tool is available for download via https://scap.nist.gov/ validation/resources.html).  The NCP is defined in SP 800-70 Revision 3, National  Checklist Program for IT Products—Guidelines for Checklist  Users and Developers, which can be found at http://csrc.nist. gov/publications/PubsSPs.html.

The configurations are based on a collection of  resources, including the existing NIST OS X configuration  guidance, the DOD OS X Recommended Settings, the  Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) OS X Security  Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), and the Center for  Internet Security (CIS) OS X Security Benchmark.  The project team researched and tested 250 settings  for OS X 10.10. Among other collected data, each setting has  a designated Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE)  number, which aids in long-term tracking of the setting.  Figure 35 illustrates the various categories that comprise  the baselines. Note that a higher quantity of settings in a  category does not imply greater importance over other  categories.  The team finished developing shell scripts that apply the  settings to an OS X 10.10 system. The settings are organized  into three key baselines, which are appropriate for different  environments:  •  The Standalone baseline describes small, informal  computer installations that are used for home or  business purposes,  •  The Managed baseline is appropriate for centrally  managed, networked systems, and  •  The Specialized Security-Limited Functionality  (SSLF) baseline is appropriate for systems where  security requirements are more stringent and  where the implementation of security safeguards is  likely to reduce functionality.  In FY 2016, the security configuration was updated to  have 250 settings after the internal testing on select CSD  systems was completed. In June 2016, the draft SP 800- 179, Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for IT  Professionals, was published for public comment  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p s : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software  applications that are exploited to stage cyber attacks.  System administrators need objective metrics to guide and  justify decision making as they manage the security risk  of enterprise networks. The objective of this research is  to develop a standard model for the security risk analysis  of computer networks. A standard model will enable an  organization to answer questions such as “Are we more  secure now than yesterday?” or “How does the security of  one network configuration compare with another one?”  Also, having a standard model to measure network security  will allow users, vendors, and researchers to evaluate  methodologies and products for network security in a  coherent and consistent manner.  CSD has approached the challenge of network security  analysis by capturing vulnerability interdependencies  and measuring security, based on how real attackers have  penetrated networks. The methodology used for security  risk analysis is based on attack graphs. CSD analyzes attack  paths through a network, providing a probabilistic metric  of the overall system risk. Through this metric, trade-offs  between security costs and security benefits are analyzed.  Computer systems are vulnerable to both known and  zero-day attacks. Enterprises have begun to move parts  of their networks from a traditional infrastructure into  cloud computing environments. Cloud providers offer  virtual servers that can be rented on demand by users. This  paradigm enables cloud customers to acquire computing  resources with high efficiency, low cost and great flexibility.  However, it also introduces many security problems that need  to be solved. Diversity has long been regarded as a security  mechanism for improving the resilience of software and  networks against various attacks. More recently, diversity has  found new applications in cloud computing security, moving  target defense, and improving the robustness of network  routing. However, most existing efforts rely on intuitive and  imprecise notions of diversity, and the few existing models  of diversity are designed for a single system running diverse  software replicas or variants. In FY 2016, CSD has attempted  to formally model network diversity as a security metric by  designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics. In  particular, CSD has devised a biodiversity-inspired metric  based on the effective number of distinct resources. CSD  has also proposed two complementary diversity metrics,  based on the least and the average attacking efforts,  respectively. CSD published two papers in this area:  1. Network Diversity: A Security Metric for Evaluating  the Resilience of Networks Against Zero Day  Attacks, IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics  and Security, 11(5) May 2016 (see http://ieeexplore. ieee.org/document/7378495/).  2.

In FY 2017, CSD plans to develop new techniques and  metrics for Cloud Computing threat modeling and network  forensics analysis using Bayesian networks. CSD also plans  to publish the results as a NIST report and as white papers in  conferences and journals.

In performing this work, the AIM project  seeks to enhance the nation’s ability to defend itself from  network-borne attacks.

However, research solutions are made publicly  available and are designed to be generally applicable to as  many environments as possible.  In FY 2016, the AIM project completed research in several  areas: algorithms for measuring the ease at which networks  can be broken apart, efficient representations for attack  graphs, and an analysis of how to increase the robustness  of the African Internet. More specifically, the project team  accomplished the following:  •  The team discovered a linear-time algorithm to  implement a heuristic for vertex partitioning that  enables effective partitioning on massive graphs  (tested on graphs up to 34 million nodes). This  enables one to measure the ease at which terrorist  activity or global conflicts can break apart large  networks, for example, the entire Internet (the  research was published in the International Journal  of Computer Science: Theory and Application).  •  The team discovered an efficient representation  for attack graphs that grows linearly in the number  of nodes, while most attack graph research uses  an inefficient graph representation that grows  quadratically in the number of nodes and that  creates unnecessary edge connections (this  research was published in the proceedings of  the Tenth International Conference on Software  Engineering Advances).  •  The team studied how to increase the robustness  of the African Internet, creating the first country- level topology maps of Africa, and measured the  growth of Internet connectivity (this research was  a precursor to more global connectivity studies;  it was published in the proceedings of the 7th  European Alliance for Innovation International  Conference on e-Infrastructure and e-Services for  Developing Countries).  In FY 2017, the AIM project will work on new methods  for assuring private communication on the Internet, network  anomaly detection, efficient graph algorithms for access  control computations (to restrict external leakage of insider  information), and methods for using attack graphs to perform  defense-in-depth measurements.

NIST  investigation of actual failures has shown that most failures  are triggered by one or two parameters, and progressively  fewer by three, four, or more parameters (see Figure 36 - next  page); this relationship is called the Interaction Rule. These  results have important implications for testing software  and systems. If all faults in a system can be triggered by a  combination of n or fewer parameters, then testing all n-way  combinations of parameters with a doable number of tests  can provide strong fault-detection efficiency. These methods  are being applied to software and hardware testing for  reliability, safety, and security. CSD’s focus is on empirical  results and the impact on real-world problems.  Project highlights for FY 2016 include the development  of an efficient method for testing rule-based systems using  covering arrays and the development of a prototype tool;  invited lectures at conferences and universities; leading the  Fifth International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing, held in  conjunction with the eighth IEEE International Conference on  Software Testing; development of a real-time combinatorial  coverage measurement tool; and analyzing the factors  involved in different types of software faults. Collaborators  include researchers from the University of Texas at Arlington,  the University of Texas at Dallas, East Carolina University, and  Duke University.  NIST also submitted a patent on an oracle-free testing  method based on two-layer covering arrays (see below). In  software testing, the oracle problem refers to determining the  expected output for a given set of inputs. A determination of  the expected output requires expert knowledge and normally  cannot be automated without a mathematical model of  the specification. The test settings for an input factor may  represent ranges of values (called equivalence classes) for  which the output is expected to remain unchanged. For  example, a shipping program may charge the same rate for  any package under one pound, a second rate for packages  one pound to 10 pounds, and a third rate for packages over  10 pounds. Values within each of these ranges are equivalent  with respect to the cost calculation. Thus, any value within an  equivalent range may be substituted for any other, and the  program output should be unchanged. Similarly, equivalent  values for any combination of input variables will also  produce the same output.  The test method works by generating two test arrays: a  primary array and a secondary array. The entries of a primary  array represent the names of equivalence classes of input  factors. For each test row of the primary array, a second  array is computed. The settings in the second array are the  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

If the outputs  corresponding to one row of the primary array differ, then  either the equivalence classes were defined incorrectly or  the code is faulty in some way. This method can detect a  large class of software faults automatically after equivalence  classes have been defined, without a conventional test  oracle.  Technology transfer activities included the publication  of a number of technical papers and software distributions;  publication of the results of a Cooperative R&D (CRADA)  project with Lockheed Martin; release of enhanced  combinatorial measurement tools; input modeling and  fault location tools; a provisional patent application on the  oracle-free testing method; and seminars at a number of  conferences, universities, and federal agencies.  Plans for FY 2017 include the development of a  mathematical model for the evolution of t-way faults in  software; combinatorial testing for big data software;  measurement of input model combination coverage of  network protocol software; trial use of prototype methods  and tools for oracle-free testing methods; analysis of  empirical data on failures; further development of methods  and tools for fault localization; and seminars, workshops,  and tutorials at professional meetings and research labs.

Many security and protection  mechanisms are currently rooted in software that, along  with all underlying components, must be trusted and not  tampered with. A vulnerability in any of those components  could compromise the trustworthiness of the security  mechanisms that rely upon those components. Stronger  security assurances may be possible by grounding security  mechanisms in roots of trust.  Roots of trust are highly reliable and secure  hardware, firmware, and software components that perform  specific, critical security functions. Because roots of trust  are inherently trusted, they must be secure by their design.  As such, many roots of trust are implemented in hardware  or protected firmware so that malware cannot tamper with  the functions they provide. Roots of trust provide a firm  foundation from which to build security and trust.  This project aims to encourage the use of roots of trust in  computers to provide stronger security assurances. A focus  area for this work has been securing firmware.

There is a belief that there is an inherent  tradeoff between cybersecurity and usability. Computers  can be theoretically secure but so unusable that they do  not improve security because users are forced to perform  in less secure ways. The opposite is true as well; systems  that are easy to use and not secure are eventually unusable  due to worms, viruses, and botnets. The usability principles  of efficiency, effectiveness and user satisfaction must be  incorporated to ensure that it is easy for users to do the right  thing and hard for them to do the wrong thing. NIST has been  working to develop usability and security metrics, facilitate  the integration of usability principles into product design  processes, and lead research projects to investigate methods  for aligning user goals with organizational security goals.  During FY 2016, the usability team’s research focused  primarily in four areas: passwords, understanding user  behavior, cryptography, and privacy.  1 .  P a s s w o r d  R e s e a r c h :  The password research included examining password  policies from two perspectives. The Password Policy  Taxonomy project is exploring the relationship between  usability and security by focusing on the password policy  itself and how users of a policy understand it. To tackle the  ambiguity inherent in many password policies, a formal  language for representing a password policy was previously  developed. Having clear, unambiguous policy statements  enables us to explore password policies in much greater  detail, discuss the relative merits of different statements,  compare and contrast policies, explore plain language policy  representations and user interpretations, and examine the  interplay between usability and security in password policies.  A Password Policy Question-Answer System (PPQAS) was  designed, developed and tested. The system is a flexible  application and is designed to collect users’ interpretations  of various password policies and map each interpretation of  a policy’s regulating statements to elements of the formal  language via a dynamic set of questions and answers and to  store those mappings for analysis.  The second effort examines how users interpret and  apply password rules. Ambiguous terminology in password  rules affects user comprehension. This research investigated  user comprehension of ambiguous terminology in password  rules, using a combination of quantitative and qualitative  methods in a usable security study with 60 participants.  Results showed:  •  That manipulating password rule terminology  causes users’ interpretation of the allowed  character space to shrink or expand.  •  Users are confused by the terms “non- alphanumeric,” “symbols,” “special characters,” and  “punctuation marks” in password rules.  •  Additionally, users are confused by partial lists of  allowed characters using “e.g.” or “etc.”  This research provides data-driven usability guidance  on constructing clearer language for password policies.  2 .  U n d e r s t a n d i n g  U s e r  B e h a v i o r :  Understanding user behavior is critical to achieving  security objectives. One example of this achieving security  objectives is preventing successful phishing attacks. Phishing  is the attempt to obtain sensitive information by posing  as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication,  often in the form of emails appearing to be from legitimate  parties that contains links or attachments. It is a major  cyber threat facing government organizations.

To ultimately  improve awareness training, it is important to understand  why the staff do or do not fall victim to phishing attacks.  For example, an employee opening an email attachment  could be a means of conducting the attack. This project  partnered with the NIST Office of Information Systems  Management (OISM) and Office of Safety, Health and  Environment (OSHE) to better understand operational  phishing awareness training. Results showed that user  context is the key to understanding user behavior regarding  phishing attacks. For example, staff who are responsible for  paying bills and invoices are more likely to be victimized by  fake unpaid invoice emails.  Another noteworthy program in user behavior is the  research into Security Fatigue. People are repeatedly  bombarded with messages about the dangers lurking  on the Internet, about the security breaches of major  corporations and the U.S. government, and about the need  to be constantly attentive while online. To combat these  dangers and stay safe while online, users are forced to  update passwords, run antivirus software programs, and  accept unwieldy terms of agreements, often without a  clear understanding of why and to what end. The research  team interviewed 40 participants to understand their  relationships with cybersecurity.  The team discovered that:  •  People reach a saturation point and become inured  to the issue of cybersecurity.  •  People are told they need to be constantly on alert,  constantly doing “something,” but they are not  even sure what that something is or what might  happen if they do or do not do it.  The team calls this “security fatigue.” This security fatigue  and the resignation and loss of control associated with it  certainly presents a challenge to efforts aimed at promoting  online security and the protection of online privacy.  This research on security fatigue was a popular topic  with users and many media outlets interested in it. According  to the NIST Public Affairs Office, there were:  •  17,550 page views of the news story on NIST.gov  (the fourth most visited page in 2016 on the NIST  website);  •  7.9K total views for Facebook posts on the  story;  •  2,327 views of the story on Eurekalert (an online  news release repository operated by The American  Association for the Advancement of Science  (AAAS));  •  2,172 plays of the video on Kaltura (the platform  hosting the video on the NIST news story page), 81  shares, 51 downloads; and  • 918 video views on YouTube.  The news outlets included: BBC News, MSN.com,  Politico, Federal News Radio, Bloomberg BNA, the Register,  and McClatchy DC, and many others included quotes by the  authors, such as: “ ‘Users are tired of being overwhelmed by  the need to be constantly on alert…’ said the study by the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, a unit of the  Department of Commerce.”  3 .  C r y p t o g r a p h y  The team’s cryptographic research is concerned with  creating a baseline understanding of the current practices  and challenges of organizations that are developing products  that use cryptography. The research team considered  the entire process, from the identification of a market  opportunity and the conceptualization of the product; the  assembling of the product team; the design, implementation  and testing of the product; and finally, the marketing, sale  and end-user support. Based on the research, ITL will use  this new understanding to help improve the assurance  of cryptographic tools and the usability of cryptographic  software and resources.  The following contributions were made:  •  The research team identified opportunities to  better characterize the cryptographic practices  and types of resources and standards used by  cryptographic developers.  •  Research offers new insights into the challenges  that cryptographic implementations introduce  into organizational practices, such as recruitment,  product lifecycle and transitions, the management  of employees, the evaluation of cryptographic  work, and product explanation to customers.

P r i v a c y  A new area was initiated to examine privacy and de- identification. A Federal Government stakeholder’s meeting  was organized to discuss the topic, after which NIST provided  additional guidance through multiple training sessions to  other federal agencies, a NIST Interagency Report, and a  NIST Special Publication.  De-identification regarding private data set release,  or the release of other information about a private data set  (such as summarizing statistics), is a  class of procedures  intended to restrict or limit the ability of a recipient of  such a release to re-identify a particular individual in the  data set and infer potentially sensitive information about  the individual (whether in an absolute, or  in a probabilistic  sense). De-identification is a collection of methods with  the goal of  protecting the privacy  of the individual, while  simultaneously preserving the utility of the released data (or  other summarizing statistics).  ITL researchers are evaluating differentially private  algorithms, a subset of de-identification techniques. The team  is considering the possible tradeoffs between protecting the  privacy of individuals and the usefulness of information, such  as might occur when a research database with de-identified  personal information is released.

These were published as NIST technical  series documents (e.g., Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS), Special Publications (SP), NIST Internal or  Interagency Reports (NISTIRs), and Information Technology  Laboratory (ITL) Bulletins), other NIST publications, or  as externally-published documents (e.g., journal articles,  conference papers, books, and other papers).  Additionally, the NCCoE began posting public drafts of  documents in two new series: Concept Papers and Project  Descriptions. Concept Papers identify potential project  topics for NCCoE to explore with stakeholders and  technology collaborators. After reviewing public comments  on a draft Concept Paper, NCCoE can better understand  specific challenges and needs, and may possibly draft  a Project Description. Formerly issued as “Building  Blocks” and “Use Cases,” Project Descriptions describe a  particular problem that is relevant across a sector. Through  collaboration with community members and vendors of  cybersecurity solutions, NCCoE will develop a reference  design that can be used by sector organizations to address  that challenge.  In FY 2016, ITL published 20 NIST Special Publications, 18  NISTIRs and 12 ITL Bulletins in the areas of cybersecurity and  privacy. Additionally, ITL continued to engage stakeholders  by posting numerous draft documents for public comment,  including 23 Special Publications, 13 NISTIRs, 6 NCCoE  Project Descriptions, 1 NCCoE Concept Paper, and 3 NIST  “white papers.” ITL research was also published externally, as  18 journal articles and 18 conference papers. They are listed  below, with abstracts and full text links, under (External  Publications).  In the October 19, 2015 Federal Register, NIST  announced the withdrawal of six FIPS that had become  obsolete: FIPS 181, 185, 188, 190, 191, and 196. NIST had  received only one comment in response to a January 16,  2015 Federal Register Notice requesting public feedback  on their proposed withdrawal. (The titles of the withdrawn  FIPS are: 181 - Automated Password Generator (APG), 185  - Escrowed Encryption Standard, 188 - Standard Security  Label for Information Transfer, 190 - Guideline for the Use  of Advanced Authentication Technology Alternatives,  191 - Guideline for The Analysis of Local Area Network  Security, and 196 - Entity Authentication Using Public Key  Cryptography.)  Two significant efforts to revise major publications were  begun. ACD solicited public input to develop preliminary  drafts of SP 800-63-3, Digital Authentication Guideline,  during a “Public Preview” phase that enabled stakeholders  to provide dynamic, interactive feedback. A subseries  of documents that will revise the current SP 800-63-2,  Electronic Authentication Guideline, will be posted for public  comment as official public drafts in early FY 2017 (see https:// pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/). Meanwhile, CSD posted a call for  comments on SP 800-53 Revision 4, Security and Privacy  Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,  to begin preparing for the release of a draft of Revision 5 for  public comment in FY 2017.  The ITL Cybersecurity Framework team worked closely  with the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program to  develop the Baldrige Cybersecurity Excellence Builder  (BCEB): Key questions for improving your organization’s  cybersecurity performance, which was posted for public  comment on the Baldridge Cybersecurity Initiative website  (see https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/products-services/ baldrige-cybersecurity-initiative). The BCEB is a voluntary  self-assessment tool that enables organizations to better  understand the effectiveness of their cybersecurity risk  management efforts.

N I S T  S P s  SP 800-188 (DRAFT)  De-Identifying Government Datasets  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-188  De-identification removes identifying information  from a dataset so that the remaining data cannot be  linked with specific individuals. Government agencies  can use de-identification to reduce the privacy risk  associated with collecting, processing, archiving,  distributing or publishing government data. Previously,  NIST published NISTIR 8053, “De-Identifying Personal  Data,” which provided a survey of de-identification and  re-identification techniques. This document provides  specific guidance to government agencies that wish to  use de-identification. Before using de-identification,  agencies should evaluate their goals in using  de-identification and the potential risks that  de-identification might create. Agencies should  decide upon a de-identification release model, such  as publishing de-identified data, publishing synthetic  data based on identified data, and providing a query  interface to the identified data that incorporates  de-identification. Agencies can use a Disclosure Review  Board to oversee the process of de-identification; they  can also adopt a de-identification standard with  measurable performance levels. Several specific  techniques for de-identification are available,  including de-identification by removing identifiers and  transforming quasi-identifiers and the use of formal  de-identification models that rely upon Differential  Privacy. De-identification is typically performed  with software tools that may have multiple features;  however, not all tools that mask personal information  provide sufficient functionality for performing de- identification. This document also includes an extensive  list of references, a glossary, and a list of specific de- identification tools, although the mention of these tools  is only to be used to convey the range of tools currently  available, and is not intended to imply recommendation  or endorsement by NIST.  SP 800-185 (DRAFT)  SHA-3 Derived Functions: cSHAKE, KMAC,  TupleHash, and ParallelHash  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-185  This Recommendation specifies four SHA-3-derived  functions: cSHAKE, KMAC, TupleHash, and ParallelHash.  cSHAKE is a customizable variant of the SHAKE functions  defined in FIPS 202. KMAC (for Keccak Message  Authentication Code) is a variable-length message  authentication code algorithm based on Keccak; it can  also be used as a pseudorandom function. TupleHash  is a variable-length hash function that is designed to  hash tuples of input strings unambiguously. ParallelHash  is a variable-length hash function that can hash non- overlapping subsets of very long messages in parallel.  SP 800-184 (DRAFT)  Guide for Cybersecurity Event Recovery  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-184  In light of an increasing number of cybersecurity  events, organizations can improve resilience by  ensuring that their risk management processes include  comprehensive recovery planning. Identifying and  prioritizing organization resources helps to guide  effective plans and realistic test scenarios. This  preparation enables rapid recovery from incidents  when they occur and helps to minimize the impact  on the organization and its constituents. Additionally,  continually improving recovery planning by learning  lessons from past events, including those of other  organizations, helps to ensure the continuity of  important mission functions. This publication provides  tactical and strategic guidance regarding the planning,  playbook developing, testing, and improvement of  recovery planning. It also provides an example scenario  that demonstrates guidance and informative metrics  that may be helpful for improving resilience of the  information systems.

In this work, five core  primitives belonging to most distributed systems are  presented. These primitives apply well to systems  with large amounts of data, scalability concerns,  heterogeneity concerns, temporal concerns, and  elements of unknown pedigree with possible nefarious  intent. These primitives are the basic building blocks  for a Network of ‘Things’ (NoT), including the Internet  of Things (IoT). This document offers an underlying  and foundational understanding of IoT based on  the realization that IoT involves sensing, computing,  communication, and actuation. The material presented  here is generic to all distributed systems that employ  IoT technologies (i.e., ‘things’ and networks). The  expected audience is computer scientists, IT managers,  networking specialists, and networking and cloud  computing software engineers.  SP 800-182  Computer Security Division 2015 Annual Report  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-182  Title III of the E-Government Act of 2002, entitled  the Federal Information Security Management Act  (FISMA) of 2002, requires NIST to prepare an annual  public report on activities undertaken in the previous  year, and those planned for the coming year, to carry  out responsibilities under this law. The primary goal of  the Computer Security Division (CSD), a component  of NIST’s Information Technology Laboratory (ITL),  is to provide standards and technology that protects  information systems against threats to the con- fidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and  services. During FY 2015, CSD successfully responded to  numerous challenges and opportunities in fulfilling that  mission. Through CSD’s diverse research agenda and  engagement in many national priority initiatives, high- quality, cost-effective security and privacy mechanisms  were developed and applied that improved information  security across the Federal Government and the greater  information security community. This annual report  highlights the research agenda and activities in which  CSD was engaged during FY 2015.  SP 800-180 (DRAFT)  NIST Definition of Microservices, Application  Containers and System Virtual Machines  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-180  Many variations and definitions of application  containers exist in industry, causing considerable  confusion among those who attempt to explain what  a container is. This document provides a NIST-standard  definition to application containers, microservices that  reside in application containers and operating system  virtual machines. Furthermore, this document explains  the similarities and differences between a Services  Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Microservices, as well  as the similarities and differences between Operating  System Virtual Machines and Application Containers.  SP 800-179 (DRAFT)  Guide to Securing Apple OS X 10.10 Systems for  IT Professionals: A NIST Security Configuration  Checklist  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-179  This publication assists IT professionals in securing  Apple OS X 10.10 (i.e., Yosemite) desktop and laptop  systems within various environments. It provides detailed  information about the security features of OS X 10.10  and security configuration guidelines. The publication  recommends and explains tested, secure settings with  the objective of simplifying the administrative burden of  improving the security of OS X 10.10 systems in three  types of environments: Standalone, Managed, and  Specialized Security-Limited Functionality.  SP 800-177  Trustworthy Email  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-177  This document gives recommendations and  guidelines for enhancing trust in email. The primary  audience includes enterprise email administrators,  information security specialists and network managers.  This guideline applies to federal IT systems and will  also be useful for small or medium-sized organizations.  Technologies recommended in support of core Simple  Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the Domain Name  System (DNS) include mechanisms for authenticating  a sending domain: Sender Policy Framework (SPF),  Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based  Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance  (DMARC). Recommendations for email transmission  security include the Transport Layer Security (TLS)  protocols and the associated certificate authentication  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

SP 800-171 Revision 1 (DRAFT)  Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in  Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 171-Rev-1  The protection of Controlled Unclassified Information  (CUI) while residing in nonfederal information systems  and organizations is of paramount importance to  federal agencies and can directly impact the ability  of the Federal Government to successfully carry out  its designated missions and business operations. This  publication provides federal agencies with recommended  requirements for protecting the confidentiality of CUI:  (i) when the CUI is resident in nonfederal information  systems and organizations; (ii) when the information  systems where the CUI resides are not used or operated  by contractors of federal agencies or other organizations  on behalf of those agencies; and (iii) where there are  no specific safeguarding requirements for protecting  the confidentiality of CUI prescribed by the authorizing  law, regulation, or government-wide policy for the CUI  category or subcategory listed in the CUI Registry. The  requirements apply to all components of nonfederal  information systems and organizations that process,  store, or transmit CUI, or provide security protection for  such components. The CUI requirements are intended  for use by federal agencies in contractual vehicles or  other agreements established between those agencies  and nonfederal organizations.  SP 800-167  Guide to Application Whitelisting  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-167  An application whitelist is a list of applications and  application components that are authorized for use in an  organization. Application whitelisting technologies use  whitelists to control which applications are permitted  to be executed on a host. This helps to stop the  execution of malware, unlicensed software, and other  unauthorized software. This publication is intended  to assist organizations in understanding the basics of  application whitelisting. It also explains planning and  implementation for whitelisting technologies throughout  the security deployment lifecycle.  SP 800-166  Derived PIV Application and Data Model Test  Guidelines  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-166  SP 800-157 contains technical guidelines for the  implementation of standards-based, secure, reliable,  interoperable PKI-based identity credentials that are  issued for mobile devices by federal departments and  agencies to individuals who possess and prove control  over a valid PIV Card.

It starts with and builds upon a set of well- established International Standards for systems and  software engineering published by the International  Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International  Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and infuses  systems security engineering techniques, methods, and  practices into those systems and software engineering  processes. The ultimate objective is to address security  issues from the perspective of stakeholder requirements  and protection needs and to use established engineering  processes to ensure that such requirements and needs  are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor early  and in a sustainable manner throughout the life cycle of  the system.  SP 800-156  Representation of PIV Chain-of-Trust for Import and  Export  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-156  This document provides a common XML-based data  representation of a chain-of-trust record to facilitate the  exchange of PIV Card enrollment data. The exchanged  record is the basis for personalizing a PIV Card for a  transferred employee and, also for service providers  to personalize a PIV Card on behalf of client federal  agencies.  SP 800-154 (DRAFT)  Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800-154  Threat modeling is a form of risk assessment  that models aspects of the attack and defense sides  of a particular logical entity, such as a piece of data,  an application, a host, a system, or an environment.  This publication examines data-centric system threat  modeling, which is threat modeling that is focused on  protecting particular types of data within systems. The  publication provides information on the basics of data- centric system threat modeling so that organizations  can successfully use it as part of their risk management  processes. The general methodology provided by  the publication is not intended to replace existing  methodologies, but rather to define fundamental  principles that should be part of any sound data-centric  system threat modeling methodology.

SP 800-57, Part 1 was  the first document produced in this effort, and includes  a general approach for transitioning from one algorithm  or key length to another. This Recommendation (SP 800- 131A) provides more specific guidance for transitions to  the use of stronger cryptographic keys and more robust  algorithms.  SP 800-126 Revision 3 (DRAFT)  The Technical Specification for the Security Content  Automation Protocol (SCAP): SCAP Version 1.3  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 126-Rev-3  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)  is a suite of specifications that standardize the format  and nomenclature by which software flaw and security  configuration information is communicated, both to  machines and humans. This publication defines the  technical composition of SCAP version 1.3 in terms of its  component specifications, their interrelationships and  interoperation, and the requirements for SCAP content.  SP 800-126A (DRAFT)  SCAP 1.3 Component Specification Version Updates:  An Annex to NIST Special Publication 800-126  Revision 3  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 126A  The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is  a multi-purpose framework of component specifications  that support automated configuration, vulnerability, and  patch checking, security measurement, and technical  control compliance activities. The SCAP version 1.3  specification is defined by the combination of SP 800- 126 Revision 3 and this document. This document allows  the use of particular minor version updates to SCAP 1.3  component specifications and the use of particular Open  Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) core  schema and platform schema versions. Allowing the  use of these updates and schemas provides additional  functionality for SCAP 1.3 without causing any loss of  existing functionality.  SP 800-125B  Secure Virtual Network Configuration for Virtual  Machine (VM) Protection  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-125B  Virtual machines (VMs) are key resources to be  protected, since they are the compute engines hosting  mission-critical applications. Since VMs are the end  nodes of a virtual network, the configuration of the  virtual network is an important element in the security  of the VMs and their hosted applications. The virtual  network configuration areas discussed in this document  are network segmentation, network path redundancy,  traffic control using firewalls, and VM traffic monitoring.  This document analyzes the configuration options  under these areas and presents a corresponding  set of recommendations for secure virtual network  configuration for VM protection.  SP 800-116 Revision 1 (DRAFT)  A Recommendation for the Use of PIV Credentials in  Physical Access Control Systems (PACS)  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-800- 116-Rev.%201  This recommendation provides a technical guideline  to use Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Cards in  physical access control systems (PACS), enabling federal  agencies to operate as government-wide interoperable  enterprises. This recommendation covers the risk- based strategy to select appropriate PIV authentication  mechanisms as expressed within Federal Information  Processing Standard (FIPS) 201-2.  SP 800-114 Revision 1  User’s Guide to Telework and Bring Your Own Device  (BYOD) Security  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-114r1  Many people telework, and they use a variety  of devices, such as desktop and laptop computers,  smartphones, and tablets, to read and send email, access  websites, review and edit documents, and perform many  other tasks. Each telework device is controlled by the  organization, a third party (such as the organization’s  contractors, business partners, and vendors), or the  teleworker; the latter is known as bring your own device  (BYOD). This publication provides recommendations  for securing BYOD devices used for telework and  remote access, as well as those directly attached to the  enterprise’s own networks.

SP 800-70 Revision 3  National Checklist Program for IT Products:  Guidelines for Checklist Users and Developers  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-70r3  A security configuration checklist is a document that  contains instructions or procedures for configuring an  IT product for an operational environment, for verifying  that the product has been configured properly, and/or  for identifying unauthorized changes to the product.  Using these checklists can minimize the attack surface,  reduce vulnerabilities, lessen the impact of successful  attacks, and identify changes that might otherwise go  undetected. To facilitate the development of checklists  and to make checklists more organized and usable, NIST  established the National Checklist Program (NCP). This  publication explains how to use the NCP to find and  retrieve checklists, and it also describes the policies,  procedures, and general requirements for participation  in the NCP.  SP 800-57 Part 1 Revision 4  Recommendation for Key Management, Part 1:  General  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-57pt1r4  This publication provides general cryptographic  key management guidance and is the first of three  parts. Part 1 defines cryptographic security services  that may be provided, provides background information  regarding the NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms,  classifies keys and other cryptographic information  according to their functions, specifies the protections  required for each key type, identifies the functions  involved in key management and discusses a variety of  key management issues related to the use of keys. Part  2 provides guidance on policy and security planning  requirements for U.S. government agencies, and Part  3 provides guidance when using the cryptographic  features of current systems.  SP 800-46 Revision 2  Guide to Enterprise Telework, Remote Access, and  Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Security  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-46r2  For many organizations, their employees,  contractors, business partners, vendors, and/or  others use enterprise telework or remote access  technologies to perform work from external locations.  All components of these technologies, including  organization-issued BYOD client devices, should be  secured against expected threats as identified through  threat models. This publication provides information  on security considerations for several types of remote  access solutions, and it makes recommendations for  securing a variety of telework, remote access, and BYOD  technologies. It also gives advice on creating related  security policies.

Both of these methods are modes of operation  for an underlying, approved symmetric-key block cipher  algorithm. FPE transforms data that is formatted as  a sequence of symbols (e.g., a sequence of decimal  numbers) so that the encrypted form of the data has  the same format and length as the original plaintext  data. Thus, an FPE-encrypted Social Security Number  would be a sequence of nine decimal digits, rather than a  sequence of symbols that may not be decimal numbers  and would very likely be longer than the original plaintext,  as is the case for other encryption modes.  SP 500-316  Framework for Cloud Usability  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.500-316  Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud- based services to meet their business needs. However,  due to the complexity and diversity of cloud systems it   is important to evaluate the user experience using within  a framework that encompasses the characteristics that  define the user experience.   In this paper, we propose  a cloud usability framework to provide a structure to  evaluate the key attributes of the cloud user experience.  The framework includes five attributes and 19 elements  that characterize this user experience.   Generally these  describe the consumer’s expectations of the cloud. The  framework can be the foundation for developing usability  metrics for organizations interested in measuring the  user experience when adopting the cloud.  SP 1800-5 (DRAFT)  IT Asset Management: Financial Services  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-1800-5  While a physical asset management system can  tell you the location of a computer, it cannot answer  questions like, “What operating systems are our laptops  running?” and “Which devices are vulnerable to the  latest threat?” An effective IT asset management (ITAM)  solution can tie together physical and virtual assets and  provide management with a complete picture of what,  where, and how assets are being used. ITAM enhances  visibility for security analysts, which leads to better asset  utilization and security. This NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide provides a reference build of an ITAM solution.  The build contains descriptions of the architecture, all  products used in the build and their individual  configurations. Additionally, this guide provides  a mapping of each product to multiple relevant  security standards. While the reference solution was  demonstrated with a certain suite of products, the  guide does not endorse these specific products. Instead,  it presents the characteristics and capabilities of the  products that an organization’s security experts can use  to identify similar standards-based products that can be  integrated quickly and cost-effectively with a financial  service company’s existing tools and infrastructure.  SP 1800-4 (DRAFT)  Mobile Device Security: Cloud and Hybrid Builds  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html#SP-1800-4  This document proposes a reference design on how  to architect enterprise-class protection for mobile devices  accessing an organization’s resources. The example  solutions presented here can be used by any organization  implementing an enterprise mobility management  solution. This project contains two distinct builds: cloud  and hybrid. The cloud build uses cloud-based services  and solutions, while the hybrid build achieves the same  functionality, but hosts at least some of the data and  services within an enterprise’s own infrastructure. The  example solutions and architectures presented here are  based on open standards and commercially available  products.

NISTIR 8144 (DRAFT)  Assessing Threats to Mobile Devices & Infrastructure:  the Mobile Threat Catalogue  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8144  Mobile devices pose a unique set of threats, yet  typical enterprise protections fail to address the larger  picture. To fully address the threats presented by mobile  devices, a wider view of the mobile security ecosystem  is necessary. This document discusses the Mobile Threat  Catalogue, which describes, identifies, and structures  the threats posed to mobile information systems.  NISTIR 8138 (DRAFT)  Vulnerability Description Ontology (VDO): a  Framework for Characterizing Vulnerabilities  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8138  This document aims to describe a more effective  and efficient methodology for characterizing the  vulnerabilities found in various forms of software and  hardware implementations, including, but not limited  to, information technology systems, industrial control  systems or medical devices to assist in the vulnerability  management process. The primary goal of the described  methodology is to enable automated analysis using  metrics such as the Common Vulnerability Scoring  System (CVSS). Additional goals include establishing  a baseline of the minimum information needed to  properly inform the vulnerability management process,  and facilitating the sharing of vulnerability information  across language barriers.  NISTIR 8136 (DRAFT)  Mobile Application Vetting Services for Public Safety:  an Informal Survey  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8136  The Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012 mandated  the creation of the Nation’s first nationwide, high-speed  communications network dedicated for public safety.  The law instantiated a new federal entity, the Federal  Responder Network Authority (FirstNet), to build,  maintain, and operate a new Long Term Evolution (LTE)  network. This network has the potential to equip first  responders with a modern array of network devices.  Mobile applications stand to be an important resource  that will be utilized by this network. However, current  mobile application developers may not be equipped  with the unique needs and requirements that must  be met for operation on FirstNet’s network. It would  benefit the public safety community to leverage the  mobile application vetting services and infrastructures  that already exist. These services currently target the  general public and enterprise markets. The purpose of  this document is to be an overview of existing mobile  application vetting services, the features these services  provide and how they relate to public safety’s needs. This  document is intended to aid public safety organizations  when selecting mobile application vetting services for  use in analyzing mobile applications.  NISTIR 8135  Identifying and Categorizing Data Types for Public  Safety Mobile Applications: Workshop Report  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8135  The Association of Public-Safety Communications  Officials (APCO), in cooperation with FirstNet and the  Department of Commerce held a half-day workshop on  June 2, 2015, “Identifying and Categorizing Data Types  for Public Safety Mobile Applications.” The goal of this  workshop was to begin identifying different types of  data that will flow through applications that operate  on the National Public Safety Broadband Network  (NPSBN). A diverse group of first responders, industry  leaders, and government representatives attended  the workshop. This document describes the workshop  and captures the input received from the workshop  attendees.  NISTIR 8114 (DRAFT)  Report on Lightweight Cryptography  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8114  NIST-approved cryptographic standards are  designed to perform well using general-purpose  computers. In recent years, there has been an  increased deployment of small computing devices  that have limited resources with which to implement  cryptography. When current NIST-approved algorithms  can be engineered to fit into the limited resources of  constrained environments, their performance may  not be acceptable.  For these reasons, NIST started  a lightweight cryptography project that was tasked  with learning more about the issues and developing  a strategy for the standardization of lightweight  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

NISTIR 8113  SATE V Ockham Sound Analysis Criteria  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8113  Static analyzers examine the source or executable  code of programs to find problems. Many static analyzers  use some heuristics or approximations to handle  programs up to millions of lines of codes. We established  the Ockham Sound Analysis Criteria to recognize static  analyzers whose findings are always correct. In brief  the criteria are (1) the analyzer’s findings are claimed to  always be correct, (2) it produces findings for most of a  program, and (3) even one incorrect finding disqualifies  an analyzer. This document begins by explaining the  background and requirements of the Ockham Criteria in  more detail. In Static Analysis Tool Exposition (SATE) V,  one tool, Frama-C, examined pertinent parts of the Juliet  1.2 test suite to participate. We reviewed eight classes  of warnings, including improper buffer access, NULL  pointer dereference, integer overflow, and others. This  document details the many technical and theoretical  challenges we addressed to classify and review the  warnings against the Criteria. It also reports anomalies,  our observations, and interpretations. Frama-C reports  led to the discovery of three unintentional, systematic  flaws in the Juliet test suite involving 416 test cases. Our  conclusion is that Frama-C satisfied the SATE V Ockham  Sound Analysis Criteria.  NISTIR 8112 (DRAFT)  Attribute Metadata  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8112  This NIST Internal Report contains a metadata  schema for attributes that may be asserted about an  individual during an online transaction. The schema  can be used by relying parties to enrich access control  policies, as well as during runtime evaluation of an  individual’s ability to access protected resources.  Attribute metadata could also create the possibility for  data sharing permissions and limitations on individual  data elements. There are other possible applications of  attribute metadata, such as the evaluation and execution  of business logic in decision support systems; however,  the metadata contained in this document is focused on  supporting an organization’s risk-informed authorization  policies and evaluation.  NISTIR 8105  Report on Post-Quantum Cryptography  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8105  In recent years, there has been a substantial amount  of research on quantum computers – machines that  exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve  mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable  for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum  computers are ever built, they will be able to break many  of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This  would seriously compromise the confidentiality and  integrity of digital communications on the Internet and  elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also  called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop  cryptographic systems that are secure against both  quantum and classical computers, and can interoperate  with existing communications protocols and networks.  This Internal Report shares NIST’s current understanding  about the status of quantum computing and post- quantum cryptography, and outlines NIST’s initial plan to  move forward in this space. The report also recognizes  the challenge of moving to new cryptographic  infrastructures and, therefore, emphasizes the need for  agencies to focus on crypto agility.  NISTIR 8103  Advanced Identity Workshop on Applying  Measurement Science in the Identity Ecosystem:  Summary and Next Steps  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8103  On January 12-13, 2016, ACD hosted a workshop  on “Applying Measurement Science in the Identity  Ecosystem” to discuss the application of measurement  science to digital identity management. This document  summarizes the concepts and ideas presented at the  workshop and serves as a platform to receive feedback  on the major themes discussed at that event.  NISTIR 8101  A Rational Foundation for Software Metrology  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8101  Much software research and practice involves  ostensible measurements of software, yet little progress  has been made on an SI-like metrological foundation for  those measurements since the work of Gray, Hogan, et al.  in 1996-2001. Given a physical object, one can determine  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

In contrast, most software  metrics are simple counts that are used as indicators  of complex, abstract qualities. In this report we revisit  software metrology from two directions: first, top  down, to establish a theory of software measurement;  second, bottom up, to identify specific purposes for  which software measurements are needed, quantifiable  properties of software, relevant units, and objects of  measurement. Although there are structural obstacles  to realizing the vision of software metrology that works  like physical metrology for all desired measurands,  progress is possible if we start with a rational foundation.  NISTIR 8085 (DRAFT)  Forming Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)  Names from Software Identification (SWID) Tags  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsNISTIRs.html#NIST- IR-8085  This report describes the association between  the use of SWID Tags and the Common Platform  Enumeration (CPE) specifications. The publication is  intended as a supplement to NIST Internal Report 8060,  Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software  Identification (SWID) Tags. Both SWID and CPE support  automated and accurate software asset management.  Such automation, in turn, helps organizations to  minimize exposure to publicly disclosed software  vulnerabilities, enforce organizational policies regarding  authorized software, and control network resource  access from potentially vulnerable endpoints. NISTIR  8085 provides guidance to support CPE naming using  information from a SWID tag based on the International  Organization for Standardization/International  Electrotechnical Commission 19770-2:2015 standard.  NISTIR 8080  Usability and Security Considerations for Public  Safety Mobile Authentication  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8080  There is a need for cybersecurity capabilities  and features to protect the National Public Safety  Broadband Network (NPSBN). However, cybersecurity  requirements should not compromise the ability of first  responders to complete their missions. In addition, the  diversity of public safety disciplines means that one  solution may not meet the usability and security needs  of different disciplines. Understanding how public safety  users operate in their different environments will allow  for usable cybersecurity capabilities and features to  be deployed and used. Although first responders work  in a variety of disciplines, this report is focused on the  Fire Service, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and  Law Enforcement. This report describes the constraints  presented by their personal protective equipment (PPE),  specialized gear, and unique operating environments  and how such constraints may interact with mobile  authentication requirements. The overarching goal of  this work is analyzing which authentication solutions  are the most appropriate and usable for first responders  using mobile devices in operational scenarios in the field.  NISTIR 8074 (2 volumes)  Volume 1: Report on Strategic U.S. Government  Engagement in International Standardization to  Achieve U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8074v1  This interagency report sets out proposed U.S.  Government strategic objectives for pursuing the  development and use of international standards  for cybersecurity and makes recommendations to  achieve those objectives. The recommendations cover  interagency coordination, collaboration with the U.S.  private sector and international partners, agency  participation in international standards development,  standards training and education, the use of international  standards to achieve mission and policy objectives, and  other issues.  Volume 2: Supplemental Information  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8074v2  This report provides background information  and analysis in support of NISTIR 8074 Volume 1,  “Interagency Report on Strategic U.S. Government  Engagement in International Standardization to Achieve  U.S. Objectives for Cybersecurity.” It provides a current  summary of ongoing activities in critical international  cybersecurity standardization and an inventory of U.S.  Government and U.S. private sector engagement. It also  provides information for federal agencies and other  stakeholders to help plan more effective participation in  international cybersecurity standards development and  related conformity assessment activities.

One of the main drivers making this change possible  is the deployment of 4th generation (4G) LTE cellular  technologies. This document serves as a guide to  the fundamentals of how LTE networks operate and  explores the LTE security architecture. This is followed  by an analysis of the threats posed to LTE networks and  supporting mitigations.  NISTIR 8063 (DRAFT)  Primitives and Elements of Internet of Things (IoT)  Trustworthiness  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/nistir-8063/ nistir_8063_draft.pdf  System primitives allow formalisms, reasoning,  simulations, and reliability and security risk tradeoffs to  be formulated and argued. In this document, five core  primitives belonging to most distributed systems are  presented. These primitives apply well to systems with  large amounts of data, scalability concerns, heterogeneity  concerns, temporal concerns, and elements of unknown  pedigree with possible nefarious intent. These primitives  form the basic building blocks for a Network of ‘Things’  (NoT), including the Internet of Things (IoT). This report  offers an underlying and foundational science to IoT.  NISTIR 8060  Guidelines for the Creation of Interoperable Software  Identification (SWID) Tags  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8060  This report provides an overview of the capabilities  and usage of SWID tags as part of a comprehensive  software lifecycle. As instantiated in the International  Organization for Standardization/International  Electrotechnical Commission 19770-2 standard, SWID  tags support numerous applications for software asset  management and information security management. This  report introduces SWID tags in an operational context,  provides guidelines for the creation of interoperable  SWID tags, and highlights key usage scenarios for which  SWID tags are applicable.  NISTIR 8055  Derived Personal Identity Verification (PIV)  Credentials (DPC) Proof of Concept Research  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8055  This report documents proof-of-concept research  for DPC. Smart card-based PIV Cards cannot be readily  used with most mobile devices, such as smartphones  and tablets, but DPC can be used instead to PIV-enable  these devices and provide multi-factor authentication  for mobile device users. This report captures existing  requirements related to DPC, proposes an architecture  that supports these requirements, and then demonstrates  how such an architecture could be implemented and  operated.  NISTIR 8053  De-Identification of Personal Information  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8053  De-identification removes identifying information  from a dataset so that individual data cannot be linked  with specific individuals. De-identification can reduce  the privacy risk associated with collecting, processing,  archiving, distributing or publishing information. De- identification attempts to balance the contradictory  goals of using and sharing personal information while  protecting privacy. Several U.S. laws, regulations and  policies specify that data should be de-identified prior  to sharing. In recent years, researchers have shown that  some de-identified data can sometimes be re-identified.  Many kinds of information can be de-identified, including  structured information, free-format text, multimedia, and  medical imagery. This document summarizes roughly  two decades of de-identification research, discusses  current practices, and presents opportunities for future  research.  NISTIR 8040  Measuring the Usability and Security of Permuted  Passwords on Mobile Platforms  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8040  Password entry on mobile devices significantly  impacts both usability and security, but there is a lack  of usable security research in this area, specifically for  complex password entry. To address this research gap,  we set out to assign strength metrics to passwords for  which we already had usability data to have a more  meaningful comparison between usability and security.  This document reports a method of optimizing the  input of randomly generated passwords on mobile  devices via password permutation to allow for a  comparison of password usability data. We found that  the number of keystrokes saved—the efficiency gained— via permutation depends on the number of onscreen  keyboard changes required in the original password  rather than on password length. Additionally, we created  and are releasing Python scripts (publicly available from  https://github.com/usnistgov/PasswordMetrics) for  the experiments on entropy loss we conducted across  passwords ranging in length from 5 to 20 characters.

This NISTIR represents a joint effort between NIST  and the Department of Homeland Security to provide  an operational approach for automating security control  assessments in order to facilitate information security  continuous monitoring (ISCM), ongoing assessment,  and ongoing security authorizations in a way that is  consistent with the NIST Risk Management Framework  overall and the guidance in NIST SPs 800-53 and 800- 53A in particular.  NISTIR 8011 will ultimately consist of 13 volumes.  Volume 1 introduces the general approach to automating  security control assessments, 12 ISCM security  capabilities, and terms and concepts common to all  12 capabilities. Volume 2 provides details specific to  the hardware asset management security capability.  The remaining 11 ISCM security capability volumes will  provide details specific to each capability but will be  organized in a very similar way to Volume 2.  Volume 1: Overview  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8011-1.pdf  Volume 1 of NISTIR 8011 introduces concepts to  support an automated assessment of most of the  security controls in SP 800-53. Referencing SP 800- 53A, the controls are divided into more granular parts  (determination statements) to be assessed. The parts of  the control assessed by each determination statement  are called control items. These control items are then  grouped into the appropriate security capabilities. As  suggested by SP 800-53 Revision 4, security capabilities  are groups of controls that support a common purpose.  For effective automated assessment, testable defect  checks are defined that bridge the determination  statements to the broader security capabilities to be  achieved and to the SP 800-53 security control items  themselves. The defect checks correspond to security  sub-capabilities—called sub-capabilities because  each is part of a larger capability. Capabilities and  sub-capabilities are both designed with the purpose  of addressing a series of attack steps. Automated  assessments (in the form of defect checks) are  performed using the test assessment method defined  in SP 800-53A by comparing a desired and actual state  (or behavior).  Volume 2: Hardware Asset Management Assets  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8011-2.pdf  This document, Volume 2 of NISTIR 8011, addresses  the Hardware Asset Management (HWAM) information  security capability. The focus of the HWAM capability  is to manage risk created by unmanaged devices on a  network. Unmanaged devices are targets that attackers  can use to gain and more easily maintain a persistent  platform from which to attack the rest of the network.  NISTIR 7987 Revision 1  Policy Machine: Features, Architecture, and  Specification  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7987r1  The ability to control access to sensitive data in  accordance with policy is perhaps the most fundamental  security requirement. Despite over four decades of  security research, the limited ability for existing access  control mechanisms to enforce a comprehensive range  of policy persists. While researchers, practitioners and  policy makers have specified a large variety of access  control policies to address real-world security issues,  only a relatively small subset of these policies can be  enforced through off-the-shelf technology, and even a  smaller subset can be enforced by any one mechanism.  This report describes an access control framework,  referred to as the Policy Machine (PM), which  fundamentally changes the way policy is expressed and  enforced. The report gives an overview of the PM and  the range of policies that can be specified and enacted.  The report also describes the architecture of the PM and  the properties of the PM model in detail.  NISTIR 7977  NIST Cryptographic Standards and Guidelines  Development Process  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7977  This document describes the principles, processes  and procedures that drive cryptographic standards  and guidelines development efforts at NIST. This  document reflects public comments received on two  earlier versions, and will serve as the basis to guide  NIST’s future cryptographic standards and guidelines  development efforts. It will be reviewed and updated  every five years, or more frequently if a need arises, to  help ensure that NIST fulfills its role and responsibilities  for producing robust, effective cryptographic standards  and guidelines.

This is often accomplished using the SSH  protocol. The SSH protocol supports several mechanisms  for interactive and automated authentication. The  management of this access requires proper provisioning,  termination, and monitoring processes. However, the  security of SSH key-based access has been largely  ignored to date. This publication assists organizations  in understanding the basics of SSH interactive and  automated access management in an enterprise,  focusing on the management of SSH user keys.  NISTIR 7904  Trusted Geolocation in the Cloud: Proof of Concept  Implementation  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7904  This publication explains selected security  challenges involving Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  cloud computing technologies and geolocation. It then  describes a proof-of-concept implementation that was  designed to address those challenges. The publication  provides sufficient details about the proof-of-concept  implementation so that organizations can reproduce it  if desired. The publication is intended to be a blueprint  or template that can be used by the general security  community to validate and implement the described  proof of concept implementation.  NISTIR 7511 Revision 4  Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) Version  1.2 Validation Program Test Requirements  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.7511r4  This report defines the requirements and associated  test procedures necessary for products or modules  to achieve one or more SCAP validations.

Through research and discussion, the  NCCoE has identified several areas of interest within a  broader cybersecurity subject, in this case, improved  security for connected devices, or the “Internet of  Things.” Public comments on this concept paper will  help the NCCoE understand specific challenges and  needs, and may be used to help define a challenge  statement, use cases, and/or a project description.  Comments will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Our  hope is that stakeholders will help identify models,  methodologies, protocols, best practices, or standards  from other industries that may be relevant to securing  smart home technology.  P r o j e c t  D e s c r i p t i o n s  ( N C C o E )  Authentication for Law Enforcement Vehicle Systems  (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/authentication- law-enforcement-vehicle-systems  Law enforcement vehicles often serve as mobile  offices. In-vehicle laptops or other computer systems are  used to access a wide range of software applications and  databases hosted and operated by federal, state, and  local agencies, with each typically requiring a different  username and password. This operational environment  presents unique security challenges. Officers must  frequently leave the vehicle unattended, perhaps on  short notice, and must be able to gain access to systems  quickly once they return or possibly while the vehicle  is in motion. These needs discourage the use of screen  locks and traditional single sign-on solutions. This  project demonstrated an integrated set of authentication  mechanisms, improving system security, usability, and  safety. This project also explored additional capabilities,  such as proximity authentication, Distributed Control  System (DPC) integration with First Responder  Network Authority (FirstNet), and integration with  vehicle drive-away protection and Computer Assisted  Dispatch systems to indicate whether the officer is in the  vehicle. This project will result in a freely available NIST  Cybersecurity Practice Guide that will enable members of  the community to more easily and effectively incorporate  proximity access and reduced-sign-on technologies.  Data Integrity: Recovering from a Destructive Malware  Attack  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building_blocks/data_ integrity  Threats of destructive malware, malicious insider  activity, and even honest mistakes create the imperative  for organizations to be able to quickly recover from  an event that alters or destroys any form of data  (database records, system files, configurations, user  files, application code, etc.). Organizations must be  confident that recovered data is accurate and safe.  The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence  (NCCoE)—in collaboration with members of the  business community and vendors of cybersecurity  solutions—built an example solution to address these  complex data integrity challenges. Multiple systems  need to work together to prevent, detect, notify, and  recover when data integrity is jeopardized. This project  explored methods to effectively monitor and detect data  corruption in commodity components (server, operating  system, applications, and software configurations)  as well as custom applications and data. The project  also explored issues of auditing and reporting (user  activity monitoring, file system monitoring, database  monitoring, scanning backups/snapshots for malware  and rapid recovery solutions) to support recovery and  investigations. To address real-world business challenges  around data integrity, the resulting example solution was  composed of open-source and commercially available  components. Ultimately, this project resulted in a  publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide—a  description of the solution and practical steps needed  to implement an example solution that addresses these  existing challenges.  Domain Name System-Based Security for Electronic Mail  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/building_blocks/secured_ email  The Domain Name System-Based Security for  Electronic Mail project produced a proof-of-concept  security platform that demonstrated trustworthy email  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The  product of the project was a security platform that  included the authentication of mail servers, the signing  and encryption of email, and binding cryptographic key  certificates to the servers; it also included a practice  guide that explained how to configure and use the  demonstrated platform to satisfy both operational and  security requirements. Domain Name System Security  Extension (DNSSEC) protocols were used to authenticate  server addresses and certificates by binding the X.509  certificates used for TLS to DNS names verified by  DNSSEC. The business value of the security platform  resulted from this project not only improves privacy  and security protection for users’ operations, but also  expands the set of available DNS security applications  and encourages wider implementation of the protocols  that provide Internet users with confidence that  entities to which they believe they are connecting are  the entities to which they are actually connecting.  This project resulted in one or more demonstration  prototype DNS-based secure email platforms, a  publicly available NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide  that explains how to employ the platform(s) to meet  federal and industry security and privacy requirements,  platform documentation necessary to compose a  DNS-based email security platform from off-the- shelf components, and any recommendations for  improvements to applicable standards documentation.  The secure email project involved the composition  of a variety of components that were provided by a  number of different vendors. Client systems, DNS/ DNSSEC services, mail transfer agents, and certificate  providers (Certificate Authorities or CAs) were included.  The NCCoE entered into cooperative research and  development agreements with technology providers for  components and expertise that included DNS resolvers  (stub and recursive) for DNSSEC, authoritative DNS  servers for DNSSEC signed zones, mail servers and  mail security components, and extended validation and  domain validation TLS certificates.  Mobile Application Single Sign-on: for Public Safety and  First Responders (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/mobile-sso  Mobile platforms offer a significant operational  advantage to public safety stakeholders by giving them  access to mission critical information and services while  deployed in the field, during training and exercises,  or participating in the day-to-day business and  preparations during non-emergency periods. However,  these advantages can be limited if unnecessary or  complex authentication requirements stand in the  way of an official providing emergency services,  especially when any delay – even seconds – is a matter  of containing or exacerbating an emergency situation.  The vast diversity of public safety personnel, missions,  and operational environments magnifies the need for  a nimble authentication solution for public safety. This  project is exploring various multi-factor authenticators  currently in use, or expected to be offered in the future,  by the public safety community as their next generation  networks are brought online. The effort is not only  building an interoperable solution that can accept various  authenticators to speed access to online systems while  maintaining an appropriate amount of security, but the  project also focuses on delivering single sign-on (SSO)  capabilities to both native and web/browser-based  applications. It is not enough to have an authenticator  that is easy to use. This project is working to identify  technical options for the public safety community to  consider for deployment to ensure individuals in the  field are not kept from meeting their mission goals by  unnecessary authentication prompts. This project will  result in a freely available NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide that details the technical decisions, tradeoffs,  lessons-learned, and build instructions, based on  market-dominant standards, such that public safety  organizations can accelerate the deployment of a range  of mobile authentication and SSO services to their  population of users.  Multifactor Authentication for e-Commerce: Online  Authentication for the Retail Sector (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/multifactor- authentication-ecommerce  As greater security control mechanisms are  implemented at the point of sale, retailers in the United  States may see a drastic increase in e-commerce fraud,  similar to what has been widely observed in the UK and  Europe following the rollout of Europay, MasterCard and  Visa (EMV) chip-and-PIN technology approximately ten  years ago. Consumers, retailers, payment processors,  banks, and card issuers are all impacted by the security  risks of e-commerce transactions. Retailers bear the  cost for fraudulent, card-not-present transactions,  motivating them to reduce fraud to avoid damage  to reputation and eliminate potential revenue losses,  which have been estimated to be over $3 billion.

In  collaboration with stakeholders in the retail and  e-commerce ecosystem, the NCCoE has determined that  implementing multifactor authentication for e-commerce  transactions can help reduce the risk of false online  identification and authentication fraud. Consumers  and retailers will adopt multi-factor authentication  mechanisms if they do not unnecessarily encumber the  purchasing process, or if they are applied evenly across  the entire sector. Building on this collaboration with  the business community and vendors of cybersecurity  solutions, the NCCoE explored methods to effectively  identify and authenticate purchasers during e-commerce  transactions and develop an example solution composed  of open-source and commercially available components.  This project produced a NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide—a publicly available description of the solution  and practical steps needed to implement practices that  effectively identify and authenticate purchasers during  e-commerce transactions.  Securing Non-Credit Card, Sensitive Consumer Data:  Consumer Data Security for the Retail Sector (DRAFT)  https://nccoe.nist.gov/projects/use_cases/securing- sensitive-consumer-data  As a result of payment card industry standards  and a strong understanding of the value of valid credit  card information in the black market, the retail industry  has already invested in security mechanisms to protect  credit card data, also referred to as cardholder data.  However, this cardholder data is not the only valuable  consumer information that is transmitted and stored by  retailers. Other data that can be personally identifiable  and is transmitted and stored in this ecosystem includes,  but is not limited to, consumer purchasing habits  (including geographical locations, preferences, search  history), the dates of birth, home or business addresses,  phone numbers, email addresses, user ids, passwords,  IP addresses, and Social Security Numbers. As seen  following high-profile data breaches in the healthcare  sector, PII is valued at up to 20 times more than credit  card data, with a single credit card number sold at $1 and  the average individual’s PII sold at $20. In collaboration  with stakeholders in the retail and commercial  payment ecosystem, the NCCoE has determined that  implementing data masking and tokenization, coupled  with fine-grained access control such as Attribute  Based Access Control2, may significantly improve the  security of PII transmitted and stored during commercial  payment transactions, as well as PII shared internally  within a retail organization and externally with business  partners. Building on this collaboration with the business  community and vendors of cybersecurity solutions, the  NCCoE is exploring methods of effectively masking and  tokenizing PII during commercial payment transactions  and developing an example solution composed of  open-source and commercially available components  to address these real-world business challenges. This  project will produce a NIST Cybersecurity Practice  Guide—a publicly available description of the solution  and practical steps needed to implement practices that  more effectively secure the handling of non-credit card,  sensitive consumer data.

It  helps organizational leaders identify opportunities for  improvement, based on their cybersecurity needs and  objectives, as well as their larger organizational needs,  objectives, and outcomes. This self-assessment, can be  used to:  • Determine cybersecurity-related activities that are  important to business strategy and critical service  delivery;  • Prioritize investments in managing cybersecurity  risk;  • Determine how best to enable the workforce,  customers, suppliers, partners, and collaborators to  be risk conscious and security aware, and to fulfill  their cybersecurity roles and responsibilities;  • Assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of  cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and practices;  • Assess the cybersecurity results achieved; and  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

It is adaptable and scalable  to an organization’s needs, goals, capabilities, and  environment. It does not prescribe how an organization’s  cybersecurity policies and operations should be  structured. Through interrelated sets of open-ended  questions, it encourages the use of approaches that  best fit the organization.  Best Practices for Privileged User PIV Authentication  http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/papers/2016/best- practices-privileged-user-piv-authentication.pdf  The Cybersecurity Strategy and Implementation  Plan (CSIP), published by the OMB on October 30,  2015, requires that federal agencies use PIV credentials  for authenticating privileged users. This will greatly  reduce unauthorized access to privileged accounts by  attackers impersonating system, network, security, and  database administrators, as well as other IT personnel  with administrative privileges. This white paper further  explains the need for multi-factor PIV-based user  authentication to take the place of password-based  single-factor authentication for privileged users. It also  provides best practices for agencies implementing PIV  authentication for privileged users.

In effect, a BCM is  an authenticated bit commitment scheme, which is  AND-homomorphic. We show that a BCM has natural  and important applications. In particular, we use a  BCM to construct a mechanism for transmitting alerts  undetectably in a message-passing system of n nodes.  Our algorithms allow an alert to quickly propagate to  all nodes without its source or existence being detected  by an adversary, who controls all message traffic. Our  proofs of security are based on a new subgroup escape  problem, which seems hard on certain groups with  bilinear pairings and on elliptic curves over the ring Zn.  J. Boyar, M. Find and R.

Namely, we study three  circuit models: monotone OR-circuits, monotone SUM- circuits (addition of non-negative integers), and non- monotone XOR-circuits (addition modulo 2). Our focus  is on separating OR-circuits from the two other models  in terms of circuit complexity:  1. We show how to obtain matrices that admit OR- circuits of size O(n)O(n), but require SUM-circuits of  size Ω(n3/2/log2n).  2. We consider the task of rewriting a given OR-circuit  as an XOR-circuit and prove that any subquadratic- time algorithm for this task violates the strong  exponential time hypothesis.  M.

This has  the potential to greatly benefit many organizations. The  key to the successful implementation of a cloud-based  information system is a level of transparency into the  cloud provider’s service. This article focuses on security  risks related to the operation and use of cloud-based  information systems.  M. Iorga and K.

Identifying, defining, selecting, and prioritizing these  functional capabilities and the security components that  implement and enforce them is surprisingly challenging.  This article explains recent developments by NIST in  addressing these challenges. The article focuses on the  capability-oriented methodology for orchestrating a  secure cloud ecosystem proposed as part of the NIST  Cloud Computing Security Reference Architecture. The  methodology recognizes that risk can vary for cloud  actors within a single ecosystem, so it takes a risk- based approach to functional capabilities. The result  is an assessment of which cloud actor is responsible  for implementing each security component and how  implementation should be prioritized. Cloud actors,  especially cloud consumers, that follow the methodology  can more easily make well-informed decisions regarding  their cloud ecosystems.  C. Kolias, A. Stavrou, J. Voas, I.

This study identifies the  affective manifestations resulting from decision fatigue  and the role it plays in users’ security decisions. A semi  structured interview protocol was used to collect data  (N = 40). Interview questions addressed online activities;  computer security perceptions; and the knowledge and  use of security icons, tools, and terminology. Qualitative  data techniques were used to code and analyze the data  identifying security fatigue and contributing factors,  symptoms, and outcomes of fatigue. Although fatigue  was not directly part of the interview protocol, more  than half of the participants alluded to fatigue in their  interviews. Participants expressed a sense of resignation,  loss of control, fatalism, risk minimization, and decision  avoidance, all characteristics of security fatigue. The  authors found that the security fatigue users experience  contributes to their cost-benefit analyses in how to  incorporate security practices and reinforces their ideas  of lack of benefit for following security advice.  M. Theofanos, S. Garfinkel, and Y. Choong, Secure and  Usable Enterprise Authentication: Lessons from the Field.  IEEE Security & Privacy, 14(5), pp.14-21 (February 2016).  There are now more than 5.4 million Personal Identity  Verification (PIV) and Common Access Card (CAC)  identity cards deployed to US government employees  and contractors. These cards are widely used to gain  physical access to federal facilities, but their use to  authenticate logical access to government information  systems has been uneven. We report the reasons for  the uneven deployment and then compare the results  of a 26,691-person survey within the Department of  Defense (DoD) and a 4,573-person survey within the  Department of Commerce (DOC) to show that the use  of smart-cards for 2-factor authentication results in  improved usability and security when compared with  1-factor, password-only systems. We show that these  benefits extend beyond the smart cards to other systems  within the organizations that solely employ password  authentication. We argue that PKI token-based  authentication systems, such as smartcards, are likely  to provide authentication that is simultaneously more  secure and more usable than other 2-factor approaches,  such as combining strong passwords with cell phones or  with time-based hardware identity tokens.

Estimates are often based on error rates in initial testing,  or on code coverage. For example, tests may be run  until a desired level of statement or branch coverage  is achieved. Combinatorial methods present an  opportunity for a different approach to estimating the  required test set size, using characteristics of the test  set. This paper describes methods for estimating the  coverage of, and ability to detect, the t-way interaction  faults of a test set based on a covering array. We also  develop a connection between (static) combinatorial  coverage and (dynamic) code coverage, such that if a  specific condition is satisfied, 100 % branch coverage  is assured. Using these results, we propose practical  recommendations for using combinatorial coverage  in specifying test requirements, and for improving  estimates of the fault detection capacity of a test set.

Prior work  has provided near optimal heuristics with a high time  complexity that function on up to hundreds of nodes  and less optimal but faster techniques that function on  up to thousands of nodes. In this work, we analyze how  to perform vertex partitioning on massive graphs of tens  of millions of nodes. We use a previously known and  very simple heuristic technique: iteratively removing  the node of the largest degree and all its edges. This  approach has an apparent quadratic complexity since,  upon removal of a node and adjoining set of edges,  the node degree calculations must be updated prior  to choosing the next node. However, we describe a  linear time complexity solution using an array whose  indices map to node degree and whose values are hash  tables indicating the presence or absence of a node at  that degree value.

More  recently, this diversity has found new applications in  cloud computing security, moving-target defense, and  improving the robustness of network routing. However,  most existing efforts rely on intuitive and imprecise  notions of diversity, and the few existing diversity models  are mostly designed for a single system running diverse  software replicas or variants. At a higher abstraction  level, as a global property of the entire network, network  diversity and its effect on security have received limited  attention. In this paper, we take the first step toward  formally modeling network diversity as a security metric  by designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics.  In particular, we first devise a biodiversity-inspired metric  based on the effective number of distinct resources. We  then propose two complementary diversity metrics,  based on the least and the average attacking efforts,  respectively. We provide guidelines for instantiating the  proposed metrics and present a case study on estimating  software diversity. Finally, we evaluate the proposed  metrics through simulation.

Recent work show that this  diversity can be modeled and quantified as a security  metric at the network level. However, such an effort  does not directly provide a solution for improving the  network diversity, and existing network hardening  approaches are largely limited to handling previously  known vulnerabilities by disabling existing services. In  this paper, we take the first step toward an automated  approach to diversifying network services under various  cost constraints in order to improve the network’s  resilience against unknown attacks. Specifically, we  provide a model of network services and formulate the  diversification requirements as an optimization problem.  We devise optimization and heuristic algorithms for  efficiently diversifying relatively large networks under  different cost constraints. We also evaluate our approach  through simulations.  S.

In this work, we propose inf- TESLA, Infinite Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant  Authentication, a multicast, delayed authentication  protocol for communication links that are used to  stream synchrophasor data for wide area control of  electric power networks. Our approach is based on  the authentication protocol TESLA, but is augmented  to accommodate high frequency transmissions of  unbounded length. The inf-TESLA protocol utilizes  the Dual Offset Key Chains mechanism to reduce  authentication delay and the computational cost  associated with key chain commitment. We provide a  description of the mechanism using two different modes  for disclosing keys and demonstrate its security against  a man-in-the-middle attack attempt. We compare  our approach against the TESLA protocol in a 2-day  simulation scenario, showing a reduction of 15.82  %  and 47.29  % in computational cost by the sender and  receiver, respectively, and a cumulative reduction in the  communication overhead.

Published in the Proceedings of the Human Factors and  Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting (Vol. 60, No. 1, pp.  760-764). Sage CA: Los Angeles, CA: SAGE Publications.  (September 2016).  Although many aspects of passwords have  been studied, no research to date has systematically  examined how ambiguous terminology affects the  user experience during password rule comprehension,  a necessary precursor to password generation. Our  research begins to address this gap by focusing on users  comprehension of password generation rules. Varying  terms special characters, symbols, non-alphanumeric  characters, and punctuation are used in different  password rules, but mostly without explicit definition.  In this laboratory study, we used character-selection  and compliance-checking tasks with 60 participants to  investigate effects of varying terms on users’ password  rule comprehension. Results show that manipulating  terminology caused participants conception of the  allowed character space to shrink or expand. Our  quantitative and qualitative data show that participants  were extremely confused by the variety of terms for  special character. Seemingly small changes in language  have large, observable impacts on users understanding  of password rules. Language in password requirements  must be carefully constructed to ensure that people  fully comprehend the allowable character space. This  research is an important first step to providing data- driven guidance on constructing clearer language for  password rules.

Do  these two tools generally find the same set of bugs, or  different, complimentary sets? Can we guarantee that  a new technique discovers all problems of this type? To  answer such questions, we need a vastly improved way to  describe classes of vulnerabilities and chains of failures.  This paper presents a descriptive framework that will lift  the current realm of best efforts and useful heuristics.  Our framework includes rigorous definitions and (static)  characteristics of bug classes, along with their related  dynamic properties, such as proximate, secondary, and  tertiary causes and consequences (CCC), and sites. The  paper discusses the buffer overflow class, the injection  class, and the interaction frequency control class, and  provides examples of applying our taxonomy to describe  particular vulnerabilities.

Test Suites 45 and 46 are analyzed,  discussed, and updated to improve accuracy, con- sistency, reciseness, and automation. Empirical results  show metrics such as recall, precision, and F-Measure  are all impacted by invalid base assumptions regarding  the test suites.  B. Stivalet and E. N.

The IARPA  (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity)  STONESOUP (Securely Taking on Software of Uncertain  Provenance) Program [1] has produced such a test suite.  Our presentation will characterize this test suite called  the STONESOUP Phase 3 Test Suite. This test suite  consists of 7769 individual test cases, of which 4581 are  in C and 3188 are in Java. All of these test cases may be  accessed independently. Each test case is derived from  real-world open source applications. This test suite is  significant in that it is the first test suite of its kind (to our  knowledge) to be based on large real-world code sets.  Our presentation will describe the test suite format and  contents, as well as the structure of the test cases in the  test suite. Additional relevant information pertaining to  the test suite including the test case naming convention  and how to specify the metadata xml file will also be  provided, containing all the instructions needed to build,  execute and score a given test case.

The networking infrastructure in a  cloud (virtualized) data center, therefore, consists of the  combination of physical IP network (data center fabric)  and the virtual network residing in virtualized hosts.  Network Segmentation (Isolation), Traffic flow control  using firewalls and Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion  Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) form the primary network- based security techniques, with the first one as the  foundation for the other two. In this paper, we describe  and analyze three generations of network segmentation  techniques: Virtual Switches & Physical NIC-based,  Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)-based & Overlay- based. We take a detailed look at the overlay-based  virtual network segmentation and its characteristics,  such as scalability and ease of configuration.  D. Ferraiolo, R. Chandramouli, D. R. Kuhn and V.

An objective of both is to provide a  standardized way for expressing and enforcing vastly  diverse access control policies in support of various  types of data services. The two standards differ with  respect to the way that access control policies and  attributes are specified and managed, and decisions are  computed and enforced.

In IFIP Advances in  Information and Communication Technology 484, pp. 189- 210.  https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-46279-0_10  Modern-day attackers use sophisticated multi-  stage and/or multi-host attack techniques and anti- forensic tools to cover their attack traces. Due to the  limitations of current intrusion detection systems and  forensic analysis tools, evidence often has false positive  errors or is incomplete. Additionally, because of the  large number of security events, discovering an attack  pattern is much like finding a needle in a haystack.  Consequently, reconstructing attack scenarios and  holding attackers accountable for their activities are  major challenges.  This chapter describes a probabilistic model that  applies Bayesian networks to construct evidence  graphs. The model helps address the problems posed  by false positive errors, analyze the reasons for missing  evidence and compute the posterior probabilities and  false positive rates of attack scenarios constructed  using the available evidence. A companion software tool  for network forensic analysis was used in conjunction  with the probabilistic model. The tool, which is written  in Prolog, leverages vulnerability databases and an  anti-forensic database similar to the NIST National  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

Restricting attack graph  size is vital for the execution of high degree polynomial  analysis algorithms. However, we find that the most widely  cited and recently used “condition/exploit” attack graph  representation has a worst-case quadratic node growth  with respect to the number of hosts in the network when  a linear representation will suffice. In 2002, a node linear  representation in the form of a “condition” approach was  published but was not significantly used in subsequent  research. In analyzing the condition approach, we find  that (while node linear) it suffers from edge explosions:  the creation of unnecessary complete bipartite sub- graphs. To address the weaknesses in both approaches,  we provide a new hybrid “condition/vulnerability”  representation that regains linearity in the number of  nodes and that removes unnecessary complete bipartite  sub-graphs, mitigating the edge explosion problem. In  our empirical study modeling an operational 5968-node  network, our new representation had 94 % fewer nodes  and 64 % fewer edges than the currently used condition/ exploit approach.  D.

This paper demonstrates attacks that are  significantly cheaper than the claimed security level of the  parameters given by Gligoroski et al. We implemented an  attack on the proposed 80-bit parameters that recovered  private keys for both encryption and signatures in  approximately two hours on a single laptop. We further  find that increasing the parameters to avoid our attack  will require parameters to grow by (at least) two orders  of magnitude for encryption, and may not be achievable  at all for signatures.

Due to the  current limitations of intrusion detection and forensic  analysis tools, reconstructing attack scenarios from  evidence left behind by the attackers of an enterprise  system is challenging. In particular, reconstructing attack  scenarios by using the information from IDS alerts and  system logs that have a large number of false positives  is a big challenge. In this poster, we present a model  and an accompanying software tool that systematically  addresses how to resolve the above problems to  reconstruct the attack scenario. These problems include  a large amount of data, including non-relevant data  and evidence destroyed by anti-forensic techniques.  Our system is based on a Prolog system using known  vulnerability databases and an anti-forensics database  that we plan to extend to a standardized database like  the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In this  model, we use different methods, including mapping the  T H I S  P U B L I C AT I O N  I S  AVA I L A B L E  F R E E  O F  C H A R G E  F R O M :  h t t p : // d x . d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 6 0 2 8 / N I S T .

The goal of this work is to reduce the investigators’ time  and effort in reaching a definite conclusion about how  an attack occurred. Our results indicate that such a  reasoning system can be useful for network forensics  analysis.  X. Sun, A. Singhal and P. Liu, Who Touched My Mission:  Towards Probabilistic Mission Impact Assessment, 2015  Workshop on Automated Decision Making for Active Cyber  Defense (SafeConfig ’15), Denver, Colorado, United States,  October 12, 2015, pp 21-26.  https://doi.org/10.1145/2809826.2809834  Cyber attacks inevitably have negative impacts  on relevant missions. However, concrete methods to  accurately evaluate such impacts are rare. In this paper,  we propose a probabilistic approach based on Bayesian  networks for quantitative mission impact assessment.  A System Object Dependency Graph (SODG) is first  built to capture the intrusion propagation process at  the low operating system level. On top of the SODG,  a mission-task-asset (MTA) map can be established  to associate the system objects with corresponding  tasks and missions. Based on the MTA map, a Bayesian  network can be constructed to leverage the collected  intrusion evidence and infer the probabilities of tasks  and missions being tainted. This approach is promising  for effective quantitative mission impact assessment.

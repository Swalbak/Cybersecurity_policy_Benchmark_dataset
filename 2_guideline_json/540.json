One of the most transcendental adaptations the industrial world is currently  experiencing is the convergence between Operations Technology (OT), the operations needed to carry  out the industrial processes, and Information Technology (IT), the use of computers to manage data  needed by the organisation’s enterprise processes. This convergence has many advantages  (optimisation of operations, better use of resources, cost savings, etc.), but it also raises additional  issues, such as the need for cyber security of industrial control systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.  This convergence, which affects hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide, implies that  professionals with knowledge of cyber security for ICS/SCADA will be needed. However, currently,  there are very few professionals with the proven skills available to do this work.  This document explores how current initiatives on certification of professional skills are related to the  topic of ICS/SCADA cyber security. It also identifies the challenges and proposes a series of  recommendations towards the development of certification schemes for ICS/SCADA cyber security  professionals.  Challenges identified in relation to operational issues of certifications included the following:   The need to handle the confluence of contents, objectives and needs of two very different  topics such as cyber security and industrial automation within a number of different industrial  sectors (energy, oil & gas, automated manufacturing, water treatment, chemical,  pharmaceutical, etc.)   The complexity of including topics and content relevant to different roles and profiles. In the  field of cyber security for ICS/SCADA systems there are implications ranging from the lower  operative levels to the top management.   The challenge to include an important practical component, in future certification contents,  able to take into account the nature of the operations performed over industrial control  systems. This can be a complicated issue since the operations where ICS are involved, usually  need to be executed continuously making it difficult to put them in practice on production  systems.  Challenges related to the societal aspects include the following:   Avoiding commercial interests that could impair the credibility of certifications.   Obtaining stakeholders’ support to underscore the relevance, credibility and strength of  future certifications.   Ensuring that the future certifications will improve compared with existing ones in regards the  level of knowledge related to cyber security for ICS/SCADA.   Exploring the professional roles and specific knowledge needed by cyber security  professionals for ICS/SCADA.  Pursuant to interviews with experts worldwide and the analysis of the results of an online survey, this  report proposes a series of recommendations for the development of cyber security certifications for  ICS/SCADA professionals.  This report concludes that the development of an overarching certification scheme is of paramount  importance to allow European professionals to achieve the degree of measured knowledge needed to  deal with the cyber security issues in ICS/SCADA systems. This would create a suitable workforce for  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  vi  European industrial organisations to face the cyber security challenges related to these systems.  Certification should be multi-level to allow reaching a wide range of professionals from different fields  of practice ; it should include not only operational but managerial topics and it should contain practical  aspects, to guarantee that the knowledge of certified professionals is not only theoretical and can be  directly applied to industrial operations.  Other proposed recommendations, relevant for both the public and private sectors, with special focus  on the European Union institutions, are to:   Create a steering committee formed by independent experts in charge of evaluation of criteria  for reviewing and assessment of current and future certifications.   Take into account existing certifications to get support of the global community and obtain a  critical mass of certificates.   Develop simulation environments for practical training and testing of skills without effecting  production environments.   Create a framework which defines the main features and contents of future European  ICS/SCADA cyber security certification schemes.

Additionally they have matched the growing concern  of governments about cyber threats and attacks originating from rogue agents. This has made Critical  Infrastructure Protection, the preparedness and response to serious incidents involving critical  infrastructures of a nation, a priority for governments worldwide.  The European Union, through the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection5 (EPCIP)  has set the principles and instruments that EU member states need to implement in order to protect  their critical infrastructures.  Many of these critical infrastructures belong to industrial sectors that have a deeply rooted concept  of security. Industrial security has been mainly focused on physical security as well as in health and  environmental safety. Nowadays cyber security has become a new important component of industrial  security. This is a novelty for many industrial organizations that is causing different sets of problems  for them to achieve the required degree of cyber protection.  Traditionally, the cyber security literature has not taken into account the specific features and needs  of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.  These systems are widely used in industries from different sectors (energy, oil & gas, automated  manufacturing, water treatment, chemical, pharmaceutical, etc.) to control, monitor and execute  operations related to physical processes. ICS/SCADA systems are prone to malfunction when  methodologies and tools widely used in IT environments, are run on control networks. The potential  impact of this is significant since incorrect operation of these devices can negatively impact the  physical environment in which these systems operate.  In a similar manner, industrial automation standards and good practices have not followed  developments in cyber security. This has resulted in a vacuum that has increased the risk that many  industrial organisations face due to cyber threats.  In terms of political response to these challenges, in March 2013, Jose Manuel Barroso, the then  President of the European Commission, presented to the European Council a forecast about digital  jobs where he stated that Europe faces up to 900,000 unfilled ICT jobs6. In September 2014, the Senate  of the United States passed a cyber security skills shortage bill7 granting the Department of Homeland  Security8 (DHS) the authority to hire qualified experts paying salaries and incentives able to compete  with the private sector.  This chronic shortage of digital skills affects all ICT sectors, but it is especially noted in the cyber  security for industrial control systems area. One way to tackle this problem would be to make available  1  Stuxnet was a malware that in 2010 attacked industrial programable logic controllers, specifically those  involved in the uranium enrichment process.  2 Havex is a remote Access Trojan that targets industrial control systems from different vendors. https://ics- cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-176-02A  3  Report focused on a cyber espionage campaign apparently sponsored by the Chinese government.  http://intelreport.mandiant.com/  4 http://www.mandiant.com/  5 http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/l33260_en.htm  6 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-182_en.htm  7http://www.govinfosecurity.com/senate-passes-cybersecurity-skills-shortage-bill-a- 7340?utm_content=buffer5faec&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer  8 http://www.dhs.gov/  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  2  certification schemes for cyber security of ICS/SCADA professionals. This would allow professionals  with a background on cyber security or industrial automation or any other related area, to gain  knowledge and develop their skills on cyber security for ICS/SCADA. Proper certification schemes on  this topic would generate a pool of skilled professionals, available in the market. This would provide  to the European industry a suitable workforce able to deal with the cyber threats effecting industrial  control systems.  1.1 Objectives and scope  The objectives of this report are to:   Analyse current certification schemes and their validity for ICS/SCADA systems for European  Members.   Assess, through an on-line survey and interviews, the need among Member States and the  relevant private sector for a voluntary or mandatory scheme for the Certification of Cyber  Security Skills of ICS/SCADA experts.   Identify the main challenges to be covered by Member States and private sector actors involved  in developing Certification of Cyber Security Skills of ICS/SCADA expert’s schemes.   Make the necessary recommendations, that cover all the challenges presented, that will allow  Member States to develop new and harmonized certification schemes for Cyber Security Skills  of ICS/SCADA experts.  This report provides a good practice guide and a set of recommendations to develop ICS/SCADA cyber  security certification schemes applicable in the European Union.  1.2 Policy context  According to Article 2(3) of the ENISA regulation9, the Agency shall assist the European Commission  and EU Member States, and in consequence cooperate with the business community, in order to help  them meet the requirements of network and information security, thereby ensuring the smooth  functioning of the Internal Market. As described in the ENISA regulation, one of the objectives of the  Agency is to assist the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in developing policies in network  and information security, so, including building expertise related to availability, authenticity, integrity  and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data and the related services offered by or accessible via  those networks and systems. For instance, the new ENISA regulation mentions the necessity to analyse  current and emerging risks (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member  States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In  particular, under Article 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulation states that ENISA should enable  effective responses to information security risks and threats.  9  REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL :  http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  3  In its 2014 Work Programme (WP2014)10, ENISA included the activity related to Certification of Cyber  Security Skills of ICS/SCADA experts. Details about this action are laid out in Work Package (WPK) 2.2.  1.3 Target audience  The target audience for this report includes professionals and organisations who desire to get involved  in the development of certification schemes of cyber security skills for ICS/SCADA professionals;  owners of current certification schemes that could be adapted to include ICS/SCADA cyber security  topics; and both public and private bodies and authorities concerned about creating a workforce able  to provide the market capabilities to deal with cyber threats over industrial and automation control  systems.  1.4 Methodology  To develop this report, the following methodology was followed:  1) Analysis of current initiatives: The first phase that led to the current report was the  identification and analysis of related initiatives.  2) The experts’ and stakeholders’ point of view through an online questionnaire: the second  phase was to obtain experts and stakeholders’ opinion. The following figure summarises the  flow used for information gathering:  3) A list of experts from various countries and environments: emphasis was placed on wide  representation from the EU Member States, of which 108 experts from ICS/SCADA  organisations were enlisted. From the group of experts, 84 completed the online  questionnaire.  4) Interviews: the following figure summarises the methodology used to gather experts’ point  of view:  A panel of 27 experts on ICS/SCADA Cyber Security were interviewed. The interview questions  can be found in Annex B  5) The fourth step was to analyse the results of the on line survey and of the interviews and  identify the professional roles needed in ICS/SCADA Cyber security and the knowledge areas  for each role.  6) Finally, a set of challenges were identified and described, and a set of recommendations have  been proposed to solve the identified challenges for the development of cyber security  certification schemes for ICS/SCADA professionals in Europe.  10  ENISA – Work Programme 2014 : https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014  Shortlist of experts Preparation Questionnaire  design Evaluation  and analysis Conclusions  Request emails to  the experts  Interview  design  Shortlist of  experts  Setting the  agenda for  the  interviews  Evaluation  and analysis Conclusions  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  4  1.5 Report Structure  The report is structured as follows:   Chapter 1, “Introduction”   Chapter 2, “Existing certification schemes”, provides a description of three certification  schemes specific to ICS/SCADA systems, of the other four relevant certification schemes for  this study and finally, three safety certifications.

It is supported by a well- known professional association, the International Society of Automation (ISA), which adds to its  Cybersecurity  Red: Supported by Government  Black: Supported by professional associations  NIS  Driving License  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  7  strength and credibility. One of its main features is that standards and documents released by ISA are  developed by professionals.  This certification program is a work in progress on cyber security fundamentals targeted towards ICS  professionals who wish to enter the field of cyber security. Dealing with topics coming from two very  different fields such as cyber security and ICS/SCADA is challenging. Related contents may allow the  entrance of professionals coming from both disciplines. This implies having basic knowledge of both  domains.  ISA 99 scope is limited to the ISA 99 standards; as such it lacks comprehensive coverage of the  ICS/SCADA security landscape.  2.1.2 GIAC19 Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional (GICSP)  GICSP is part of the GIAC family and it is supported by SANS. It is a global certification that brings  together IT, engineering and cyber security to achieve security for industrial control systems from  design through to retirement. GICSP is targeted at professionals, worldwide and across industries, who  engineer or support control systems and share responsibility for the security of these environments.  These professionals can come from different backgrounds, such as Engineering, Cyber Security or IT.  This certification has been developed by GIAC in cooperation with an industry consortium consisting  of ICS/SCADA security professionals from industry leaders. One of the key features of the GICSP is that  it possesses a steering committee that has guided its development process.  GICSP has been developed under the international standard ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 20 , designed to  harmonize the personnel certification process worldwide and create a more cost-effective global  standard for workers. ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024, officially entitled \"General Requirements for Bodies  Operating Certification Systems of Persons,\" plays a prominent role in facilitating global  standardization of the certification community, enhancing consistency, and protecting consumers.  2.1.3 Certified SCADA Security Architect (CSSA)  CSSA is a professional certification from the Information Assurance Certification Review Board, a non- profit organisation formed by information security professionals. CSSA is targeted towards network  administrators and their managers, as well as IT professionals and their managers.  CSSA contains the following domains:   SCADA security policy development   SCADA security standards and best practices   Access Control   SCADA protocol security issues   Securing field communications   User authentication and authorization   Detecting cyber-attacks on SCADA systems   Vulnerability assessment  The goal of CSSA is to guarantee that certified professionals possess adequate knowledge to properly  secure SCADA systems. It is designed to be relevant for power transmission, oil and gas and water  19 Global Information Assurance Certification is a certification body completely owned/supported by SANS.  20 http://www.iso.org/iso/news.htm?refid=Ref1625  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  8  treatment industries. The most appreciated features of this certification are related to the quality of  the training courses, its instructors, and especially to the practical work during the training.  2.2 Other relevant certification schemes  2.2.1 European Computer Driving License (ECDL) / International Computer Driving License (ICDL)  / NIS Driving License  The European Computer Driving License (ECDL) and International Computer Driving License (ICDL) are  international standards in digital skills certifications. They are part of an initiative and a set of  certifications programmes targeted towards the public in general (i.e., individuals, employers,  teachers, students).  Despite the ECDL/ICDL not being related to cyber security or ICS/SCADA, they are pan-European  efforts that contain valuable features.  These can be used as reference in the development of future  European certifications on cyber security for ICS/SCADA professionals.  ECDL is made up of a range of modules, providing a practical programme of up-to-date skills and  knowledge areas that are validated by a test for each module.  In an area with multidisciplinary knowledge requirements (such as IT, OT, cyber security, etc.) as  ICS/SCADA security, a modular approach like the one followed by this programme, seems to be  interesting and valuable.  The most appreciated feature of this certification programme is the broad support of key public bodies  and governments (such as the European Commission, Member States, UNESCO, etc.). This is a key for  the success (but not the only one) and should be a taken into account for any certification that aspires  to be widely adopted and required in the industry.  The EU Cyber Security Strategy “An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace”21 proposes the development  of a roadmap for a \"Network and Information Security driving licence\" (NIS Driving License) as a  voluntary certification programme to promote enhanced skills and the competence of professionals.  There is a current effort22, led by ENISA, that has taken its first steps towards producing a roadmap  through a consultation process to involve the relevant stakeholders identify gaps between available  training, certifications and NIS education needs and propose scenarios to narrow the gaps and provide  best practices to organisations from all Member States.  The NIS Driving License develops different scenarios where are described their main features, target  audience, involved stakeholders, and are proposed incentives, objectives and means to achieve them.  The current described scenarios are:   Health care   Data Protection officers   Small and Medium Enterprises   Continuing education for teachers   Digital forensics  21 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  22  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education- programmes-in-europe  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  9  2.2.2 National Cyber Security Workforce Framework  The National Cyber Security Workforce Framework, as published by the United States National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is seen in the U.S., as a national resource that  categorizes, organizes and describes cyber security work. It has been developed by the National  Initiative for Cyber Security Education23 (NICE) in order to provide educators, students, employers,  employees, training providers and policy makers with a systematic way to approach cyber security  work, and describe what is required of the cyber security workforce. This framework is a thorough  approach to describe cyber security workforce related initiatives. It is backed by the United States  Government and it is being followed by different federal agencies as such it is becoming a de-facto  standard. It is not a certification scheme, but a comprehensive definition of cyber security workforce  related contents that should be taken into account in any certification scheme development in order  to guarantee a proper definition and scope of contents.  2.2.3 Certified Automation Professional (CAP)  The Certified Automation Professional (CAP) serves as a third party endorsement and documentation  of the skills and knowledge for professionals of the automation industry worldwide. CAP is targeted  at people working in automation at the professional level, technical supervisors, technical sales  personnel as well as automation educators. It does not include cyber security topics. CAP is backed by  the International Society of Automation, which makes it to be the most reputable certifications in the  industrial automation world. The CAP Certification is widely used by companies to evaluate hiring  candidates and making contracting decisions. CAP provides very comprehensive and detailed contents  about automation, including security and safety topics; nevertheless cyber security is just slightly  addressed in domain IV related to software development, and just from a very general point of view  without detailing the specifics of cyber security in Industrial Control Systems.  2.2.4 Industrial Security Professional Certification (NCMS-ISP)  The Industrial Security Professional (ISP) Certification is provided by The Society of Industrial Security  Professionals (NCMS). The intent of the ISP designation is to award professional certification and  recognition to qualified candidates who demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities their  profession demands. It is targeted at qualified candidates who work within the U.S. National Industrial  Security Program.  ISP has a strong focus on physical security. Information Security is part of the certification, but  ICS/SCADA Security is not.  2.3 Safety Certifications  Traditionally, in the industrial world, most of the effort and resources invested in security were related  to safety. Today, due to convergence between operations technology and information technology,  cyber security is achieving an importance equal to that of safety among industrial companies and also  forced failure of systems via cyber-attacks may have a safety impact. The industrial security market  has a number of initiatives related to the training and certification of safety professionals.  The main features of safety certifications are:   Complexity:  o Different disciplines such as safety, health, environment protection are involved.  23 http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  10  o Different environments: emergency management, engineering, ergonomics, fire  protection, risk management, occupational safety, etc.   Multiple levels of certification: allowing safety professionals to achieve professional  recognition regardless their education and giving priority to experience.  In this section two of the most relevant initiatives on this field are being outlined. Their features and  history could be used as reference in the development of cyber security certifications for ICS/SCADA  professionals.  2.3.1 The Board of Certified Safety Professionals  The Board of Certified Safety Professionals24 (BCSP) began in 1969 as a peer certification board whose  objectives are to:   Set standards for professional, technician, technologist, and supervisory level safety  practices.   Evaluate the academic and professional experience qualifications of certification  applicants.   Administer examinations.   Issue certificates to candidates who meet BCSP's certification qualifications and  successfully pass the examination(s).   Monitor continued professional development through mandatory recertification  requirements.  BCSP maintains multiple certifications and professional programs which amounts to more than 30000  certified individuals:   CSP: Certified Safety Professional   OHST: Occupational Health & Safety Technologist   CHST: Construction Health & Safety Technician   STS: Safety Trained Supervisor   CET: Certified Environmental Safety and Health Trainer   ASP: Associate Safety Professional   GSP: Graduate Safety Practitioner   BCSP certified professionals are from countries across the globe however most of them  come from the U.S.  2.3.2 The European Network of Safety and Health Professional Organisations  The European Network of Safety and Health Professional Organisations25 (ENSHPO) brings together  health and safety professional organisations from across Europe.  The main objectives of ENSHPO are:   To ensure participation from all of the professional organisations across Europe and  represent the views, opinions and concerns of this group.   To operate as a dialogue partner with relevant national and international authorities.   To co-operate with other organisations, institutions, and federations within Europe and  beyond.  24 http://www.bcsp.org/  25 http://www.enshpo.eu/home  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  11   To primarily act as a forum where practitioners can exchange information, experiences  and good practices on a wide variety of pertinent topics.   To develop a European-wide recognition of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH)  practitioner qualifications and training.  The member organisations of ENSHPO have agreed to create two standardised Europe-wide  certifications. They allow eligible health and safety practitioners to use the designation EurOSHM  (European Occupational Safety and Health Manager) and EurOSHT (European Occupational Safety and  Health Technician).  National professional organisations of European countries can present their own certification schemes  for standard verification. These schemes are reviewed by the ENSHPO Certification Committee (ECC)  for deciding what additional qualifications are necessary to obtain the EurOSHM or EurOSHT title.  2.3.3 Specific training on cyber security for ICS/SCADA  Currently, there is not a wide offer of training specialized in cyber security for ICS/SCADA in the  market.

No  Table 2 – Training and certification needs for ICS Cyber Security professionals (ERNCIP)37  Within this group the workforce has been divided roughly into two subgroups:  1. The general workforce that interacts with and maintains these systems. This group can  target general awareness campaigns explaining risks; it also provides simple do’s and  don’ts.   Examples are operators in plants, vendors and integrators of systems, developers of  ICS systems.  2. ICS/SCADA Cyber Security professionals that have specific accountability or responsibility  for ICS/SCADA Cyber Security. This is the group that needs to be trained (and if needed)  certified. This group can be divided in groups as well:   Management roles:  o ICS/SCADA Security Manager (e.g., responsible person for central team of  specialists/Centre of Excellence).  o Manager in the business with accountability for ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  (often line manager, such as engineering manager, plant manager, OT  manager, IT Manager, maintenance manager, Integrator of IT and OT  environments).  o Management of process control systems and associated maintenance  responsible control system engineers.   Technical roles:  o ICS/SCADA focal points in the business  o ICS/SCADA Security Operations Centre personnel  o ICS/SCADA (Forensic) Analysts  o ICS/SCADA Incident Response professionals  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Architects  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Analyst  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security R&D personnel  o Cyber Security professionals in ICS Development organisations  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security testers  37 Created by the ERNCIP Thematic Group Industrial Automated Control Systems and Smart Grids, work stream  Workforce Development Framework  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  15  3.2 Knowledge areas for ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Professionals  The most important knowledge areas for professionals have been identified taking into account the  existing ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification schemes and other relevant studies. The following  uses as reference the work done under the ERNCIP Thematic Group on IACS and Smart Grids.  One of  its subgroups has focused on defining the competences, qualifications and experience, needed by ICS  Cyber Security Professionals. The result is a high level overview of the knowledge areas that need to  be developed (Figure 2):  Figure 2 – Knowledge areas38  This ERNCIP work has been adopted by the industry consortium developing the list of certification  objectives and outcome statements that has been used by GIAC to develop the GICSP certification.

This list embeds all the knowledge areas that were named in the interviews and the survey for this  research (see previous chapter). These knowledge areas are the foundation for all the technical  ICS/SCADA cyber security roles.  All roles with accountability or responsibility of ICS/SCADA cyber security would need the basic  competence across these knowledge areas. Where more specialist roles are defined, for example  ICS/SCADA forensic analyst, ICS/SCADA Incident Response professional, more detailed knowledge,  skills and abilities on that specific topic will be needed.

In this section are presented the most relevant results that allow the further identification of  challenges and recommendations for the development of certifications for ICS/SCADA cybersecurity  professionals.  Intention towards certification  ICS/SCADA cyber security is important to safeguard the Critical Infrastructures in Europe. It is  important to have professionals trained and certified to implement and maintain the right level of  ICS/SCADA cyber security controls.  As presented in Figure 3, three quarters of the respondents to the survey are considering getting  certified, to prove their cyber security ICS/SCADA knowledge, but just one third have already obtained  or are in process of obtaining a cyber security ICS/SCADA related certificate.  Figure 3 – Survey Results. Intention regarding certification  75,9%  24,1%  Are you considering to get certified to prove your  cyber security ICS/SCADA knowledge?

Yes  No  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  20  Approach to building cyber security certification schemes  When asked about the approach to building an ICS/SCADA cyber security certification scheme, most  of the professionals consider that new certifications should combine baseline knowledge with  specialised certifications focused on different knowledge areas (Figure 4).  Figure 4 – Survey Results. Approach to build certification schemes  The research has shown that for certain positions it would add value to certify these professionals.  There are already a few certifications available in the market, but they are still on a foundational level  and there is not yet a complete certification scheme that covers both, the certification of skills and  abilities in cyber security for ICS/SCADA professionals. As the community of organisations using  ICS/SCADA systems shows a demand for further development of these kinds of certifications, it seems  that it is the moment to define a framework to allow the development of ICS/SCADA cyber security  certifications that meets or exceeds the needs of all the stakeholders and considers different  perspectives in a coherent manner.  Nature of cyber security certification schemes for ICS/SCADA  The research conducted shows that there are open discussions about the nature that cyber security  for ICS/SCADA certifications schemes should have. For instance, 51% think that they should be sector  specific while 49% think that they should be generic (Figure 5). Also, 85,2% of professionals do not  know any position where an ICS/SCADA certification is mandatory.  25,6%  11,6%62,8%  What is the best approach to build a ICS/SCADA  cyber security certification scheme?  Develop a baseline knowledge certification that covers the basics about cyber security, ICS/SCADA, automation, etc.  Develop several specialized certifications focused on different knowledge areas.  Develop a combined certification schema/framework that includes both of the options mentioned above.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  21  Figure 5 – Survey Results. Generic vs. Specific certifications  Most of the professionals believe that having a panel of recognised experts involved in the creation of  the certifications would be very valuable, as presented in Figure 6.  Figure 6 – Survey Results. Involvement of experts  An impartial review/assessment of existing and future certifications could help reach a consensus on  these topics.  This should be made through a committee able to validate the quality, impact and applicability of the  certification and to ensure that these ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification schemes will be  supported by the European Commission, EU member states governments, industry bodies, critical  infrastructures and all their stakeholders, such as asset owners, suppliers, vendors, integrators,  51,2%  48,8%  Do you think that cyber security certifications for  ICS/SCADA should be sector specific (energy, water,  oil & gas, etc)?  Yes  No  72,1%  25,6%  2,3%  When creating the curricula and contents of the  certification, how do you value having a panel of  recognized experts working on it?

Such a committee should be credible for the community of experts and  professionals in order to earn recognition and support.  Knowledge about existing certifications of ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals  More than 55% of professionals are aware of existing certification schemes, as presented in Figure 7.  Besides this, as stated in Section 2, there exist good certification schemes that could prove useful  foundation for the development of new certifications.  Figure 7 – Survey Results. Knowledge of certification of ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals  There is a small number of ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certifications available in the market that focus  on the foundational knowledge of professionals. The experts interviewed suggested there is a need to  build comprehensive European certification schemes on the ICS/SCADA cyber security topic based on  existing certifications.  Certification credibility factors  Figure 8 presents the results to the question “What makes a certification credible?”. From the total  number, 76,7% of professionals think that practical training makes a certification credible and more  valuable.  55,6%  44,4%  Do you know any scheme for the Certification of  ICS/SCADA Cyber Security experts?  Yes  No  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  23  Figure 8 – Survey Results. What makes a certification credible?  Until now, the most relevant certifications available in the ICS/SCADA cyber security community  focused on testing the foundational knowledge of professionals, but do not include the testing of  practical skills. Given the nature of the operations executed by industrial control systems, it is of  importance to include the development and test of practical knowledge skills in future certification  schemes.  Practical experience as an integral part of certifications  From the total number presented on Figure 9, 72,1% of professionals think that to demonstrate  knowledge and applied principles, the certification should include the demonstration of practical  experience.

From this point of view, the  idea of promoting simulation environments seems good and will probably be supported by the  promotion of European Commission of serious gaming technologies.  The nature of operations conducted on industrial control systems requires that the professionals in  charge possess practical experience. This is something difficult to achieve and demonstrate through  theoretical certifications, so, to include practical work is very important for future ICS/SCADA cyber  security certifications for professionals.  Inclusion of management topics in certification schemes  The majority of the interviewed experts recognize the necessity of including management levels in  certification schemes, the only opinions against this were related to different sets of priorities, but  were still considering it a necessity.  A target group in the ICS/SCADA Cyber Security domain are the people in management positions,  senior professionals who oversee activities in this area and need to ensure that in their environments  include the right controls in place to mitigate the risk to their organisation to an acceptable level. They  also need to be able to explain this to top management in their organisations.  Main features of ICS/SCADA cyber security certification schemes  For European certification schemes to work, it is important to develop content in ways in which such  schemes would work. Part of this should be to decide under which premises new certifications will be  developed:  o Do we want to create an entity (or select an entity) that develops specific certifications? Or,  o Do we create a certification framework in which organisations that use ICS/SCADA initiatives  can be assessed, validated, approved and supported by European agencies or public bodies?  This approach could be similar to the way the DODD 8570 framework is operated in the US.  In either case, to keep an adequate level of credibility, validating certifications should be exempt of  commercial interests.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  25  5 Challenges  The studies made during the development of this work as well as the interviews carried out and the  online survey results have identified some challenges and issues. This section lists the main challenges  that should be addressed when developing certification schemes for testing the skills of cyber security  ICS/SCADA professionals.  The challenges identified are supported in the answers made by experts in the online questionnaire  and during the interviews, and also in perceptions obtained in workshops and conversations with  experts combined with the experience of the main authors of this work.  5.1 Obtain stakeholder support  The support of professional associations and organisations is one of the key issues for the success of  any certification. The public highly values the involvement of well-known professionals and strong  organisations in the development and support of professional certifications. However, 44,3% of  professionals involved have not heard about ICS/SCADA certifications.  Raising the relevance, credibility and strength of future certifications related to the cyber security skills  of ICS/SCADA professionals will require to engage well-known and respected professionals from the  fields of cyber security and industrial operations technology.  Also, obtaining a consensus about contents and target audience will be an important issue since  currently there are ongoing major discussions involving important topics such as whether certification  must be sector oriented or not.  5.2 Avoid commercial interests  Stakeholders involved in the analysis process expressed their concern that some existing certifications  have strong commercial interests, since selling certifications is part of the business model of many  certification bodies. This in itself is not a problem, since this budget is also needed to keep the content  of the certification up-to-date and provide professional certification environments. It does imply,  however, the necessity of an objective validation of the quality of the certification by an impartial  body. This would allow checks of the quality of the certifications according to an objective checklist  and criteria.  5.3 Manage the confluence ICS/Cyber Security  The contents of certifications on cyber security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals are related to two  very different worlds: cyber security and operations technology in industrial environments. The results  of the questionnaire and interviews reflect that, besides IT and cyber security contents, all the  professionals surveyed would include specific OT knowledge. This would be a challenge since it implies  the development and integration of contents coming from very different subjects.  5.4 Cross sector contents  ICS and SCADA systems are used in a number of different industrial sectors. Despite the fact that the  underlying technology is common among sectors, and these face similar technical problems,  operational processes are different, so addressing the different requirements and necessities of every  sector may be difficult.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  26  5.5 Cover the different positions involved in cyber security for ICS/SCADA  The development of contents for future certification schemes should take into account different  professional profiles from the functional point of view ( e.g., operators, engineers, IT technicians, cyber  security personnel, physical security personnel, …) but also from a broader point of view ( e.g.,  managers, section chiefs, field workers, …). This would add complexity to the contents of future  certifications since they will have to deal with many different points of view.  5.6 Obtain a critical mass of certificates  As the number of certified professionals increases, a certification scheme becomes more  representative in the community. Also the involvement of well-known professionals in the creation of  certifications is important because they would serve as role models for their peers.  The more focused a certification scheme is the number of wide range professionals interested in the  scheme decreases. Broader differentiation into sub-tier certification levels may be a successful  approach. With ICS/SCADA Cyber Security being a growing area of expertise worldwide, this is needed,  since it adds value to professionals and the industry.  5.7 Avoid the appearance of too many similar certifications  Industrial cyber security is a topic that will gain prominence  in the market place in the coming years,  so it is foreseeable that this will be accompanied by a growing a broader interest by IT, OT and  operational professionals and therefore a number of organisations will find it appropriate and suitable  to support the development of certifications.  A wide number of certifications will scatter possible professionals among all of them. This will  complicate the development of relevant certifications that will serve as a reference for the ICS/SCADA  cyber security market. This is something that is currently happening with IT or cyber security related  certifications, where different organisations, vendors and public bodies propose their own  certifications making difficult for any of these to differentiate from the others.  5.8 Adapt existing certifications to include ICS/SCADA cyber security topics  Most of the existing cyber security certifications do not include topics related to ICS/SCADA;  additionally industrial certifications do not include cyber security in their curriculum. The adaptation  of these certifications to include topics specific to ICS/SCADA cyber security, will boost the general  knowledge among the community of professionals and therefore will increase the cyber security of  industrial facilities. However, the developers of existing certifications will not be willing to adapt their  contents unless there exists a proper pressure from the market.  However, aligning and trying to improve and add content to existing certifications can be a lengthy  process. Also working together with other initiatives around the world will take a considerable effort  and considerable amounts of communication and meetings to reach alignment.  5.9 Inclusion of practical aspects  Due to the nature of operations made over industrial control systems, future certification schemes  should include practical knowledge in the form of hands-on laboratories, simulations or other practical  testing methods.  However, it is possible that practical assignments do not reflect thoroughly the daily practice. It is  difficult to test all practical skills and abilities for all possible roles, especially in a simulation  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  27  environment. This might be the reason to develop a whole set of certifications (with different topics  and objectives) focusing on practical skills and abilities for different target groups (e.g., Incident  Handling in ICS environments, Ethical hacking in ICS environments, Forensics in ICS environments,  etc.).  The development of valid simulators can be a costly effort. This will only be feasible if the simulation  environment can also be used for other purposes like component testing, exercises and training.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  28  6 Recommendations for an European certification scheme on ICS/SCADA  cyber security  This section presents a series of recommendations aimed to address the identified challenges for the  development of cyber security certification schemes for ICS/SCADA professionals In Europe. The  recommendations are extracted from the data provided by experts through interviews and the online  survey.  The recommendations are related to each other and are considered equally important.  Recommendation 1 presents the framework under which the subsequent recommendations should  be included and interpreted. The remaining recommendations should be coherent between them and  with the common reference of Recommendation 1.  The detailed descriptions of the recommendations contain the following sections:   Description: where the core content of the recommendation is presented. It can be  considered as the “what” and the “how” parts of the recommendation. What should be its  architecture, how to design and manage it.   Challenges addressed: set of challenges that are addressed by the current recommendation.   Good practices: suggestions to successfully implement the recommendation.  In Recommendation 1 the following sections can be found:   Objectives: what the recommendation aims to address.   Steps: next actions to be executed to achieve the recommendation.   Stakeholders affected: It provides information concerning the stakeholders for whom each  the tasks of the recommendations is specially addressed. ‘Leading’ entities are intended to  take initiative and decisions, ‘cooperating’ ones would have to develop specific tasks  including actions or documentation delivery, ‘consulting’ stakeholders would only be  considered for informational aspects.  Recommendation 1: Create an overarching ICS/SCADA cyber security certification scheme for  ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals.  Description:  The European Union should promote, fund and support the development of an ICS/SCADA Cyber  Security Certification Scheme for the European ICS/SCADA Cyber Security community. This will make  it possible to validate and assess current and future certifications in this domain. These certification  schemes will also stimulate the market to develop relevant new certifications.  Challenges addressed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  Objective:  The good practices and recommendations described in this document have to serve as a reference for  the development of such a comprehensive ICS/SCADA cyber security scheme as well for the  development of new certifications. It should meet the demand of the ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  community. The following points should be considered when building such comprehensive ICS/SCADA  Cyber Security Certification scheme:   Data gathered through the survey and from the interviewed experts suggest that new  ICS/SCADA cyber security certifications should be multi-level as this will allow the certification  to reach a broader range of professionals (from entry-level to expert) as well as different fields  of application. In this way, a multi-level scheme could reflect the difference skill-set that are  needed for professionals (e.g., management vs. specialist or generalist vs specialist). Being  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  29  able to place certifications on multiple levels allows the inclusion of a wider range of people,  including entry level and experienced professionals. An example of these levels could be:  o Foundational level: Where all the basics of ICS/SCADA security are introduced to the  students, requiring them to pass a (theoretical) exam that tests the (applied)  knowledge of the candidates. This is the entry level. Only professionals that already  have some relevant experience should be able to pass this exam. Professionals on the  Knowledge level are able to interpret and evaluate information and advice from  experts in an area of expertise. They can operate with help of more senior  professionals.  o Advanced level: The certifications on this level should contain assignments to test the  practical skills of the candidates. This would be interesting for people with either 5-8  years of relevant experience and with the Knowledge level certification passed. The  candidates will have to pass a theory and practical exam, with practical assignments  in a simulator environment. Professionals on this skill level are able to consistently  carry out ICS/SCADA Cyber Security activities.  o Master’s level: This level is for experienced professionals on ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  in specific roles. They will need more than ten years of relevant experience and will  need to have passed the skill level. At this level sector specifications might be  considered as well. A theory and practical exam should be passed with corresponding  practical exercises performed in the simulation environment. People on a mastery  level are thought leaders who are able to diagnose and resolve significant, unusual  problems and to successfully adapt all ICS/SCADA cyber security aspects.  o Management level: focused on the skills of managers in this domain.  The main  objective will be to explain the impact of low security and how a good cyber security  strategy supports the general strategy of a corporation.  This separation in levels can also enable the introduction of topics specific to certain industrial sectors,  and will reflect the experience, skills and abilities of ICS/SCADA Cyber Security professionals and will  offer the possibility to distinguish between professionals.  Steps:   At the EU level, create, fund and support an initiative to set-up a project to develop this  certification scheme, the assessment criteria as well as the set-up of the independent  committee (see next recommendation) that will operate the certification scheme.   Invite the most relevant stakeholders, both public and private, to take part in this effort.  Include appropriate knowledgeable representatives from outside the EU.   After building the certification scheme and the assessment criteria, assess existing  foundational ICS/SCADA Cyber Security certifications to see if they meet the criteria and  actively stimulate the market to fill in the gaps in the scheme. Do not limit the scheme to  European certification initiatives, but also include international certifications in the  framework.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: cooperating   Academia and R&D: leading   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  30  Recommendation 2: Create an independent committee that assesses (and endorses) current and  future certifications.  Description:  It is recommended to create an independent committee that develops evaluation criteria, reviews and  assesses current and future certifications and endorses them when they meet the established criteria.  This will give the applicable weight and will maximize the adoption of the certifications by private and  public organisations as well as motivate professionals to obtain these certifications. It should be note  that, achieving a critical mass of certificates will be a key issue to the success of future certifications.  To achieve this, it will be necessary to identify renowned stakeholders from the industrial cyber  security arena including asset owners, suppliers, vendors, technical educators, integrators,  government and regulators. People from these stakeholder communities can apply for participation  in this independent committee and will be vetted.  Part of the work of this independent committee, in close cooperation with ENISA, could aim at  stimulating the market to develop relevant certifications for ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals  and to provide guidance on how to develop new uniform certification scheme at EU level.  Having a sound validation process in place will also prevent the proliferation of multiple certifications  related to cyber security of ICS/SCADA as this could disperse the efforts made and scatter potential  certified professionals among them.  Challenges addressed: 1, 2, 6, 7  Good Practices:   Create an independent committee with vetted experts (from industry but also with  certification development and accreditation as expertise) that will assess and (potentially)  endorse ICS/SCADA Cyber Security certifications for professional skills.   Develop assessment criteria for the assessment of ICS/SCADA cyber security certifications.   Establish a straight-forward process of cooperation for the committee, with regular  meetings and defined short, medium and long-term objectives.   To involve relevant stakeholders in order improve the credibility of the committee.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: consulting   Academia and R&D: cooperating   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: cooperating  Recommendation 3: Take into account existing global certifications.  Description:  Use existing ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certifications as a basis to build European ICS/SCADA Cyber  Security certification schemes. This implies working closely together with the providers of existing  certifications to ensure that they also cover European specific regulations and legislation.  By adapting existing relevant ICS/SCADA cyber security initiatives to the development of European  certification schemes, the effort is likely to gain the support of the global community and multinational  organisations. This will also facilitate the creation of a critical mass of certified professionals who will  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  31  find it easy to achieve the new certifications if parts of them are based in previous knowledge and  experience.  The project groups, leading the effort to build certification schemes, should take an active approach  in validating these certifications and work on improving them hand-in-hand with the provider  organisations. Also, it will be important to work together with similar initiatives outside Europe to  ensure global alignment.  Of course these existing schemes will need to be assessed as soon as the overarching ICS/SCADA cyber  security certification scheme is released.  Challenges addressed: 6, 8  Good practices:   Use comprehensive schemes such as the National Cyber Security Workforce Framework as a  basis to define the contents of future certifications.   Take into account the most relevant initiatives and certifications identified and analysed in  Annex A: Detailed Analysis of initiatives to be included in future European certification  schemes.   Evaluate the content of these certifications on their alignment with European legislation and  regulations.   Work together with the providers of these certifications to add relevant European legislation  and regulation to the certification objectives and outcome statements of these certifications.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: consulting   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 4: Include practical assignments in new certifications.  Description:  The recommendation promotes the inclusion to future certification schemes of several hands-on  sessions to test the practical skills of the students. This will be needed to go a step further than  testing candidates on the theoretical knowledge level, since knowing how to act against risk and  vulnerabilities in ICS/SCADA environments cannot be learned by just studying books.  Future certifications shall include mandatory practical work, where besides taking a theory exam,  students would have to complete and pass some practical assignments in a simulation environment.  The objective is to create comprehensive schemes in which certifications are being developed  containing practical assignments. The students will need to apply all their theoretical knowledge for  ensuring that certified professionals have the right level of skills and abilities to meet real risk  situations. This test will assure that they have at least some experience with practical successes where  they were able to manage the situation and act to solve the problems.

Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: cooperating   Manufacturers and integrators: cooperating   ICS Security tools and services providers: cooperating   Operators: cooperating   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 5: Create a simulation environment to test practical skills and abilities.  Description:  For new ICS/SCADA cyber security certifications to contain practical assignments, it is necessary to  develop simulation environments to test the students. The same environments could also be used for  training purposes.  These environments should be realistic simulations that can be used for the practical part of the  certifications where students can develop and demonstrate their practical skills and abilities in, e.g.,  simulated cyber-attacks.  The environments might be either physical places with physically simulated industrial environments  or virtual industrial environments.  Challenges addressed: 9  Good practices:   The creation of an inventory of such simulation environments available in the European and  global market.   Define the use cases for these simulation environments.   Align with the European Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) and critical sectors to  keep the threat catalogue of the simulation environment up-to-date.   Work towards the creation of test beds, simulation environments and laboratories that allow  students to develop and test their practical skills.   To promote new technologies needed to develop the simulators.   To promote business models to make viable simulators as a business.   To promote collaboration between the industrial infrastructures and the potential developers  of the simulator.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: cooperating   ICS Security tools and services providers: leading   Operators: consulting  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  33   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 6: Include Management Certification in the Certification schemes  Description:  As in existing certification schemes such as ‘regular’ IT Security, a specific management related content  would add value. The focus would be more on topics like business impact, regulations, ICS/SCADA Risk  Management and Incident Management.  This will ensure that managers of ICS/SCADA Cyber Security organisations or departments are qualified  to give clear guidance to the top management of their organisations and to make the right decisions  in crisis situations.  Challenges addressed: 5  Good practices:   Include managerial topics in the contents developed for future certifications.   Take into account methodologies focused on understanding how ICS/SCADA cyber security  supports the strategy and results of the organisation.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: consulting   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 7: Define main features and contents of European ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  Certification Schemes  Description:  There are multiple ways of implementing an ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification Scheme. It is  important to make a choice in the approach to take.  For every certification that will be part of the certification scheme it is important to clearly state:   Define base level of expertise before entering the framework.   Recommendations about how skills are maintained (Continuing Professional Development  (CPD) or forced refreshers)   What the certification objectives and the outcome statements are.   How the weighting of these items is in the exam.   The way the exam is taken (questions / use cases / proctored or not).   Policies for retaking exams, extensions, recertifying process, etc.  A key issue will be to keep an adequate balance between the cyber security and ICS/SCADA related  contents. This will make the certification suitable for professionals coming from both the IT and OT  domains.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  34  To make it practical the creation of an ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification Framework that  provides organisations the opportunity to develop certifications that will be validated and approved  by an appointed organisation on the European level, e.g., ENISA is proposed.  Certifications should be developed under strict guidance before being approved and integrated in the  European certification framework. Next to the approval of the assigned entity, the certifications  should also have ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation. This international standard (ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024)  was designed to harmonize the personnel certification process worldwide and create a more cost- effective global standard for workers. ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024, officially entitled \"General Requirements  for Bodies Operating Certification Systems of Persons,\" plays a prominent role in facilitating global  standardization of the certification community, enhancing consistency, and protecting consumers.  Challenges addressed: 2, 3  Good practices:   First step towards the creation of new certification schemes will be the development of an  ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Framework with all the following elements:  o Framework.  o Certification process.  o Appoint entity guiding the process.   Include balanced contents of cyber security and operations technology on ICS/SCADA  systems.   Setting this up should go hand-in-hand with creation of the workgroup that has to stimulate  development of new certifications.

However it is also noticeable  that most of the experts have not heard about many existing certification schemes. This is a trending  issue which is starting to gain importance.  The field of cyber security for ICS/SCADA is complex due to its main features:   The involvement of different disciplines such as cyber security, operations technology and  information technology, which implies dealing with different objectives and bodies of  knowledge.  This also implies dealing with different cultures and attitudes towards security in  both the IT and OT domains.   The broad range of sectors that use industrial control systems (automation, energy, chemical,  pharmaceutics, energy, etc.). Despite all of them use similar physical systems, there are  important differences in their processes and operational procedures as well as health, safety  and environmental consequences due to a failure of a system or component.   Current certifications focused on related to ICS/SCADA cyber security have a theoretical  approach; nevertheless, practical aspects should be included in future certification schemes.  For any initiative to succeed in this complex field, guidance and expertise are needed. It is highly  advisable to create a steering committee in charge of assessing future certifications and providing  guidance in its development.  ICS/SCADA cyber security is a growing trend that during the upcoming years will have an important  presence in the market with many commercial and industrial opportunities. This has the following  implications:   Development and exploitation of certification schemes can be a profitable business, but by no  means the main objective of the certifications should be forgotten: improving the skills of  professionals on ICS/SCADA cyber security. Everything else is secondary.   One of the key factors for the success of any certification is the number of certified  professionals. The bigger the amount, the more relevance the certification will obtain. Despite  the foreseeable growth of the subject of ICS/SCADA cyber security is a very specialised  discipline with a relatively low number of professionals involved. This could make it difficult  to obtain a critical mass of certificates.

One of the most transcendental adaptations the industrial world is currently  experiencing is the convergence between Operations Technology (OT), the operations needed to carry  out the industrial processes, and Information Technology (IT), the use of computers to manage data  needed by the organisation’s enterprise processes. This convergence has many advantages  (optimisation of operations, better use of resources, cost savings, etc.), but it also raises additional  issues, such as the need for cyber security of industrial control systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control  and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.  This convergence, which affects hundreds of thousands of systems worldwide, implies that  professionals with knowledge of cyber security for ICS/SCADA will be needed. However, currently,  there are very few professionals with the proven skills available to do this work.  This document explores how current initiatives on certification of professional skills are related to the  topic of ICS/SCADA cyber security. It also identifies the challenges and proposes a series of  recommendations towards the development of certification schemes for ICS/SCADA cyber security  professionals.  Challenges identified in relation to operational issues of certifications included the following:   The need to handle the confluence of contents, objectives and needs of two very different  topics such as cyber security and industrial automation within a number of different industrial  sectors (energy, oil & gas, automated manufacturing, water treatment, chemical,  pharmaceutical, etc.)   The complexity of including topics and content relevant to different roles and profiles. In the  field of cyber security for ICS/SCADA systems there are implications ranging from the lower  operative levels to the top management.   The challenge to include an important practical component, in future certification contents,  able to take into account the nature of the operations performed over industrial control  systems. This can be a complicated issue since the operations where ICS are involved, usually  need to be executed continuously making it difficult to put them in practice on production  systems.  Challenges related to the societal aspects include the following:   Avoiding commercial interests that could impair the credibility of certifications.   Obtaining stakeholders’ support to underscore the relevance, credibility and strength of  future certifications.   Ensuring that the future certifications will improve compared with existing ones in regards the  level of knowledge related to cyber security for ICS/SCADA.   Exploring the professional roles and specific knowledge needed by cyber security  professionals for ICS/SCADA.  Pursuant to interviews with experts worldwide and the analysis of the results of an online survey, this  report proposes a series of recommendations for the development of cyber security certifications for  ICS/SCADA professionals.  This report concludes that the development of an overarching certification scheme is of paramount  importance to allow European professionals to achieve the degree of measured knowledge needed to  deal with the cyber security issues in ICS/SCADA systems. This would create a suitable workforce for  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  vi  European industrial organisations to face the cyber security challenges related to these systems.  Certification should be multi-level to allow reaching a wide range of professionals from different fields  of practice ; it should include not only operational but managerial topics and it should contain practical  aspects, to guarantee that the knowledge of certified professionals is not only theoretical and can be  directly applied to industrial operations.  Other proposed recommendations, relevant for both the public and private sectors, with special focus  on the European Union institutions, are to:   Create a steering committee formed by independent experts in charge of evaluation of criteria  for reviewing and assessment of current and future certifications.   Take into account existing certifications to get support of the global community and obtain a  critical mass of certificates.   Develop simulation environments for practical training and testing of skills without effecting  production environments.   Create a framework which defines the main features and contents of future European  ICS/SCADA cyber security certification schemes.

Additionally they have matched the growing concern  of governments about cyber threats and attacks originating from rogue agents. This has made Critical  Infrastructure Protection, the preparedness and response to serious incidents involving critical  infrastructures of a nation, a priority for governments worldwide.  The European Union, through the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection5 (EPCIP)  has set the principles and instruments that EU member states need to implement in order to protect  their critical infrastructures.  Many of these critical infrastructures belong to industrial sectors that have a deeply rooted concept  of security. Industrial security has been mainly focused on physical security as well as in health and  environmental safety. Nowadays cyber security has become a new important component of industrial  security. This is a novelty for many industrial organizations that is causing different sets of problems  for them to achieve the required degree of cyber protection.  Traditionally, the cyber security literature has not taken into account the specific features and needs  of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.  These systems are widely used in industries from different sectors (energy, oil & gas, automated  manufacturing, water treatment, chemical, pharmaceutical, etc.) to control, monitor and execute  operations related to physical processes. ICS/SCADA systems are prone to malfunction when  methodologies and tools widely used in IT environments, are run on control networks. The potential  impact of this is significant since incorrect operation of these devices can negatively impact the  physical environment in which these systems operate.  In a similar manner, industrial automation standards and good practices have not followed  developments in cyber security. This has resulted in a vacuum that has increased the risk that many  industrial organisations face due to cyber threats.  In terms of political response to these challenges, in March 2013, Jose Manuel Barroso, the then  President of the European Commission, presented to the European Council a forecast about digital  jobs where he stated that Europe faces up to 900,000 unfilled ICT jobs6. In September 2014, the Senate  of the United States passed a cyber security skills shortage bill7 granting the Department of Homeland  Security8 (DHS) the authority to hire qualified experts paying salaries and incentives able to compete  with the private sector.  This chronic shortage of digital skills affects all ICT sectors, but it is especially noted in the cyber  security for industrial control systems area. One way to tackle this problem would be to make available  1  Stuxnet was a malware that in 2010 attacked industrial programable logic controllers, specifically those  involved in the uranium enrichment process.  2 Havex is a remote Access Trojan that targets industrial control systems from different vendors. https://ics- cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-14-176-02A  3  Report focused on a cyber espionage campaign apparently sponsored by the Chinese government.  http://intelreport.mandiant.com/  4 http://www.mandiant.com/  5 http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/fight_against_terrorism/l33260_en.htm  6 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_SPEECH-13-182_en.htm  7http://www.govinfosecurity.com/senate-passes-cybersecurity-skills-shortage-bill-a- 7340?utm_content=buffer5faec&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer  8 http://www.dhs.gov/  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  2  certification schemes for cyber security of ICS/SCADA professionals. This would allow professionals  with a background on cyber security or industrial automation or any other related area, to gain  knowledge and develop their skills on cyber security for ICS/SCADA. Proper certification schemes on  this topic would generate a pool of skilled professionals, available in the market. This would provide  to the European industry a suitable workforce able to deal with the cyber threats effecting industrial  control systems.  1.1 Objectives and scope  The objectives of this report are to:   Analyse current certification schemes and their validity for ICS/SCADA systems for European  Members.   Assess, through an on-line survey and interviews, the need among Member States and the  relevant private sector for a voluntary or mandatory scheme for the Certification of Cyber  Security Skills of ICS/SCADA experts.   Identify the main challenges to be covered by Member States and private sector actors involved  in developing Certification of Cyber Security Skills of ICS/SCADA expert’s schemes.   Make the necessary recommendations, that cover all the challenges presented, that will allow  Member States to develop new and harmonized certification schemes for Cyber Security Skills  of ICS/SCADA experts.  This report provides a good practice guide and a set of recommendations to develop ICS/SCADA cyber  security certification schemes applicable in the European Union.  1.2 Policy context  According to Article 2(3) of the ENISA regulation9, the Agency shall assist the European Commission  and EU Member States, and in consequence cooperate with the business community, in order to help  them meet the requirements of network and information security, thereby ensuring the smooth  functioning of the Internal Market. As described in the ENISA regulation, one of the objectives of the  Agency is to assist the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in developing policies in network  and information security, so, including building expertise related to availability, authenticity, integrity  and confidentiality of stored or transmitted data and the related services offered by or accessible via  those networks and systems. For instance, the new ENISA regulation mentions the necessity to analyse  current and emerging risks (and their components), stating: “the Agency, in cooperation with Member  States and, as appropriate, with statistical bodies and others, collects relevant information”. In  particular, under Article 3, Tasks, d), iii), the new ENISA regulation states that ENISA should enable  effective responses to information security risks and threats.  9  REGULATION (EU) No 526/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL :  http://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal- content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:JOL_2013_165_R_0041_01&qid=1397226946093&from=EN  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  3  In its 2014 Work Programme (WP2014)10, ENISA included the activity related to Certification of Cyber  Security Skills of ICS/SCADA experts. Details about this action are laid out in Work Package (WPK) 2.2.  1.3 Target audience  The target audience for this report includes professionals and organisations who desire to get involved  in the development of certification schemes of cyber security skills for ICS/SCADA professionals;  owners of current certification schemes that could be adapted to include ICS/SCADA cyber security  topics; and both public and private bodies and authorities concerned about creating a workforce able  to provide the market capabilities to deal with cyber threats over industrial and automation control  systems.  1.4 Methodology  To develop this report, the following methodology was followed:  1) Analysis of current initiatives: The first phase that led to the current report was the  identification and analysis of related initiatives.  2) The experts’ and stakeholders’ point of view through an online questionnaire: the second  phase was to obtain experts and stakeholders’ opinion. The following figure summarises the  flow used for information gathering:  3) A list of experts from various countries and environments: emphasis was placed on wide  representation from the EU Member States, of which 108 experts from ICS/SCADA  organisations were enlisted. From the group of experts, 84 completed the online  questionnaire.  4) Interviews: the following figure summarises the methodology used to gather experts’ point  of view:  A panel of 27 experts on ICS/SCADA Cyber Security were interviewed. The interview questions  can be found in Annex B  5) The fourth step was to analyse the results of the on line survey and of the interviews and  identify the professional roles needed in ICS/SCADA Cyber security and the knowledge areas  for each role.  6) Finally, a set of challenges were identified and described, and a set of recommendations have  been proposed to solve the identified challenges for the development of cyber security  certification schemes for ICS/SCADA professionals in Europe.  10  ENISA – Work Programme 2014 : https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/programmes-reports/work- programme-2014  Shortlist of experts Preparation Questionnaire  design Evaluation  and analysis Conclusions  Request emails to  the experts  Interview  design  Shortlist of  experts  Setting the  agenda for  the  interviews  Evaluation  and analysis Conclusions  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  4  1.5 Report Structure  The report is structured as follows:   Chapter 1, “Introduction”   Chapter 2, “Existing certification schemes”, provides a description of three certification  schemes specific to ICS/SCADA systems, of the other four relevant certification schemes for  this study and finally, three safety certifications.

Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  5  2 Existing Certification Schemes  In this section the main points related to the development of certification schemes in the European  Union have been summarised.  The objective was to identify helpful aspects for the development of future certification schemes  regarding ICS/SCADA cyber security skills.  The following certification schemes have been identified, through desktop research:   ICS/SCADA Cyber security certification schemes:  o ISA99/IEC 62443 Cyber Security Certificate Program.11  o Certified ICS/SCADA Security Architect (CSSA)12  o SANS Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional certification (GICSP)13   Other relevant certification schemes:  o European Computer Driving License (ECDL) / International Computer Driving License  (ICDL)14 / NIS Driving License.  o National Cyber Security Workforce Framework.15  o Certified Automation Professional (CAP)16.  o Industrial Security Professional.17  o Department of Defense Directive 8570 for Information Assurance (DODD 8570)18.  A detailed description of each of the eight relevant initiatives selected is provided in Annex A: Detailed  Analysis of initiatives. Figure 1 maps these different schemes regarding their application to physical  security, ICS, and cyber security.  11 https://www.isa.org/training-and-certifications/isa-certification/isa99iec-62443/isa99iec-62443- cybersecurity-certificate-programs/  12 http://www.iacertification.org/cssa_certified_scada_security_architect.html  13 http://www.giac.org/certification/global-industrial-cyber-security-professional-gicsp  14 http://www.ecdl.com/  15 http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/framework/  16 https://www.isa.org/isa-certification/certified-automation-professional/  17 http://www.ncms-isp.org/ISP_Certification/index.asp  18 http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/857001m.pdf  https://www.isa.org/training-and-certifications/isa-certification/isa99iec-62443/isa99iec-62443-cybersecurity-certificate-programs/ https://www.isa.org/training-and-certifications/isa-certification/isa99iec-62443/isa99iec-62443-cybersecurity-certificate-programs/ http://www.iacertification.org/cssa_certified_scada_security_architect.html http://www.giac.org/certification/global-industrial-cyber-security-professional-gicsp http://www.ecdl.com/ http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/framework/ https://www.isa.org/isa-certification/certified-automation-professional/ http://www.ncms-isp.org/ISP_Certification/index.asp  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  6  Figure 1 – Relevant schemes  The analysed initiatives can be sorted according to the following features:   Orientation: The main topics addressed by the analysed initiatives are:  o Physical security: Industrial sectors have been always deeply committed with physical  security, so this is a topic always present in ICS/SCADA related certifications.  o Industrial Control Systems: Their features, operation and management are major  topics in ICS/SCADA initiatives related to certification and/or training.  o Cyber security: This is a new dimension of security that is starting to play a prominent  role in today’s industrial systems.   Support: Who is backing the various initiatives:  o Governments and public bodies  o Private sector and professional associations   Scope: Geographical scope of the certification:  o Global/International  o Europe  o United States  2.1 Certification schemes specific to ICS/SCADA cyber security  2.1.1 ISA 99 / IEC 62443 Cyber Security Certificate Program  ISA 99 / IEC 62443 is focused on cyber security in industrial environments. It is supported by a well- known professional association, the International Society of Automation (ISA), which adds to its  Cybersecurity  Red: Supported by Government  Black: Supported by professional associations  NIS  Driving License  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  7  strength and credibility. One of its main features is that standards and documents released by ISA are  developed by professionals.  This certification program is a work in progress on cyber security fundamentals targeted towards ICS  professionals who wish to enter the field of cyber security. Dealing with topics coming from two very  different fields such as cyber security and ICS/SCADA is challenging. Related contents may allow the  entrance of professionals coming from both disciplines. This implies having basic knowledge of both  domains.  ISA 99 scope is limited to the ISA 99 standards; as such it lacks comprehensive coverage of the  ICS/SCADA security landscape.  2.1.2 GIAC19 Global Industrial Cyber Security Professional (GICSP)  GICSP is part of the GIAC family and it is supported by SANS. It is a global certification that brings  together IT, engineering and cyber security to achieve security for industrial control systems from  design through to retirement. GICSP is targeted at professionals, worldwide and across industries, who  engineer or support control systems and share responsibility for the security of these environments.  These professionals can come from different backgrounds, such as Engineering, Cyber Security or IT.  This certification has been developed by GIAC in cooperation with an industry consortium consisting  of ICS/SCADA security professionals from industry leaders. One of the key features of the GICSP is that  it possesses a steering committee that has guided its development process.  GICSP has been developed under the international standard ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 20 , designed to  harmonize the personnel certification process worldwide and create a more cost-effective global  standard for workers. ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024, officially entitled \"General Requirements for Bodies  Operating Certification Systems of Persons,\" plays a prominent role in facilitating global  standardization of the certification community, enhancing consistency, and protecting consumers.  2.1.3 Certified SCADA Security Architect (CSSA)  CSSA is a professional certification from the Information Assurance Certification Review Board, a non- profit organisation formed by information security professionals. CSSA is targeted towards network  administrators and their managers, as well as IT professionals and their managers.  CSSA contains the following domains:   SCADA security policy development   SCADA security standards and best practices   Access Control   SCADA protocol security issues   Securing field communications   User authentication and authorization   Detecting cyber-attacks on SCADA systems   Vulnerability assessment  The goal of CSSA is to guarantee that certified professionals possess adequate knowledge to properly  secure SCADA systems. It is designed to be relevant for power transmission, oil and gas and water  19 Global Information Assurance Certification is a certification body completely owned/supported by SANS.  20 http://www.iso.org/iso/news.htm?refid=Ref1625  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  8  treatment industries. The most appreciated features of this certification are related to the quality of  the training courses, its instructors, and especially to the practical work during the training.  2.2 Other relevant certification schemes  2.2.1 European Computer Driving License (ECDL) / International Computer Driving License (ICDL)  / NIS Driving License  The European Computer Driving License (ECDL) and International Computer Driving License (ICDL) are  international standards in digital skills certifications. They are part of an initiative and a set of  certifications programmes targeted towards the public in general (i.e., individuals, employers,  teachers, students).  Despite the ECDL/ICDL not being related to cyber security or ICS/SCADA, they are pan-European  efforts that contain valuable features.  These can be used as reference in the development of future  European certifications on cyber security for ICS/SCADA professionals.  ECDL is made up of a range of modules, providing a practical programme of up-to-date skills and  knowledge areas that are validated by a test for each module.  In an area with multidisciplinary knowledge requirements (such as IT, OT, cyber security, etc.) as  ICS/SCADA security, a modular approach like the one followed by this programme, seems to be  interesting and valuable.  The most appreciated feature of this certification programme is the broad support of key public bodies  and governments (such as the European Commission, Member States, UNESCO, etc.). This is a key for  the success (but not the only one) and should be a taken into account for any certification that aspires  to be widely adopted and required in the industry.  The EU Cyber Security Strategy “An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace”21 proposes the development  of a roadmap for a \"Network and Information Security driving licence\" (NIS Driving License) as a  voluntary certification programme to promote enhanced skills and the competence of professionals.  There is a current effort22, led by ENISA, that has taken its first steps towards producing a roadmap  through a consultation process to involve the relevant stakeholders identify gaps between available  training, certifications and NIS education needs and propose scenarios to narrow the gaps and provide  best practices to organisations from all Member States.  The NIS Driving License develops different scenarios where are described their main features, target  audience, involved stakeholders, and are proposed incentives, objectives and means to achieve them.  The current described scenarios are:   Health care   Data Protection officers   Small and Medium Enterprises   Continuing education for teachers   Digital forensics  21 http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf  22  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education- programmes-in-europe  http://eeas.europa.eu/policies/eu-cyber-security/cybsec_comm_en.pdf https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe https://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/stakeholder-relations/nis-brokerage-1/roadmap-for-nis-education-programmes-in-europe  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  9  2.2.2 National Cyber Security Workforce Framework  The National Cyber Security Workforce Framework, as published by the United States National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is seen in the U.S., as a national resource that  categorizes, organizes and describes cyber security work. It has been developed by the National  Initiative for Cyber Security Education23 (NICE) in order to provide educators, students, employers,  employees, training providers and policy makers with a systematic way to approach cyber security  work, and describe what is required of the cyber security workforce. This framework is a thorough  approach to describe cyber security workforce related initiatives. It is backed by the United States  Government and it is being followed by different federal agencies as such it is becoming a de-facto  standard. It is not a certification scheme, but a comprehensive definition of cyber security workforce  related contents that should be taken into account in any certification scheme development in order  to guarantee a proper definition and scope of contents.  2.2.3 Certified Automation Professional (CAP)  The Certified Automation Professional (CAP) serves as a third party endorsement and documentation  of the skills and knowledge for professionals of the automation industry worldwide. CAP is targeted  at people working in automation at the professional level, technical supervisors, technical sales  personnel as well as automation educators. It does not include cyber security topics. CAP is backed by  the International Society of Automation, which makes it to be the most reputable certifications in the  industrial automation world. The CAP Certification is widely used by companies to evaluate hiring  candidates and making contracting decisions. CAP provides very comprehensive and detailed contents  about automation, including security and safety topics; nevertheless cyber security is just slightly  addressed in domain IV related to software development, and just from a very general point of view  without detailing the specifics of cyber security in Industrial Control Systems.  2.2.4 Industrial Security Professional Certification (NCMS-ISP)  The Industrial Security Professional (ISP) Certification is provided by The Society of Industrial Security  Professionals (NCMS). The intent of the ISP designation is to award professional certification and  recognition to qualified candidates who demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and abilities their  profession demands. It is targeted at qualified candidates who work within the U.S. National Industrial  Security Program.  ISP has a strong focus on physical security. Information Security is part of the certification, but  ICS/SCADA Security is not.  2.3 Safety Certifications  Traditionally, in the industrial world, most of the effort and resources invested in security were related  to safety. Today, due to convergence between operations technology and information technology,  cyber security is achieving an importance equal to that of safety among industrial companies and also  forced failure of systems via cyber-attacks may have a safety impact. The industrial security market  has a number of initiatives related to the training and certification of safety professionals.  The main features of safety certifications are:   Complexity:  o Different disciplines such as safety, health, environment protection are involved.  23 http://csrc.nist.gov/nice/  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  10  o Different environments: emergency management, engineering, ergonomics, fire  protection, risk management, occupational safety, etc.   Multiple levels of certification: allowing safety professionals to achieve professional  recognition regardless their education and giving priority to experience.  In this section two of the most relevant initiatives on this field are being outlined. Their features and  history could be used as reference in the development of cyber security certifications for ICS/SCADA  professionals.  2.3.1 The Board of Certified Safety Professionals  The Board of Certified Safety Professionals24 (BCSP) began in 1969 as a peer certification board whose  objectives are to:   Set standards for professional, technician, technologist, and supervisory level safety  practices.   Evaluate the academic and professional experience qualifications of certification  applicants.   Administer examinations.   Issue certificates to candidates who meet BCSP's certification qualifications and  successfully pass the examination(s).   Monitor continued professional development through mandatory recertification  requirements.  BCSP maintains multiple certifications and professional programs which amounts to more than 30000  certified individuals:   CSP: Certified Safety Professional   OHST: Occupational Health & Safety Technologist   CHST: Construction Health & Safety Technician   STS: Safety Trained Supervisor   CET: Certified Environmental Safety and Health Trainer   ASP: Associate Safety Professional   GSP: Graduate Safety Practitioner   BCSP certified professionals are from countries across the globe however most of them  come from the U.S.  2.3.2 The European Network of Safety and Health Professional Organisations  The European Network of Safety and Health Professional Organisations25 (ENSHPO) brings together  health and safety professional organisations from across Europe.  The main objectives of ENSHPO are:   To ensure participation from all of the professional organisations across Europe and  represent the views, opinions and concerns of this group.   To operate as a dialogue partner with relevant national and international authorities.   To co-operate with other organisations, institutions, and federations within Europe and  beyond.  24 http://www.bcsp.org/  25 http://www.enshpo.eu/home  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  11   To primarily act as a forum where practitioners can exchange information, experiences  and good practices on a wide variety of pertinent topics.   To develop a European-wide recognition of Occupational Safety and Health (OSH)  practitioner qualifications and training.  The member organisations of ENSHPO have agreed to create two standardised Europe-wide  certifications. They allow eligible health and safety practitioners to use the designation EurOSHM  (European Occupational Safety and Health Manager) and EurOSHT (European Occupational Safety and  Health Technician).  National professional organisations of European countries can present their own certification schemes  for standard verification. These schemes are reviewed by the ENSHPO Certification Committee (ECC)  for deciding what additional qualifications are necessary to obtain the EurOSHM or EurOSHT title.  2.3.3 Specific training on cyber security for ICS/SCADA  Currently, there is not a wide offer of training specialized in cyber security for ICS/SCADA in the  market.

The general workforce that interacts with and maintains these systems. This group can  target general awareness campaigns explaining risks; it also provides simple do’s and  don’ts.   Examples are operators in plants, vendors and integrators of systems, developers of  ICS systems.  2. ICS/SCADA Cyber Security professionals that have specific accountability or responsibility  for ICS/SCADA Cyber Security. This is the group that needs to be trained (and if needed)  certified. This group can be divided in groups as well:   Management roles:  o ICS/SCADA Security Manager (e.g., responsible person for central team of  specialists/Centre of Excellence).  o Manager in the business with accountability for ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  (often line manager, such as engineering manager, plant manager, OT  manager, IT Manager, maintenance manager, Integrator of IT and OT  environments).  o Management of process control systems and associated maintenance  responsible control system engineers.   Technical roles:  o ICS/SCADA focal points in the business  o ICS/SCADA Security Operations Centre personnel  o ICS/SCADA (Forensic) Analysts  o ICS/SCADA Incident Response professionals  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Architects  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Analyst  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security R&D personnel  o Cyber Security professionals in ICS Development organisations  o ICS/SCADA Cyber Security testers  37 Created by the ERNCIP Thematic Group Industrial Automated Control Systems and Smart Grids, work stream  Workforce Development Framework  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  15  3.2 Knowledge areas for ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Professionals  The most important knowledge areas for professionals have been identified taking into account the  existing ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification schemes and other relevant studies. The following  uses as reference the work done under the ERNCIP Thematic Group on IACS and Smart Grids.  One of  its subgroups has focused on defining the competences, qualifications and experience, needed by ICS  Cyber Security Professionals. The result is a high level overview of the knowledge areas that need to  be developed (Figure 2):  Figure 2 – Knowledge areas38  This ERNCIP work has been adopted by the industry consortium developing the list of certification  objectives and outcome statements that has been used by GIAC to develop the GICSP certification.

This list embeds all the knowledge areas that were named in the interviews and the survey for this  research (see previous chapter). These knowledge areas are the foundation for all the technical  ICS/SCADA cyber security roles.  All roles with accountability or responsibility of ICS/SCADA cyber security would need the basic  competence across these knowledge areas. Where more specialist roles are defined, for example  ICS/SCADA forensic analyst, ICS/SCADA Incident Response professional, more detailed knowledge,  skills and abilities on that specific topic will be needed.

In this section are presented the most relevant results that allow the further identification of  challenges and recommendations for the development of certifications for ICS/SCADA cybersecurity  professionals.  Intention towards certification  ICS/SCADA cyber security is important to safeguard the Critical Infrastructures in Europe. It is  important to have professionals trained and certified to implement and maintain the right level of  ICS/SCADA cyber security controls.  As presented in Figure 3, three quarters of the respondents to the survey are considering getting  certified, to prove their cyber security ICS/SCADA knowledge, but just one third have already obtained  or are in process of obtaining a cyber security ICS/SCADA related certificate.  Figure 3 – Survey Results. Intention regarding certification  75,9%  24,1%  Are you considering to get certified to prove your  cyber security ICS/SCADA knowledge?

Yes  No  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  20  Approach to building cyber security certification schemes  When asked about the approach to building an ICS/SCADA cyber security certification scheme, most  of the professionals consider that new certifications should combine baseline knowledge with  specialised certifications focused on different knowledge areas (Figure 4).  Figure 4 – Survey Results. Approach to build certification schemes  The research has shown that for certain positions it would add value to certify these professionals.  There are already a few certifications available in the market, but they are still on a foundational level  and there is not yet a complete certification scheme that covers both, the certification of skills and  abilities in cyber security for ICS/SCADA professionals. As the community of organisations using  ICS/SCADA systems shows a demand for further development of these kinds of certifications, it seems  that it is the moment to define a framework to allow the development of ICS/SCADA cyber security  certifications that meets or exceeds the needs of all the stakeholders and considers different  perspectives in a coherent manner.  Nature of cyber security certification schemes for ICS/SCADA  The research conducted shows that there are open discussions about the nature that cyber security  for ICS/SCADA certifications schemes should have. For instance, 51% think that they should be sector  specific while 49% think that they should be generic (Figure 5). Also, 85,2% of professionals do not  know any position where an ICS/SCADA certification is mandatory.  25,6%  11,6%62,8%  What is the best approach to build a ICS/SCADA  cyber security certification scheme?  Develop a baseline knowledge certification that covers the basics about cyber security, ICS/SCADA, automation, etc.  Develop several specialized certifications focused on different knowledge areas.  Develop a combined certification schema/framework that includes both of the options mentioned above.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  21  Figure 5 – Survey Results. Generic vs. Specific certifications  Most of the professionals believe that having a panel of recognised experts involved in the creation of  the certifications would be very valuable, as presented in Figure 6.  Figure 6 – Survey Results. Involvement of experts  An impartial review/assessment of existing and future certifications could help reach a consensus on  these topics.  This should be made through a committee able to validate the quality, impact and applicability of the  certification and to ensure that these ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification schemes will be  supported by the European Commission, EU member states governments, industry bodies, critical  infrastructures and all their stakeholders, such as asset owners, suppliers, vendors, integrators,  51,2%  48,8%  Do you think that cyber security certifications for  ICS/SCADA should be sector specific (energy, water,  oil & gas, etc)?  Yes  No  72,1%  25,6%  2,3%  When creating the curricula and contents of the  certification, how do you value having a panel of  recognized experts working on it?

Such a committee should be credible for the community of experts and  professionals in order to earn recognition and support.  Knowledge about existing certifications of ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals  More than 55% of professionals are aware of existing certification schemes, as presented in Figure 7.  Besides this, as stated in Section 2, there exist good certification schemes that could prove useful  foundation for the development of new certifications.  Figure 7 – Survey Results. Knowledge of certification of ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals  There is a small number of ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certifications available in the market that focus  on the foundational knowledge of professionals. The experts interviewed suggested there is a need to  build comprehensive European certification schemes on the ICS/SCADA cyber security topic based on  existing certifications.  Certification credibility factors  Figure 8 presents the results to the question “What makes a certification credible?”. From the total  number, 76,7% of professionals think that practical training makes a certification credible and more  valuable.  55,6%  44,4%  Do you know any scheme for the Certification of  ICS/SCADA Cyber Security experts?  Yes  No  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  23  Figure 8 – Survey Results. What makes a certification credible?  Until now, the most relevant certifications available in the ICS/SCADA cyber security community  focused on testing the foundational knowledge of professionals, but do not include the testing of  practical skills. Given the nature of the operations executed by industrial control systems, it is of  importance to include the development and test of practical knowledge skills in future certification  schemes.  Practical experience as an integral part of certifications  From the total number presented on Figure 9, 72,1% of professionals think that to demonstrate  knowledge and applied principles, the certification should include the demonstration of practical  experience.

From this point of view, the  idea of promoting simulation environments seems good and will probably be supported by the  promotion of European Commission of serious gaming technologies.  The nature of operations conducted on industrial control systems requires that the professionals in  charge possess practical experience. This is something difficult to achieve and demonstrate through  theoretical certifications, so, to include practical work is very important for future ICS/SCADA cyber  security certifications for professionals.  Inclusion of management topics in certification schemes  The majority of the interviewed experts recognize the necessity of including management levels in  certification schemes, the only opinions against this were related to different sets of priorities, but  were still considering it a necessity.  A target group in the ICS/SCADA Cyber Security domain are the people in management positions,  senior professionals who oversee activities in this area and need to ensure that in their environments  include the right controls in place to mitigate the risk to their organisation to an acceptable level. They  also need to be able to explain this to top management in their organisations.  Main features of ICS/SCADA cyber security certification schemes  For European certification schemes to work, it is important to develop content in ways in which such  schemes would work. Part of this should be to decide under which premises new certifications will be  developed:  o Do we want to create an entity (or select an entity) that develops specific certifications? Or,  o Do we create a certification framework in which organisations that use ICS/SCADA initiatives  can be assessed, validated, approved and supported by European agencies or public bodies?  This approach could be similar to the way the DODD 8570 framework is operated in the US.  In either case, to keep an adequate level of credibility, validating certifications should be exempt of  commercial interests.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  25  5 Challenges  The studies made during the development of this work as well as the interviews carried out and the  online survey results have identified some challenges and issues. This section lists the main challenges  that should be addressed when developing certification schemes for testing the skills of cyber security  ICS/SCADA professionals.  The challenges identified are supported in the answers made by experts in the online questionnaire  and during the interviews, and also in perceptions obtained in workshops and conversations with  experts combined with the experience of the main authors of this work.  5.1 Obtain stakeholder support  The support of professional associations and organisations is one of the key issues for the success of  any certification. The public highly values the involvement of well-known professionals and strong  organisations in the development and support of professional certifications. However, 44,3% of  professionals involved have not heard about ICS/SCADA certifications.  Raising the relevance, credibility and strength of future certifications related to the cyber security skills  of ICS/SCADA professionals will require to engage well-known and respected professionals from the  fields of cyber security and industrial operations technology.  Also, obtaining a consensus about contents and target audience will be an important issue since  currently there are ongoing major discussions involving important topics such as whether certification  must be sector oriented or not.  5.2 Avoid commercial interests  Stakeholders involved in the analysis process expressed their concern that some existing certifications  have strong commercial interests, since selling certifications is part of the business model of many  certification bodies. This in itself is not a problem, since this budget is also needed to keep the content  of the certification up-to-date and provide professional certification environments. It does imply,  however, the necessity of an objective validation of the quality of the certification by an impartial  body. This would allow checks of the quality of the certifications according to an objective checklist  and criteria.  5.3 Manage the confluence ICS/Cyber Security  The contents of certifications on cyber security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals are related to two  very different worlds: cyber security and operations technology in industrial environments. The results  of the questionnaire and interviews reflect that, besides IT and cyber security contents, all the  professionals surveyed would include specific OT knowledge. This would be a challenge since it implies  the development and integration of contents coming from very different subjects.  5.4 Cross sector contents  ICS and SCADA systems are used in a number of different industrial sectors. Despite the fact that the  underlying technology is common among sectors, and these face similar technical problems,  operational processes are different, so addressing the different requirements and necessities of every  sector may be difficult.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  26  5.5 Cover the different positions involved in cyber security for ICS/SCADA  The development of contents for future certification schemes should take into account different  professional profiles from the functional point of view ( e.g., operators, engineers, IT technicians, cyber  security personnel, physical security personnel, …) but also from a broader point of view ( e.g.,  managers, section chiefs, field workers, …). This would add complexity to the contents of future  certifications since they will have to deal with many different points of view.  5.6 Obtain a critical mass of certificates  As the number of certified professionals increases, a certification scheme becomes more  representative in the community. Also the involvement of well-known professionals in the creation of  certifications is important because they would serve as role models for their peers.  The more focused a certification scheme is the number of wide range professionals interested in the  scheme decreases. Broader differentiation into sub-tier certification levels may be a successful  approach. With ICS/SCADA Cyber Security being a growing area of expertise worldwide, this is needed,  since it adds value to professionals and the industry.  5.7 Avoid the appearance of too many similar certifications  Industrial cyber security is a topic that will gain prominence  in the market place in the coming years,  so it is foreseeable that this will be accompanied by a growing a broader interest by IT, OT and  operational professionals and therefore a number of organisations will find it appropriate and suitable  to support the development of certifications.  A wide number of certifications will scatter possible professionals among all of them. This will  complicate the development of relevant certifications that will serve as a reference for the ICS/SCADA  cyber security market. This is something that is currently happening with IT or cyber security related  certifications, where different organisations, vendors and public bodies propose their own  certifications making difficult for any of these to differentiate from the others.  5.8 Adapt existing certifications to include ICS/SCADA cyber security topics  Most of the existing cyber security certifications do not include topics related to ICS/SCADA;  additionally industrial certifications do not include cyber security in their curriculum. The adaptation  of these certifications to include topics specific to ICS/SCADA cyber security, will boost the general  knowledge among the community of professionals and therefore will increase the cyber security of  industrial facilities. However, the developers of existing certifications will not be willing to adapt their  contents unless there exists a proper pressure from the market.  However, aligning and trying to improve and add content to existing certifications can be a lengthy  process. Also working together with other initiatives around the world will take a considerable effort  and considerable amounts of communication and meetings to reach alignment.  5.9 Inclusion of practical aspects  Due to the nature of operations made over industrial control systems, future certification schemes  should include practical knowledge in the form of hands-on laboratories, simulations or other practical  testing methods.  However, it is possible that practical assignments do not reflect thoroughly the daily practice. It is  difficult to test all practical skills and abilities for all possible roles, especially in a simulation  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  27  environment. This might be the reason to develop a whole set of certifications (with different topics  and objectives) focusing on practical skills and abilities for different target groups (e.g., Incident  Handling in ICS environments, Ethical hacking in ICS environments, Forensics in ICS environments,  etc.).  The development of valid simulators can be a costly effort. This will only be feasible if the simulation  environment can also be used for other purposes like component testing, exercises and training.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  28  6 Recommendations for an European certification scheme on ICS/SCADA  cyber security  This section presents a series of recommendations aimed to address the identified challenges for the  development of cyber security certification schemes for ICS/SCADA professionals In Europe. The  recommendations are extracted from the data provided by experts through interviews and the online  survey.  The recommendations are related to each other and are considered equally important.  Recommendation 1 presents the framework under which the subsequent recommendations should  be included and interpreted. The remaining recommendations should be coherent between them and  with the common reference of Recommendation 1.  The detailed descriptions of the recommendations contain the following sections:   Description: where the core content of the recommendation is presented. It can be  considered as the “what” and the “how” parts of the recommendation. What should be its  architecture, how to design and manage it.   Challenges addressed: set of challenges that are addressed by the current recommendation.   Good practices: suggestions to successfully implement the recommendation.  In Recommendation 1 the following sections can be found:   Objectives: what the recommendation aims to address.   Steps: next actions to be executed to achieve the recommendation.   Stakeholders affected: It provides information concerning the stakeholders for whom each  the tasks of the recommendations is specially addressed. ‘Leading’ entities are intended to  take initiative and decisions, ‘cooperating’ ones would have to develop specific tasks  including actions or documentation delivery, ‘consulting’ stakeholders would only be  considered for informational aspects.  Recommendation 1: Create an overarching ICS/SCADA cyber security certification scheme for  ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals.  Description:  The European Union should promote, fund and support the development of an ICS/SCADA Cyber  Security Certification Scheme for the European ICS/SCADA Cyber Security community. This will make  it possible to validate and assess current and future certifications in this domain. These certification  schemes will also stimulate the market to develop relevant new certifications.  Challenges addressed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9  Objective:  The good practices and recommendations described in this document have to serve as a reference for  the development of such a comprehensive ICS/SCADA cyber security scheme as well for the  development of new certifications. It should meet the demand of the ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  community. The following points should be considered when building such comprehensive ICS/SCADA  Cyber Security Certification scheme:   Data gathered through the survey and from the interviewed experts suggest that new  ICS/SCADA cyber security certifications should be multi-level as this will allow the certification  to reach a broader range of professionals (from entry-level to expert) as well as different fields  of application. In this way, a multi-level scheme could reflect the difference skill-set that are  needed for professionals (e.g., management vs. specialist or generalist vs specialist). Being  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  29  able to place certifications on multiple levels allows the inclusion of a wider range of people,  including entry level and experienced professionals. An example of these levels could be:  o Foundational level: Where all the basics of ICS/SCADA security are introduced to the  students, requiring them to pass a (theoretical) exam that tests the (applied)  knowledge of the candidates. This is the entry level. Only professionals that already  have some relevant experience should be able to pass this exam. Professionals on the  Knowledge level are able to interpret and evaluate information and advice from  experts in an area of expertise. They can operate with help of more senior  professionals.  o Advanced level: The certifications on this level should contain assignments to test the  practical skills of the candidates. This would be interesting for people with either 5-8  years of relevant experience and with the Knowledge level certification passed. The  candidates will have to pass a theory and practical exam, with practical assignments  in a simulator environment. Professionals on this skill level are able to consistently  carry out ICS/SCADA Cyber Security activities.  o Master’s level: This level is for experienced professionals on ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  in specific roles. They will need more than ten years of relevant experience and will  need to have passed the skill level. At this level sector specifications might be  considered as well. A theory and practical exam should be passed with corresponding  practical exercises performed in the simulation environment. People on a mastery  level are thought leaders who are able to diagnose and resolve significant, unusual  problems and to successfully adapt all ICS/SCADA cyber security aspects.  o Management level: focused on the skills of managers in this domain.  The main  objective will be to explain the impact of low security and how a good cyber security  strategy supports the general strategy of a corporation.  This separation in levels can also enable the introduction of topics specific to certain industrial sectors,  and will reflect the experience, skills and abilities of ICS/SCADA Cyber Security professionals and will  offer the possibility to distinguish between professionals.  Steps:   At the EU level, create, fund and support an initiative to set-up a project to develop this  certification scheme, the assessment criteria as well as the set-up of the independent  committee (see next recommendation) that will operate the certification scheme.   Invite the most relevant stakeholders, both public and private, to take part in this effort.  Include appropriate knowledgeable representatives from outside the EU.   After building the certification scheme and the assessment criteria, assess existing  foundational ICS/SCADA Cyber Security certifications to see if they meet the criteria and  actively stimulate the market to fill in the gaps in the scheme. Do not limit the scheme to  European certification initiatives, but also include international certifications in the  framework.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: cooperating   Academia and R&D: leading   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  30  Recommendation 2: Create an independent committee that assesses (and endorses) current and  future certifications.  Description:  It is recommended to create an independent committee that develops evaluation criteria, reviews and  assesses current and future certifications and endorses them when they meet the established criteria.  This will give the applicable weight and will maximize the adoption of the certifications by private and  public organisations as well as motivate professionals to obtain these certifications. It should be note  that, achieving a critical mass of certificates will be a key issue to the success of future certifications.  To achieve this, it will be necessary to identify renowned stakeholders from the industrial cyber  security arena including asset owners, suppliers, vendors, technical educators, integrators,  government and regulators. People from these stakeholder communities can apply for participation  in this independent committee and will be vetted.  Part of the work of this independent committee, in close cooperation with ENISA, could aim at  stimulating the market to develop relevant certifications for ICS/SCADA cyber security professionals  and to provide guidance on how to develop new uniform certification scheme at EU level.  Having a sound validation process in place will also prevent the proliferation of multiple certifications  related to cyber security of ICS/SCADA as this could disperse the efforts made and scatter potential  certified professionals among them.  Challenges addressed: 1, 2, 6, 7  Good Practices:   Create an independent committee with vetted experts (from industry but also with  certification development and accreditation as expertise) that will assess and (potentially)  endorse ICS/SCADA Cyber Security certifications for professional skills.   Develop assessment criteria for the assessment of ICS/SCADA cyber security certifications.   Establish a straight-forward process of cooperation for the committee, with regular  meetings and defined short, medium and long-term objectives.   To involve relevant stakeholders in order improve the credibility of the committee.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: consulting   Academia and R&D: cooperating   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: cooperating  Recommendation 3: Take into account existing global certifications.  Description:  Use existing ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certifications as a basis to build European ICS/SCADA Cyber  Security certification schemes. This implies working closely together with the providers of existing  certifications to ensure that they also cover European specific regulations and legislation.  By adapting existing relevant ICS/SCADA cyber security initiatives to the development of European  certification schemes, the effort is likely to gain the support of the global community and multinational  organisations. This will also facilitate the creation of a critical mass of certified professionals who will  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  31  find it easy to achieve the new certifications if parts of them are based in previous knowledge and  experience.  The project groups, leading the effort to build certification schemes, should take an active approach  in validating these certifications and work on improving them hand-in-hand with the provider  organisations. Also, it will be important to work together with similar initiatives outside Europe to  ensure global alignment.  Of course these existing schemes will need to be assessed as soon as the overarching ICS/SCADA cyber  security certification scheme is released.  Challenges addressed: 6, 8  Good practices:   Use comprehensive schemes such as the National Cyber Security Workforce Framework as a  basis to define the contents of future certifications.   Take into account the most relevant initiatives and certifications identified and analysed in  Annex A: Detailed Analysis of initiatives to be included in future European certification  schemes.   Evaluate the content of these certifications on their alignment with European legislation and  regulations.   Work together with the providers of these certifications to add relevant European legislation  and regulation to the certification objectives and outcome statements of these certifications.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: consulting   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 4: Include practical assignments in new certifications.  Description:  The recommendation promotes the inclusion to future certification schemes of several hands-on  sessions to test the practical skills of the students. This will be needed to go a step further than  testing candidates on the theoretical knowledge level, since knowing how to act against risk and  vulnerabilities in ICS/SCADA environments cannot be learned by just studying books.  Future certifications shall include mandatory practical work, where besides taking a theory exam,  students would have to complete and pass some practical assignments in a simulation environment.  The objective is to create comprehensive schemes in which certifications are being developed  containing practical assignments. The students will need to apply all their theoretical knowledge for  ensuring that certified professionals have the right level of skills and abilities to meet real risk  situations. This test will assure that they have at least some experience with practical successes where  they were able to manage the situation and act to solve the problems.

Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: cooperating   Manufacturers and integrators: cooperating   ICS Security tools and services providers: cooperating   Operators: cooperating   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 5: Create a simulation environment to test practical skills and abilities.  Description:  For new ICS/SCADA cyber security certifications to contain practical assignments, it is necessary to  develop simulation environments to test the students. The same environments could also be used for  training purposes.  These environments should be realistic simulations that can be used for the practical part of the  certifications where students can develop and demonstrate their practical skills and abilities in, e.g.,  simulated cyber-attacks.  The environments might be either physical places with physically simulated industrial environments  or virtual industrial environments.  Challenges addressed: 9  Good practices:   The creation of an inventory of such simulation environments available in the European and  global market.   Define the use cases for these simulation environments.   Align with the European Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) and critical sectors to  keep the threat catalogue of the simulation environment up-to-date.   Work towards the creation of test beds, simulation environments and laboratories that allow  students to develop and test their practical skills.   To promote new technologies needed to develop the simulators.   To promote business models to make viable simulators as a business.   To promote collaboration between the industrial infrastructures and the potential developers  of the simulator.

The focus would be more on topics like business impact, regulations, ICS/SCADA Risk  Management and Incident Management.  This will ensure that managers of ICS/SCADA Cyber Security organisations or departments are qualified  to give clear guidance to the top management of their organisations and to make the right decisions  in crisis situations.  Challenges addressed: 5  Good practices:   Include managerial topics in the contents developed for future certifications.   Take into account methodologies focused on understanding how ICS/SCADA cyber security  supports the strategy and results of the organisation.  Stakeholders affected:   Security Test Lab Experts: consulting   Manufacturers and integrators: consulting   ICS Security tools and services providers: consulting   Operators: consulting   Academia and R&D: consulting   Public bodies: leading   Standardisation bodies: consulting  Recommendation 7: Define main features and contents of European ICS/SCADA Cyber Security  Certification Schemes  Description:  There are multiple ways of implementing an ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification Scheme. It is  important to make a choice in the approach to take.  For every certification that will be part of the certification scheme it is important to clearly state:   Define base level of expertise before entering the framework.   Recommendations about how skills are maintained (Continuing Professional Development  (CPD) or forced refreshers)   What the certification objectives and the outcome statements are.   How the weighting of these items is in the exam.   The way the exam is taken (questions / use cases / proctored or not).   Policies for retaking exams, extensions, recertifying process, etc.  A key issue will be to keep an adequate balance between the cyber security and ICS/SCADA related  contents. This will make the certification suitable for professionals coming from both the IT and OT  domains.  Certification of Cyber Security skills of ICS/SCADA professionals  Good practice and recommendations for developing harmonised certification schemes  December 2014  Page  34  To make it practical the creation of an ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Certification Framework that  provides organisations the opportunity to develop certifications that will be validated and approved  by an appointed organisation on the European level, e.g., ENISA is proposed.  Certifications should be developed under strict guidance before being approved and integrated in the  European certification framework. Next to the approval of the assigned entity, the certifications  should also have ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024 accreditation. This international standard (ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024)  was designed to harmonize the personnel certification process worldwide and create a more cost- effective global standard for workers. ANSI/ISO/IEC 17024, officially entitled \"General Requirements  for Bodies Operating Certification Systems of Persons,\" plays a prominent role in facilitating global  standardization of the certification community, enhancing consistency, and protecting consumers.  Challenges addressed: 2, 3  Good practices:   First step towards the creation of new certification schemes will be the development of an  ICS/SCADA Cyber Security Framework with all the following elements:  o Framework.  o Certification process.  o Appoint entity guiding the process.   Include balanced contents of cyber security and operations technology on ICS/SCADA  systems.   Setting this up should go hand-in-hand with creation of the workgroup that has to stimulate  development of new certifications.

However it is also noticeable  that most of the experts have not heard about many existing certification schemes. This is a trending  issue which is starting to gain importance.  The field of cyber security for ICS/SCADA is complex due to its main features:   The involvement of different disciplines such as cyber security, operations technology and  information technology, which implies dealing with different objectives and bodies of  knowledge.  This also implies dealing with different cultures and attitudes towards security in  both the IT and OT domains.   The broad range of sectors that use industrial control systems (automation, energy, chemical,  pharmaceutics, energy, etc.). Despite all of them use similar physical systems, there are  important differences in their processes and operational procedures as well as health, safety  and environmental consequences due to a failure of a system or component.   Current certifications focused on related to ICS/SCADA cyber security have a theoretical  approach; nevertheless, practical aspects should be included in future certification schemes.  For any initiative to succeed in this complex field, guidance and expertise are needed. It is highly  advisable to create a steering committee in charge of assessing future certifications and providing  guidance in its development.  ICS/SCADA cyber security is a growing trend that during the upcoming years will have an important  presence in the market with many commercial and industrial opportunities. This has the following  implications:   Development and exploitation of certification schemes can be a profitable business, but by no  means the main objective of the certifications should be forgotten: improving the skills of  professionals on ICS/SCADA cyber security. Everything else is secondary.   One of the key factors for the success of any certification is the number of certified  professionals. The bigger the amount, the more relevance the certification will obtain. Despite  the foreseeable growth of the subject of ICS/SCADA cyber security is a very specialised  discipline with a relatively low number of professionals involved. This could make it difficult  to obtain a critical mass of certificates.

CONCLUSIONS 17  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The EU’s eIDAS regulation (EU Regulation 910/2014) sets rules for electronic identity schemes  and trust services in Europe, national eID schemes, cross-border interoperability and  recognition. eIDAS was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016. One of the goals of  eIDAS is to ensure that electronic signatures can have the same legal standing as traditional  signatures and to remove barriers to electronic commerce and all types  of electronic transactions in the EU. The eIDAS regulation aims to:   ensure that people and businesses can voluntarily use their own national electronic  identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services available online in other EU  countries.   create a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work  across borders and have the same legal status as their traditional paper-based  equivalents.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets out the security requirements for the trust service  providers (TSPs) and introduces mandatory security breach reporting for trust service providers  (TSPs) in the EU. The reporting obligations have three parts:   Trust service providers must notify security breaches that have a significant impact to  the national supervisory bodies.   The national supervisory bodies must inform each other and ENISA if there are  breaches which have an impact across borders.   Every year national supervisory bodies must send annual summary reports about the  notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  This report, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2020, provides an aggregated  overview of the notified breaches for 2020, analysing root causes, statistics and trends. This  report marks the fifth round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector.  In this round of annual summary reporting a total of 27 EU countries and 2 EFTA countries took  part. They reported a total of 39 incidents.  KEY FINDINGS  We summarize the key findings from the 2020 incident reports:   A steady increase in notified incidents: in 2020 notified incidents increased by  around 18%. This suggests that authorities and TSPs are becoming more familiar with  the breach reporting process and their obligations under eIDAS.   The number of incidents with a large impact has dropped: in 2020 only 3 incidents  were characterized as having had a “large impact” as opposed to 2019 when 10 such  incidents had been reported (translating into approximately 60% decrease).  Τhe ratio of reported incidents concerning qualified and non-qualified trust services  remains high: in 2020, 69% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services  compared to approximately 33% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services (with some  incidents  touching both categories.  2020  HIGHLIGHTS  The number of  notified incidents is  steadily increasing.  The number of  incidents with large  impacts has dropped.  System failures  account for more  than half of incidents  and have been the  dominant root cause  for the last four years  of incident reporting.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  4  Although non-qualified trust services are widely used by citizens and enterprises, it seems that  the respective trust services operators do not make much effort to report related incidents. In  most cases, the notification is done by a TSP that also offers qualified services, reporting an  incident that has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.  The impact on subservices is mainly divided between certificate management (47% of the  incidents) and certificate generation (42% of the incidents).  Approximately 66% (26 incidents) of the reported incidents were rated as minor  compared to 2019 when 60% (19 incidents) were rated as having had only a minor  impact. Only one incident had a very large (disastrous) impact, and only three incidents  had a large impact. Furthermore, a significant increase in minor incidents has been  observed, indicating that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to  the providers and they are reporting more incidents regardless of their severity.  Figure 1: Severity of impact - Trust services security incidents in the EU reported over 2016-2020  ENISA publishes detailed statistics about trust services security incidents in an online visual  tool, CIRAS Visual. This tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns1.  Currently the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament are  discussing policy changes. Last year the Commission proposed to integrate Article 19, the  security requirements for TSPs into a revised NIS Directive. The goal of this Commission  proposal, the NIS2 proposal, is to simplify EU cybersecurity legislation and to ensure that there  is a similar approach across the different sectors, including the telecom sector and the trust  services sector, which are currently addressed under separate pieces of legislation. This year  the Commission will also make a proposal for a new eIDAS regulation.  ENISA will continue to support national supervisory bodies with the implementation of breach  reporting under Article 19 of eIDAS and to work towards making this process efficient and  effective, yielding useful data, for the supervising bodies, for the national authorities, as well as  for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-  analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  Under Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation2, Trust Service Providers (TSPs) in the EU are  expected to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. On  an annual basis, the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA.  Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of the reported security incidents.  This document gives an aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the  supervisory bodies during 2020. This annual report marks the fifth round of security incident  reporting in the EU’s trust services sector, covering security incidents during 2020.  1.1 SCOPE  Incidents reported by authorities under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  Experts at national authorities, experts in the sector  1.3 CONTENT  This document is structured as follows: in section 2, the policy context is briefly summarized as  is the underlying eIDAS reporting framework and an overview of the types of incidents reported  is provided by anonymized examples. In Section 3, further elaboration of the reported incidents  is given, by presenting the categories of root causes, the detailed causes, and the affected  services. In section 4, the multi-annual trends in incidents over the years 2016-2020 are  highlighted. In Section 5, conclusions and observations based on the available data are drawn.  1.4 DISCLAIMER  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does  not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed  discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert  group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the  practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a representative from  RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and supports the group  with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  6  2. INCIDENT REPORTING  FRAMEWORK  In this section, we give an overview of the formats and procedures for the reporting of incidents  (breaches) under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  2.1 OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS  The mandatory security breach notification process has three steps as displayed in the figure  below:  1. Trust service providers notify their national supervisory body about security breaches  that have significant impact.  2. National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is a cross-border  impact.  3. National supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified breaches  to ENISA and the Commission.  Figure 2: Incident reporting under article 19 of eIDAS regulation  EIDAS  ARTICLE 19  requires trust service  providers in the EU to  1) assess risks;  2) take appropriate  security measures to  mitigate security  breaches;  3) notify breaches to  national supervisory  bodies.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  7  2.2 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  Experts from the national authorities have access to the ENISA CIRAS incident reporting tool,  where they can upload incident reports and search for and study specific incidents.  For the public, ENISA also offers an online visual tool, which is publicly accessible and can be  used for custom analysis of the data. This tool anonymizes the country or operator involved.  CIRAS  is a free online tool where ENISA stores reported  incidents and provides annual and multiannual  statistics: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ciras  We briefly introduce the reporting template. The template starts with a type selector and contains  three parts:  1. Impact of the incident - which trust services are impacted and by how much.  2. Nature of the incident - what caused the incident?  3. Details about the incident - detailed information about the incident, a short description,  the types of services, the types of assets, the severity level etc.  Figure 3: eIDAS Article 19 incident reporting types   Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability). For example, an outage caused by  a cable cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for building  a new road would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity). For  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the endpoints  participating in the shared session. This leads to the interception of the media (voice,  pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This incident would be  categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact on  the service). For example, a malware has been detected on several workstations and  servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be categorised  as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw). For instance, the discovery  of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  8   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system). For example, the  breaking of one of two redundant submarine cables would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures). For instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would be  categorised as a type F incident.  Depending on the type selected, some fields in the template are deactivated. For example, in the  case of a Type A incident the fields “threat severity factors” and “severity of threat” are not active.  2.3 ANONYMIZED EXAMPLES OF SECURITY INCIDENTS  In this section we present some of the kinds of incidents that are reported, by providing several  detailed and anonymized examples.  Incident example 1  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Faulty software change/update  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform  Comment Unavailability of the eSignature service due to an outage of the  front-end application component  Incident example 2  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected System failure  Root cause Faulty software change/update  Technical causes Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform  Assets affected Unavailability of the eSignature service due to an outage of the  front-end application component  Comment eSignature  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  9  Incident example 3  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature, eTimestamps  Root cause Natural phenomena  Technical causes Natural phenomena  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform, Time  Stamping Authority (TSA) platform, Validation Authority (VA)  platform  Comment Consequences of heavy rain caused unavailability of registers and  information systems. Synchronisation with redundant hardware of  information systems was also disturbed. Additional sealing means  was installed.  Incident example 4  Incident type B-Other impact on core service  Service affected eSignature  Root cause Malicious action  Technical causes Tampering of personal data, theft or loss of data  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform, Time  Stamping Authority (TSA) platform, Validation Authority (VA)  platform  Comment The incident concerns the creation of a qualified certificate  following a phishing attack and the creation of a false identity  through online banking. The certificate was used only once to sign  the terms and conditions for opening an account in another bank.  That bank has been warned and closed the account. The qualified  certificate has been revoked.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  10  Incident example 5  Incident type D-Active threat or vulnerability  Service affected PDF signing  Root cause Malicious action, third party failure  Technical causes Vulnerability inherent to document format  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform, Time  Stamping Authority (TSA) platform, Validation Authority (VA)  platform  Comment Signed PDF files can be manipulated in a way that they look  different to the signatory than to relying parties (shadow attacks,  https://www.pdf-insecurity.org/). Signing services and validation  services are not affected. The vulnerability has been resolved by  issuing new versions of PDF viewers. Recommendations for  signatories by TSPs have been updated accordingly.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  11  3. INCIDENT ANALYSIS  The 2020 annual summary reporting, by the 27 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries  participating in this process, included in total 39 security incidents3. This is the fifth round of annual  summary reporting, since eIDAS came into force on the 1st of July 2016.  Figure 4: Number of incidents per year  There is a steady increase in the number of incidents reported which, over the years, leans  towards becoming linear. This suggests that TSPs are becoming more familiar with the process.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  The figure nr. 5 shows the distribution of the incidents according to their underlying root cause.  We categorize incidents into four categories of root causes: Systems failures, Human errors,  Malicious actions and Natural phenomena.   System failures continue to be the dominant root cause, accounting for just over half of  total trust services incidents reported (53%, around 20 incidents). Typically, system  failures are due to either hardware failures or software bugs.   Almost 39% of incidents were categorised as human errors.   Around 5% of the incidents were flagged as malicious actions.  We also keep track of third-party failures, i.e. when the incident really originated at a third party.  For 2020, 14% of incidents were flagged as third-party failures. All these third-party failures  were categorized as system failures. See figure nr. 6.  3 Note that three of the reported incidents were indicated as type D-Active threats or vulnerabilities and are not included in  the analysis  53%  of 2020 trust  services  incidents  reported have  System failures  as root cause  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  12  Figure 5: Root causes of TSP security incidents in 2020 Figure 6: Third party failures - 2020  3.2 DETAILED CAUSES  The two most common detailed causes of incidents were faulty software changes/updates and  software bugs. It is important to note that an incident is often not only triggered by one cause  but can involve multiple detailed causes (i.e. a chain of events). The third most common  detailed cause is flaws in the organization’s policy or procedures.  Figure 7: Detailed causes of trust services security incidents - 2020  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  13  3.3 TYPES OF TRUST SERVICES AFFECTED  Most of the reported incidents (69%) had an impact on electronic signatures (see the chart  below). Electronic seals were affected in about one tenth (11%) of all cases, as were electronic  timestamps (another 11%).  Figure 8: Impact of incidents - 2020  If we look back at the past four years of reporting, we see a similar pattern: 83% of the reported  incidents had an impact on electronic signature services, while 29% affected electronic seals  and 20% affected timestamping services.  For each incident we keep track of the underlying subservices affected. Most incidents impact  the generation of signatures/seals/timestamps (42%) or certificate management (47%)  Figure 9: Impact of incidents on subservices  Finally, we also keep track of the underlying assets affected by incidents. In most cases the assets  affected are the Certification Authority (CA) platform (33%) and the platform for the generation  and validation of signatures/seals platform (31%). See the impact on technical assets in the chart  below.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  14  Figure 10: Technical assets affected  3.4 QUALIFIED SERVICES VERSUS NON-QUALIFIED SERVICES  This year nearly 70% of total trust services security incidents had an impact on qualified  services (i.e. qualified signature certificate creation, qualified seal certificate creation, etc.), while  only a third of the incidents affected a non-qualified service. Again, it is important to note that  one incident report could involve multiple trust services, which explains why the percentages in  the graph 8 below add up to more than 100%.  Figure 11: Reported Incidents affecting Qualified v Non-qualified services  Note that in most cases, the TSP notifying an incident is also offering qualified services and that  in most cases the impact on non-qualified services is reported as part of an incident report for a  qualified trust service. This suggests that there is a gap in the reporting and that, while Article  19 is also concerned with non-qualified services, only the TSPs offering qualified trust services  are reporting incidents, and mostly do so concerning incidents that impact qualified services.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  15  4. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  2016-2020  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating trust services incident reports since 2016. In this  section, we look at multi-annual trends over the last 5 years, covering the period from 2016 to  2020. The total dataset contains 104 reported incidents.  4.1 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Over the last few years of trust services security incident reporting  ̶  as displayed in the graph  below  ̶  the most common root cause has been system failures. These add up to 68% over the  period since 2016. For this specific root cause, the most common detailed causes were  hardware failures (35%) and software bugs (33%).  Note that we observe the same pattern in electronic communication services4, where system  failures account for almost two thirds (67%) of total incidents (722 out of 1093 incidents).  Figure 12: Root cause categories  ̶ Trust services security incidents in the EU reported over 2016-  2020  Around a fifth of the reported incidents (18%) were caused by malicious actions and another  fifth were flagged as human errors.  In the trust services sector, natural phenomena are not a common root cause. In comparison,  the telecom sector is quite different because it has extensive over-the-ground IT infrastructure  which is vulnerable to natural phenomena such as storms.  4 See ENISA Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019  68%  of total trust  services  incidents  reported since  2016 have  hardware  failures (35%)  and software  bugs (33%) as  main root  causes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-report-telecom-security-incidents-2019  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  16  4.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN SEVERITY OF IMPACT  In the multi-annual trend concerning the severity of impact, the EU Cybersecurity incident  taxonomy is again followed where the severity of the impact has the following values: no impact,  minor, large and very large impact5.  While comparing the statistics for severity since 2016 (Graph 10 below), it is quite clear that the  number of incidents with large impacts is decreasing significantly although it was rather stable  for the previous four years. It is interesting to see that there was a rather linear increase in minor  incidents since last year.  This is again an indication that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to  trust services providers and also more effective; providers are reporting more incidents  regardless of their severity. In contrast to 2018, there were no very large (i.e. disastrous)  incidents during 2019 and 2020.  Figure 13: Severity of impact  ̶- Trust services security incidents in the EU reported over 2016-2020  5 See CG Publication 04/2018 - Cybersecurity incident taxonomy  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  17  5. CONCLUSIONS  We conclude with the main findings and some more general observations about this process  and the broader policy context.  MAIN FINDINGS   A steady lower level of severity confirms that TSPs are become more familiar with the  incident reporting process and that they are reporting more incidents, even if they are  less severe.   Qualified trust services versus non-qualified trust services: The ratio of reported  incidents concerning qualified trust services over non-qualified ones remains high. In  2020, 69% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services when compared  with approximately 33% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services. Although  non-qualified trust services are widely used, not so much effort is made by operators  on related incident reporting. In most cases, notifications are performed by a TSP  offering all types of services (qualified and non-qualified), reporting an incident that has  affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.   System failures (53%) remain the dominant root cause and the second most  dominant are human errors with 39%.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS   PDF signing vulnerabilities in 2020: in 2020 authorities discussed and reported on  several vulnerabilities with PDF signatures. In 2020, the so-called “shadow attacks”  emerged as a new class of attacks, where signed documents contain hidden content,  which an attacker can reveal after the document has been signed. These  vulnerabilities affect a wide range of software products. These vulnerabilities, which  are not under the control of a TSP and therefore can hardly be supervised, were  reported as type D-incidents/vulnerabilities during 2020.   Supervision of non-qualified services: The supervision of, and incident reporting by,  non-qualified services remains a concern. As already mentioned, non-qualified trust  services are widely used. A good example is website (TLS) certificates, which are a  staple of online/internet security. Globally around 80% of websites use web certificates.  The fact that under Article 19 there are hardly any reports about incidents with non-  qualified trust services suggests there is still under-reporting in this area, although one  MS reported 11 incidents during 2020.   EU policy changes: eIDAS regulations and eIDAS incident reporting have been in  place for more than four years now and eIDAS is currently under review. The  Commission will make a proposal for a revised eIDAS regulation in 2021. In 2020, the  Commission also made a proposal for a revised NIS Directive, i.e. NIS2, which  proposes the integration of eIDAS Article 19 to the NIS Directive. Both policy proposals  are expected to deliver important improvements. These policy changes present an  opportunity to address some of the gaps in policy, for example, the issue of supervision  of and reporting by the providers of non-qualified services. We look forward to  supporting the Commission and the EU Member States with implementing eIDAS  security incident reporting in an efficient and effective manner  T P  -0 5  -2 1  -2 2  9 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

CONCLUSIONS 17  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The EU’s eIDAS regulation (EU Regulation 910/2014) sets rules for electronic identity schemes  and trust services in Europe, national eID schemes, cross-border interoperability and  recognition. eIDAS was adopted in July 2014 and came into force in 2016. One of the goals of  eIDAS is to ensure that electronic signatures can have the same legal standing as traditional  signatures and to remove barriers to electronic commerce and all types  of electronic transactions in the EU. The eIDAS regulation aims to:   ensure that people and businesses can voluntarily use their own national electronic  identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services available online in other EU  countries.   create a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work  across borders and have the same legal status as their traditional paper-based  equivalents.  Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation sets out the security requirements for the trust service  providers (TSPs) and introduces mandatory security breach reporting for trust service providers  (TSPs) in the EU. The reporting obligations have three parts:   Trust service providers must notify security breaches that have a significant impact to  the national supervisory bodies.   The national supervisory bodies must inform each other and ENISA if there are  breaches which have an impact across borders.   Every year national supervisory bodies must send annual summary reports about the  notified breaches to ENISA and the Commission.  This report, the Annual Report Trust Services Security Incidents 2020, provides an aggregated  overview of the notified breaches for 2020, analysing root causes, statistics and trends. This  report marks the fifth round of security incident reporting for the EU’s trust services sector.  In this round of annual summary reporting a total of 27 EU countries and 2 EFTA countries took  part. They reported a total of 39 incidents.  KEY FINDINGS  We summarize the key findings from the 2020 incident reports:   A steady increase in notified incidents: in 2020 notified incidents increased by  around 18%. This suggests that authorities and TSPs are becoming more familiar with  the breach reporting process and their obligations under eIDAS.   The number of incidents with a large impact has dropped: in 2020 only 3 incidents  were characterized as having had a “large impact” as opposed to 2019 when 10 such  incidents had been reported (translating into approximately 60% decrease).  Τhe ratio of reported incidents concerning qualified and non-qualified trust services  remains high: in 2020, 69% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services  compared to approximately 33% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services (with some  incidents  touching both categories.  2020  HIGHLIGHTS  The number of  notified incidents is  steadily increasing.  The number of  incidents with large  impacts has dropped.  System failures  account for more  than half of incidents  and have been the  dominant root cause  for the last four years  of incident reporting.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  4  Although non-qualified trust services are widely used by citizens and enterprises, it seems that  the respective trust services operators do not make much effort to report related incidents. In  most cases, the notification is done by a TSP that also offers qualified services, reporting an  incident that has affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.  The impact on subservices is mainly divided between certificate management (47% of the  incidents) and certificate generation (42% of the incidents).  Approximately 66% (26 incidents) of the reported incidents were rated as minor  compared to 2019 when 60% (19 incidents) were rated as having had only a minor  impact. Only one incident had a very large (disastrous) impact, and only three incidents  had a large impact. Furthermore, a significant increase in minor incidents has been  observed, indicating that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to  the providers and they are reporting more incidents regardless of their severity.  Figure 1: Severity of impact - Trust services security incidents in the EU reported over 2016-2020  ENISA publishes detailed statistics about trust services security incidents in an online visual  tool, CIRAS Visual. This tool allows for custom analysis of trends and patterns1.  Currently the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament are  discussing policy changes. Last year the Commission proposed to integrate Article 19, the  security requirements for TSPs into a revised NIS Directive. The goal of this Commission  proposal, the NIS2 proposal, is to simplify EU cybersecurity legislation and to ensure that there  is a similar approach across the different sectors, including the telecom sector and the trust  services sector, which are currently addressed under separate pieces of legislation. This year  the Commission will also make a proposal for a new eIDAS regulation.  ENISA will continue to support national supervisory bodies with the implementation of breach  reporting under Article 19 of eIDAS and to work towards making this process efficient and  effective, yielding useful data, for the supervising bodies, for the national authorities, as well as  for the trust service providers and the organisations relying on these trust services  1 See https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-  analysis/visual-tool  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/incident-reporting/cybersecurity-incident-report-and-analysis-system-visual-analysis/visual-tool  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  5  1. INTRODUCTION  Under Article 19 of the eIDAS Regulation2, Trust Service Providers (TSPs) in the EU are  expected to notify the national supervisory bodies in their country about security incidents. On  an annual basis, the supervisory bodies send summaries of these incident reports to ENISA.  Subsequently, ENISA publishes an aggregated overview of the reported security incidents.  This document gives an aggregate overview of the security incident reports submitted by the  supervisory bodies during 2020. This annual report marks the fifth round of security incident  reporting in the EU’s trust services sector, covering security incidents during 2020.  1.1 SCOPE  Incidents reported by authorities under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation  1.2 TARGET AUDIENCE  Experts at national authorities, experts in the sector  1.3 CONTENT  This document is structured as follows: in section 2, the policy context is briefly summarized as  is the underlying eIDAS reporting framework and an overview of the types of incidents reported  is provided by anonymized examples. In Section 3, further elaboration of the reported incidents  is given, by presenting the categories of root causes, the detailed causes, and the affected  services. In section 4, the multi-annual trends in incidents over the years 2016-2020 are  highlighted. In Section 5, conclusions and observations based on the available data are drawn.  1.4 DISCLAIMER  This document only contains aggregated and anonymized information about incidents and does  not include details about individual countries or individual trust service providers. Detailed  discussions about the reported security incidents take place in the ENISA Article 19 expert  group, which is an informal group of experts from national supervisory bodies focusing on the  practical implementation of Article 19. The group is currently chaired by a representative from  RTR, the Austrian regulatory authority. ENISA acts as the secretariat and supports the group  with analysis, drafting, logistics, etc.  2 Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification  and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC, can be consulted at  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2014/910/oj  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  6  2. INCIDENT REPORTING  FRAMEWORK  In this section, we give an overview of the formats and procedures for the reporting of incidents  (breaches) under Article 19 of the eIDAS regulation.  2.1 OVERVIEW OF INCIDENT REPORTING PROCESS  The mandatory security breach notification process has three steps as displayed in the figure  below:  1. Trust service providers notify their national supervisory body about security breaches  that have significant impact.  2. National supervisory bodies inform each other and ENISA if there is a cross-border  impact.  3. National supervisory bodies send annual summary reports about the notified breaches  to ENISA and the Commission.  Figure 2: Incident reporting under article 19 of eIDAS regulation  EIDAS  ARTICLE 19  requires trust service  providers in the EU to  1) assess risks;  2) take appropriate  security measures to  mitigate security  breaches;  3) notify breaches to  national supervisory  bodies.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  7  2.2 INCIDENT REPORTING TOOL  Experts from the national authorities have access to the ENISA CIRAS incident reporting tool,  where they can upload incident reports and search for and study specific incidents.  For the public, ENISA also offers an online visual tool, which is publicly accessible and can be  used for custom analysis of the data. This tool anonymizes the country or operator involved.  CIRAS  is a free online tool where ENISA stores reported  incidents and provides annual and multiannual  statistics: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/ciras  We briefly introduce the reporting template. The template starts with a type selector and contains  three parts:  1. Impact of the incident - which trust services are impacted and by how much.  2. Nature of the incident - what caused the incident?  3. Details about the incident - detailed information about the incident, a short description,  the types of services, the types of assets, the severity level etc.  Figure 3: eIDAS Article 19 incident reporting types   Type A: Service outage (e.g. continuity, availability). For example, an outage caused by  a cable cut due to a mistake by the operator of an excavation machine used for building  a new road would be categorised as a type A incident.   Type B: Other impact on service (e.g. confidentiality, authenticity, integrity). For  example, a popular collaboration tool has not encrypted the content of the media  channels, which are being established when a session is started, between the endpoints  participating in the shared session. This leads to the interception of the media (voice,  pictures, video, files, etc.) through a man-in-the-middle attack. This incident would be  categorised as a type B incident.   Type C: Impact on other systems (e.g. ransomware in an office network, no impact on  the service). For example, a malware has been detected on several workstations and  servers of the office network of a telecom provider. This incident would be categorised  as a type C incident.   Type D: Threat or vulnerability (e.g. discovery of crypto flaw). For instance, the discovery  of a cryptographic weakness would be categorised as a type D incident.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  8   Type E: Impact on redundancy (e.g. failover or backup system). For example, the  breaking of one of two redundant submarine cables would be categorised as a type E  incident.   Type F: Near-miss incident (e.g. activation of security measures). For instance, a  malicious attempt that ends up in the honeypot network of a telecom provider would be  categorised as a type F incident.  Depending on the type selected, some fields in the template are deactivated. For example, in the  case of a Type A incident the fields “threat severity factors” and “severity of threat” are not active.  2.3 ANONYMIZED EXAMPLES OF SECURITY INCIDENTS  In this section we present some of the kinds of incidents that are reported, by providing several  detailed and anonymized examples.  Incident example 1  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature  Root cause System failure  Technical causes Faulty software change/update  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform  Comment Unavailability of the eSignature service due to an outage of the  front-end application component  Incident example 2  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected System failure  Root cause Faulty software change/update  Technical causes Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform  Assets affected Unavailability of the eSignature service due to an outage of the  front-end application component  Comment eSignature  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  9  Incident example 3  Incident type A-Core service outage  Service affected eSignature, eTimestamps  Root cause Natural phenomena  Technical causes Natural phenomena  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform, Time  Stamping Authority (TSA) platform, Validation Authority (VA)  platform  Comment Consequences of heavy rain caused unavailability of registers and  information systems. Synchronisation with redundant hardware of  information systems was also disturbed. Additional sealing means  was installed.  Incident example 4  Incident type B-Other impact on core service  Service affected eSignature  Root cause Malicious action  Technical causes Tampering of personal data, theft or loss of data  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform, Time  Stamping Authority (TSA) platform, Validation Authority (VA)  platform  Comment The incident concerns the creation of a qualified certificate  following a phishing attack and the creation of a false identity  through online banking. The certificate was used only once to sign  the terms and conditions for opening an account in another bank.  That bank has been warned and closed the account. The qualified  certificate has been revoked.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  10  Incident example 5  Incident type D-Active threat or vulnerability  Service affected PDF signing  Root cause Malicious action, third party failure  Technical causes Vulnerability inherent to document format  Assets affected Generation and validation of signatures/seals platform, Time  Stamping Authority (TSA) platform, Validation Authority (VA)  platform  Comment Signed PDF files can be manipulated in a way that they look  different to the signatory than to relying parties (shadow attacks,  https://www.pdf-insecurity.org/). Signing services and validation  services are not affected. The vulnerability has been resolved by  issuing new versions of PDF viewers. Recommendations for  signatories by TSPs have been updated accordingly.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  11  3. INCIDENT ANALYSIS  The 2020 annual summary reporting, by the 27 EU Member States and 2 EFTA countries  participating in this process, included in total 39 security incidents3. This is the fifth round of annual  summary reporting, since eIDAS came into force on the 1st of July 2016.  Figure 4: Number of incidents per year  There is a steady increase in the number of incidents reported which, over the years, leans  towards becoming linear. This suggests that TSPs are becoming more familiar with the process.  3.1 ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  The figure nr. 5 shows the distribution of the incidents according to their underlying root cause.  We categorize incidents into four categories of root causes: Systems failures, Human errors,  Malicious actions and Natural phenomena.   System failures continue to be the dominant root cause, accounting for just over half of  total trust services incidents reported (53%, around 20 incidents). Typically, system  failures are due to either hardware failures or software bugs.   Almost 39% of incidents were categorised as human errors.   Around 5% of the incidents were flagged as malicious actions.  We also keep track of third-party failures, i.e. when the incident really originated at a third party.  For 2020, 14% of incidents were flagged as third-party failures. All these third-party failures  were categorized as system failures. See figure nr. 6.  3 Note that three of the reported incidents were indicated as type D-Active threats or vulnerabilities and are not included in  the analysis  53%  of 2020 trust  services  incidents  reported have  System failures  as root cause  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  12  Figure 5: Root causes of TSP security incidents in 2020 Figure 6: Third party failures - 2020  3.2 DETAILED CAUSES  The two most common detailed causes of incidents were faulty software changes/updates and  software bugs. It is important to note that an incident is often not only triggered by one cause  but can involve multiple detailed causes (i.e. a chain of events). The third most common  detailed cause is flaws in the organization’s policy or procedures.  Figure 7: Detailed causes of trust services security incidents - 2020  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  13  3.3 TYPES OF TRUST SERVICES AFFECTED  Most of the reported incidents (69%) had an impact on electronic signatures (see the chart  below). Electronic seals were affected in about one tenth (11%) of all cases, as were electronic  timestamps (another 11%).  Figure 8: Impact of incidents - 2020  If we look back at the past four years of reporting, we see a similar pattern: 83% of the reported  incidents had an impact on electronic signature services, while 29% affected electronic seals  and 20% affected timestamping services.  For each incident we keep track of the underlying subservices affected. Most incidents impact  the generation of signatures/seals/timestamps (42%) or certificate management (47%)  Figure 9: Impact of incidents on subservices  Finally, we also keep track of the underlying assets affected by incidents. In most cases the assets  affected are the Certification Authority (CA) platform (33%) and the platform for the generation  and validation of signatures/seals platform (31%). See the impact on technical assets in the chart  below.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  14  Figure 10: Technical assets affected  3.4 QUALIFIED SERVICES VERSUS NON-QUALIFIED SERVICES  This year nearly 70% of total trust services security incidents had an impact on qualified  services (i.e. qualified signature certificate creation, qualified seal certificate creation, etc.), while  only a third of the incidents affected a non-qualified service. Again, it is important to note that  one incident report could involve multiple trust services, which explains why the percentages in  the graph 8 below add up to more than 100%.  Figure 11: Reported Incidents affecting Qualified v Non-qualified services  Note that in most cases, the TSP notifying an incident is also offering qualified services and that  in most cases the impact on non-qualified services is reported as part of an incident report for a  qualified trust service. This suggests that there is a gap in the reporting and that, while Article  19 is also concerned with non-qualified services, only the TSPs offering qualified trust services  are reporting incidents, and mostly do so concerning incidents that impact qualified services.  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  15  4. MULTI-ANNUAL TRENDS  2016-2020  ENISA has been collecting and aggregating trust services incident reports since 2016. In this  section, we look at multi-annual trends over the last 5 years, covering the period from 2016 to  2020. The total dataset contains 104 reported incidents.  4.1 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN ROOT CAUSE CATEGORIES  Over the last few years of trust services security incident reporting  ̶  as displayed in the graph  below  ̶  the most common root cause has been system failures. These add up to 68% over the  period since 2016. For this specific root cause, the most common detailed causes were  hardware failures (35%) and software bugs (33%).  Note that we observe the same pattern in electronic communication services4, where system  failures account for almost two thirds (67%) of total incidents (722 out of 1093 incidents).  Figure 12: Root cause categories  ̶ Trust services security incidents in the EU reported over 2016-  2020  Around a fifth of the reported incidents (18%) were caused by malicious actions and another  fifth were flagged as human errors.  In the trust services sector, natural phenomena are not a common root cause. In comparison,  the telecom sector is quite different because it has extensive over-the-ground IT infrastructure  which is vulnerable to natural phenomena such as storms.  4 See ENISA Annual Report Telecom Security Incidents 2019  68%  of total trust  services  incidents  reported since  2016 have  hardware  failures (35%)  and software  bugs (33%) as  main root  causes  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/annual-report-telecom-security-incidents-2019  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  16  4.2 MULTI-ANNUAL TREND IN SEVERITY OF IMPACT  In the multi-annual trend concerning the severity of impact, the EU Cybersecurity incident  taxonomy is again followed where the severity of the impact has the following values: no impact,  minor, large and very large impact5.  While comparing the statistics for severity since 2016 (Graph 10 below), it is quite clear that the  number of incidents with large impacts is decreasing significantly although it was rather stable  for the previous four years. It is interesting to see that there was a rather linear increase in minor  incidents since last year.  This is again an indication that the incident reporting mechanism has become more familiar to  trust services providers and also more effective; providers are reporting more incidents  regardless of their severity. In contrast to 2018, there were no very large (i.e. disastrous)  incidents during 2019 and 2020.  Figure 13: Severity of impact  ̶- Trust services security incidents in the EU reported over 2016-2020  5 See CG Publication 04/2018 - Cybersecurity incident taxonomy  http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=53646  TRUST SERVICES SECURITY INCIDENTS 2020  July 2021  17  5. CONCLUSIONS  We conclude with the main findings and some more general observations about this process  and the broader policy context.  MAIN FINDINGS   A steady lower level of severity confirms that TSPs are become more familiar with the  incident reporting process and that they are reporting more incidents, even if they are  less severe.   Qualified trust services versus non-qualified trust services: The ratio of reported  incidents concerning qualified trust services over non-qualified ones remains high. In  2020, 69% of total incidents had an impact on qualified trust services when compared  with approximately 33% of incidents reported on non-qualified trust services. Although  non-qualified trust services are widely used, not so much effort is made by operators  on related incident reporting. In most cases, notifications are performed by a TSP  offering all types of services (qualified and non-qualified), reporting an incident that has  affected both their qualified and non-qualified services.   System failures (53%) remain the dominant root cause and the second most  dominant are human errors with 39%.  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS   PDF signing vulnerabilities in 2020: in 2020 authorities discussed and reported on  several vulnerabilities with PDF signatures. In 2020, the so-called “shadow attacks”  emerged as a new class of attacks, where signed documents contain hidden content,  which an attacker can reveal after the document has been signed. These  vulnerabilities affect a wide range of software products. These vulnerabilities, which  are not under the control of a TSP and therefore can hardly be supervised, were  reported as type D-incidents/vulnerabilities during 2020.   Supervision of non-qualified services: The supervision of, and incident reporting by,  non-qualified services remains a concern. As already mentioned, non-qualified trust  services are widely used. A good example is website (TLS) certificates, which are a  staple of online/internet security. Globally around 80% of websites use web certificates.  The fact that under Article 19 there are hardly any reports about incidents with non-  qualified trust services suggests there is still under-reporting in this area, although one  MS reported 11 incidents during 2020.   EU policy changes: eIDAS regulations and eIDAS incident reporting have been in  place for more than four years now and eIDAS is currently under review. The  Commission will make a proposal for a revised eIDAS regulation in 2021. In 2020, the  Commission also made a proposal for a revised NIS Directive, i.e. NIS2, which  proposes the integration of eIDAS Article 19 to the NIS Directive. Both policy proposals  are expected to deliver important improvements. These policy changes present an  opportunity to address some of the gaps in policy, for example, the issue of supervision  of and reporting by the providers of non-qualified services. We look forward to  supporting the Commission and the EU Member States with implementing eIDAS  security incident reporting in an efficient and effective manner  T P  -0 5  -2 1  -2 2  9 -E  N -N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

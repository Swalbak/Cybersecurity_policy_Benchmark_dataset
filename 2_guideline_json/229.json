The “Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework”  proposes a methodology for assessing the potential interoperability of risk management (RM)  frameworks and methods and presents related results. The methods included in this report have  been selected as prominent, based on their interoperability features, after evaluating an  extended list of risk management frameworks and methods (included in the Compendium of  Risk Management Frameworks with Potential Interoperability, ENISA, January 2002) which has  been published as Supplement to the Interoperable EU Risk Management.  The “Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework” describes and evaluates the  interoperability features for prominent risk management frameworks and methods, by employing  a four-level scale to evaluate their interoperability level. The features assessed to evaluate the  interoperability level include the approach used by the RM method (i.e. to whether it is asset- based or scenario-based), whether risk assessment is quantitative or qualitative, as  well as other characteristics such as the use of asset taxonomies, valuation methods, the  cataloguing of threats and vulnerabilities, the method of risk calculation etc. It also provides an  overview of possible collaborative combinations between them.  The update of “Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework” was based on desktop  research and analysis, which resulted in:  • Identifying new risk management methods, which were evaluated with regard to their  interoperability potential and included in the ““Interoperable EU Risk Management  Framework”. These are the following:  o SERIMA  o CIRCULAR CSSF 20/750  • Updating the features and evaluation of the following RM methods which were already  included in the Framework:  o MONARC  o ITSRM²  o THE OPEN GROUP STANDARD, RISK ANALYSIS  Finally, no updates were identified for the following:  o ISO/IEC 27005:2018  o NIST SP 800-37  o NIST SP 800-30  o NIST SP 800-39  o BSI STANDARD 200-2  o OCTAVE-S  o OCTAVE ALLEGRO  o OCTAVE FORTE  o ETSI TS 102 165-1(TVRA)  o EBIOS Risk Manager  o MAGERIT v.3  o MEHARI  o GUIDELINES ON CYBER SECURITY ONBOARD SHIPS  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE  This report presents an updated analysis of the interoperability features of prominent RM  frameworks and methodologies, as this was initially presented in the Interoperable EU Risk  Management Framework published by ΕNISA in January 2022, along with the method  followed to determine their interoperability potential. A presentation and brief description of the  RM methods is provided in the “Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks”1 .  The updated version of the Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework presented in this  report includes a) new RM methods, and b) newer versions of already identified RM frameworks  and methods. A detailed evaluation regarding the potential for interoperability of the RM  frameworks, based on their features and an evaluation model, is also included.  The  corresponding results show the potential for forming a coherent RM framework through various  possible combinations of the features of the aforementioned frameworks.  The detailed analysis of the RM frameworks and methodologies, the methodology used to  evaluate them and the results of this process, aim at the provision of a clear outcome in regard  to potentially forming a coherent RM framework that could support information risk management  in different organisations and sectors across EU.  The methodology for evaluating the interoperability potential of different RM methods upon  which the Interoperable Framework is based, was the result of meticulous research and  analysis carried out by professionals involved in both the academic sector and  organisations that engage in RM-related activities and research, informed by the comments,  recommendations and insights provided by key stakeholders. The output of this work is a  method for evaluating the potential for interoperability of different RM frameworks and tools,  along with the results of this evaluation, for a list of prominent RM methods.  1.2 DEFINITION OF ACRONYMS  The acronyms used in this document and recurring definitions are listed below.

METHOD OF WORK  The methodology for assessing the interoperability of risk management frameworks and  methodologies, mainly draws on assessment models. Gilsinn and Schierholz (2010) developed  an assessment model for information assurance for a given information technology, which  comprises seven features (e.g. access control, resource availability) that are relevant to  information assurance. Using those features the assessment model classifies a given  technology into four levels of increasing security (i.e. protection against casual or coincidental  violation, protection against intentional violation using simple means, protection against  intentional violation using sophisticated means, protection against intentional violation using  sophisticated means with extended resources).  In another example, ENISA (2016) developed an assessment model to assess the readiness of  information technology (and specifically privacy-enhancing technologies). The model identifies  nine features that are relevant to the quality and readiness of an information technology (i.e.,  Protection, Trust assumptions, Side effects, Reliability, Performance efficiency, Operability,  Maintainability, Transferability and Scope). Each technology receives a grade for each feature  using a five-level scale (very poor, poor, satisfactory, good, very good). Depending on the  assessment of each feature, the model classifies a given privacy-enhancing technology into one  of six levels (Idea, Research, Proof-of-concept, Pilot, Product, Outdated).  In this chapter we describe the features that we identified as relevant for the assessment of the  interoperability features of risk management frameworks and methodologies. Further, for the  functional features we describe a four-level scale to evaluate the interoperability level of each  RM framework. Finally, we propose a three-level scale for the potential interoperability for each  framework and for combined features.  2.1 FEATURES OF INTEROPERABILITY  The risk management area is characterised by a plethora of frameworks, methodologies and  methods, each of them with their own characteristics and following their own approach in  managing risks. During the risk management lifecycle, practitioners might want to reuse  information provided by other methodologies or consider comparing results among frameworks.  This typically requires the methodologies to be able to share information and therefore provide  capabilities for interoperability.  There is no single definition of interoperability in the literature, as this is a generic term that can  be applied to many sectors and disciplines. As such, it strongly depends on the context in which  it is applied, satisfying its peculiarities and specific demands. In the ICT sector, interoperability  is considered as the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and  to use the information that has been exchanged.  ISO/IEC 2382 defines interoperability as the capability to communicate, execute programs, or  transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or  no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units.  The IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary also places emphasis on the required effort thus  defining interoperability as the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or  products without special effort on the part of the customer. This definition is also adopted by  ISO 23903 regarding interoperability in the health sector.  The European Interoperability Framework defines interoperability as “the ability of organisations  to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  8  between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the  exchange of data between their ICT systems.  Considering the above definitions as well as the structure of management frameworks for cyber  risks and the targets of their individual functional characteristics, the interoperability of risk  management frameworks and methodologies can be defined as the ability of a risk  management component or methods to reuse information provided by the risk management  components or methods of other frameworks with equal ease and with the same interfaces,  towards the same goals.  A risk management framework or methodology should address at least the following phases  (ISO 27005, EU ITSRM) which can be considered as its main functional components:  • Risk Identification (Assets, Threats and Vulnerabilities)  • Risk Assessment (Risk Calculation and Evaluation),  • Risk Treatment (Selection and Implementation of Security Controls, and Calculation of  Residual Risk),  • Risk Monitoring (Assess effectiveness of measures and monitor risks).  From the above functional components, Risk Monitoring is a process that, although essential for  efficient risk management, is independent of the rest of the phases and can typically be  conducted using any assessment methodology, process or tool. As such, it is considered  outside the scope of this report which focuses on the other three phases instead, i.e. Risk  Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment.  Overall, there are many characteristics (governance, compliance, privacy) that constitute  integral parts of risk frameworks but not all of them affect interoperability. Considering the  aforementioned definition and the above functional components, we could argue that  interoperability in risk management can be achieved if these components can be addressed by  the components of other frameworks, with similar effectiveness and ease. This essentially  means that interoperability can be achieved at various levels, and we will consider the  functional and non-functional characteristics of the evaluated frameworks.  As such, regarding the functional characteristics, the interoperability between risk  management frameworks can be evaluated against the following levels: Generic aspects, Risk  Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment, which are further analysed to a set of  features that typically stem from the above functional components.  • Generic aspects: At this aspect we consider some generic features of the  frameworks, which are:  o Asset based or Scenario based: this indicates whether a risk management  framework or methodology adopts an asset-based approach or is guided by a  risk scenario. These approaches could be combined. Therefore, our analysis  includes frameworks or methodologies that distinctly follow either an asset-  based or a scenario-based approach, as well as methodologies that adopt  both or a combination of these approaches.  o Quantitative or Qualitative: this indicates whether the risk management  framework or methodology adopts a risk assessment method that is based on  quantitative or qualitative criteria. This does not exclude a third category that  is used for risk assessment, the semi-quantitative method, in which case the  method examined is categorised as either quantitative or qualitative,  whichever is closer.  • Risk Identification: risk management frameworks are considered interoperable if they  can use each other’s asset taxonomy and valuation, threat and vulnerability  catalogues, with equivalent results and without negatively affecting subsequent steps.  At this level we consider the following features:  o Asset Taxonomy: it indicates whether the framework or methodology  requires the use of a specific asset taxonomy.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  9  o Asset Valuation: it indicates whether the framework or methodology requires  the use of a specific asset valuation method.  o Threat catalogues: these indicate whether the framework or methodology  requires the use of a specific set of threats.  o Vulnerability catalogues: these indicate whether the framework or  methodology requires the use of a specific catalogue of vulnerabilities.  • Risk Assessment: risk management frameworks are considered interoperable if they  use the same methodology for risk assessment, or their methods can provide results  that can be easily mapped to the results of other frameworks. At this level we consider  the following features:  o Risk Calculation method: it provides information about the method used for  risk calculation. e.g. Risk = Impact x Likelihood; Risk = Impact x Threat  Likelihood x Vulnerability Level.  • Risk Treatment: risk management frameworks are considered interoperable if they  result in the same set of measures or a set of measures with an equal contribution to  reducing levels of risk. At this level we consider the following features:  o Measures catalogue: it indicates whether the framework or methodology  requires the use of a specific catalogue of measures. If so, it also considers  whether the two catalogues can be mapped to each other.  o Residual Risk Calculation: it considers the chosen measures to evaluate  the remaining levels of risk. This process is typically affected by both the risk  calculation method and the impact of the chosen security measure(s) on a  risk scenario.  Non-functional characteristics that can also be used for assessing the interoperability of risk  management frameworks include:  • Supported languages: An English version of the methodology is an advantage.  • Compliance with other risk-related frameworks (e.g. ISO 27005). Such compliance is  likely to promote interoperability among frameworks.  • Risk Management Life-Cycle Coverage: the level of coverage of the above  functional components of a risk management framework.  • Licensing costs that might hinder interoperability.  The overall interoperability potential of risk management frameworks and methodologies will  be evaluated using a weighted approach on some of the above aspects of interoperability since  some of them might prohibit the interoperability of the frameworks, while others might simply  hinder it. For example, language issues are considered an obstacle that can be bypassed, while  different approaches in risk calculation will not allow the two frameworks to use components of  the other’s method.  Similarly, some of the above features are considered to be exclusive, i.e. if the feature is not  satisfied then interoperability cannot be achieved at any of the aforementioned levels. Such  exclusive features are the ‘Asset based or Scenario-based’ and ‘Quantitative or Qualitative’  based features.  A framework or methodology that does not require, define or dictate specific methods for the  above functional components is obviously considered highly interoperable. Such frameworks  can accommodate risk management components from various methods. For example, the NIST  800-37 risk management framework can typically use any threats, vulnerabilities and catalogue  of measures, and can accommodate any method for calculating the risk. In this respect, it is  considered a highly interoperable framework. Similarly, BSI Standard 200-2 (IT-Grunschutz  Methodology) integrates components from the IT-Grundschutz Compendium, and specifically  accommodates the asset typology, the threat list and the catalogue of controls.  If a methodology has strict requirements regarding the above functional components, its  interoperability is bound to be restricted. For example, if risk assessment is tightly coupled with  a specific threat or vulnerability catalogue, its ability to adopt an alternative catalogue provided  by another method, is restricted.  On the other hand, risk management methodologies that do require following specific,  predefined characteristics (e.g. an asset taxonomy or a calculation method) could provide a  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  10  high potential for interoperability if these characteristics are described in detail so that other  methodologies or frameworks can accommodate them.  2.2 INTEROPERABILITY EVALUATION MODEL  2.2.1 Methodology and levels of interoperability  For the evaluation of potential interoperability among risk management frameworks and  methodologies, we initially consider the inherent level of interoperability of the framework or  methodology regarding functional features. This shows whether a specific framework allows  interoperability with other frameworks with regards to these specific features. Regarding the  features that contribute to the interoperability of the identification, estimation and treatment of  risk, a four-level scale was used:  • Non Applicable: the framework or methodology does not use or support this feature.  • Low Level of Interoperability: the framework or methodology requires a proprietary  solution for this feature, provided by the framework itself.  • Medium Level of Interoperability: the framework or methodology provides details but  are not compulsory, and therefore the proposed solution is modifiable.  • High Level of Interoperability: the framework or methodology uses this feature, but it  either does not provide any suggestions or it can adopt the features of a third  framework, e.g. a standardised or a proprietary solution.  We have applied this evaluation methodology for the functional requirements and specifically for  the following features:  • Risk Identification  o Asset Taxonomy  o Asset Evaluation  o Threat Catalogues  o Vulnerability Catalogues  • Risk Calculation  • Risk Treatment  o Measure Catalogues  o Calculation of Residual Risk  To evaluate the potential interoperability of each risk management framework or  methodology, we first determine the level of interoperability of the Risk Identification, Risk  Calculation and Risk Treatment functional components. More specifically, the following Table  provides the main parameters that are evaluated for each functional characteristic of the risk  management framework or methodology.  Table 1: Parameters evaluated for each functional characteristic  Characteristics  Parameters to Check  Asset  Taxonomy  Does the framework or methodology use or describe specific categories of  assets?  Is the taxonomy used modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new categories of assets or import taxonomies from  other sources?  Asset  Valuation  Does the framework or methodology use or describe specific guidelines for the  valuation of assets (i.e. scale and criteria for assessment of asset value and  impact)?  Are the proposed scales or criteria modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new scales or criteria?  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  11  Characteristics  Parameters to Check  Threat  Catalogues  Does the framework or methodology use or describe specific threat catalogues  and/or threat categories?  Are the proposed threat catalogues and/or threat categories modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new threats and/or threat categories and import them  from other sources?  Vulnerability  Catalogues  Does the framework or methodology describe specific vulnerability catalogues  and/or categories of vulnerabilities?  Are the proposed vulnerability catalogues and/or categories of vulnerabilities  modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new vulnerabilities and/or categories of vulnerabilities  and import them from other sources?  Risk  Calculation  Does the framework or methodology describe specific guidelines for the  calculation of risk (i.e. formulas, scale, matrix)?  Is the proposed calculation method modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce or import (from other sources) new methods of  calculation?  Measure  Catalogues &  Calculation of  Residual Risk  Does the framework or methodology describe specific control catalogues  and/or  categories of controls?  Are the proposed control catalogues and/or categories of controls modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new controls and/or categories of controls and import  them from other sources?  Is the Calculation of Residual Risk (either on a Calculation of Residual Risk  formula or on an Impact of Measures formula) modifiable?  Based on the information collected and on how the aforementioned parameters were satisfied  or not, we estimate the level of interoperability (No interoperability, Low, Medium or High level of  interoperability) for each functional component (Risk Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk  Treatment) for each risk management framework or methodology.  The higher the level of interoperability that a functional component holds, the more likely it is  that the framework is interoperable with other frameworks regarding a specific feature or  functionality (i.e. combined features).  As an example, a risk assessment framework regarding the feature ‘Vulnerability Catalogues’,  will be evaluated as shown next.  • Non applicable, if the framework does not use vulnerabilities in the calculation of risk,  hence interoperability with another framework, such as using another framework’s  catalogues as provided, is not applicable.  • Low Level of Interoperability, if the framework or methodology uses a proprietary  vulnerability catalogue that cannot be modified or replaced by another one.  • Medium Level of Interoperability: if the framework or methodology uses a  proprietary catalogue of vulnerabilities that can be modified.  • High Level of Interoperability: if the framework uses a proprietary vulnerability  catalogue that can be modified and that can also accommodate other catalogues, and  also where the framework or methodology might not use a proprietary vulnerability  catalogue but can accommodate any other catalogue.  2.2.2 Scoring model for potential interoperability  After assessing the level of interoperability that each framework holds for each functional  feature, we also evaluated the collective potential for interoperability for features that when  combined result in specific functional components (e.g. risk identification). Specifically, for risk  identification, we combined the assessment of the levels of interoperability regarding the  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  12  features of Asset Taxonomy, Asset Valuation, Threat Catalogues and Vulnerability Catalogues.  Then to calculate the potential interoperability of the Risk Identification functional component of  a given risk management framework or methodology, we applied the following weighting  factors:  • Asset Taxonomy, Weighting factor: 30%  • Asset Valuation, Weighting factor: 50%  • Threat Catalogues, Weighting factor: 10%  • Vulnerability Catalogues, Weighting factor: 10%  Thus, the interoperability potential for the Risk Identification functional component will be:  • 30% * Interoperability Level for Asset Taxonomy +  • 50% * Interoperability Level for Asset Valuation +  • 10% * Interoperability Level for Threat Catalogues +  • 10% * Interoperability Level for Vulnerability Catalogues.  The above weights reflect the importance of each functional feature for the potential  interoperability of the framework or methodology in relation to the rest of the functional features,  as evaluated by the security experts who compose the project team (i.e. practical and research  knowledge).  The potential interoperability of a given framework in terms of Risk Assessment and of the Risk  Treatment process, is equal to their assessed levels of interoperability.  The fact that the potential interoperability for the Risk Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk  Treatment process is presented separately, serves someone’s need to interact with a  framework only within one of the three distinct functional components. For example, it is  possible that a framework could have a high potential for interoperability for risk identification  but not for the risk treatment process.  Finally, the overall potential interoperability of a Risk Management framework is calculated as  the average of the interoperability potentials calculated for the Risk Identification, Risk  Calculation and Risk Treatment functional components of the framework.

RESULTS  3.1 ANALYSIS OF LEVEL OF INTEROPERABILITY FOR EACH RISK  MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND FEATURE  The following table presents the application of the methodology for the evaluation of identified  risk assessment frameworks and methodologies. Each framework or methodology is assessed  regarding all features and the resulting scores. Justifications are given in the following figures.  Note that not all available risk management solutions are analysed in this chapter which instead  focuses on well-established and recognised frameworks and methodologies that exhibit the  characteristics of a risk management solution, and that have also been identified, after an initial  screening, to have the potential to interoperate with other frameworks or methodologies.  Thus, a total of 18 methodologies of various types were analysed. Eleven of them are asset- based while four are considered as scenario-based, while the remaining three bear both asset- based and scenario-based characteristics.  Figure 1: Asset-based Scenario-based  Similarly, the subset of methods of analyse included both quantitative (only 2 out of 18) and  qualitative (11 out of 18) methodologies, while 5 of them have the characteristics of both  categories.  Figure 2: Quantitative vs Qualitative  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  14  Regarding the potential interoperability of the methods that were analysed, all of them appear to  be highly interoperable on threats and measures, hence allowing the adoption of additional  catalogues provided by other methods or the alteration of their existing ones. Three of the  methodologies analysed do not consider vulnerabilities in their approach to risk assessment.  Moreover, 11 of the 18 methodologies are considered highly interoperable with respect to their  approach to risk calculation and therefore more open to the adoption of alternatives, while 7 out  of the 18 methodologies allow modification of the proposed method of risk calculation, typically  in term of the scales that are used. The levels of interoperability of the methodologies analysed  are summarised in the following table.

INTEGRATION OF  INTEROPERABILITY IN THE  RM PROCESSES BASED ON  ITSRM2  Based on the analysis of RM frameworks and methodologies performed in in accompanying  “Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks”3, two RM frameworks provide a thorough  description of the typical RM processes, covering the overall RM lifecycle. These are ISO 27005  and ITSRM2.  In this Chapter we provide recommendations regarding interoperability for the ENISA Work  Programme for 2022 and thereafter in the area of Risk Management (RM), using ITSRM2 as a  reference framework. The rationale behind this choice is that ITSRM2 is process-oriented and  offers a detailed presentation of the inputs and outputs for each RM process, providing us with  the grounding needed to discuss the recommendations for opportunities in interoperability.  Figure 4 presents the ITSRM2 RM processes.  Figure 4: The ITSRM2 processes  Before initiating the analysis for each RM process, one high-level recommendation for the  facilitation of interoperability concerns the terminology. In particular, the problem exists in two  cases: 1) using the same (English) term with different meanings, or 2) translating a term,  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  28  usually from the language in which the RM framework was developed, into other languages. In  both cases, interoperability is hindered.  Therefore, we recommend working towards a: Common terminology and translation of  terms in the languages of MS and supporting their integration into the RM frameworks. Next,  we identify recommendations across the RM processes based on ITSRM2.  4.1 PROCESS P1 SYSTEM SECURITY CHARACTERISATION  4.1.1 Description of process  The purpose of the System Security Characterisation process is to gather initial information  concerning the system and its context, which will be used for the rest of the RM processes. The  output of this process includes a high-level description of the system and the organisation, the  contact points for security roles, any constraints for security requirements and any mandatory  security measures that result from these requirements. This process is mapped with the ISO  27005 step Context Establishment.  For the purposes of identifying interoperability opportunities and features, this process is  considered outside the scope of our analysis, as described in accompanying “Compendium of  Risk Management Frameworks”4.  4.2 PROCESSES P2 PRIMARY ASSETS AND P3 SUPPORTING ASSETS  4.2.1 Description of processes  The objective of the P2 Primary Assets process is to identify the Data and Functions  (considered as Primary Assets) that are crucial for the organisation to achieve its business  objectives, determine their value (from a business perspective) as well as their attractiveness  for potential adversaries (combination of the power and interest of potential adversaries that can  be motivated by threatening the Primary Asset). For this process the methodology offers a  business impact scale, a catalogue of potential adversaries and a scale of levels of interest for  potential adversaries.  Finally, the objective of P3 Supporting Assets is to identify and register the Supporting Assets  employed (inventory of hardware and software, a high-level design, an architectural diagram  etc.) for the management of the primary assets (Data and Functions provided by the target  system).  This process is part of the Risk Identification step of ISO 27005.  4.2.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  To achieve interoperability among different RM frameworks, we need to enable the use of each  other’s asset taxonomy and valuation algorithm with equivalent results and without negatively  affecting subsequent steps. Therefore, we need to ensure that:  • the asset taxonomy used by an RM framework is modifiable;  • the analyst can introduce new categories of assets or import taxonomies from other  sources;  the RM framework uses or describes specific guidelines for the evaluation of assets  (i.e. scale and criteria for assessment of asset value and impact) which are modifiable  or the analyst can introduce new scales or criteria.  4.3 PROCESS P4 SYSTEM MODELLING  4.3.1 Description of process  The purpose of P4 System Modelling is to develop a model of a system in terms of associations  between primary and supporting assets, data flows, and system architecture.  This process is part of the Risk Identification step of ISO 27005.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  29  4.3.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  To find the potential for interoperability in this process, it is advisable to work towards promoting  standard representation techniques of the system model (e.g. all supporting assets required for  the processing of primary assets, software architecture, logical model) to allow process P5 to  use it regardless of the RM framework applied.  4.4 PROCESS P5 RISK IDENTIFICATION  4.4.1 Description of process  The objective of the P5 Risk Identification task is to build the risk scenarios that will be  analysed. The risk scenarios are used to represent the risks for the organisation and the  Primary assets regarding the consequences of potential threats in relation to the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of the Supporting Assets.  To identify the threats that the Primary and Supporting assets of a specific information system  are facing, this task will use the system model (output of P4). More specifically, the system  model will provide useful information in order to identify which threats are most likely to occur  for each triplet ‘Primary Asset / Security Dimension (CIA) / Supporting Asset’. Another important  parameter during the risk identification process is the identification of the vulnerabilities  exhibited by the Supporting assets which can be explored by the relevant threats to harm the  confidentiality or integrity or availability of a Primary asset.  The output of the process P5 Risk Identification will be a list of risk scenarios that will be  evaluated in P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation.  This process is part of the Risk Identification step of ISO 27005.  4.4.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  Interoperability requires that, for the same system, two different RM frameworks should produce  comparable risk scenarios or, for different systems, the risk scenarios produced by different RM  frameworks are comparable. To achieve interoperability among different RM frameworks during  the risk identification process, it is necessary to work towards the following.  • Common threat repositories that will feed the applicable (common) threats to the risk  identification process of different RM frameworks. These repositories should:  o classify threats in categories, depending on commonly accepted threat types  (e.g. physical threats, malware, denial of service, failures etc.);  o classify threats according to the sector to which they are applicable (e.g.  threats for health organisations, threats for financial institutions etc.);  o support a hierarchical structure for each threat category, starting from a high  level threat description and continuing with lower-level technical details  (instances) of each threat; this hierarchical structure will facilitate the  interoperability of frameworks working with high-level threats (low-threat  granularity) with frameworks considering threats at a much lower technical  level (high threat granularity).  • Risk scenarios should take into consideration both the business perspective and the  system perspective. They should also support the association of threats with  Supporting assets (i.e. which threat is applicable to which Supporting asset).  • Common vulnerability repositories that will feed the applicable (common)  vulnerabilities to the risk identification process of different RM frameworks. These  repositories should also support the association of vulnerabilities and Supporting  assets (i.e. which vulnerability is applicable to which Supporting asset).  The existence of the common repositories for threats and vulnerabilities will also support global  awareness about new threats and vulnerabilities, allowing all RM frameworks to take them into  account automatically.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  30  4.5 PROCESS P6 RISK ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION  4.5.1 Description of process  The objective of the P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process is the computation of the residual  risk level for each risk identified in P5 Risk Identification, based on the list of Security Measures  identified to mitigate these risks.  The P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process uses as input the Primary asset inventory (from  P2), the risk scenarios (from P5), the catalogue of threats (provided by the methodology), the  risk scale (provided by the methodology), the treatment register (from P7, if it exists from past  RMs), and the security measures register (from P7, if it exists from past RMs).  The output of the P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process is the risk register which guides  decisions on the treatment of risk. For the analysis of risk, the analyst takes into consideration  the likelihood of threats (based on types of threats and potential adversaries, provided by the  methodology) and the consequences of a potential incident. A risk matrix is provided by the  methodology, which calculates the inherent level of risk by combining the likelihood with the  levels of consequences. The residual risk level is calculated after considering existing or  planned security measures to mitigate the risk. Finally, the risk evaluation process provides an  ordered list of risks from the highest to the lowest levels of risk.  This stage is mapped with the ISO 27005 Risk Analysis and Risk Evaluation processes.  4.5.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  Based on the analysis performed in Chapters 2 and 3, we can identify two types of potential for  interoperability. Firstly, the potential for enabling interoperability when an RM analyst performs  RM using the same RM framework but in systems that function for organisations in different  sectors. Secondly, the potential for enabling interoperability when an RM analyst performs RM  using different RM frameworks in systems either in the same or different sectors.  For both options, the key stakeholders and specialists noted that it is important to work in the  future in the direction of creating guidelines for the interpretation and alignment of RM results,  so that the various RM outputs can be compared with each other (i.e. from different RM  methodologies or from the same RM methodology in different sectors). The components of the  P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process, which draw attention for the above purposes are:  - the threat likelihood scale component  - the risk scale component  - the risk matrix component.  Based on the analysis performed in Chapters 2 and 3 and comments from key stakeholders,  future work should focus on allowing interpretation of the outputs from risk analysis that result  from different RMs so that risk levels are comparable. Such provisions can be very beneficial for  organisations in Member States that aim to collaborate or exchange information and services.  In such circumstances, auditors or security specialists are troubled when comparing various RM  results and trying to evaluate whether risk levels are equivalent (e.g. a risk level 18 using  ITSRM2 compared with a risk level 4 using TVRA).  Therefore, to achieve interoperability it is necessary to work towards the following.  • Common or Comparative Risk Scales that will be used by analysts to evaluate the  risk scenarios produced by the risk identification process.  o The risk scales could be qualitative or quantitative. However, there should be  guidelines on the way analysts can interpret the results of each RM  framework as a comparison to another RM framework  o It would be useful to identify (if possible) reference values for each  organisational size, sector, region or nation, etc.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  31  4.6 PROCESS P7 RISK TREATMENT  4.6.1 Description of process  The objective of P7 Risk Treatment is the selection of the risk treatment options that are most  appropriate for handling the risks identified taking into consideration the constraints on the  organisation. Risk mitigation, avoidance, sharing or acceptance are considered as potential  options for treatment. The process takes the results from the previous processes as input and  the catalogue of security measures provided by the framework. The process results in a risk  treatment register that gathers all the information related to the risk treatment options and  applicable security measures if mitigation is chosen.  The process is mapped with the Risk Treatment step of ISO 27005.  4.6.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  Achieving interoperability among different RM frameworks during the risk treatment process is  important especially given that RM is a continuous and repetitive process. Therefore, it is  common that organisations might perform RM using different methodologies in due course.  Further, it is important because organisations may select collaborators based on their appetite  for risk management and treatment as well as status, since collaboration commonly involves the  exchange of information and the interconnection of systems. Therefore, organisations desire to  be able to compare the results of risk treatment produced for the same system by two different  RM frameworks or the results produced by different RM frameworks for different systems. For  this, it is necessary to work towards the following objectives.  • Baseline security measures and the levels of risk maturity associated with various  categories of risk and levels of risk maturity. Organisations could initially aim to  achieve the minimum level of baseline security and further improve risk maturity by  carrying out risk assessments and identifying further risks and appropriate controls.  • Guidelines for comparing risk appetite. Top management selects among the  available risk treatment options, thus selecting risk mitigation, risk acceptance, risk  avoidance or risk sharing. The decisions concerning risk treatment are related to the  risk appetite of top management and could be a valuable criterion that organisations  might use for selecting collaborators and developing service level agreements.  Assuming there are comparative scales for risk, it would be useful to work towards  guidelines for evaluating and comparing risk management appetites.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  32  5. SYNOPSIS  The RM frameworks and methodologies presented in this report have undergone an in-depth  analysis regarding certain attributes and characteristics which was essential in determining the  corresponding levels of their potential interoperability. To this end, a scoring model was  followed which produced the sought-after results. Each framework’s features initially achieved  an interoperability score, which in turn was used to evaluate the overall potential interoperability  from the features’ categories. Chapter 3 presents the interoperability features of the prominent  RM methods and frameworks including the ones identified through the current work as well as  updates to the ones identified in the previous version of the Report. (Chapter 6 includes a list of  all RM frameworks and methods identified and updates made), while Chapter 4 presents  recommendations for incorporating compatibility into the RM processes following ITSRM2.  Conclusively, there are a number of scenario-based methods that do not support all the  characteristics that we used in our evaluation process, e.g. asset identification or evaluation,  and therefore the overall score is not directly comparable to the scores of others.  It should also be noted that, due to the differing scopes and objectives of the RM frameworks  and methodologies, a direct comparison of their score for potential interoperability might lead to  erroneous conclusions. RM Frameworks (inc. ISO 27005, NIST SP 800 – 30/37/39) provide  broad directions and guidelines and pose less constraints on the steps or processes to follow  during RM. Well-structured methodologies, on the other hand (such as EBIOS RM, Magerit, and  Monarc), prescribe in a higher level of detail the steps to be followed and support all phases of  an RM process.  Finally, we should mention that RM frameworks, being essentially the guidelines for performing  an assessment, can be integrated seamlessly with the processes derived from corresponding  methodologies that have achieved the required evaluation of interoperability. For example,  NIST 800-37 is a framework that only acts as an umbrella for risk management functional  components and does not provide any details for each of them. As such, it has the capacity to  accommodate any risk management functional component and, therefore, is highly  interoperable but it cannot be used by its own as a methodology for managing levels of risk.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  33  6. UPDATES ON THE  PROMINENT RISK  MANAGEMENT  FRAMEWORKS AND  METHODOLOGIES  This section describes the updates to the most prominent, currently in use RM frameworks and  methods, as they have been identified in the report Interoperable EU Risk Management  Framework.  6.1 MONARC  (https://www.monarc.lu/, Cyber Security Agency, Luxemburg)  MONARC (Méthode Optimisée d’analyse des risques CASES - Method for an Optimised  Analysis of Risks by CASES) (CASES, 2013) is a tool and a method allowing precise and  repeatable risk assessments to take place. It was created in 2013 by the Cyberworld Awareness  Security Enhancement Services (CASES) department of the Cybersecurity Agency for the  Luxembourg Economy and Municipalities in Luxembourg.  Since the publication of the report Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework,  MONARC has incorporated an update of the risk treatment phase via the addition of security  controls catalogue which are aligned with ISO/IEC 27002:2022 controls. This demonstrates the  interoperability potential of MONARC, given that new features can be incorporated into specific  RM stages. Moreover, in the previous version, the provided control catalogue is not obligatory,  and it is possible to import referential catalogues from other sources (e.g., standards).  6.2 EU ITSRM2, IT SECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY V1.2  (https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/security-standards-applying-all-european-commission- information-systems_en, EU, DG DIGIT)  The second version of ITSRM² IT Security Risk Management Methodology (2020, version 2.0)  (European Commission Directorate-General for Communication, Security standards applying to  all European Commission information systems) is a methodology provided by DG DIGIT and the  European Commission, as part of a set of standards for information security which were  updated in November 2021. The methodology comprises phases and steps that are mapped  onto ISO 27005, including Context Establishment, Risk assessment and Risk Treatment. The  main changes in the methodology include:  • flagging of personal data in the inventory of primary assets,  • asset valuation is extended to consider impact on data subject for personal data, and  not only impact on business (i.e., Impact Scales were divided into Business Impact  Scale and Data Protection Impact Scale)  • Measures catalogues included all measures from NIST SP800-53r4, but categorised  as 1) Mitigating measures, 2) Supporting Measures, and 3) Corporate Measures.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://www.monarc.lu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/security-standards-applying-all-european-commission-information-systems_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/security-standards-applying-all-european-commission-information-systems_en  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  34  6.3 THE AML/CFT NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  (https://pubs.opengroup.org/security/o-ra/, The Open Group)  A new version of the methodology provided by the Open Group Standard for Risk Analysis (The  Open Group, 2021) was published (version 2.0.1). The document is associated with the  updated version of the Risk Taxonomy Standard (Risk Taxonomy (O-RT) Standard, Version  3.0.1, the Open Group Standard (C20B, November 2021)).  The main updates in the version 2.0.1 are:  • The “Confidence Level in the Most Likely Value” as a parameter to model estimates is  discontinued and replaced by the choice of distribution that would determine it  • The quantitative example that utilized a qualitative scale has been removed  • Open FAIR terms and definitions have been clarified  • The Loss Scenario is decomposed and explained utilizing accompanying figures,  including guidance on selecting the distribution to use and Risk Factor to model  6.4 THE AML/CFT NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  (https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodolog y_report.pdf?download=1,  Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia)  The AML/CFT methodology is developed by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia.  The purpose of this RM framework is to identify, assess and understand the risks, threats and  vulnerabilities of money laundering and terrorist financing. Although, the specific threats are not  necessarily cybersecurity risks, the methodology is strongly oriented towards the realization of  the threats through the cyberspace and computer systems infrastructures.  The risk management process includes risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation & re- assessment. Risk identification includes among others, understanding the threats and  vulnerabilities; risk analysis includes among others risk and vulnerability rating; and risk  evaluation and re-assessment includes action planning and re-assessment of risks. The  methodology provides an indicative taxonomy of threats and vulnerabilities, as well as rating  guidelines related to a five-level scale for threat probability and vulnerability level and a five- level scaling for risk rating. For example a level 1 risk is associated with “insignificant impact on  national security systems”, a level 4 risk is associated with “high cybercrime attacks on  computer infrastructure and databases, involving losses in confidential information”, and a level  5 risk with “Significant cybercrime attacks on computer infrastructure and databases, involving  disclosure of National Secrets (classified information), increased damage on national operation  level on information, computer and telecommunication system”. For the risk evaluation & re- assessment stage, three strategies are proposed for action planning: risk acceptance, risk  avoidance and risk mitigation.  6.5 CIRCULAR CSSF 20/750  (https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf, Commission de Surveillance du  Secteur Financier (CSSF) of Luxemburg)  Circular CSSF 20/750 is developed by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier  (CSSF) of Luxemburg and provides guidelines on information and computer technology (ICT)  and security risk management, which are specifically targeted to the financial sector. The  guidelines explain at high-level how financial institutions should manage the ICT and security  risks that they are exposed to. The RM framework includes the following main steps:  • Organization and objectives  https://pubs.opengroup.org/security/o-ra/ https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodology_report.pdf?download=1 https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodology_report.pdf?download=1 https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodology_report.pdf?download=1 https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf,%20Commission%20de%20Surveillance%20du%20Secteur%20Financier%20(CSSF)%20of%20Luxemburg) https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf,%20Commission%20de%20Surveillance%20du%20Secteur%20Financier%20(CSSF)%20of%20Luxemburg) https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  35  • Identification of functions, processes and assets  • Classification and risk assessment  • Risk mitigation  • Reporting  • Audit  The Guidelines state that the ICT and security risk management framework should include  processes in place to:  • determine the risk appetite for ICT and security risks, in accordance with the risk  appetite of the financial institution  • identify and assess the ICT and security risks to which a financial institution is exposed  • define mitigation measures, including controls, to mitigate ICT and security risks  • monitor the effectiveness of these measures as well as the number of reported  incidents,  including for PSPs the incidents reported in accordance with Article 96 of PSD2  affecting  • the ICT-related activities, and take action to correct the measures where necessary  report to the management body on the ICT and security risks and controls  • identify and assess whether there are any ICT and security risks resulting from any  major  • change in ICT system or ICT services, processes or procedures, and/or after any  significant operational or security incident.  The Guidelines also define certain security areas that financial institutions should address with  safeguards, including information security policy, logical security, physical security, ICT  operations security, security monitoring, etc.  6.6 SERIMA  The Luxemburg Institute of Science and Technology developed a prototype and created a  regulation platform called SERIMA (SEcurity RIsk Management), which allows  telecommunication operators to carry out risk analyses, particularly in the telecommunications  sector. This initiative is expected to assist operators in having a common methodology for  carrying out risk analyses and report incidents according to the regulations in force.

The “Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework”  proposes a methodology for assessing the potential interoperability of risk management (RM)  frameworks and methods and presents related results. The methods included in this report have  been selected as prominent, based on their interoperability features, after evaluating an  extended list of risk management frameworks and methods (included in the Compendium of  Risk Management Frameworks with Potential Interoperability, ENISA, January 2002) which has  been published as Supplement to the Interoperable EU Risk Management.  The “Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework” describes and evaluates the  interoperability features for prominent risk management frameworks and methods, by employing  a four-level scale to evaluate their interoperability level. The features assessed to evaluate the  interoperability level include the approach used by the RM method (i.e. to whether it is asset- based or scenario-based), whether risk assessment is quantitative or qualitative, as  well as other characteristics such as the use of asset taxonomies, valuation methods, the  cataloguing of threats and vulnerabilities, the method of risk calculation etc. It also provides an  overview of possible collaborative combinations between them.  The update of “Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework” was based on desktop  research and analysis, which resulted in:  • Identifying new risk management methods, which were evaluated with regard to their  interoperability potential and included in the ““Interoperable EU Risk Management  Framework”. These are the following:  o SERIMA  o CIRCULAR CSSF 20/750  • Updating the features and evaluation of the following RM methods which were already  included in the Framework:  o MONARC  o ITSRM²  o THE OPEN GROUP STANDARD, RISK ANALYSIS  Finally, no updates were identified for the following:  o ISO/IEC 27005:2018  o NIST SP 800-37  o NIST SP 800-30  o NIST SP 800-39  o BSI STANDARD 200-2  o OCTAVE-S  o OCTAVE ALLEGRO  o OCTAVE FORTE  o ETSI TS 102 165-1(TVRA)  o EBIOS Risk Manager  o MAGERIT v.3  o MEHARI  o GUIDELINES ON CYBER SECURITY ONBOARD SHIPS  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  6  1. INTRODUCTION  1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE  This report presents an updated analysis of the interoperability features of prominent RM  frameworks and methodologies, as this was initially presented in the Interoperable EU Risk  Management Framework published by ΕNISA in January 2022, along with the method  followed to determine their interoperability potential. A presentation and brief description of the  RM methods is provided in the “Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks”1 .  The updated version of the Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework presented in this  report includes a) new RM methods, and b) newer versions of already identified RM frameworks  and methods. A detailed evaluation regarding the potential for interoperability of the RM  frameworks, based on their features and an evaluation model, is also included.  The  corresponding results show the potential for forming a coherent RM framework through various  possible combinations of the features of the aforementioned frameworks.  The detailed analysis of the RM frameworks and methodologies, the methodology used to  evaluate them and the results of this process, aim at the provision of a clear outcome in regard  to potentially forming a coherent RM framework that could support information risk management  in different organisations and sectors across EU.  The methodology for evaluating the interoperability potential of different RM methods upon  which the Interoperable Framework is based, was the result of meticulous research and  analysis carried out by professionals involved in both the academic sector and  organisations that engage in RM-related activities and research, informed by the comments,  recommendations and insights provided by key stakeholders. The output of this work is a  method for evaluating the potential for interoperability of different RM frameworks and tools,  along with the results of this evaluation, for a list of prominent RM methods.  1.2 DEFINITION OF ACRONYMS  The acronyms used in this document and recurring definitions are listed below.

METHOD OF WORK  The methodology for assessing the interoperability of risk management frameworks and  methodologies, mainly draws on assessment models. Gilsinn and Schierholz (2010) developed  an assessment model for information assurance for a given information technology, which  comprises seven features (e.g. access control, resource availability) that are relevant to  information assurance. Using those features the assessment model classifies a given  technology into four levels of increasing security (i.e. protection against casual or coincidental  violation, protection against intentional violation using simple means, protection against  intentional violation using sophisticated means, protection against intentional violation using  sophisticated means with extended resources).  In another example, ENISA (2016) developed an assessment model to assess the readiness of  information technology (and specifically privacy-enhancing technologies). The model identifies  nine features that are relevant to the quality and readiness of an information technology (i.e.,  Protection, Trust assumptions, Side effects, Reliability, Performance efficiency, Operability,  Maintainability, Transferability and Scope). Each technology receives a grade for each feature  using a five-level scale (very poor, poor, satisfactory, good, very good). Depending on the  assessment of each feature, the model classifies a given privacy-enhancing technology into one  of six levels (Idea, Research, Proof-of-concept, Pilot, Product, Outdated).  In this chapter we describe the features that we identified as relevant for the assessment of the  interoperability features of risk management frameworks and methodologies. Further, for the  functional features we describe a four-level scale to evaluate the interoperability level of each  RM framework. Finally, we propose a three-level scale for the potential interoperability for each  framework and for combined features.  2.1 FEATURES OF INTEROPERABILITY  The risk management area is characterised by a plethora of frameworks, methodologies and  methods, each of them with their own characteristics and following their own approach in  managing risks. During the risk management lifecycle, practitioners might want to reuse  information provided by other methodologies or consider comparing results among frameworks.  This typically requires the methodologies to be able to share information and therefore provide  capabilities for interoperability.  There is no single definition of interoperability in the literature, as this is a generic term that can  be applied to many sectors and disciplines. As such, it strongly depends on the context in which  it is applied, satisfying its peculiarities and specific demands. In the ICT sector, interoperability  is considered as the ability of two or more systems or components to exchange information and  to use the information that has been exchanged.  ISO/IEC 2382 defines interoperability as the capability to communicate, execute programs, or  transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or  no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units.  The IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary also places emphasis on the required effort thus  defining interoperability as the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or  products without special effort on the part of the customer. This definition is also adopted by  ISO 23903 regarding interoperability in the health sector.  The European Interoperability Framework defines interoperability as “the ability of organisations  to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  8  between these organisations, through the business processes they support, by means of the  exchange of data between their ICT systems.  Considering the above definitions as well as the structure of management frameworks for cyber  risks and the targets of their individual functional characteristics, the interoperability of risk  management frameworks and methodologies can be defined as the ability of a risk  management component or methods to reuse information provided by the risk management  components or methods of other frameworks with equal ease and with the same interfaces,  towards the same goals.  A risk management framework or methodology should address at least the following phases  (ISO 27005, EU ITSRM) which can be considered as its main functional components:  • Risk Identification (Assets, Threats and Vulnerabilities)  • Risk Assessment (Risk Calculation and Evaluation),  • Risk Treatment (Selection and Implementation of Security Controls, and Calculation of  Residual Risk),  • Risk Monitoring (Assess effectiveness of measures and monitor risks).  From the above functional components, Risk Monitoring is a process that, although essential for  efficient risk management, is independent of the rest of the phases and can typically be  conducted using any assessment methodology, process or tool. As such, it is considered  outside the scope of this report which focuses on the other three phases instead, i.e. Risk  Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment.  Overall, there are many characteristics (governance, compliance, privacy) that constitute  integral parts of risk frameworks but not all of them affect interoperability. Considering the  aforementioned definition and the above functional components, we could argue that  interoperability in risk management can be achieved if these components can be addressed by  the components of other frameworks, with similar effectiveness and ease. This essentially  means that interoperability can be achieved at various levels, and we will consider the  functional and non-functional characteristics of the evaluated frameworks.  As such, regarding the functional characteristics, the interoperability between risk  management frameworks can be evaluated against the following levels: Generic aspects, Risk  Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Treatment, which are further analysed to a set of  features that typically stem from the above functional components.  • Generic aspects: At this aspect we consider some generic features of the  frameworks, which are:  o Asset based or Scenario based: this indicates whether a risk management  framework or methodology adopts an asset-based approach or is guided by a  risk scenario. These approaches could be combined. Therefore, our analysis  includes frameworks or methodologies that distinctly follow either an asset-  based or a scenario-based approach, as well as methodologies that adopt  both or a combination of these approaches.  o Quantitative or Qualitative: this indicates whether the risk management  framework or methodology adopts a risk assessment method that is based on  quantitative or qualitative criteria. This does not exclude a third category that  is used for risk assessment, the semi-quantitative method, in which case the  method examined is categorised as either quantitative or qualitative,  whichever is closer.  • Risk Identification: risk management frameworks are considered interoperable if they  can use each other’s asset taxonomy and valuation, threat and vulnerability  catalogues, with equivalent results and without negatively affecting subsequent steps.  At this level we consider the following features:  o Asset Taxonomy: it indicates whether the framework or methodology  requires the use of a specific asset taxonomy.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  9  o Asset Valuation: it indicates whether the framework or methodology requires  the use of a specific asset valuation method.  o Threat catalogues: these indicate whether the framework or methodology  requires the use of a specific set of threats.  o Vulnerability catalogues: these indicate whether the framework or  methodology requires the use of a specific catalogue of vulnerabilities.  • Risk Assessment: risk management frameworks are considered interoperable if they  use the same methodology for risk assessment, or their methods can provide results  that can be easily mapped to the results of other frameworks. At this level we consider  the following features:  o Risk Calculation method: it provides information about the method used for  risk calculation. e.g. Risk = Impact x Likelihood; Risk = Impact x Threat  Likelihood x Vulnerability Level.  • Risk Treatment: risk management frameworks are considered interoperable if they  result in the same set of measures or a set of measures with an equal contribution to  reducing levels of risk. At this level we consider the following features:  o Measures catalogue: it indicates whether the framework or methodology  requires the use of a specific catalogue of measures. If so, it also considers  whether the two catalogues can be mapped to each other.  o Residual Risk Calculation: it considers the chosen measures to evaluate  the remaining levels of risk. This process is typically affected by both the risk  calculation method and the impact of the chosen security measure(s) on a  risk scenario.  Non-functional characteristics that can also be used for assessing the interoperability of risk  management frameworks include:  • Supported languages: An English version of the methodology is an advantage.  • Compliance with other risk-related frameworks (e.g. ISO 27005). Such compliance is  likely to promote interoperability among frameworks.  • Risk Management Life-Cycle Coverage: the level of coverage of the above  functional components of a risk management framework.  • Licensing costs that might hinder interoperability.  The overall interoperability potential of risk management frameworks and methodologies will  be evaluated using a weighted approach on some of the above aspects of interoperability since  some of them might prohibit the interoperability of the frameworks, while others might simply  hinder it. For example, language issues are considered an obstacle that can be bypassed, while  different approaches in risk calculation will not allow the two frameworks to use components of  the other’s method.  Similarly, some of the above features are considered to be exclusive, i.e. if the feature is not  satisfied then interoperability cannot be achieved at any of the aforementioned levels. Such  exclusive features are the ‘Asset based or Scenario-based’ and ‘Quantitative or Qualitative’  based features.  A framework or methodology that does not require, define or dictate specific methods for the  above functional components is obviously considered highly interoperable. Such frameworks  can accommodate risk management components from various methods. For example, the NIST  800-37 risk management framework can typically use any threats, vulnerabilities and catalogue  of measures, and can accommodate any method for calculating the risk. In this respect, it is  considered a highly interoperable framework. Similarly, BSI Standard 200-2 (IT-Grunschutz  Methodology) integrates components from the IT-Grundschutz Compendium, and specifically  accommodates the asset typology, the threat list and the catalogue of controls.  If a methodology has strict requirements regarding the above functional components, its  interoperability is bound to be restricted. For example, if risk assessment is tightly coupled with  a specific threat or vulnerability catalogue, its ability to adopt an alternative catalogue provided  by another method, is restricted.  On the other hand, risk management methodologies that do require following specific,  predefined characteristics (e.g. an asset taxonomy or a calculation method) could provide a  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  10  high potential for interoperability if these characteristics are described in detail so that other  methodologies or frameworks can accommodate them.  2.2 INTEROPERABILITY EVALUATION MODEL  2.2.1 Methodology and levels of interoperability  For the evaluation of potential interoperability among risk management frameworks and  methodologies, we initially consider the inherent level of interoperability of the framework or  methodology regarding functional features. This shows whether a specific framework allows  interoperability with other frameworks with regards to these specific features. Regarding the  features that contribute to the interoperability of the identification, estimation and treatment of  risk, a four-level scale was used:  • Non Applicable: the framework or methodology does not use or support this feature.  • Low Level of Interoperability: the framework or methodology requires a proprietary  solution for this feature, provided by the framework itself.  • Medium Level of Interoperability: the framework or methodology provides details but  are not compulsory, and therefore the proposed solution is modifiable.  • High Level of Interoperability: the framework or methodology uses this feature, but it  either does not provide any suggestions or it can adopt the features of a third  framework, e.g. a standardised or a proprietary solution.  We have applied this evaluation methodology for the functional requirements and specifically for  the following features:  • Risk Identification  o Asset Taxonomy  o Asset Evaluation  o Threat Catalogues  o Vulnerability Catalogues  • Risk Calculation  • Risk Treatment  o Measure Catalogues  o Calculation of Residual Risk  To evaluate the potential interoperability of each risk management framework or  methodology, we first determine the level of interoperability of the Risk Identification, Risk  Calculation and Risk Treatment functional components. More specifically, the following Table  provides the main parameters that are evaluated for each functional characteristic of the risk  management framework or methodology.  Table 1: Parameters evaluated for each functional characteristic  Characteristics  Parameters to Check  Asset  Taxonomy  Does the framework or methodology use or describe specific categories of  assets?  Is the taxonomy used modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new categories of assets or import taxonomies from  other sources?  Asset  Valuation  Does the framework or methodology use or describe specific guidelines for the  valuation of assets (i.e. scale and criteria for assessment of asset value and  impact)?  Are the proposed scales or criteria modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new scales or criteria?  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  11  Characteristics  Parameters to Check  Threat  Catalogues  Does the framework or methodology use or describe specific threat catalogues  and/or threat categories?  Are the proposed threat catalogues and/or threat categories modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new threats and/or threat categories and import them  from other sources?  Vulnerability  Catalogues  Does the framework or methodology describe specific vulnerability catalogues  and/or categories of vulnerabilities?  Are the proposed vulnerability catalogues and/or categories of vulnerabilities  modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new vulnerabilities and/or categories of vulnerabilities  and import them from other sources?  Risk  Calculation  Does the framework or methodology describe specific guidelines for the  calculation of risk (i.e. formulas, scale, matrix)?  Is the proposed calculation method modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce or import (from other sources) new methods of  calculation?  Measure  Catalogues &  Calculation of  Residual Risk  Does the framework or methodology describe specific control catalogues  and/or  categories of controls?  Are the proposed control catalogues and/or categories of controls modifiable?  Can the analyst introduce new controls and/or categories of controls and import  them from other sources?  Is the Calculation of Residual Risk (either on a Calculation of Residual Risk  formula or on an Impact of Measures formula) modifiable?  Based on the information collected and on how the aforementioned parameters were satisfied  or not, we estimate the level of interoperability (No interoperability, Low, Medium or High level of  interoperability) for each functional component (Risk Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk  Treatment) for each risk management framework or methodology.  The higher the level of interoperability that a functional component holds, the more likely it is  that the framework is interoperable with other frameworks regarding a specific feature or  functionality (i.e. combined features).  As an example, a risk assessment framework regarding the feature ‘Vulnerability Catalogues’,  will be evaluated as shown next.  • Non applicable, if the framework does not use vulnerabilities in the calculation of risk,  hence interoperability with another framework, such as using another framework’s  catalogues as provided, is not applicable.  • Low Level of Interoperability, if the framework or methodology uses a proprietary  vulnerability catalogue that cannot be modified or replaced by another one.  • Medium Level of Interoperability: if the framework or methodology uses a  proprietary catalogue of vulnerabilities that can be modified.  • High Level of Interoperability: if the framework uses a proprietary vulnerability  catalogue that can be modified and that can also accommodate other catalogues, and  also where the framework or methodology might not use a proprietary vulnerability  catalogue but can accommodate any other catalogue.  2.2.2 Scoring model for potential interoperability  After assessing the level of interoperability that each framework holds for each functional  feature, we also evaluated the collective potential for interoperability for features that when  combined result in specific functional components (e.g. risk identification). Specifically, for risk  identification, we combined the assessment of the levels of interoperability regarding the  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  12  features of Asset Taxonomy, Asset Valuation, Threat Catalogues and Vulnerability Catalogues.  Then to calculate the potential interoperability of the Risk Identification functional component of  a given risk management framework or methodology, we applied the following weighting  factors:  • Asset Taxonomy, Weighting factor: 30%  • Asset Valuation, Weighting factor: 50%  • Threat Catalogues, Weighting factor: 10%  • Vulnerability Catalogues, Weighting factor: 10%  Thus, the interoperability potential for the Risk Identification functional component will be:  • 30% * Interoperability Level for Asset Taxonomy +  • 50% * Interoperability Level for Asset Valuation +  • 10% * Interoperability Level for Threat Catalogues +  • 10% * Interoperability Level for Vulnerability Catalogues.  The above weights reflect the importance of each functional feature for the potential  interoperability of the framework or methodology in relation to the rest of the functional features,  as evaluated by the security experts who compose the project team (i.e. practical and research  knowledge).  The potential interoperability of a given framework in terms of Risk Assessment and of the Risk  Treatment process, is equal to their assessed levels of interoperability.  The fact that the potential interoperability for the Risk Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk  Treatment process is presented separately, serves someone’s need to interact with a  framework only within one of the three distinct functional components. For example, it is  possible that a framework could have a high potential for interoperability for risk identification  but not for the risk treatment process.  Finally, the overall potential interoperability of a Risk Management framework is calculated as  the average of the interoperability potentials calculated for the Risk Identification, Risk  Calculation and Risk Treatment functional components of the framework.

RESULTS  3.1 ANALYSIS OF LEVEL OF INTEROPERABILITY FOR EACH RISK  MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND FEATURE  The following table presents the application of the methodology for the evaluation of identified  risk assessment frameworks and methodologies. Each framework or methodology is assessed  regarding all features and the resulting scores. Justifications are given in the following figures.  Note that not all available risk management solutions are analysed in this chapter which instead  focuses on well-established and recognised frameworks and methodologies that exhibit the  characteristics of a risk management solution, and that have also been identified, after an initial  screening, to have the potential to interoperate with other frameworks or methodologies.  Thus, a total of 18 methodologies of various types were analysed. Eleven of them are asset- based while four are considered as scenario-based, while the remaining three bear both asset- based and scenario-based characteristics.  Figure 1: Asset-based Scenario-based  Similarly, the subset of methods of analyse included both quantitative (only 2 out of 18) and  qualitative (11 out of 18) methodologies, while 5 of them have the characteristics of both  categories.  Figure 2: Quantitative vs Qualitative  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  14  Regarding the potential interoperability of the methods that were analysed, all of them appear to  be highly interoperable on threats and measures, hence allowing the adoption of additional  catalogues provided by other methods or the alteration of their existing ones. Three of the  methodologies analysed do not consider vulnerabilities in their approach to risk assessment.  Moreover, 11 of the 18 methodologies are considered highly interoperable with respect to their  approach to risk calculation and therefore more open to the adoption of alternatives, while 7 out  of the 18 methodologies allow modification of the proposed method of risk calculation, typically  in term of the scales that are used. The levels of interoperability of the methodologies analysed  are summarised in the following table.

INTEGRATION OF  INTEROPERABILITY IN THE  RM PROCESSES BASED ON  ITSRM2  Based on the analysis of RM frameworks and methodologies performed in in accompanying  “Compendium of Risk Management Frameworks”3, two RM frameworks provide a thorough  description of the typical RM processes, covering the overall RM lifecycle. These are ISO 27005  and ITSRM2.  In this Chapter we provide recommendations regarding interoperability for the ENISA Work  Programme for 2022 and thereafter in the area of Risk Management (RM), using ITSRM2 as a  reference framework. The rationale behind this choice is that ITSRM2 is process-oriented and  offers a detailed presentation of the inputs and outputs for each RM process, providing us with  the grounding needed to discuss the recommendations for opportunities in interoperability.  Figure 4 presents the ITSRM2 RM processes.  Figure 4: The ITSRM2 processes  Before initiating the analysis for each RM process, one high-level recommendation for the  facilitation of interoperability concerns the terminology. In particular, the problem exists in two  cases: 1) using the same (English) term with different meanings, or 2) translating a term,  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  28  usually from the language in which the RM framework was developed, into other languages. In  both cases, interoperability is hindered.  Therefore, we recommend working towards a: Common terminology and translation of  terms in the languages of MS and supporting their integration into the RM frameworks. Next,  we identify recommendations across the RM processes based on ITSRM2.  4.1 PROCESS P1 SYSTEM SECURITY CHARACTERISATION  4.1.1 Description of process  The purpose of the System Security Characterisation process is to gather initial information  concerning the system and its context, which will be used for the rest of the RM processes. The  output of this process includes a high-level description of the system and the organisation, the  contact points for security roles, any constraints for security requirements and any mandatory  security measures that result from these requirements. This process is mapped with the ISO  27005 step Context Establishment.  For the purposes of identifying interoperability opportunities and features, this process is  considered outside the scope of our analysis, as described in accompanying “Compendium of  Risk Management Frameworks”4.  4.2 PROCESSES P2 PRIMARY ASSETS AND P3 SUPPORTING ASSETS  4.2.1 Description of processes  The objective of the P2 Primary Assets process is to identify the Data and Functions  (considered as Primary Assets) that are crucial for the organisation to achieve its business  objectives, determine their value (from a business perspective) as well as their attractiveness  for potential adversaries (combination of the power and interest of potential adversaries that can  be motivated by threatening the Primary Asset). For this process the methodology offers a  business impact scale, a catalogue of potential adversaries and a scale of levels of interest for  potential adversaries.  Finally, the objective of P3 Supporting Assets is to identify and register the Supporting Assets  employed (inventory of hardware and software, a high-level design, an architectural diagram  etc.) for the management of the primary assets (Data and Functions provided by the target  system).  This process is part of the Risk Identification step of ISO 27005.  4.2.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  To achieve interoperability among different RM frameworks, we need to enable the use of each  other’s asset taxonomy and valuation algorithm with equivalent results and without negatively  affecting subsequent steps. Therefore, we need to ensure that:  • the asset taxonomy used by an RM framework is modifiable;  • the analyst can introduce new categories of assets or import taxonomies from other  sources;  the RM framework uses or describes specific guidelines for the evaluation of assets  (i.e. scale and criteria for assessment of asset value and impact) which are modifiable  or the analyst can introduce new scales or criteria.  4.3 PROCESS P4 SYSTEM MODELLING  4.3.1 Description of process  The purpose of P4 System Modelling is to develop a model of a system in terms of associations  between primary and supporting assets, data flows, and system architecture.  This process is part of the Risk Identification step of ISO 27005.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  29  4.3.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  To find the potential for interoperability in this process, it is advisable to work towards promoting  standard representation techniques of the system model (e.g. all supporting assets required for  the processing of primary assets, software architecture, logical model) to allow process P5 to  use it regardless of the RM framework applied.  4.4 PROCESS P5 RISK IDENTIFICATION  4.4.1 Description of process  The objective of the P5 Risk Identification task is to build the risk scenarios that will be  analysed. The risk scenarios are used to represent the risks for the organisation and the  Primary assets regarding the consequences of potential threats in relation to the confidentiality,  integrity and availability of the Supporting Assets.  To identify the threats that the Primary and Supporting assets of a specific information system  are facing, this task will use the system model (output of P4). More specifically, the system  model will provide useful information in order to identify which threats are most likely to occur  for each triplet ‘Primary Asset / Security Dimension (CIA) / Supporting Asset’. Another important  parameter during the risk identification process is the identification of the vulnerabilities  exhibited by the Supporting assets which can be explored by the relevant threats to harm the  confidentiality or integrity or availability of a Primary asset.  The output of the process P5 Risk Identification will be a list of risk scenarios that will be  evaluated in P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation.  This process is part of the Risk Identification step of ISO 27005.  4.4.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  Interoperability requires that, for the same system, two different RM frameworks should produce  comparable risk scenarios or, for different systems, the risk scenarios produced by different RM  frameworks are comparable. To achieve interoperability among different RM frameworks during  the risk identification process, it is necessary to work towards the following.  • Common threat repositories that will feed the applicable (common) threats to the risk  identification process of different RM frameworks. These repositories should:  o classify threats in categories, depending on commonly accepted threat types  (e.g. physical threats, malware, denial of service, failures etc.);  o classify threats according to the sector to which they are applicable (e.g.  threats for health organisations, threats for financial institutions etc.);  o support a hierarchical structure for each threat category, starting from a high  level threat description and continuing with lower-level technical details  (instances) of each threat; this hierarchical structure will facilitate the  interoperability of frameworks working with high-level threats (low-threat  granularity) with frameworks considering threats at a much lower technical  level (high threat granularity).  • Risk scenarios should take into consideration both the business perspective and the  system perspective. They should also support the association of threats with  Supporting assets (i.e. which threat is applicable to which Supporting asset).  • Common vulnerability repositories that will feed the applicable (common)  vulnerabilities to the risk identification process of different RM frameworks. These  repositories should also support the association of vulnerabilities and Supporting  assets (i.e. which vulnerability is applicable to which Supporting asset).  The existence of the common repositories for threats and vulnerabilities will also support global  awareness about new threats and vulnerabilities, allowing all RM frameworks to take them into  account automatically.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  30  4.5 PROCESS P6 RISK ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION  4.5.1 Description of process  The objective of the P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process is the computation of the residual  risk level for each risk identified in P5 Risk Identification, based on the list of Security Measures  identified to mitigate these risks.  The P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process uses as input the Primary asset inventory (from  P2), the risk scenarios (from P5), the catalogue of threats (provided by the methodology), the  risk scale (provided by the methodology), the treatment register (from P7, if it exists from past  RMs), and the security measures register (from P7, if it exists from past RMs).  The output of the P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process is the risk register which guides  decisions on the treatment of risk. For the analysis of risk, the analyst takes into consideration  the likelihood of threats (based on types of threats and potential adversaries, provided by the  methodology) and the consequences of a potential incident. A risk matrix is provided by the  methodology, which calculates the inherent level of risk by combining the likelihood with the  levels of consequences. The residual risk level is calculated after considering existing or  planned security measures to mitigate the risk. Finally, the risk evaluation process provides an  ordered list of risks from the highest to the lowest levels of risk.  This stage is mapped with the ISO 27005 Risk Analysis and Risk Evaluation processes.  4.5.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  Based on the analysis performed in Chapters 2 and 3, we can identify two types of potential for  interoperability. Firstly, the potential for enabling interoperability when an RM analyst performs  RM using the same RM framework but in systems that function for organisations in different  sectors. Secondly, the potential for enabling interoperability when an RM analyst performs RM  using different RM frameworks in systems either in the same or different sectors.  For both options, the key stakeholders and specialists noted that it is important to work in the  future in the direction of creating guidelines for the interpretation and alignment of RM results,  so that the various RM outputs can be compared with each other (i.e. from different RM  methodologies or from the same RM methodology in different sectors). The components of the  P6 Risk Analysis and Evaluation process, which draw attention for the above purposes are:  - the threat likelihood scale component  - the risk scale component  - the risk matrix component.  Based on the analysis performed in Chapters 2 and 3 and comments from key stakeholders,  future work should focus on allowing interpretation of the outputs from risk analysis that result  from different RMs so that risk levels are comparable. Such provisions can be very beneficial for  organisations in Member States that aim to collaborate or exchange information and services.  In such circumstances, auditors or security specialists are troubled when comparing various RM  results and trying to evaluate whether risk levels are equivalent (e.g. a risk level 18 using  ITSRM2 compared with a risk level 4 using TVRA).  Therefore, to achieve interoperability it is necessary to work towards the following.  • Common or Comparative Risk Scales that will be used by analysts to evaluate the  risk scenarios produced by the risk identification process.  o The risk scales could be qualitative or quantitative. However, there should be  guidelines on the way analysts can interpret the results of each RM  framework as a comparison to another RM framework  o It would be useful to identify (if possible) reference values for each  organisational size, sector, region or nation, etc.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  31  4.6 PROCESS P7 RISK TREATMENT  4.6.1 Description of process  The objective of P7 Risk Treatment is the selection of the risk treatment options that are most  appropriate for handling the risks identified taking into consideration the constraints on the  organisation. Risk mitigation, avoidance, sharing or acceptance are considered as potential  options for treatment. The process takes the results from the previous processes as input and  the catalogue of security measures provided by the framework. The process results in a risk  treatment register that gathers all the information related to the risk treatment options and  applicable security measures if mitigation is chosen.  The process is mapped with the Risk Treatment step of ISO 27005.  4.6.2 Recommendations and integration of interoperability features  Achieving interoperability among different RM frameworks during the risk treatment process is  important especially given that RM is a continuous and repetitive process. Therefore, it is  common that organisations might perform RM using different methodologies in due course.  Further, it is important because organisations may select collaborators based on their appetite  for risk management and treatment as well as status, since collaboration commonly involves the  exchange of information and the interconnection of systems. Therefore, organisations desire to  be able to compare the results of risk treatment produced for the same system by two different  RM frameworks or the results produced by different RM frameworks for different systems. For  this, it is necessary to work towards the following objectives.  • Baseline security measures and the levels of risk maturity associated with various  categories of risk and levels of risk maturity. Organisations could initially aim to  achieve the minimum level of baseline security and further improve risk maturity by  carrying out risk assessments and identifying further risks and appropriate controls.  • Guidelines for comparing risk appetite. Top management selects among the  available risk treatment options, thus selecting risk mitigation, risk acceptance, risk  avoidance or risk sharing. The decisions concerning risk treatment are related to the  risk appetite of top management and could be a valuable criterion that organisations  might use for selecting collaborators and developing service level agreements.  Assuming there are comparative scales for risk, it would be useful to work towards  guidelines for evaluating and comparing risk management appetites.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  32  5. SYNOPSIS  The RM frameworks and methodologies presented in this report have undergone an in-depth  analysis regarding certain attributes and characteristics which was essential in determining the  corresponding levels of their potential interoperability. To this end, a scoring model was  followed which produced the sought-after results. Each framework’s features initially achieved  an interoperability score, which in turn was used to evaluate the overall potential interoperability  from the features’ categories. Chapter 3 presents the interoperability features of the prominent  RM methods and frameworks including the ones identified through the current work as well as  updates to the ones identified in the previous version of the Report. (Chapter 6 includes a list of  all RM frameworks and methods identified and updates made), while Chapter 4 presents  recommendations for incorporating compatibility into the RM processes following ITSRM2.  Conclusively, there are a number of scenario-based methods that do not support all the  characteristics that we used in our evaluation process, e.g. asset identification or evaluation,  and therefore the overall score is not directly comparable to the scores of others.  It should also be noted that, due to the differing scopes and objectives of the RM frameworks  and methodologies, a direct comparison of their score for potential interoperability might lead to  erroneous conclusions. RM Frameworks (inc. ISO 27005, NIST SP 800 – 30/37/39) provide  broad directions and guidelines and pose less constraints on the steps or processes to follow  during RM. Well-structured methodologies, on the other hand (such as EBIOS RM, Magerit, and  Monarc), prescribe in a higher level of detail the steps to be followed and support all phases of  an RM process.  Finally, we should mention that RM frameworks, being essentially the guidelines for performing  an assessment, can be integrated seamlessly with the processes derived from corresponding  methodologies that have achieved the required evaluation of interoperability. For example,  NIST 800-37 is a framework that only acts as an umbrella for risk management functional  components and does not provide any details for each of them. As such, it has the capacity to  accommodate any risk management functional component and, therefore, is highly  interoperable but it cannot be used by its own as a methodology for managing levels of risk.  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  33  6. UPDATES ON THE  PROMINENT RISK  MANAGEMENT  FRAMEWORKS AND  METHODOLOGIES  This section describes the updates to the most prominent, currently in use RM frameworks and  methods, as they have been identified in the report Interoperable EU Risk Management  Framework.  6.1 MONARC  (https://www.monarc.lu/, Cyber Security Agency, Luxemburg)  MONARC (Méthode Optimisée d’analyse des risques CASES - Method for an Optimised  Analysis of Risks by CASES) (CASES, 2013) is a tool and a method allowing precise and  repeatable risk assessments to take place. It was created in 2013 by the Cyberworld Awareness  Security Enhancement Services (CASES) department of the Cybersecurity Agency for the  Luxembourg Economy and Municipalities in Luxembourg.  Since the publication of the report Interoperable EU Risk Management Framework,  MONARC has incorporated an update of the risk treatment phase via the addition of security  controls catalogue which are aligned with ISO/IEC 27002:2022 controls. This demonstrates the  interoperability potential of MONARC, given that new features can be incorporated into specific  RM stages.

The methodology comprises phases and steps that are mapped  onto ISO 27005, including Context Establishment, Risk assessment and Risk Treatment. The  main changes in the methodology include:  • flagging of personal data in the inventory of primary assets,  • asset valuation is extended to consider impact on data subject for personal data, and  not only impact on business (i.e., Impact Scales were divided into Business Impact  Scale and Data Protection Impact Scale)  • Measures catalogues included all measures from NIST SP800-53r4, but categorised  as 1) Mitigating measures, 2) Supporting Measures, and 3) Corporate Measures.  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://www.monarc.lu/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/interoperable-eu-risk-management-framework https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/security-standards-applying-all-european-commission-information-systems_en https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/security-standards-applying-all-european-commission-information-systems_en  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  34  6.3 THE AML/CFT NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  (https://pubs.opengroup.org/security/o-ra/, The Open Group)  A new version of the methodology provided by the Open Group Standard for Risk Analysis (The  Open Group, 2021) was published (version 2.0.1). The document is associated with the  updated version of the Risk Taxonomy Standard (Risk Taxonomy (O-RT) Standard, Version  3.0.1, the Open Group Standard (C20B, November 2021)).  The main updates in the version 2.0.1 are:  • The “Confidence Level in the Most Likely Value” as a parameter to model estimates is  discontinued and replaced by the choice of distribution that would determine it  • The quantitative example that utilized a qualitative scale has been removed  • Open FAIR terms and definitions have been clarified  • The Loss Scenario is decomposed and explained utilizing accompanying figures,  including guidance on selecting the distribution to use and Risk Factor to model  6.4 THE AML/CFT NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY  (https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodolog y_report.pdf?download=1,  Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia)  The AML/CFT methodology is developed by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Estonia.  The purpose of this RM framework is to identify, assess and understand the risks, threats and  vulnerabilities of money laundering and terrorist financing. Although, the specific threats are not  necessarily cybersecurity risks, the methodology is strongly oriented towards the realization of  the threats through the cyberspace and computer systems infrastructures.  The risk management process includes risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation & re- assessment. Risk identification includes among others, understanding the threats and  vulnerabilities; risk analysis includes among others risk and vulnerability rating; and risk  evaluation and re-assessment includes action planning and re-assessment of risks. The  methodology provides an indicative taxonomy of threats and vulnerabilities, as well as rating  guidelines related to a five-level scale for threat probability and vulnerability level and a five- level scaling for risk rating. For example a level 1 risk is associated with “insignificant impact on  national security systems”, a level 4 risk is associated with “high cybercrime attacks on  computer infrastructure and databases, involving losses in confidential information”, and a level  5 risk with “Significant cybercrime attacks on computer infrastructure and databases, involving  disclosure of National Secrets (classified information), increased damage on national operation  level on information, computer and telecommunication system”. For the risk evaluation & re- assessment stage, three strategies are proposed for action planning: risk acceptance, risk  avoidance and risk mitigation.  6.5 CIRCULAR CSSF 20/750  (https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf, Commission de Surveillance du  Secteur Financier (CSSF) of Luxemburg)  Circular CSSF 20/750 is developed by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier  (CSSF) of Luxemburg and provides guidelines on information and computer technology (ICT)  and security risk management, which are specifically targeted to the financial sector. The  guidelines explain at high-level how financial institutions should manage the ICT and security  risks that they are exposed to. The RM framework includes the following main steps:  • Organization and objectives  https://pubs.opengroup.org/security/o-ra/ https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodology_report.pdf?download=1 https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodology_report.pdf?download=1 https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/system/files_force/document_files/l2._nra_methodology_report.pdf?download=1 https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf,%20Commission%20de%20Surveillance%20du%20Secteur%20Financier%20(CSSF)%20of%20Luxemburg) https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf,%20Commission%20de%20Surveillance%20du%20Secteur%20Financier%20(CSSF)%20of%20Luxemburg) https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/cssf20_750eng.pdf  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  35  • Identification of functions, processes and assets  • Classification and risk assessment  • Risk mitigation  • Reporting  • Audit  The Guidelines state that the ICT and security risk management framework should include  processes in place to:  • determine the risk appetite for ICT and security risks, in accordance with the risk  appetite of the financial institution  • identify and assess the ICT and security risks to which a financial institution is exposed  • define mitigation measures, including controls, to mitigate ICT and security risks  • monitor the effectiveness of these measures as well as the number of reported  incidents,  including for PSPs the incidents reported in accordance with Article 96 of PSD2  affecting  • the ICT-related activities, and take action to correct the measures where necessary  report to the management body on the ICT and security risks and controls  • identify and assess whether there are any ICT and security risks resulting from any  major  • change in ICT system or ICT services, processes or procedures, and/or after any  significant operational or security incident.  The Guidelines also define certain security areas that financial institutions should address with  safeguards, including information security policy, logical security, physical security, ICT  operations security, security monitoring, etc.  6.6 SERIMA  The Luxemburg Institute of Science and Technology developed a prototype and created a  regulation platform called SERIMA (SEcurity RIsk Management), which allows  telecommunication operators to carry out risk analyses, particularly in the telecommunications  sector. This initiative is expected to assist operators in having a common methodology for  carrying out risk analyses and report incidents according to the regulations in force. Therefore,  tackling differences in format, methodology, data reconciliation or data comparison and  analysis.  SERIMA is not analysed further in this report, due to lack of publicly available information.  6.7 ISO/IEC 27005:2018  (https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html, International Organization for Standardization)  No updates.  6.8 NIST SP 800-37 REV. 2  (https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/risk-management-framework, USA)  No updates.  6.9 NIST SP 800–30 REV.1  (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final, USA)  No updates.  https://www.iso.org/standard/75281.html https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/risk-management-framework https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  36  6.10 NIST SP 800–39  (https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final, USA)  No updates.  6.11 BSI STANDARD 200-2  (https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi- standard-2002_en_pdf.html)  No updates.  6.12 OCTAVE-S  (https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=6795, Carnegie Mellon University  / Software Engineering Institute - USA)  No updates.  6.13 OCTAVE ALLEGRO  (https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=8419, Carnegie Mellon University  / Software Engineering Institute - USA)  No updates.  6.14 OCTAVE FORTE (OCTAVE FOR THE ENTERPRISE)  (https://search.cmu.edu/?q=octave+fort&siteSearch=&site=&ie=UTF-8, Carnegie Mellon  University / Software Engineering Institute - USA)  No updates.  6.15 ETSI TS 102 165-1, THREAT VULNERABILITY AND RISK  ANALYSIS (TVRA)  (https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/05.02.03_60/ts_10216501v0502 03p.pdf, ETSI Technical Committee Cyber Security)  No updates.  6.16 EBIOS RISK MANAGER (EXPRESSION DES BESOINS ET  IDENTIFICATION DES OBJECTIFS DE SECURITE - EXPRESSION OF  NEEDS AND IDENTIFICATION OF SECURITY OBJECTIVES)  (https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/guide/ebios-risk-manager-the-method/, ANSSI, France)  No updates.  6.17 MAGERIT V.3: ANALYSIS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  INFORMATION SYSTEMS  (https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_Documentacion/pae_Metodolog/pae_ Magerit.html?idioma=en, Spanish Ministry for Public Administrations, Spain)  No updates.  https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-30/rev-1/final https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=6795 https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=8419 https://search.cmu.edu/?q=octave+fort&siteSearch=&site=&ie=UTF-8 https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/05.02.03_60/ts_10216501v050203p.pdf https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102100_102199/10216501/05.02.03_60/ts_10216501v050203p.pdf https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/guide/ebios-risk-manager-the-method/ https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_Documentacion/pae_Metodolog/pae_Magerit.html?idioma=en https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_Documentacion/pae_Metodolog/pae_Magerit.html?idioma=en  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  37  6.18 MEHARI  (https://clusif.fr/management-des-risques-cooperation-de-mehari-et-ebios-risk-manager/  https://clusif.fr/module-mehari-manager-bc/,  CLUSIF, France)  No updates.  6.19 GUIDELINES ON CYBER SECURITY ONBOARD SHIPS  (https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Security/Documents/ANNEX%20Guideline s%20on%20Cyber%20Security%20Onboard%20Ships%20v.4.pdf, BIMCO, CLIA, ICS,  INTERCARGO, INTERMANAGER, INTERTANKO, OCIMF, IUMI and WORLD SHIPPING  COUNCIL)  No updates.  https://clusif.fr/management-des-risques-cooperation-de-mehari-et-ebios-risk-manager/ https://clusif.fr/module-mehari-manager-bc/ https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Security/Documents/ANNEX%20Guidelines%20on%20Cyber%20Security%20Onboard%20Ships%20v.4.pdf https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/OurWork/Security/Documents/ANNEX%20Guidelines%20on%20Cyber%20Security%20Onboard%20Ships%20v.4.pdf  INTEROPERABLE EU RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  D1 | 1.0 - DRAFT | Updated Report, December 2022  38  7.

The methodology used to evaluate interoperability stemmed from extensive research of the literature, resulting in the use of certain RM framework features which were singled out for this purpose. These features, which were identified as relevant for the assessment of interoperability, are thoroughly described and analysed for each framework/methodology. More specifically, for certain functional features we make use of a four-level scale to evaluate the interoperability level for each method and each set of combined features."

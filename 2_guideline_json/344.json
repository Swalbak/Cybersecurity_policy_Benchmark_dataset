There are several patterns associated with threats from the inside.  A well-known insider threat pattern (also known as ‘privilege misuse’)  occurs when outsiders collaborate with internal actors to gain  unapproved access to assets. Insiders may cause harm unintentionally  through carelessness or because of a lack of knowledge. Since these  insiders often enjoy trust and privileges, as well as knowledge of the  organisational policies, processes and procedures of the organisation, it  is difficult to distinguish between legitimate, malicious and erroneous  access to applications, data and systems.1  The five types of insider threat can be defined according to their  rationales and objectives:  a) the careless workers who mishandle data, break use policies and  install unauthorised applications;  b) the inside agents who steal information on behalf of outsiders;  c) the disgruntled employees who seek to harm their organisation;  d) the malicious insiders who use existing privileges to steal information  for personal gain;  e) the feckless third-parties who compromise security through  intelligence, misuse or malicious access to or use of an asset.  All five types of insider threats should be continuously studied, as  acknowledging their existence and their modus operandi should define  the organisation’s strategy for security and data protection.  2  3  __Findings  65%_of the impact from insider threats includes  damage to the organisation’s reputation and  finances12  88%_of the organisations surveyed recognise  that insider threats are a cause for alarm10  €11,45_million is the average annual cost of  cybersecurity incidents caused by an insider to the  organisation8  40%_of the organisations surveyed feel  vulnerable to having confidential business  information exposed11  4  Kill chain  Reconnaissance Weaponisation Delivery Exploitation  Step of Attack Workflow  Width of Purpose  Insider threat  5  Installation Command &  Control  Actions on  Objectives  MORE INFORMATION  The Cyber Kill Chain® framework was developed by  Lockheed Martin, adapted from a military concept related  with the structure of an attack. To study a particular attack  vector, use this kill-chain diagram to map each step of the  process and reference the tools, techniques and  procedures used by the attacker.  https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html  6  Description  Due to the increasing cost of other attack vectors, attackers are willing to  offer large amounts of money to insiders. The price of insiders varies,  depending on the insider’s position in the company, the company itself,  the type and complexity of service that is requested, the type of data that  are exfiltrated and the level of security at the company. Some of the ways  attackers recruit insiders include: (1) simply posting an offer on forums  and offering a reward for certain information; (2) disguising their actions  so that employees don’t realize they are acting illegally, disclosing personal  information or engaging in insider activity; and (3) blackmailing.4  _Money rules  A former software engineer from a cloud service provider took advantage  of a misconfigured web application firewall and accessed more than 100  million customers’ accounts and credit card records. The company has  since fixed the vulnerability and stated that ‘no credit card account  numbers or log-in credentials were compromised’. This insider-threat case  is particularly interesting because the former employee turned hacker  wasn’t worried about hiding the identity. The hacker shared the hacking  method with colleagues from Capital One on a chat service. The hacker  also posted the information on GitHub (using the full name) and bragged  on social media about it too. This kind of behaviour is a phenomenon  psychologist’s call ‘leakage’ whereby insiders who plot to do damage reveal  their plans. Capital One expects the breach to cost up to US $150 million  (ca. €127 million).5  _Rogue actions Urbi et Orbi  7  Incidents and cost trends.

According to cybersecurity experts15, phishing (38%) is the biggest  vulnerability in the case of unintentional insider threats. In a lower  position of the list are spear phishing (21%), the weak or reused  passwords (16%), orphaned accounts (10%) and browsing of suspicious  sites (7%).  _How  38%  27%  18%  12% 5%  Reputational  damage  Financial  impact  Leaked IP Customer churn None  _ Impact area of insider threat incidents  Source: Egress 12  9  “Insiders may cause  harm unintentionally  through carelessness or  because of a lack of  knowledge.”  in ETL 2020  _Proposed actions  10  Mitigation   Deploy a deep packet inspection (DPI) technology for anomaly  detection which gives industrial users a trusted platform for  monitoring the flow of process control command flow and telemetry  data, and protect against outside threats. At the same time, it mitigates  the risk of ‘advanced’ insider interference from engineers, SCADA  operators or other internal staff with direct access to systems.16   Introduce an insider threat countermeasures plan into the overall  security strategy and policies. This plan typically includes a risk  management framework, business continuity plan (BCP), disaster  recovery program (DRP), a financial and accounting management  policies and a legal and regulatory management.1   Build a security programme that consists of: conducting threat hunting  activities, performing vulnerability scanning and penetration testing,  implementing personnel security measures, employing physical  security measures, implement network security solutions, employing  endpoint security solutions, applying data security measures,  employing identity and accessing management measures, establishing  incident management capabilities, retaining digital forensics services  and utilisation of artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to prevent insider  attacks.   Draw up a security policy on insider threats, based on user awareness,  wich is one of the most effective controls for this type of cyberthreat.   Implement robust technical controls. Traditional security measures  tend to focus on external threats, but these are usually not efficient at  identifying internal risks emanating from inside the organisation. To  protect assets, implement tools such as data loss prevention (DLP) to  prevent data exfiltration.1  11   Reduce the number of users with privileges and access to sensitive  information. If an employee doesn’t need to have access to some  information to do their work, it is better to restrict what they can see,  thus avoid improper access.17   Harden the digital environment, which includes tightening up the  security of the network, systems, applications, data and accounts.1  11  12  References  1. “Insider Threat Report”, 2019.

Established in 2004 and strengthened by the EU  Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity  contributes to EU cyber policy, enhances the trustworthiness of ICT  products, services and processes with cybersecurity certification schemes,  cooperates with Member States and EU bodies, and helps Europe prepare  for the cyber challenges of tomorrow. Through knowledge sharing,  capacity building and awareness raising, the Agency works together with  its key stakeholders to strengthen trust in the connected economy, to  boost resilience of the Union’s infrastructure, and, ultimately, to keep  Europe’s society and citizens digitally secure.

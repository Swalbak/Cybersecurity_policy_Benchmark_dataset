INTRODUCTION  1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE  The Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM)1 sector is an entire ecosystem of services,  operations and infrastructures comprised of a variety of actors and stakeholders. Under a new  regulation set by the United Nations2, car manufacturers are required to secure vehicles against  cyberattacks. In the European Union, the new regulation on cybersecurity will be mandatory for  all new vehicle types from July 2022 and will become mandatory for all new vehicles produced  from July 2024.3 Moreover, the UNECE Regulation and related ISO standards apply to all CAM  stakeholders who must ensure that their products and services conform to cybersecurity goals.  Increased connectivity and technological development in the ecosystem through various  services, components and technologies are continuously expanding. Therefore, within the CAM  sector, where innovation and market growth are expanding, global players in the CAM sector  face a risk of cyberattacks. Connected services may be attacked by cyber-attackers and create  cyber fraud, data breach and privacy incidents, as well as software overrides resulting in  dangerous situations and accidents when part of the vehicle to everything (V2X) network is  attacked, thereby threatening the drivers, road users and companies. Efforts across the whole  industry should be made to ensure that even if one system is compromised and/or tampered,  the rest of the systems remain unaffected.  The interlinking of systems and services (both inside and outside the vehicle) and thus  intelligent and connected mobility are already revolutionising users’ lives. The whole ecosystem  involved in the CAM lifecycle has to cope with key challenges that add complexity to responding  and managing CAM cybersecurity risks. Today, connected vehicles, connected environment  and connected infrastructure should be designed with new capabilities and features that have  the potential to provide increased safety, better vehicle performance, competitive digital  products and services, more comfort, environmental friendliness, as well as convenience for its  end-users. Governments, manufacturers, private companies (incl. SMEs and start-ups) as well  as IT enterprises are all involved in the future development of intelligent and connected and  automated mobility. Fixed and mobile telecommunication infrastructure is necessary for cars to  communicate with the smart road infrastructure (I2V and V2I), with devices (V2D), between  vehicles (V2V), with other networks such as access to cloud infrastructure (V2N) as well as  within the vehicle.  The aim of this report is to provide a high-level overview of the cybersecurity challenges in the  CAM sector and to highlight both the concerned CAM actors and associated recommendations.  Cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem is partially standardised and the role of standards is widely  recognised. All stakeholders’ contributions to the CAM ecosystem are intertwined. Standards  and regulations are often not adopted uniformly worldwide, and therefore some countries may  advance faster than others in building a safe and secure cybersecurity system around CAM  infrastructure. In the context of growing cybersecurity threats and concerns about cybersecurity  and data protection, this report aims to identify the main challenges in the current situation and  to propose actionable recommendations for the different stakeholders involved in the CAM  ecosystem to enhance the level of security and resilience of CAM infrastructures and systems in  Europe. Challenges in the CAM ecosystem arise from the whole lifecycle, therefore this report  1 Connected and automated mobility in Europe. European Commission.

The  recommendations proposed by ENISA aim to guide all CAM ecosystem stakeholders and to  contribute to the improvement and harmonisation of cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem in the  European Union.  Using a layered approach of primary and secondary research, this report summarises insights  across a complex CAM ecosystem. Primary research methods included a survey and a series of  interviews and validation discussions with key stakeholders from the CAM ecosystem.  Secondary research methods included desktop research of works of ENISA, official statistics,  academic research, external studies and official documents, white papers, legislation, policies,  strategies and initiatives to identify challenges and lessons learnt on cyber incidents against the  CAM ecosystem.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  8  2. CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE  CAM AREA  2.1 GOVERNANCE AND CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION INTO  CORPORATE ACTIVITIES  Cybersecurity governance in the CAM ecosystem represents an organisational and technical  challenge for all stakeholders within it. The emergence of CAM where digital technology and  connectivity encounter the physical world of transportation involves the definition of a  cybersecurity approach that answers the specific needs and constraints of CAM. In the CAM  environment, there are:   Connected services and off-board systems that are characterised by agile  development cycles involving the continuous evolution of services following staggered  releases, a large number of short-term projects generally based on scalable and  modular cloud architectures which are managed by Information System  (IS)/Information Technology (IT) teams or hosting services providers.   Various physical infrastructures, equipment, products and associated services,  vehicles and soft-mobility devices based on Operational Technology (OT),  electrics/electronics (E/E) architectures and on-board systems managed by  engineering teams, which are characterised by a much longer development cycle and  which must meet the security and technical requirements associated with various  types of quality validations or regulatory approvals (e.g. vehicle type approval).  The above two different parts of the environment have an impact on cybersecurity and its  integration into development projects as well as broadly into corporate activities. This new  relation between teams evolving into the digital world, and ‘historic’ teams developing and  operating physical products is a challenge in terms of collaboration, which does not ease  cybersecurity governance. Developments on each side can affect the security of the other side,  thereby making the risk approach holistic which has proven to be challenging in environments  where a clearly stated and efficient governance has not yet been put in place.  The different actors of the CAM ecosystem, from international companies to start-ups, have  started to tackle this new model. Indeed, companies have started to grow new expertise, skills  and competences, enabling the integration of digital into the transport sector by hiring new  profiles, transferring competences and opening up internally. Companies have also started  collaborating with partners, start-ups and other suppliers that could provide the required  expertise. However, for the larger structures, it has been more difficult to implement this new  model of governance requiring the mastery of digital and IT technologies in their research and  development (R&D) and core processes considering their size, thereby generating inertia for  organisational change.  The introduction of new skills within existing entities or through new entities is necessary to  adapt organisations and to clarify roles and responsibilities vis-à-vis these new capabilities. In  this context, the roles and responsibilities of employees regarding cybersecurity within the  different entities are not clearly defined, creating a gap in the capacity to deal with security-  related issues. In addition, a seamless integration of security activities into the execution of core  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  9  business activities is directly related to the lack of concern for cybersecurity. If cybersecurity  becomes a core business objective, businesses would become integrated and prepared to rely  more effectively on cybersecurity teams to manage their risks and address potential  vulnerabilities. Responsibility and accountability for security needs to be clearly defined for the  various stakeholders, which is generally not the case. This is directly linked to the lack of  cybersecurity integration into the corporate strategy and business planning, associated to lack  of awareness and trainings to corporate resources, as well as the legislative requirements that  need to be adapted.  2.1.1 Recommendations  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and when considering CAM products and services, this  becomes even more of a reality because their security and privacy are part of the very core  business value. Software and data are integrated into objects designed and engineered to  provide mobility and transport services using on-board and off-board systems with very specific  technologies. In the CAM ecosystem, cybersecurity shall not be seen as a standalone topic that  provides requirements and expertise beside other engineering, development and operations  teams. It should be seen as a core enabler that protects safety and provides value to products  and services, and is integrated in the lifecycles of products’ and services’ activities.  At all stages of CAM products’ and services’ lifecycles, risks must be managed, and  cybersecurity activities performed. It shall be the responsibility of product and process owners to  ensure that, by relying on the security expertise and resources provided by their organisation,  the risks related to their activity is well assessed and treated. Cybersecurity must become part  of the core business of an organisation in the delivery of its activities.  To foster better governance and integration of cybersecurity into corporate activities, ENISA  recommends to:   Raise awareness to the top management level of the organisation, where appropriate,  about the impact of cybersecurity and technology on the CAM ecosystem lifecycle.   Raise awareness throughout the organisation, and especially at the right decision level  within the company or group, about the impact of cybersecurity and technology on the  CAM ecosystem lifecycle.   Promote the integration of cybersecurity along with digital transformation at the board  level in the organisation.   Advise on fast-moving business and technology topics such as cybersecurity on a  permanent basis at board level of the organisation.   Promote the acceleration of cybersecurity in research and development spending on  CAM technology to keep up with cybersecurity developments.   Promote procurement processes to integrate cybersecurity risk-oriented requirements.   Address cybersecurity skills to keep up with the creative (e.g. design thinking) skills  that the company’s strategy aims to foster.   Define clear roles and responsibilities regarding cybersecurity within the organisation,  not only for the cybersecurity branch, but also the relevant business and corporate  functions, up to the global risk owner for the product, system or service.   Take into regard the cybersecurity needs of both business and supporting processes  according to the cybersecurity risks of assets handled by such processes.   Define a risk management process enabling risk assessment, treatment decision and  ownership over the product/service lifecycle.   Consider cybersecurity activities in projects and business planning, by establishing  collaboration schemes between different teams (e.g. business and cybersecurity).  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  10  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Mobility Services Providers   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.2 LACK OF TOP MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND CYBERSECURITY  PRIORITISATION  In the complex context of CAM, cybersecurity has generally not been considered a priority by  corporate management in the CAM industry. So far, cybersecurity has not been perceived as a  board-level topic. Indeed, not all organisations of the CAM ecosystem are involving the  corporate management in cybersecurity problematics. Furthermore, cybersecurity executives  have few interactions with corporate executives which is why it is so shallowly integrated into  the global strategy and objectives of companies. As a primary consequence, the lack of  management involvement leads to insufficient financial support to ensure cybersecurity is  addressed as a key topic in the lifecycle of CAM products and services. Also, the lack of  cybersecurity consideration that involves cybersecurity strategic planning is generally not as  robust as it should be. It also makes it difficult for the teams in charge of cybersecurity to obtain  enough resources for R&D, to deploy awareness and training programs, as well as to carry out  operational activities in the most effective manner. Hence, the cybersecurity dimension is rarely  anticipated and integrated into business planning since business priorities tend to focus  primarily on innovation, quality, cost, and time-to-market rather than on cybersecurity. However,  with the emergence of legislation and requirements from national and international regulatory  bodies for CAM cybersecurity, such as the General Vehicle Safety Regulation (GSR) from the  European Commission that will enforce the UNECE WP29 cybersecurity regulation for  European countries as of 2022. It regulates that vehicles will have to comply with applicable  cybersecurity regulations and standards in order to be put on the market. The UNECE  regulation however covers just part of the CAM ecosystem, providing only qualitative  requirements and does not include all stakeholders.  In addition to the low consideration of cybersecurity in corporate management, most of the  stakeholders interviewed ranked the financial resources available for cybersecurity as a main  challenge to enable the teams to carry out state-of-the-art activities and effectively address all  identified risks. The budget allocation of companies is generally based on the estimated Return  on Investment (ROI) of business activities and it is sometimes acknowledged that the difficulty  of calculating the ROI of budgets allocated to cybersecurity is the reason why companies limit  their investments. The impact of cybersecurity on increasing revenues or optimising costs  generally remains uncertain for companies in the CAM industry. Regulatory aspects might tend  to rationalise the perception of cybersecurity ROI since it is becoming a requirement to be  integrated in the products’ and services’ planning and lifecycle.  In the context of quickly increasing development of CAM products and services, as well as a  regulatory landscape that becomes demanding regarding cybersecurity, a lack of cybersecurity  consideration can significantly impact companies’ operations and reputations which can lead to  severe safety impacts or financial loss.  Regarding the complexity of the CAM ecosystem and of its services and products, implementing  cybersecurity in an efficient way requires implementing an adequate strategy and associated  funding for its deployment. To foster success, the cybersecurity strategy must not be built in a  standalone manner but streamlined with the business strategy in order to make it realistic and  capitalise on synergies. Hence the cybersecurity strategy must be acknowledged and supported  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  11  by top management as an enabler to the satisfying development and operations of CAM  products and services.  2.2.1 Recommendations  To build a strategy, a mind-set shift is required so that cybersecurity is not seen as a cost and  pure loss of money that may avoid potential risks, but as a real enabler of important business  opportunities made possible by the mastering of technologies. Cybersecurity allows to reduce  time to market and provide state-of-the-art products and services to customers that are secure,  reliable and trustworthy. In order to follow the technological developments, adequate budgets  must be devoted for cybersecurity innovation and R&D activities, as well as ensured for  cybersecurity operations such as security maintenance, detection and reaction activities.  Since new regulations will enforce to perform risk management activities and ensure products’  and services’ security, CAM actors shall transform this constraint into an opportunity to add  value to their deliveries by making the process more robust and by raising the quality of their  products and services through security and privacy.  To foster better prioritisation of cybersecurity by corporate leads and better funding and budget  allocation of cybersecurity, ENISA recommends:   Establish administrative structures for top-level management to discuss and exchange  views with cybersecurity experts and CISOs.   Incentivise innovation and R&D activities for securing IT and CAM environments,  components, systems and services.   Promote the aspect of security in companies’ business strategies by learning from  automotive industry practices.   Consider the development of certification schemes for automotive industry security  (taking into account the inherent particularities when defining the target of evaluation),  in order to promote harmonisation of the market, increase consumer trust and open up  new business opportunities.   Foster a corporate security culture by involving cybersecurity directly in the  management board.   Establish regular training programmes for the different levels of the company, including  top management, in order to bring awareness on cybersecurity legal requirements as  well as possible threats, risks and security measures.   Develop targeted cybersecurity information and certification schemes for SMEs in the  automotive aftermarket and servicing sector.   Define common requirements and responsibilities for all stakeholders involved in the  CAM ecosystem.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.3 TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY IN THE CAM ECOSYSTEM  In the mobility and transportation sector, the number of actors and tiers interacting is important.  The multiplicity of stakeholders involved around infrastructures, connected services and  products along the value chain leads to different challenges concerning the implementation and  management of cybersecurity and efficient risk management. Dependencies, interactions and  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  12  supply chain management in this sector are a well-known challenge acknowledged by the  majority of the actors involved.  For instance, the delivery of a service such as public transportation will involve a vehicle  manufacturer and all its supply chain: a public transport operator, its suppliers and partners for  operations and maintenance, the road and public authorities and management, insurance  companies, interactions with other road users, automotive aftermarket operators, service  providers, and so on. In this landscape where the products, services and operations of each  stakeholder can affect the security of the end users, the products and the companies involved, a  comprehensive and commonly acknowledged cybersecurity alignment is needed in terms of  legal, technical and practical aspects between parties. The dependencies between stakeholders  generates a need for interoperability, which will stem from the cybersecurity model. It starts by  defining and sharing roles and responsibilities that raises a need of alignment of role and  responsibility principles within the ecosystem, and a continuous cybersecurity information  sharing between stakeholders. Clarifying roles and responsibilities is one of the enablers to  define and implement security by design for products and services, where all stakeholders  ensure the risks are managed over their perimeter in order to secure all chain links and  guarantee a holistic cybersecurity approach. The implementation of roles and responsibilities  would need to be supported by establishing a harmonised authorisation process. Integrating  security by design for all products and services is essential, however, security needs to be  considered in a more holistic manner in terms of interactions of products and services  developed by multiple stakeholders, including automotive aftermarket operators, which  essentially affects the end-to-end security of the vehicle over its lifetime, including post-  production. Building an approach where the technical complexity has to be settled between all  the diverging and sometimes competing actors is a major challenge.  Today, users’ needs are increasing in terms of connectivity and they want to get the connected  products and services at the state-of-the-art, at the right time and at a low price. In parallel,  despite the added value of CAM’s emerging technologies for customers and new potential  revenues for the companies of the CAM ecosystem, the complexity of their development,  deployment and adoption has an impact on the scalability of the CAM concept as well as on the  potential ROI for investor and sustainability for companies involved in the CAM ecosystem. The  CAM industry, in its widest sense, is therefore confronted with the complexity of new  technologies requiring skills and knowledge that were not previously managed by the industry,  which are costly and time-consuming to implement. At the same time, the CAM industry needs  to meet the demands of users at a reasonable cost to remain competitive in the market. In this  quite recent context, finding the right balance between innovation, cost management and the  need for security remains an open challenge given the current low budget allocated to  cybersecurity in the CAM industry.  2.3.1 Recommendations  It is evident that technical complexity could lead to the introduction of new attack vectors due to  the whole interaction of the CAM ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, ENISA  recommends:   Promote the use of common security measures across components and services to  adhere to a minimum level of cybersecurity and ensure an appropriate level of security.   Promote the use of suitable certification schemes.   Promote security assessment for both on-board and off-board solutions and  standardise the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities during the lifetime of the  product.   Ensure that the organisation maintains a consistent and up-to-date asset inventory.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  13  The recommendations are targeted at:   National Authorities   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities (RA)  Additionally ENISA recommends:   Consider defining an industry standard to share threat intelligence, report monitoring  outputs and cybersecurity incidents and enable collaboration regarding cybercriminal  activity targeting CAM between ecosystem parties.   Consider applying data security strategies (privacy compliance mechanisms) and  require minimum level of security measures for the whole CAM ecosystem.   Use tools supporting asset management (e.g. servers, software, onboard components)  that can automatically discover, identify and enumerate assets specific to the  organisation of the CAM ecosystem (e.g. tools enabling to constitute a Configuration  Management Database).   Ensure a change management process is implemented in the CAM ecosystem, in  order to verify that evolutions applicable to hardware, software or configuration are  assessed and validated regarding their potential cybersecurity impacts.   Establish cybersecurity requirements and validation methods that are incorporated as  standard deliverables in OEMs’ and suppliers’ development processes, starting from  the concept phase of any new product development.   Incentivise the use of cybersecurity certified components if they exist to bring a better  level of security.   Designate one or several dedicated security team(s) with security specialists having a  diversified and broad range of competencies in security-related topics (e.g. risk  assessment, penetration testing, secure design).   Apply a hardening approach (e.g. measures such as authentication, encryption,  segmentation, filtering, code quality check) on different levels (i.e. devices, network,  back-end, etc.) to reduce the possible attack surface.   Reinforce interfaces’ robustness to, among others, cope with buffer overflows or  fuzzing.   Consider strengthening applications’ isolation at runtime, using trusted software  technologies.   Apply system, sub-domain and network segregation using physical and logical isolation  techniques where appropriate (based on a risk assessment and an appropriate  allocation of rights and roles).   Harden against adversarial attacks, to prevent Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine  Learning (ML) components from being attacked.   Prevent data falsification or manipulation in regard to AI and ML.   Use data redundancy mechanisms (e.g. sensor data fusion) that correlate data  acquired from the different sensors in the system and data obtained via external  communications before making a decision.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarkets Operators   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  14  2.4 TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY  INTO CAM  As the CAM industry is moving towards increased connectivity and automation, the technical  constraints of managing threats relative to the ecosystem also increases. Cybersecurity risks  can be particularly complex to manage for the CAM sector. Risks can be triggered across both  the physical and digital world since both consume and create data, as systems are  communicating with the surrounding ecosystem through different types of short and long range  connectivity. In this context of technological diversity, the adversary model to consider for risk  management may be quite large, meaning that the approach to secure CAM products and  services in order to identify relevant attack paths and implement the right security measures will  require the assessment of a wide variety of systems and technical assets, making it a  consequent approach to secure CAM assets during their conception and development phases.  At the moment, there are few commitments to standardisation of CAM technologies (e.g.  communication protocols, data format), which forces cybersecurity professionals to address and  master different technologies and solutions for similar functions. In addition, for the CAM  ecosystem, there is no holistic end-to-end approach to manage risks, nor a comprehensive  security model to implement for a unified cybersecurity approach of CAM products and services.  As the CAM sector is very innovation-oriented, the continuous evolution and development of  new technologies for CAM assets also involves taking into account particular technical  constraints when it comes to securing the various assets. When taking into account emerging  technologies such as those in CAM, security measures and standards do not yet exist to  provide best practices and guidelines in order to manage risks with state-of-the-art security  measures and solutions acknowledged by the industry. Cybersecurity teams often have to  develop their security features and solutions from scratch for emerging CAM technologies,  making it longer, more complex and costly, as well as potentially more error prone. There are  not yet enough mature ‘on-the-shelf’ solutions to secure connected products, even though new  actors are emerging and propose turn-key cybersecurity solutions for the CAM ecosystem,  though without much feedback on their efficiency.  The new features proposed, for example by electric and autonomous vehicles, infrastructures  such as charging stations or the connectivity with personal devices required for the use of e-  scooters and other free-floating devices, create opportunities for malicious parties to perform  attacks in order to gain access to vehicles’ functions, steal data or ransom users. When  considering the potential impacts for safety and public order, if control is taken over systems at  the scale of a city or a fleet of vehicles, cybersecurity must be a forefront stake, especially in a  context where the threats to consider can come from the nation state or large criminal  organisations. The CAM topic being fairly recent, its cybersecurity industry is not as mature as it  can be for traditional IS/IT. Also, considering the nature of its services and products that are  integrated into the transport sector landscape and can have safety impacts or large operational  impacts for cities flows, cybersecurity experts promote the cybersecurity and privacy by design  approach. Security components, software and hardware, must be removable and replaceable  with compliant parts. Components, or wearing parts, have a lifetime shorter than the vehicle  itself. This approach means that rather than treating cybersecurity subsequently with additional  hardening or detection solutions, it should be addressed in the early conception phases by  ensuring there are no vulnerabilities in the design of services and products. This requires that  the right cybersecurity skills and competences are provided to the R&D and design teams and  that is why the CAM ecosystem is currently making its cybersecurity teams grow.  2.4.1 Recommendations  As stated above, regarding the diversity and complexity of the technologies used in the  ecosystem, there are no standardised solutions for the security of CAM products and services.  In this context where there is a plentiful of constraints, especially cost-based, the engineering of  security solutions shall be addressed at the root of the design, based on a risk analysis  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  15  approach. Hence, to ensure efficiency, in the CAM ecosystem, interoperability, security and  privacy shall be implemented by design and by default. This will enable better flexibility and  usability of the security solutions that will be adapted to their environment by better coping with  functional and technical constraints. These solutions shall be part of a global security model, be  based on a layered approach combining different security solutions guaranteeing the security  properties of the assets, depending on the trust level required (e.g. segmentation of systems  with functions impacting safety, segmentation of physical and digital environment). For each  layer defined and for all relevant parts of the CAM ecosystem, principles of security-by-design,  interoperability-by-design, privacy-by-design and by-default should be applied, based on the  supporting justification and implementation constraints. ENISA published guidelines for good  practices for security of smart cars and cybersecurity and resilience of smart cars4, which is an  additional relevant document to consult. The use of suitable certification schemes is also  recommended, in order to establish mutual trust and to demonstrate the state-of-the-art.  Given the scalability of the CAM ecosystem and its quick technological evolution, the threat  landscape is constantly evolving and requires keeping the cybersecurity response up-to-date by  performing continuous threat intelligence and a watch on the security best practices. In a  context where the assets to secure are owned by customers and remote to the operating  organisation, the ability to provide update/maintenance and incident response capability over  the air will be crucial for a cybersecurity coverage over the full CAM products and services  lifecycles. Threat modelling should be used to discover relevant threat scenarios as well as  related trust boundaries for which appropriate security measures should be devised.  In terms of applying measures to ensure CAM security and mitigate technical constraints,  ENISA recommends:   Define a security model for CAM products and services based on a methodological risk  assessment.   Ensure commitment to use of standard and/or common components   Ensure proper implementation of relevant security measures following risk assessment  and ensure the risk assessment is kept current for CAM products and services over  their lifecycles.   Implement common rules for all stakeholders, including a risk assessment method,  design principles, a set of security measures and information security policy, all of  which ensure that there is harmonisation, trust and clear roles and duties in the CAM  ecosystem.   Apply principles of security-by-design by default for all CAM components, devices,  services, protocols, communications and processes.   Perform validation tests and penetration tests to ensure that the security objectives are  met for CAM products and services according to the risk assessment.   Assess the maturity of implemented cybersecurity solutions periodically and  collaborate with pairs and partners on cybersecurity state-of-the-art for CAM product  and services.   Implement an overall cybersecurity incident response structure to deal with and  monitor the ongoing and emerging threat landscape.   Establish a continual and secured updatability and upgradability of CAM products and  services as a central security mechanism in their lifecycles.   Ensure the compatibility of security measures taken by OEMs and ISPs developing  software functionality that may be added retro-actively, after the vehicle enters into  service.   Enable ability to perform incident response using failsafe mechanisms for CAM  products and services with failsafe as guiding principle.  4 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cars  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cars  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  16   Keep track of developments in cybersecurity standards and best practices for the CAM  ecosystem.   Use suitable certification schemes in order to establish mutual trust and to demonstrate  the state-of-the-art.   Update the threat models regularly when new threats are discovered.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.5 FRAGMENTED REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  In the context of innovation and rapid development of CAM technologies, one of the key  challenges in the CAM sector is the number of standards and regulations to comply with.  Standardisation and regulatory environments are evolving internationally, generating new  requirements for the industry regarding connectivity and autonomous capabilities. Regulators  rely on these standards to provide more precision on the intended way to comply with their  regulations. In Europe, regulations tend to be harmonised for the Member States, but some  specific regulations exist per country. For example in Germany, large cities have to get their  information security management system (ISMS) audited every two years by the National IT  Security Agency (BSI).5  With regard to UNECE (the main regulatory body impacting the automotive and mobility sector),  its requirements bind almost all countries in the world, nevertheless, type approval mechanisms  differ around the world. UNECE regulations, in addition to various other regulations (e.g.  privacy, telecommunication), make it difficult for OEMs and suppliers to streamline their security  actions and deploy a single strategy across their entire product and service range. The lack of  streamlined regulations at the global level leads to a situation where an organisation is subject  to different schemes for a same product range.  The current landscape of standards related to CAM cybersecurity is quite broad, since  traditional aspects of security are followed such as risk management, vulnerability management,  threat analysis, detection and reaction (e.g. ISO270356), but also specific aspects of CAM  industry processes with regulations and standards for type approval of vehicles (e.g. ISO/SAE  214347, ISO262628, SAEJ30619, ISO2117710, ISO2118411 and ISO2118512) also standards for  intelligent transport systems communications (e.g. ETSI TC ITS13 and IEEE802.11bd14) as well  as common criteria (ISO/IEC 1540815). Some of the recommendations provided by these  5 See more at: https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html  6 See more at: https://iso27001security.com/html/27035.html  7 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  8 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html  9 See more at: https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3061/  10 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70056.html  11 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70057.html  12 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70058.html  13 See more at: https://www.etsi.org/technologies/automotive-intelligent-transport  14 See more at: https://www.car-2-car.org/documents/publications/ieee-80211bd-5g-nr-v2x/  15 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws- regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408  https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html https://iso27001security.com/html/27035.html https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html https://www.iso.org/standard/68383.html https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3061/ https://www.iso.org/standard/70056.html https://www.iso.org/standard/70057.html https://www.iso.org/standard/70058.html https://www.etsi.org/technologies/automotive-intelligent-transport https://www.car-2-car.org/documents/publications/ieee-80211bd-5g-nr-v2x/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/threat-risk-management/risk-management/current-risk/laws-regulation/rm-ra-standards/iso-iec-standard-15408  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  17  standards sometimes create overlaps since they can be proposed in two different standards  (e.g. between ISO2700116 and ISO/SAE 2143417 or between ISO21434 and ISO2626218).  In addition, associations, groups (e.g. Auto-Isac19, OCA20, EuroRAP21) or the European  Commission and European agencies, such as ENISA, provide high-level reference documents,  as well as baselines, good practices and general guidance for the development of CAM  products and systems. Many of these documents are process-oriented or limited to a restricted  area (e.g. embedded systems) and are therefore not prescriptive as to the exact technical  solution to be used or end-to-end security model. For example, with respect to vulnerability  management and penetration testing on embedded systems, no common criteria or methods  are proposed to streamline vocabulary and practices in the same way as is done for IT systems  with Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score22. This leads to heterogeneity and a  wide variety of methodologies, security systems and solutions being developed and  implemented by companies and their suppliers. In addition, this heterogeneity and freedom of  implementation results in a lack of necessary information required for other affected  stakeholders in the CAM ecosystem to effectively implement their cybersecurity strategies.  However, the recently published standards and regulations, and ongoing work within CAM  associations, will tend to foster harmonisation within the CAM ecosystem and a better ability to  streamline the implementation of various standards.  2.5.1 Recommendations  To harmonise efforts on the regulatory environment and to define responsibilities/requirements  for the complete CAM ecosystem, ENISA recommends:   Ensure a homogeneous, detailed, and stable legal EU environment for CAM  cybersecurity to allow all stakeholders to plan long-term, sustainable business  strategies including the aspect of security.   Working across all levels of policy-making (incl. governmental and European) to  participate in the development of new, harmonised laws and guidance to provide clarity  on national standards and responsibilities, and to reduce barriers to innovation while  promoting secure product and service development.   Conduct analyses on current automotive regulations to examine potential gaps, i.e.  whether existing regulations adequately address the CAM ecosystem security  requirements.   Promote multi-stakeholder dialogues between the automotive industry actors to ensure  consensus in the development of relevant technical standards and regulations.   Foster commitment to standardisation activities addressing holistically the automotive  industry security, including interoperability, that include relevant actors involved in the  post-production phase such as automotive aftermarket operators.   Conduct analyses on current automotive standards to examine potential gaps, i.e.  whether existing standards adequately address the CAM ecosystem security  requirements.   Develop and maintain mapping schemes between standardisation activities (such as  the ones by ENISA and UNECE) to explore cross-standard commonalities and  synergies.   Launch funding schemes to support cybersecurity initiatives in the CAM ecosystem,  including financial support for cooperative actions such as standardisation activities.   Consider measures ensuring proper implementation of standards and requirements.  16 See more at: https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  17 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  18 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html  19 Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

The recommendations are targeted at:   National Authorities   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities  2.6 LACK OF EXPERTISE AND SKILLED RESOURCES FOR CAM  CYBERSECURITY  The lack of human resources with expertise in cybersecurity on the market is a major obstacle  that hinders the adoption of security measures specific to CAM products and solutions.  Cybersecurity experts required for the development and management of CAM products and  new solutions should have knowledge, in addition to their expertise of IT security in general, in  several further areas such as software security, network security, cryptography, embedded  systems, and operational technology (OT). Moreover, in the different fields of technical  expertise, there are various types of cybersecurity competences necessary to secure CAM  products and services. Considering the lifecycle of CAM, cybersecurity profiles will be needed  for different types of activities with various degrees of technical expertise for risk  management/assessment, project management and reporting, conception of security features,  definition of technical requirements and specifications, penetration testing, threat intelligence,  incident detection, response, forensic and so on. There is not one kind of cybersecurity expert  for CAM, but companies are looking for a good mix of technical and methodological knowledge  in order to address all the cybersecurity problematics they have to cope with.  Given the large number of companies looking for these types of expertise, there is strong  competition to recruit qualified cybersecurity resources who already have expertise in CAM  topics, which makes it difficult for companies to find new talents on the market. The concurrence  for hiring or contracting cybersecurity profiles with the skillset adapted to the CAM needs  increase the costs, which makes cybersecurity resources expensive. Also, most CAM  stakeholders confirmed that it is difficult to find qualified specialists who are familiar with security  issues within their companies. In addition, there are too few cybersecurity training and  awareness programmes already in place within companies that could lead to the scaling up of  other IT or engineering resources on cybersecurity-related topics. Lacking expertise and  familiarity with these technologies, employees thus also lack skills that are essential for the  secure development and operation of CAM products and solutions. The interviews conducted as  part of this study confirmed that there is a high demand and low supply of talent in the area of  cybersecurity in the CAM sector. Hence, companies started to train internal resources with a  previous experience either in IS/IT, OT or embedded systems to cybersecurity in order to  instantiate a cybersecurity knowledge ramp-up and employees’ mobility programme in order to  compensate the resource shortage on the market.  2.6.1 Recommendations  Security expertise and guidance for the CAM ecosystem is of paramount importance. To  address the lack of security talent, it is essential to cultivate such knowledge both within and  across organisational boundaries. Persons in charge of security within the industry  organisations should invest in state-of-the-art dedicated cybersecurity trainings that cover all  necessary aspects specific to IT and CAM convergence. Lastly, trainings and courses at  schools and universities have been launched to further promote a better understanding of the  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  19  automotive industry security among younger generations and thus, in the long term, will  contribute to raising awareness.  To promote cross-functional knowledge on security expertise and guidance, ENISA  recommends:   Encourage cross-functional security and safety knowledge exchange between IT/OT  and mobility experts respectively.   Launch security education and trainings in mobility industries, including knowledge of  the state-of-the-art, best practices, methodologies and tools for secure convergence of  IT/OT and mobility systems.   Establish tailor-made training courses focussed on mobility industry security to  increase the effectiveness of the trainings and assist mobility and IT/OT security  experts to address relevant cybersecurity issues more efficiently.   Develop competency profiles to provide mobility industry-specific awareness and  education training for all staff.   Introduce programmes at schools and universities to address the lack of security and  safety knowledge across the industry and to empower the next generation of IT/OT  and mobility security experts.   Organise cyber-culture and cyber-hygiene introduction courses for personnel and  conversely safety-culture and safety-hygiene courses all personnel, especially IT/OT  staff. Introduce the notion of security and the notion of safety, with special mentions to  cases where the two notions may or may not align.   Extend the courses to the whole supply chain, or require that all parts of it have  cybersecurity training included in their companies.   Enhance corporate culture to include cybersecurity in job profiles, and to attract and  retain security talents/experts.   Participate in information exchange programs such as Information Sharing and  Analysis Centres (ISACs)23 to further increase information knowledge and exchange of  good practices.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   National Authorities   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities (RA)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.7 LACK OF INFORMATION SHARING AND COORDINATION ON  SECURITY ISSUES AMONG THE CAM ACTORS  The CAM sector is one of the largest generators of data. For example, a self-driving vehicle is  expected to generate and consume 40 terabytes of data every 8 hours of driving, giving a hint of  the amount of data that will be generated at the scale of a smart city or road infrastructures.24  Data is evolving as a key production factor, and large data applications enable stakeholders  23 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  24 Barua, Suhrid. (n.d.). Flood of Data Will Get Generated in Autonomous Cars. Auto Tech Review. Retrieved from:  https://autotechreview.com/features/flood-of-data-will-get-generated-in-autonomous-cars  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing https://autotechreview.com/features/flood-of-data-will-get-generated-in-autonomous-cars  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  20  such as car manufacturers, suppliers, automotive aftermarket operators, service providers,  transport operators and public authorities to utilise consumers’, infrastructures’ and vehicles’  information to provide modern mobility services. In the consideration that all types of data, let it  be from vehicles, free-floating devices or road infrastructures are going to be exchanged and  shared among CAM actors, within the boundaries of data protection and privacy regulation like  the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)25 and the forthcoming ePrivacy Directive26, this  implies the implementation of cybersecurity measures, protocols and standards to secure the  exchange itself. Considering data access and exchange within the ecosystem, trust between  parties and data governance is a key challenge to address in order to implement a secure and  lasting model. Such models need to be supported with establishing a pan-European  authentication and authorisation scheme based on clearly defined roles and responsibilities, to  ensure that every CAM stakeholder has the possibility to access the required vehicle data,  functions and resources in a safe and secure way.  Considering cybersecurity, one of the current challenges is the lack of visibility and sharing of  information within the ecosystem on evolving attacks and threats. Since CAM products and  services delivery rely on multiple interactions between different actors, as mentioned earlier,  one stakeholder may need to access data or information related to cybersecurity operations of  another stakeholder. This could be insightful for its own cybersecurity operations and protection  of its perimeter, and vice-versa. This need is particularly noteworthy in the interactions between  a company and its supplier where collaboration, information sharing about incidents and  discovered vulnerabilities, collective implementation of security measures or shared threat  intelligence will be decisive for the efficiency of cyber security operations. However, it is also  important to note that the impact of cybersecurity is at the whole vehicle level and at the level of  interaction between components and services managed by different actors within the CAM  ecosystem. The cohesive interdependent nature of the vehicle, its components and services,  require that in addition to incidents and vulnerabilities, additional information regarding  cybersecurity compatibility and interoperability be shared among the relevant stakeholders of  the CAM ecosystem. Such information sharing is of paramount importance to ensure that  components and services implemented within the vehicle architecture by multiple CAM  stakeholders are still able to function as required in a safe and secure way.  This challenge is also linked to the problem of interoperability. With the massive development of  solutions and to ensure a system of interconnected transport infrastructures, CAM actors should  have the possibility to share information about, among others, their new solutions,  developments and technologies. CAM actors confirmed that there are many solutions  developed in the world that are not interoperable which should be standardised in order to  achieve a more global solution in Europe, and to ensure business continuity of all CAM  stakeholders in the automotive sector. Where there are interdependencies between products  and services developed by multiple CAM stakeholders, in addition to perimeter level  cybersecurity considerations, there should be an information sharing mechanism (at European  level - supported by legislation) to ensure that these products and services can be developed  and integrated with the products in a safe and secure way. Changes or updates to cybersecurity  requirements of one CAM stakeholder, that affects the cybersecurity and functioning of the  components and services of other CAM stakeholders need to be communicated to all relevant  CAM stakeholders.  25 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive  95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

The  starting point is smaller groups of stakeholders that grow into establishing cross-  connections throughout the remainder of the ecosystem to further enrich the  information available.   Consider exploring cooperation with Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRT) communities, including the European CSIRTs Network27.   Consider involving the right stakeholders in the ISACs, including but not limited to EU  agencies and bodies, law enforcement agencies, other industry bodies, as well as  associations and telecom operators.   Consider creating interfaces of cooperation with other sectorial actors and EU-wide  ISACs to exchange good practices for information sharing, as well as knowledge on  attacks and threats that might be relevant for the CAM industry (especially the  automotive supply chain).   Ensure legally that relevant cybersecurity compatibility information (for development  and system integration) from relevant CAM stakeholders are be provided to all  authorised CAM stakeholders, as required upon request. This information sharing is  necessary as the information shared in ISACs only relates to cyber-threats, attacks  and good practices for internal development, but does not include cybersecurity-  relevant information for producing and replacing parts, and conducting repair and  maintenance operations.   Adapt industry standards or minimum requirements covering cybersecurity information  interoperability to ensure all stakeholders are at a minimum level of security.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers,  27 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  T P  0 4  2 0  6 3  8 E  N N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

Under a new  regulation set by the United Nations2, car manufacturers are required to secure vehicles against  cyberattacks. In the European Union, the new regulation on cybersecurity will be mandatory for  all new vehicle types from July 2022 and will become mandatory for all new vehicles produced  from July 2024.3 Moreover, the UNECE Regulation and related ISO standards apply to all CAM  stakeholders who must ensure that their products and services conform to cybersecurity goals.  Increased connectivity and technological development in the ecosystem through various  services, components and technologies are continuously expanding. Therefore, within the CAM  sector, where innovation and market growth are expanding, global players in the CAM sector  face a risk of cyberattacks. Connected services may be attacked by cyber-attackers and create  cyber fraud, data breach and privacy incidents, as well as software overrides resulting in  dangerous situations and accidents when part of the vehicle to everything (V2X) network is  attacked, thereby threatening the drivers, road users and companies. Efforts across the whole  industry should be made to ensure that even if one system is compromised and/or tampered,  the rest of the systems remain unaffected.  The interlinking of systems and services (both inside and outside the vehicle) and thus  intelligent and connected mobility are already revolutionising users’ lives. The whole ecosystem  involved in the CAM lifecycle has to cope with key challenges that add complexity to responding  and managing CAM cybersecurity risks. Today, connected vehicles, connected environment  and connected infrastructure should be designed with new capabilities and features that have  the potential to provide increased safety, better vehicle performance, competitive digital  products and services, more comfort, environmental friendliness, as well as convenience for its  end-users. Governments, manufacturers, private companies (incl. SMEs and start-ups) as well  as IT enterprises are all involved in the future development of intelligent and connected and  automated mobility. Fixed and mobile telecommunication infrastructure is necessary for cars to  communicate with the smart road infrastructure (I2V and V2I), with devices (V2D), between  vehicles (V2V), with other networks such as access to cloud infrastructure (V2N) as well as  within the vehicle.  The aim of this report is to provide a high-level overview of the cybersecurity challenges in the  CAM sector and to highlight both the concerned CAM actors and associated recommendations.  Cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem is partially standardised and the role of standards is widely  recognised. All stakeholders’ contributions to the CAM ecosystem are intertwined. Standards  and regulations are often not adopted uniformly worldwide, and therefore some countries may  advance faster than others in building a safe and secure cybersecurity system around CAM  infrastructure. In the context of growing cybersecurity threats and concerns about cybersecurity  and data protection, this report aims to identify the main challenges in the current situation and  to propose actionable recommendations for the different stakeholders involved in the CAM  ecosystem to enhance the level of security and resilience of CAM infrastructures and systems in  Europe. Challenges in the CAM ecosystem arise from the whole lifecycle, therefore this report  1 Connected and automated mobility in Europe. European Commission.

The  recommendations proposed by ENISA aim to guide all CAM ecosystem stakeholders and to  contribute to the improvement and harmonisation of cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem in the  European Union.  Using a layered approach of primary and secondary research, this report summarises insights  across a complex CAM ecosystem. Primary research methods included a survey and a series of  interviews and validation discussions with key stakeholders from the CAM ecosystem.  Secondary research methods included desktop research of works of ENISA, official statistics,  academic research, external studies and official documents, white papers, legislation, policies,  strategies and initiatives to identify challenges and lessons learnt on cyber incidents against the  CAM ecosystem.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  8  2. CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGES  AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE  CAM AREA  2.1 GOVERNANCE AND CYBERSECURITY INTEGRATION INTO  CORPORATE ACTIVITIES  Cybersecurity governance in the CAM ecosystem represents an organisational and technical  challenge for all stakeholders within it. The emergence of CAM where digital technology and  connectivity encounter the physical world of transportation involves the definition of a  cybersecurity approach that answers the specific needs and constraints of CAM. In the CAM  environment, there are:   Connected services and off-board systems that are characterised by agile  development cycles involving the continuous evolution of services following staggered  releases, a large number of short-term projects generally based on scalable and  modular cloud architectures which are managed by Information System  (IS)/Information Technology (IT) teams or hosting services providers.   Various physical infrastructures, equipment, products and associated services,  vehicles and soft-mobility devices based on Operational Technology (OT),  electrics/electronics (E/E) architectures and on-board systems managed by  engineering teams, which are characterised by a much longer development cycle and  which must meet the security and technical requirements associated with various  types of quality validations or regulatory approvals (e.g. vehicle type approval).  The above two different parts of the environment have an impact on cybersecurity and its  integration into development projects as well as broadly into corporate activities. This new  relation between teams evolving into the digital world, and ‘historic’ teams developing and  operating physical products is a challenge in terms of collaboration, which does not ease  cybersecurity governance. Developments on each side can affect the security of the other side,  thereby making the risk approach holistic which has proven to be challenging in environments  where a clearly stated and efficient governance has not yet been put in place.  The different actors of the CAM ecosystem, from international companies to start-ups, have  started to tackle this new model. Indeed, companies have started to grow new expertise, skills  and competences, enabling the integration of digital into the transport sector by hiring new  profiles, transferring competences and opening up internally. Companies have also started  collaborating with partners, start-ups and other suppliers that could provide the required  expertise. However, for the larger structures, it has been more difficult to implement this new  model of governance requiring the mastery of digital and IT technologies in their research and  development (R&D) and core processes considering their size, thereby generating inertia for  organisational change.  The introduction of new skills within existing entities or through new entities is necessary to  adapt organisations and to clarify roles and responsibilities vis-à-vis these new capabilities. In  this context, the roles and responsibilities of employees regarding cybersecurity within the  different entities are not clearly defined, creating a gap in the capacity to deal with security-  related issues. In addition, a seamless integration of security activities into the execution of core  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  9  business activities is directly related to the lack of concern for cybersecurity. If cybersecurity  becomes a core business objective, businesses would become integrated and prepared to rely  more effectively on cybersecurity teams to manage their risks and address potential  vulnerabilities. Responsibility and accountability for security needs to be clearly defined for the  various stakeholders, which is generally not the case. This is directly linked to the lack of  cybersecurity integration into the corporate strategy and business planning, associated to lack  of awareness and trainings to corporate resources, as well as the legislative requirements that  need to be adapted.  2.1.1 Recommendations  Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, and when considering CAM products and services, this  becomes even more of a reality because their security and privacy are part of the very core  business value. Software and data are integrated into objects designed and engineered to  provide mobility and transport services using on-board and off-board systems with very specific  technologies. In the CAM ecosystem, cybersecurity shall not be seen as a standalone topic that  provides requirements and expertise beside other engineering, development and operations  teams. It should be seen as a core enabler that protects safety and provides value to products  and services, and is integrated in the lifecycles of products’ and services’ activities.  At all stages of CAM products’ and services’ lifecycles, risks must be managed, and  cybersecurity activities performed. It shall be the responsibility of product and process owners to  ensure that, by relying on the security expertise and resources provided by their organisation,  the risks related to their activity is well assessed and treated. Cybersecurity must become part  of the core business of an organisation in the delivery of its activities.  To foster better governance and integration of cybersecurity into corporate activities, ENISA  recommends to:   Raise awareness to the top management level of the organisation, where appropriate,  about the impact of cybersecurity and technology on the CAM ecosystem lifecycle.   Raise awareness throughout the organisation, and especially at the right decision level  within the company or group, about the impact of cybersecurity and technology on the  CAM ecosystem lifecycle.   Promote the integration of cybersecurity along with digital transformation at the board  level in the organisation.   Advise on fast-moving business and technology topics such as cybersecurity on a  permanent basis at board level of the organisation.   Promote the acceleration of cybersecurity in research and development spending on  CAM technology to keep up with cybersecurity developments.   Promote procurement processes to integrate cybersecurity risk-oriented requirements.   Address cybersecurity skills to keep up with the creative (e.g. design thinking) skills  that the company’s strategy aims to foster.   Define clear roles and responsibilities regarding cybersecurity within the organisation,  not only for the cybersecurity branch, but also the relevant business and corporate  functions, up to the global risk owner for the product, system or service.   Take into regard the cybersecurity needs of both business and supporting processes  according to the cybersecurity risks of assets handled by such processes.   Define a risk management process enabling risk assessment, treatment decision and  ownership over the product/service lifecycle.   Consider cybersecurity activities in projects and business planning, by establishing  collaboration schemes between different teams (e.g. business and cybersecurity).  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  10  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Mobility Services Providers   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.2 LACK OF TOP MANAGEMENT SUPPORT AND CYBERSECURITY  PRIORITISATION  In the complex context of CAM, cybersecurity has generally not been considered a priority by  corporate management in the CAM industry. So far, cybersecurity has not been perceived as a  board-level topic. Indeed, not all organisations of the CAM ecosystem are involving the  corporate management in cybersecurity problematics. Furthermore, cybersecurity executives  have few interactions with corporate executives which is why it is so shallowly integrated into  the global strategy and objectives of companies. As a primary consequence, the lack of  management involvement leads to insufficient financial support to ensure cybersecurity is  addressed as a key topic in the lifecycle of CAM products and services. Also, the lack of  cybersecurity consideration that involves cybersecurity strategic planning is generally not as  robust as it should be. It also makes it difficult for the teams in charge of cybersecurity to obtain  enough resources for R&D, to deploy awareness and training programs, as well as to carry out  operational activities in the most effective manner. Hence, the cybersecurity dimension is rarely  anticipated and integrated into business planning since business priorities tend to focus  primarily on innovation, quality, cost, and time-to-market rather than on cybersecurity. However,  with the emergence of legislation and requirements from national and international regulatory  bodies for CAM cybersecurity, such as the General Vehicle Safety Regulation (GSR) from the  European Commission that will enforce the UNECE WP29 cybersecurity regulation for  European countries as of 2022. It regulates that vehicles will have to comply with applicable  cybersecurity regulations and standards in order to be put on the market. The UNECE  regulation however covers just part of the CAM ecosystem, providing only qualitative  requirements and does not include all stakeholders.  In addition to the low consideration of cybersecurity in corporate management, most of the  stakeholders interviewed ranked the financial resources available for cybersecurity as a main  challenge to enable the teams to carry out state-of-the-art activities and effectively address all  identified risks. The budget allocation of companies is generally based on the estimated Return  on Investment (ROI) of business activities and it is sometimes acknowledged that the difficulty  of calculating the ROI of budgets allocated to cybersecurity is the reason why companies limit  their investments. The impact of cybersecurity on increasing revenues or optimising costs  generally remains uncertain for companies in the CAM industry. Regulatory aspects might tend  to rationalise the perception of cybersecurity ROI since it is becoming a requirement to be  integrated in the products’ and services’ planning and lifecycle.  In the context of quickly increasing development of CAM products and services, as well as a  regulatory landscape that becomes demanding regarding cybersecurity, a lack of cybersecurity  consideration can significantly impact companies’ operations and reputations which can lead to  severe safety impacts or financial loss.  Regarding the complexity of the CAM ecosystem and of its services and products, implementing  cybersecurity in an efficient way requires implementing an adequate strategy and associated  funding for its deployment. To foster success, the cybersecurity strategy must not be built in a  standalone manner but streamlined with the business strategy in order to make it realistic and  capitalise on synergies. Hence the cybersecurity strategy must be acknowledged and supported  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  11  by top management as an enabler to the satisfying development and operations of CAM  products and services.  2.2.1 Recommendations  To build a strategy, a mind-set shift is required so that cybersecurity is not seen as a cost and  pure loss of money that may avoid potential risks, but as a real enabler of important business  opportunities made possible by the mastering of technologies. Cybersecurity allows to reduce  time to market and provide state-of-the-art products and services to customers that are secure,  reliable and trustworthy. In order to follow the technological developments, adequate budgets  must be devoted for cybersecurity innovation and R&D activities, as well as ensured for  cybersecurity operations such as security maintenance, detection and reaction activities.  Since new regulations will enforce to perform risk management activities and ensure products’  and services’ security, CAM actors shall transform this constraint into an opportunity to add  value to their deliveries by making the process more robust and by raising the quality of their  products and services through security and privacy.  To foster better prioritisation of cybersecurity by corporate leads and better funding and budget  allocation of cybersecurity, ENISA recommends:   Establish administrative structures for top-level management to discuss and exchange  views with cybersecurity experts and CISOs.   Incentivise innovation and R&D activities for securing IT and CAM environments,  components, systems and services.   Promote the aspect of security in companies’ business strategies by learning from  automotive industry practices.   Consider the development of certification schemes for automotive industry security  (taking into account the inherent particularities when defining the target of evaluation),  in order to promote harmonisation of the market, increase consumer trust and open up  new business opportunities.   Foster a corporate security culture by involving cybersecurity directly in the  management board.   Establish regular training programmes for the different levels of the company, including  top management, in order to bring awareness on cybersecurity legal requirements as  well as possible threats, risks and security measures.   Develop targeted cybersecurity information and certification schemes for SMEs in the  automotive aftermarket and servicing sector.   Define common requirements and responsibilities for all stakeholders involved in the  CAM ecosystem.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.3 TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY IN THE CAM ECOSYSTEM  In the mobility and transportation sector, the number of actors and tiers interacting is important.  The multiplicity of stakeholders involved around infrastructures, connected services and  products along the value chain leads to different challenges concerning the implementation and  management of cybersecurity and efficient risk management. Dependencies, interactions and  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  12  supply chain management in this sector are a well-known challenge acknowledged by the  majority of the actors involved.  For instance, the delivery of a service such as public transportation will involve a vehicle  manufacturer and all its supply chain: a public transport operator, its suppliers and partners for  operations and maintenance, the road and public authorities and management, insurance  companies, interactions with other road users, automotive aftermarket operators, service  providers, and so on. In this landscape where the products, services and operations of each  stakeholder can affect the security of the end users, the products and the companies involved, a  comprehensive and commonly acknowledged cybersecurity alignment is needed in terms of  legal, technical and practical aspects between parties. The dependencies between stakeholders  generates a need for interoperability, which will stem from the cybersecurity model. It starts by  defining and sharing roles and responsibilities that raises a need of alignment of role and  responsibility principles within the ecosystem, and a continuous cybersecurity information  sharing between stakeholders. Clarifying roles and responsibilities is one of the enablers to  define and implement security by design for products and services, where all stakeholders  ensure the risks are managed over their perimeter in order to secure all chain links and  guarantee a holistic cybersecurity approach. The implementation of roles and responsibilities  would need to be supported by establishing a harmonised authorisation process. Integrating  security by design for all products and services is essential, however, security needs to be  considered in a more holistic manner in terms of interactions of products and services  developed by multiple stakeholders, including automotive aftermarket operators, which  essentially affects the end-to-end security of the vehicle over its lifetime, including post-  production. Building an approach where the technical complexity has to be settled between all  the diverging and sometimes competing actors is a major challenge.  Today, users’ needs are increasing in terms of connectivity and they want to get the connected  products and services at the state-of-the-art, at the right time and at a low price. In parallel,  despite the added value of CAM’s emerging technologies for customers and new potential  revenues for the companies of the CAM ecosystem, the complexity of their development,  deployment and adoption has an impact on the scalability of the CAM concept as well as on the  potential ROI for investor and sustainability for companies involved in the CAM ecosystem. The  CAM industry, in its widest sense, is therefore confronted with the complexity of new  technologies requiring skills and knowledge that were not previously managed by the industry,  which are costly and time-consuming to implement. At the same time, the CAM industry needs  to meet the demands of users at a reasonable cost to remain competitive in the market. In this  quite recent context, finding the right balance between innovation, cost management and the  need for security remains an open challenge given the current low budget allocated to  cybersecurity in the CAM industry.  2.3.1 Recommendations  It is evident that technical complexity could lead to the introduction of new attack vectors due to  the whole interaction of the CAM ecosystem. To overcome these challenges, ENISA  recommends:   Promote the use of common security measures across components and services to  adhere to a minimum level of cybersecurity and ensure an appropriate level of security.   Promote the use of suitable certification schemes.   Promote security assessment for both on-board and off-board solutions and  standardise the discovery and remediation of vulnerabilities during the lifetime of the  product.   Ensure that the organisation maintains a consistent and up-to-date asset inventory.  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  13  The recommendations are targeted at:   National Authorities   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities (RA)  Additionally ENISA recommends:   Consider defining an industry standard to share threat intelligence, report monitoring  outputs and cybersecurity incidents and enable collaboration regarding cybercriminal  activity targeting CAM between ecosystem parties.   Consider applying data security strategies (privacy compliance mechanisms) and  require minimum level of security measures for the whole CAM ecosystem.   Use tools supporting asset management (e.g. servers, software, onboard components)  that can automatically discover, identify and enumerate assets specific to the  organisation of the CAM ecosystem (e.g. tools enabling to constitute a Configuration  Management Database).   Ensure a change management process is implemented in the CAM ecosystem, in  order to verify that evolutions applicable to hardware, software or configuration are  assessed and validated regarding their potential cybersecurity impacts.   Establish cybersecurity requirements and validation methods that are incorporated as  standard deliverables in OEMs’ and suppliers’ development processes, starting from  the concept phase of any new product development.   Incentivise the use of cybersecurity certified components if they exist to bring a better  level of security.   Designate one or several dedicated security team(s) with security specialists having a  diversified and broad range of competencies in security-related topics (e.g. risk  assessment, penetration testing, secure design).   Apply a hardening approach (e.g. measures such as authentication, encryption,  segmentation, filtering, code quality check) on different levels (i.e. devices, network,  back-end, etc.) to reduce the possible attack surface.   Reinforce interfaces’ robustness to, among others, cope with buffer overflows or  fuzzing.   Consider strengthening applications’ isolation at runtime, using trusted software  technologies.   Apply system, sub-domain and network segregation using physical and logical isolation  techniques where appropriate (based on a risk assessment and an appropriate  allocation of rights and roles).   Harden against adversarial attacks, to prevent Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine  Learning (ML) components from being attacked.   Prevent data falsification or manipulation in regard to AI and ML.   Use data redundancy mechanisms (e.g. sensor data fusion) that correlate data  acquired from the different sensors in the system and data obtained via external  communications before making a decision.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarkets Operators   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  14  2.4 TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF SECURITY  INTO CAM  As the CAM industry is moving towards increased connectivity and automation, the technical  constraints of managing threats relative to the ecosystem also increases. Cybersecurity risks  can be particularly complex to manage for the CAM sector. Risks can be triggered across both  the physical and digital world since both consume and create data, as systems are  communicating with the surrounding ecosystem through different types of short and long range  connectivity. In this context of technological diversity, the adversary model to consider for risk  management may be quite large, meaning that the approach to secure CAM products and  services in order to identify relevant attack paths and implement the right security measures will  require the assessment of a wide variety of systems and technical assets, making it a  consequent approach to secure CAM assets during their conception and development phases.  At the moment, there are few commitments to standardisation of CAM technologies (e.g.  communication protocols, data format), which forces cybersecurity professionals to address and  master different technologies and solutions for similar functions. In addition, for the CAM  ecosystem, there is no holistic end-to-end approach to manage risks, nor a comprehensive  security model to implement for a unified cybersecurity approach of CAM products and services.  As the CAM sector is very innovation-oriented, the continuous evolution and development of  new technologies for CAM assets also involves taking into account particular technical  constraints when it comes to securing the various assets. When taking into account emerging  technologies such as those in CAM, security measures and standards do not yet exist to  provide best practices and guidelines in order to manage risks with state-of-the-art security  measures and solutions acknowledged by the industry. Cybersecurity teams often have to  develop their security features and solutions from scratch for emerging CAM technologies,  making it longer, more complex and costly, as well as potentially more error prone. There are  not yet enough mature ‘on-the-shelf’ solutions to secure connected products, even though new  actors are emerging and propose turn-key cybersecurity solutions for the CAM ecosystem,  though without much feedback on their efficiency.  The new features proposed, for example by electric and autonomous vehicles, infrastructures  such as charging stations or the connectivity with personal devices required for the use of e-  scooters and other free-floating devices, create opportunities for malicious parties to perform  attacks in order to gain access to vehicles’ functions, steal data or ransom users. When  considering the potential impacts for safety and public order, if control is taken over systems at  the scale of a city or a fleet of vehicles, cybersecurity must be a forefront stake, especially in a  context where the threats to consider can come from the nation state or large criminal  organisations. The CAM topic being fairly recent, its cybersecurity industry is not as mature as it  can be for traditional IS/IT. Also, considering the nature of its services and products that are  integrated into the transport sector landscape and can have safety impacts or large operational  impacts for cities flows, cybersecurity experts promote the cybersecurity and privacy by design  approach. Security components, software and hardware, must be removable and replaceable  with compliant parts. Components, or wearing parts, have a lifetime shorter than the vehicle  itself. This approach means that rather than treating cybersecurity subsequently with additional  hardening or detection solutions, it should be addressed in the early conception phases by  ensuring there are no vulnerabilities in the design of services and products. This requires that  the right cybersecurity skills and competences are provided to the R&D and design teams and  that is why the CAM ecosystem is currently making its cybersecurity teams grow.  2.4.1 Recommendations  As stated above, regarding the diversity and complexity of the technologies used in the  ecosystem, there are no standardised solutions for the security of CAM products and services.  In this context where there is a plentiful of constraints, especially cost-based, the engineering of  security solutions shall be addressed at the root of the design, based on a risk analysis  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  15  approach. Hence, to ensure efficiency, in the CAM ecosystem, interoperability, security and  privacy shall be implemented by design and by default. This will enable better flexibility and  usability of the security solutions that will be adapted to their environment by better coping with  functional and technical constraints. These solutions shall be part of a global security model, be  based on a layered approach combining different security solutions guaranteeing the security  properties of the assets, depending on the trust level required (e.g. segmentation of systems  with functions impacting safety, segmentation of physical and digital environment). For each  layer defined and for all relevant parts of the CAM ecosystem, principles of security-by-design,  interoperability-by-design, privacy-by-design and by-default should be applied, based on the  supporting justification and implementation constraints. ENISA published guidelines for good  practices for security of smart cars and cybersecurity and resilience of smart cars4, which is an  additional relevant document to consult. The use of suitable certification schemes is also  recommended, in order to establish mutual trust and to demonstrate the state-of-the-art.  Given the scalability of the CAM ecosystem and its quick technological evolution, the threat  landscape is constantly evolving and requires keeping the cybersecurity response up-to-date by  performing continuous threat intelligence and a watch on the security best practices. In a  context where the assets to secure are owned by customers and remote to the operating  organisation, the ability to provide update/maintenance and incident response capability over  the air will be crucial for a cybersecurity coverage over the full CAM products and services  lifecycles. Threat modelling should be used to discover relevant threat scenarios as well as  related trust boundaries for which appropriate security measures should be devised.  In terms of applying measures to ensure CAM security and mitigate technical constraints,  ENISA recommends:   Define a security model for CAM products and services based on a methodological risk  assessment.   Ensure commitment to use of standard and/or common components   Ensure proper implementation of relevant security measures following risk assessment  and ensure the risk assessment is kept current for CAM products and services over  their lifecycles.   Implement common rules for all stakeholders, including a risk assessment method,  design principles, a set of security measures and information security policy, all of  which ensure that there is harmonisation, trust and clear roles and duties in the CAM  ecosystem.   Apply principles of security-by-design by default for all CAM components, devices,  services, protocols, communications and processes.   Perform validation tests and penetration tests to ensure that the security objectives are  met for CAM products and services according to the risk assessment.   Assess the maturity of implemented cybersecurity solutions periodically and  collaborate with pairs and partners on cybersecurity state-of-the-art for CAM product  and services.   Implement an overall cybersecurity incident response structure to deal with and  monitor the ongoing and emerging threat landscape.   Establish a continual and secured updatability and upgradability of CAM products and  services as a central security mechanism in their lifecycles.   Ensure the compatibility of security measures taken by OEMs and ISPs developing  software functionality that may be added retro-actively, after the vehicle enters into  service.   Enable ability to perform incident response using failsafe mechanisms for CAM  products and services with failsafe as guiding principle.  4 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cars  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/smart-cars  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  16   Keep track of developments in cybersecurity standards and best practices for the CAM  ecosystem.   Use suitable certification schemes in order to establish mutual trust and to demonstrate  the state-of-the-art.   Update the threat models regularly when new threats are discovered.

Standardisation and regulatory environments are evolving internationally, generating new  requirements for the industry regarding connectivity and autonomous capabilities. Regulators  rely on these standards to provide more precision on the intended way to comply with their  regulations. In Europe, regulations tend to be harmonised for the Member States, but some  specific regulations exist per country. For example in Germany, large cities have to get their  information security management system (ISMS) audited every two years by the National IT  Security Agency (BSI).5  With regard to UNECE (the main regulatory body impacting the automotive and mobility sector),  its requirements bind almost all countries in the world, nevertheless, type approval mechanisms  differ around the world. UNECE regulations, in addition to various other regulations (e.g.  privacy, telecommunication), make it difficult for OEMs and suppliers to streamline their security  actions and deploy a single strategy across their entire product and service range. The lack of  streamlined regulations at the global level leads to a situation where an organisation is subject  to different schemes for a same product range.  The current landscape of standards related to CAM cybersecurity is quite broad, since  traditional aspects of security are followed such as risk management, vulnerability management,  threat analysis, detection and reaction (e.g. ISO270356), but also specific aspects of CAM  industry processes with regulations and standards for type approval of vehicles (e.g. ISO/SAE  214347, ISO262628, SAEJ30619, ISO2117710, ISO2118411 and ISO2118512) also standards for  intelligent transport systems communications (e.g. ETSI TC ITS13 and IEEE802.11bd14) as well  as common criteria (ISO/IEC 1540815).

In addition, associations, groups (e.g. Auto-Isac19, OCA20, EuroRAP21) or the European  Commission and European agencies, such as ENISA, provide high-level reference documents,  as well as baselines, good practices and general guidance for the development of CAM  products and systems. Many of these documents are process-oriented or limited to a restricted  area (e.g. embedded systems) and are therefore not prescriptive as to the exact technical  solution to be used or end-to-end security model. For example, with respect to vulnerability  management and penetration testing on embedded systems, no common criteria or methods  are proposed to streamline vocabulary and practices in the same way as is done for IT systems  with Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score22. This leads to heterogeneity and a  wide variety of methodologies, security systems and solutions being developed and  implemented by companies and their suppliers. In addition, this heterogeneity and freedom of  implementation results in a lack of necessary information required for other affected  stakeholders in the CAM ecosystem to effectively implement their cybersecurity strategies.  However, the recently published standards and regulations, and ongoing work within CAM  associations, will tend to foster harmonisation within the CAM ecosystem and a better ability to  streamline the implementation of various standards.  2.5.1 Recommendations  To harmonise efforts on the regulatory environment and to define responsibilities/requirements  for the complete CAM ecosystem, ENISA recommends:   Ensure a homogeneous, detailed, and stable legal EU environment for CAM  cybersecurity to allow all stakeholders to plan long-term, sustainable business  strategies including the aspect of security.   Working across all levels of policy-making (incl. governmental and European) to  participate in the development of new, harmonised laws and guidance to provide clarity  on national standards and responsibilities, and to reduce barriers to innovation while  promoting secure product and service development.   Conduct analyses on current automotive regulations to examine potential gaps, i.e.  whether existing regulations adequately address the CAM ecosystem security  requirements.   Promote multi-stakeholder dialogues between the automotive industry actors to ensure  consensus in the development of relevant technical standards and regulations.   Foster commitment to standardisation activities addressing holistically the automotive  industry security, including interoperability, that include relevant actors involved in the  post-production phase such as automotive aftermarket operators.   Conduct analyses on current automotive standards to examine potential gaps, i.e.  whether existing standards adequately address the CAM ecosystem security  requirements.   Develop and maintain mapping schemes between standardisation activities (such as  the ones by ENISA and UNECE) to explore cross-standard commonalities and  synergies.   Launch funding schemes to support cybersecurity initiatives in the CAM ecosystem,  including financial support for cooperative actions such as standardisation activities.   Consider measures ensuring proper implementation of standards and requirements.  16 See more at: https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html  17 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/70918.html  18 See more at: https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html  19 Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

The recommendations are targeted at:   National Authorities   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities  2.6 LACK OF EXPERTISE AND SKILLED RESOURCES FOR CAM  CYBERSECURITY  The lack of human resources with expertise in cybersecurity on the market is a major obstacle  that hinders the adoption of security measures specific to CAM products and solutions.  Cybersecurity experts required for the development and management of CAM products and  new solutions should have knowledge, in addition to their expertise of IT security in general, in  several further areas such as software security, network security, cryptography, embedded  systems, and operational technology (OT). Moreover, in the different fields of technical  expertise, there are various types of cybersecurity competences necessary to secure CAM  products and services. Considering the lifecycle of CAM, cybersecurity profiles will be needed  for different types of activities with various degrees of technical expertise for risk  management/assessment, project management and reporting, conception of security features,  definition of technical requirements and specifications, penetration testing, threat intelligence,  incident detection, response, forensic and so on. There is not one kind of cybersecurity expert  for CAM, but companies are looking for a good mix of technical and methodological knowledge  in order to address all the cybersecurity problematics they have to cope with.  Given the large number of companies looking for these types of expertise, there is strong  competition to recruit qualified cybersecurity resources who already have expertise in CAM  topics, which makes it difficult for companies to find new talents on the market. The concurrence  for hiring or contracting cybersecurity profiles with the skillset adapted to the CAM needs  increase the costs, which makes cybersecurity resources expensive. Also, most CAM  stakeholders confirmed that it is difficult to find qualified specialists who are familiar with security  issues within their companies. In addition, there are too few cybersecurity training and  awareness programmes already in place within companies that could lead to the scaling up of  other IT or engineering resources on cybersecurity-related topics. Lacking expertise and  familiarity with these technologies, employees thus also lack skills that are essential for the  secure development and operation of CAM products and solutions. The interviews conducted as  part of this study confirmed that there is a high demand and low supply of talent in the area of  cybersecurity in the CAM sector. Hence, companies started to train internal resources with a  previous experience either in IS/IT, OT or embedded systems to cybersecurity in order to  instantiate a cybersecurity knowledge ramp-up and employees’ mobility programme in order to  compensate the resource shortage on the market.  2.6.1 Recommendations  Security expertise and guidance for the CAM ecosystem is of paramount importance. To  address the lack of security talent, it is essential to cultivate such knowledge both within and  across organisational boundaries. Persons in charge of security within the industry  organisations should invest in state-of-the-art dedicated cybersecurity trainings that cover all  necessary aspects specific to IT and CAM convergence. Lastly, trainings and courses at  schools and universities have been launched to further promote a better understanding of the  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  19  automotive industry security among younger generations and thus, in the long term, will  contribute to raising awareness.  To promote cross-functional knowledge on security expertise and guidance, ENISA  recommends:   Encourage cross-functional security and safety knowledge exchange between IT/OT  and mobility experts respectively.   Launch security education and trainings in mobility industries, including knowledge of  the state-of-the-art, best practices, methodologies and tools for secure convergence of  IT/OT and mobility systems.   Establish tailor-made training courses focussed on mobility industry security to  increase the effectiveness of the trainings and assist mobility and IT/OT security  experts to address relevant cybersecurity issues more efficiently.   Develop competency profiles to provide mobility industry-specific awareness and  education training for all staff.   Introduce programmes at schools and universities to address the lack of security and  safety knowledge across the industry and to empower the next generation of IT/OT  and mobility security experts.   Organise cyber-culture and cyber-hygiene introduction courses for personnel and  conversely safety-culture and safety-hygiene courses all personnel, especially IT/OT  staff. Introduce the notion of security and the notion of safety, with special mentions to  cases where the two notions may or may not align.   Extend the courses to the whole supply chain, or require that all parts of it have  cybersecurity training included in their companies.   Enhance corporate culture to include cybersecurity in job profiles, and to attract and  retain security talents/experts.   Participate in information exchange programs such as Information Sharing and  Analysis Centres (ISACs)23 to further increase information knowledge and exchange of  good practices.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   National Authorities   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Policy Makers   Regulatory Bodies   Road Authorities (RA)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers  2.7 LACK OF INFORMATION SHARING AND COORDINATION ON  SECURITY ISSUES AMONG THE CAM ACTORS  The CAM sector is one of the largest generators of data. For example, a self-driving vehicle is  expected to generate and consume 40 terabytes of data every 8 hours of driving, giving a hint of  the amount of data that will be generated at the scale of a smart city or road infrastructures.24  Data is evolving as a key production factor, and large data applications enable stakeholders  23 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing  24 Barua, Suhrid. (n.d.). Flood of Data Will Get Generated in Autonomous Cars. Auto Tech Review. Retrieved from:  https://autotechreview.com/features/flood-of-data-will-get-generated-in-autonomous-cars  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/information-sharing https://autotechreview.com/features/flood-of-data-will-get-generated-in-autonomous-cars  RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE SECURITY OF  CONNECTED AND AUTOMATED MOBILITY  May 2021  20  such as car manufacturers, suppliers, automotive aftermarket operators, service providers,  transport operators and public authorities to utilise consumers’, infrastructures’ and vehicles’  information to provide modern mobility services. In the consideration that all types of data, let it  be from vehicles, free-floating devices or road infrastructures are going to be exchanged and  shared among CAM actors, within the boundaries of data protection and privacy regulation like  the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)25 and the forthcoming ePrivacy Directive26, this  implies the implementation of cybersecurity measures, protocols and standards to secure the  exchange itself. Considering data access and exchange within the ecosystem, trust between  parties and data governance is a key challenge to address in order to implement a secure and  lasting model. Such models need to be supported with establishing a pan-European  authentication and authorisation scheme based on clearly defined roles and responsibilities, to  ensure that every CAM stakeholder has the possibility to access the required vehicle data,  functions and resources in a safe and secure way.  Considering cybersecurity, one of the current challenges is the lack of visibility and sharing of  information within the ecosystem on evolving attacks and threats. Since CAM products and  services delivery rely on multiple interactions between different actors, as mentioned earlier,  one stakeholder may need to access data or information related to cybersecurity operations of  another stakeholder. This could be insightful for its own cybersecurity operations and protection  of its perimeter, and vice-versa. This need is particularly noteworthy in the interactions between  a company and its supplier where collaboration, information sharing about incidents and  discovered vulnerabilities, collective implementation of security measures or shared threat  intelligence will be decisive for the efficiency of cyber security operations. However, it is also  important to note that the impact of cybersecurity is at the whole vehicle level and at the level of  interaction between components and services managed by different actors within the CAM  ecosystem. The cohesive interdependent nature of the vehicle, its components and services,  require that in addition to incidents and vulnerabilities, additional information regarding  cybersecurity compatibility and interoperability be shared among the relevant stakeholders of  the CAM ecosystem. Such information sharing is of paramount importance to ensure that  components and services implemented within the vehicle architecture by multiple CAM  stakeholders are still able to function as required in a safe and secure way.  This challenge is also linked to the problem of interoperability. With the massive development of  solutions and to ensure a system of interconnected transport infrastructures, CAM actors should  have the possibility to share information about, among others, their new solutions,  developments and technologies. CAM actors confirmed that there are many solutions  developed in the world that are not interoperable which should be standardised in order to  achieve a more global solution in Europe, and to ensure business continuity of all CAM  stakeholders in the automotive sector. Where there are interdependencies between products  and services developed by multiple CAM stakeholders, in addition to perimeter level  cybersecurity considerations, there should be an information sharing mechanism (at European  level - supported by legislation) to ensure that these products and services can be developed  and integrated with the products in a safe and secure way. Changes or updates to cybersecurity  requirements of one CAM stakeholder, that affects the cybersecurity and functioning of the  components and services of other CAM stakeholders need to be communicated to all relevant  CAM stakeholders.  25 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive  95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).

The  starting point is smaller groups of stakeholders that grow into establishing cross-  connections throughout the remainder of the ecosystem to further enrich the  information available.   Consider exploring cooperation with Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRT) communities, including the European CSIRTs Network27.   Consider involving the right stakeholders in the ISACs, including but not limited to EU  agencies and bodies, law enforcement agencies, other industry bodies, as well as  associations and telecom operators.   Consider creating interfaces of cooperation with other sectorial actors and EU-wide  ISACs to exchange good practices for information sharing, as well as knowledge on  attacks and threats that might be relevant for the CAM industry (especially the  automotive supply chain).   Ensure legally that relevant cybersecurity compatibility information (for development  and system integration) from relevant CAM stakeholders are be provided to all  authorised CAM stakeholders, as required upon request. This information sharing is  necessary as the information shared in ISACs only relates to cyber-threats, attacks  and good practices for internal development, but does not include cybersecurity-  relevant information for producing and replacing parts, and conducting repair and  maintenance operations.   Adapt industry standards or minimum requirements covering cybersecurity information  interoperability to ensure all stakeholders are at a minimum level of security.  The recommendations are targeted at:   Automotive Aftermarket Operators   Operators of Intelligent Transport Systems (OITS)   Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)   Road Equipment Manufacturers   Smart City Operators   System Integrators   System Providers   Tier 1 and Tier 2 Suppliers,  27 See more at: https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirts-network  T P  0 4  2 0  6 3  8 E  N N  ABOUT ENISA  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA, is the Union’s agency dedicated to  achieving a high common level of cybersecurity across Europe.

    "abstract": "The aim of this report is to provide a high-level overview of the cybersecurity challenges in the CAM sector and to highlight both the concerned CAM actors and associated recommendations. Cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem is partially standardised and the role of standards is widely recognised. This report aims to identify the main challenges in the current situation and to propose actionable recommendations for the different stakeholders involved in the CAM ecosystem to enhance the level of security and resilience of CAM infrastructures and systems in Europe. Challenges in the CAM ecosystem arise from the whole lifecycle, therefore this report points to detailed challenges that the stakeholders are facing across Europe. The recommendations proposed by ENISA aim to guide all CAM ecosystem stakeholders and to contribute to the improvement and harmonisation of cybersecurity in the CAM ecosystem in the European Union."

    "document(english)": "ENISA ETL2020 - Sectoral and thematic threat analysis  From January 2019 to April 2020  Sectoral/  thematic  threat  analysis ENISA Threat Landscape  ENEN  Overview  Apart from indicating adversaries’ motivations, it provides evidence  about the most common attack techniques and threat exposure applying  to a particular sector, thus indicate protection requirements and  priorities. With respect to themes, the analysis of threats and challenges  associated with specific emerging technologies contributes to the  process of assessing, evaluating and mitigating future risks.  Contextualised cyber threat intelligence (CTI) for sectors  is an important preparedness tool for drawing  conclusions on expected cyberattacks within a specific  sector.  2  Contextualisation of sectoral CTI is mainly based on cybersecurity incidents  encountered in a sector. Although this is a standard method for existing  and established IT components and digital services, it does not cover  emerging technologies. This is mainly because no incident information  exists for technologies that are only at a pilot or experimental phase. CTI  for emerging technologies is contextualised through threat assessments of  asset categories pertinent to a specific sector. ENISA performs such  assessments for emerging sectors such as 5G, IoT 5  and smart cars 6 .  Sectorial and thematic threat landscapes and assessments of baseline  protection are the methods used by ENISA to contextualise CTI.  In this report, besides sectorial CTI relying on incident-based statistics, we  present a summary of assessed CTI for emerging technology sectors based  on ENISA work.  _Sector incident statistics vs. assessed  exposure of emerging sectors  3  “During the next  decade, cybersecurity  risks will become  harder to assess and  interpret due to the  growing complexity of  the threat landscape,  adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the  attack surface.” in ETL 2020  Overview  _The urgent need for accurate and up-to-date  sectoral incident statistics  Sectoral incident statistics are an essential tool to understand the  dynamics of threat evolution, adversaries’ motives, exposure of assets,  and actions on objectives. Because of the complexity of attacks,  dependencies among the assets targeted and the cross-sector nature of  the abused vulnerabilities exploited, incidents statistics have some  inherent uncertainties that emanate from the following facts.   In various sector statistics, we see a number of incidents classified as  ‘unknown’ 1,2  . This percentage varies from 1,5% to 5%. If these  incidents could be associated with some of the known sectors, this  percentage could influence the order of targets. Moreover, the  significant amount of unknown attack techniques (approximately  15%), add some uncertainty to the assessment of threat agents’  motives.   Most attacks take more than one-step (average three) to reach their  objectives of the final target. In many cases, multiple targets from  various sectors are involved in a single attack. Hence, an incident  recorded within a sector may result from several incidents in other  sectors that are intermediate steps in the attack. Such dependencies  among incidents may affect the accuracy of incident statistics.   Apart from the number of incidents per sector, an important element  for the statistical analysis is the nature of attack techniques used.  This information may provide useful evidence about the most  frequently used attack vector and can help contribute to prioritise  necessary protective measures necessary for a particular sector.  4   The materialization of threats depends heavily on existing  opportunities that are explored by adversaries. Because of the  COVID-19 pandemic, for example, IT environments have become  decentralized. This weakens the corporate security controls applied  within a company’s network, which explains the shift in attacks from  corporate targets to individual targets. 1 This example is indicative of the  need to ‘translate’ observed changes in statistics in the light of emerging  opportunities.   Current statistics are developed with various criteria in mind. Variations  in the criteria of statistics impede comparisons between incident  statistics. For example:   Depending on the information collector’s  stakeholders/contributors data base of the data about statistic  may not cover all sectors evenly;   Classification of incidents may be based on their frequency of  occurrence, irrespectively of the magnitude of the damage (e.g.  size of breached information) or its impact.   An essential element of sectoral statistics is the frequency of  occurrence of individual cyberthreats. This gives an impression of the  most common attack method used in a sector. Such statistics may  provide guidance on the required level of preparedness or maturity of  individual security controls that reduce exposure to the relevant cyber  threats.   Given the above facts pertinent to incident statistics, this report provides  an approximate ranking of sectors in terms of observed incidents,  together with a trend drawn from the emerging dynamics of the  potential exposure of each sector. Moreover, some information on the  most popular attack vectors per sector is also given. For this purpose,  information from various publications has been consolidated. 1,2,3,4  5  Trends in incidents  SECTOR MOST POPULAR THREATS/ATTACKS INCIDENTS  TRENDS  Individual  • Phishing  •

measures has led to  dispersed/ decentralized IT environments and isolation of users  who are easier to fool and have fewer security controls in place,  than was the case in centralized environments.  Multiple industries  Remote users due to COVID-19 lockdown measures have  facilitated attacks via phishing and leakage of sensitive  information (i.e. credentials).  Public  Administration,  Defence, Social  Services  Use of cloud services may have influenced the security of public  offerings. Nonetheless, social services have received significant  amount of attacks due to financial aids offered to citizens during  COVID-19 pandemic.  Financial/ Banking/  Insurance  The complexity of the financial sector makes it hard to interpret  the threat landscape, as different domains within financial  services and banking may face entirely different cyber risks and  threats.  Health/Medical  The attention paid by cybercriminals to health targets has  increased considerable due to financial motives and the  importance of the sector during COVID-19 pandemic.  Education  Although stable, this sector has been targeted in 2020 by  cyberespionage campaigns due to interest in COVID-19 research  results.  Information and  Communication  This sector is constantly under pressure due to the difficulties in  protecting a huge attack surface, introduced by digital media  platforms. For online media organizations, attacks that cause  reputational damage are one of the biggest threats.  Professional/ Digital Services  Although stable, this sector has been targeted in 2020 by various  campaigns in an attempt to leak information from users of digital  services teleworking from home during COVID-19 pandemic.  Arts,  Entertainment and gaming  The change from a licensed to subscription business model  adopted by the gaming industry made this sector more attractive  to cyber criminals. 8  Manufacturing  Supply chain attacks and attacks to industrial control systems are  the main threat to manufacturing companies since these are able  to shut down a complete production line. The theft of intellectual  property data is another serious threat to this sector.  7  Threats on emerging  technologies  RELATED  COMPONENTS –  ASSET GROUPS  THREAT EXPOSURE  Core Network  Abuse from remote access, Authentication traffic spikes, Abuse  of user authentication/authorization data, Abuse of third party  hosted network functions, Abuse of lawful interception  function, Application programming interface (API) exploitation,  Exploitation of poorly designed architecture and planning,  Exploitation of misconfigured or poorly configured  systems/networks, Erroneous use or administration of the  network, systems and devices, Fraud scenarios related to  roaming interconnections, Lateral movement, Memory  scraping, Manipulation of network traffic, network  reconnaissance and information gathering, Manipulation of  network configuration data, Malicious flooding of core network  components, Malicious diversion of traffic, Manipulation of the  network resources orchestrator, Misuse of audit tools,  Opportunistic and fraudulent usages of shared resources,  Registration of malicious network functions, Traffic sniffing,  Side-channel attacks  Access Network  Abuse of spectrum resources, Address Resolution Protocol  (ARP) poisoning, Fake access network node, Flooding attack,  IMSI catching attacks, Jamming the radio frequency, MAC  spoofing, Manipulation of access network configuration data,  Radio interference, Radio traffic manipulation, Session  hijacking, Signalling fraud, Signalling storms  _ Next generation of mobile communications  or 5G  8  RELATED  COMPONENTS –  ASSET GROUPS  THREAT EXPOSURE  Multi Edge Computing False or rogue MEC gateway, Edge node overload, Abuse of  edge open application programming interfaces (APIs)  Virtualisation of  Network Functions  and Software Defined  Networks  Abuse on Data Centres Interconnect (DCI) protocol, Abuse of  cloud computational resources, Network virtualisation  bypassing, Virtualised host abuse  Physical  Infrastructure  Manipulation of hardware equipment, Natural disasters  affecting the network infrastructure, Physical  sabotage/vandalism of the network infrastructure, Threat  from third parties’ personnel accessing MNO’s facilities,  Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) format exploitation,  User equipment compromising  All above 5G asset  groups  Denial of Service (DoS), Data breach, leak, theft destruction  and manipulation of information, Eavesdropping, Exploitation  of software and hardware vulnerabilities, Malicious code or  software, Compromised supply chain, vendor and service  providers, Targeted threats/attacks, Exploiting flaws in  security, management and operational procedures, Abuse of  authentication, Identity theft or spoofing  9  _ Internet-of-things (IoT)  RELATED  COMPONENTS –  ASSET GROUPS  THREAT EXPOSURE  Human factor  Insider threat, Teamwork issues, Internal limitations,  Hacktivism, Loss of support services, Utility outage, Network  outage, Unintentional modifications, Sabotage, Violation of  rules and regulations, Breach of legislation, Contract  Requirements, Failure to meet contractual requirements (e.g.  software maintenance), Software exploitation, Social  engineering, Identity theft.

    "original document": "ENISA ETL2020 - Sectoral and thematic threat analysis  From January 2019 to April 2020  Sectoral/  thematic  threat  analysis ENISA Threat Landscape  ENEN  Overview  Apart from indicating adversaries’ motivations, it provides evidence  about the most common attack techniques and threat exposure applying  to a particular sector, thus indicate protection requirements and  priorities. With respect to themes, the analysis of threats and challenges  associated with specific emerging technologies contributes to the  process of assessing, evaluating and mitigating future risks.  Contextualised cyber threat intelligence (CTI) for sectors  is an important preparedness tool for drawing  conclusions on expected cyberattacks within a specific  sector.  2  Contextualisation of sectoral CTI is mainly based on cybersecurity incidents  encountered in a sector. Although this is a standard method for existing  and established IT components and digital services, it does not cover  emerging technologies. This is mainly because no incident information  exists for technologies that are only at a pilot or experimental phase. CTI  for emerging technologies is contextualised through threat assessments of  asset categories pertinent to a specific sector. ENISA performs such  assessments for emerging sectors such as 5G, IoT 5  and smart cars 6 .  Sectorial and thematic threat landscapes and assessments of baseline  protection are the methods used by ENISA to contextualise CTI.  In this report, besides sectorial CTI relying on incident-based statistics, we  present a summary of assessed CTI for emerging technology sectors based  on ENISA work.  _Sector incident statistics vs. assessed  exposure of emerging sectors  3  “During the next  decade, cybersecurity  risks will become  harder to assess and  interpret due to the  growing complexity of  the threat landscape,  adversarial ecosystem  and expansion of the  attack surface.” in ETL 2020  Overview  _The urgent need for accurate and up-to-date  sectoral incident statistics  Sectoral incident statistics are an essential tool to understand the  dynamics of threat evolution, adversaries’ motives, exposure of assets,  and actions on objectives. Because of the complexity of attacks,  dependencies among the assets targeted and the cross-sector nature of  the abused vulnerabilities exploited, incidents statistics have some  inherent uncertainties that emanate from the following facts.   In various sector statistics, we see a number of incidents classified as  ‘unknown’ 1,2  . This percentage varies from 1,5% to 5%. If these  incidents could be associated with some of the known sectors, this  percentage could influence the order of targets. Moreover, the  significant amount of unknown attack techniques (approximately  15%), add some uncertainty to the assessment of threat agents’  motives.   Most attacks take more than one-step (average three) to reach their  objectives of the final target. In many cases, multiple targets from  various sectors are involved in a single attack. Hence, an incident  recorded within a sector may result from several incidents in other  sectors that are intermediate steps in the attack. Such dependencies  among incidents may affect the accuracy of incident statistics.   Apart from the number of incidents per sector, an important element  for the statistical analysis is the nature of attack techniques used.  This information may provide useful evidence about the most  frequently used attack vector and can help contribute to prioritise  necessary protective measures necessary for a particular sector.  4   The materialization of threats depends heavily on existing  opportunities that are explored by adversaries. Because of the  COVID-19 pandemic, for example, IT environments have become  decentralized. This weakens the corporate security controls applied  within a company’s network, which explains the shift in attacks from  corporate targets to individual targets. 1 This example is indicative of the  need to ‘translate’ observed changes in statistics in the light of emerging  opportunities.   Current statistics are developed with various criteria in mind. Variations  in the criteria of statistics impede comparisons between incident  statistics. For example:   Depending on the information collector’s  stakeholders/contributors data base of the data about statistic  may not cover all sectors evenly;   Classification of incidents may be based on their frequency of  occurrence, irrespectively of the magnitude of the damage (e.g.  size of breached information) or its impact.   An essential element of sectoral statistics is the frequency of  occurrence of individual cyberthreats. This gives an impression of the  most common attack method used in a sector. Such statistics may  provide guidance on the required level of preparedness or maturity of  individual security controls that reduce exposure to the relevant cyber  threats.   Given the above facts pertinent to incident statistics, this report provides  an approximate ranking of sectors in terms of observed incidents,  together with a trend drawn from the emerging dynamics of the  potential exposure of each sector. Moreover, some information on the  most popular attack vectors per sector is also given. For this purpose,  information from various publications has been consolidated. 1,2,3,4  5  Trends in incidents  SECTOR MOST POPULAR THREATS/ATTACKS INCIDENTS  TRENDS  Individual  • Phishing  •

measures has led to  dispersed/ decentralized IT environments and isolation of users  who are easier to fool and have fewer security controls in place,  than was the case in centralized environments.  Multiple industries  Remote users due to COVID-19 lockdown measures have  facilitated attacks via phishing and leakage of sensitive  information (i.e. credentials).  Public  Administration,  Defence, Social  Services  Use of cloud services may have influenced the security of public  offerings. Nonetheless, social services have received significant  amount of attacks due to financial aids offered to citizens during  COVID-19 pandemic.  Financial/ Banking/  Insurance  The complexity of the financial sector makes it hard to interpret  the threat landscape, as different domains within financial  services and banking may face entirely different cyber risks and  threats.  Health/Medical  The attention paid by cybercriminals to health targets has  increased considerable due to financial motives and the  importance of the sector during COVID-19 pandemic.  Education  Although stable, this sector has been targeted in 2020 by  cyberespionage campaigns due to interest in COVID-19 research  results.  Information and  Communication  This sector is constantly under pressure due to the difficulties in  protecting a huge attack surface, introduced by digital media  platforms. For online media organizations, attacks that cause  reputational damage are one of the biggest threats.  Professional/ Digital Services  Although stable, this sector has been targeted in 2020 by various  campaigns in an attempt to leak information from users of digital  services teleworking from home during COVID-19 pandemic.  Arts,  Entertainment and gaming  The change from a licensed to subscription business model  adopted by the gaming industry made this sector more attractive  to cyber criminals. 8  Manufacturing  Supply chain attacks and attacks to industrial control systems are  the main threat to manufacturing companies since these are able  to shut down a complete production line. The theft of intellectual  property data is another serious threat to this sector.  7  Threats on emerging  technologies  RELATED  COMPONENTS –  ASSET GROUPS  THREAT EXPOSURE  Core Network  Abuse from remote access, Authentication traffic spikes, Abuse  of user authentication/authorization data, Abuse of third party  hosted network functions, Abuse of lawful interception  function, Application programming interface (API) exploitation,  Exploitation of poorly designed architecture and planning,  Exploitation of misconfigured or poorly configured  systems/networks, Erroneous use or administration of the  network, systems and devices, Fraud scenarios related to  roaming interconnections, Lateral movement, Memory  scraping, Manipulation of network traffic, network  reconnaissance and information gathering, Manipulation of  network configuration data, Malicious flooding of core network  components, Malicious diversion of traffic, Manipulation of the  network resources orchestrator, Misuse of audit tools,  Opportunistic and fraudulent usages of shared resources,  Registration of malicious network functions, Traffic sniffing,  Side-channel attacks  Access Network  Abuse of spectrum resources, Address Resolution Protocol  (ARP) poisoning, Fake access network node, Flooding attack,  IMSI catching attacks, Jamming the radio frequency, MAC  spoofing, Manipulation of access network configuration data,  Radio interference, Radio traffic manipulation, Session  hijacking, Signalling fraud, Signalling storms  _ Next generation of mobile communications  or 5G  8  RELATED  COMPONENTS –  ASSET GROUPS  THREAT EXPOSURE  Multi Edge Computing False or rogue MEC gateway, Edge node overload, Abuse of  edge open application programming interfaces (APIs)  Virtualisation of  Network Functions  and Software Defined  Networks  Abuse on Data Centres Interconnect (DCI) protocol, Abuse of  cloud computational resources, Network virtualisation  bypassing, Virtualised host abuse  Physical  Infrastructure  Manipulation of hardware equipment, Natural disasters  affecting the network infrastructure, Physical  sabotage/vandalism of the network infrastructure, Threat  from third parties’ personnel accessing MNO’s facilities,  Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC) format exploitation,  User equipment compromising  All above 5G asset  groups  Denial of Service (DoS), Data breach, leak, theft destruction  and manipulation of information, Eavesdropping, Exploitation  of software and hardware vulnerabilities, Malicious code or  software, Compromised supply chain, vendor and service  providers, Targeted threats/attacks, Exploiting flaws in  security, management and operational procedures, Abuse of  authentication, Identity theft or spoofing  9  _ Internet-of-things (IoT)  RELATED  COMPONENTS –  ASSET GROUPS  THREAT EXPOSURE  Human factor  Insider threat, Teamwork issues, Internal limitations,  Hacktivism, Loss of support services, Utility outage, Network  outage, Unintentional modifications, Sabotage, Violation of  rules and regulations, Breach of legislation, Contract  Requirements, Failure to meet contractual requirements (e.g.  software maintenance), Software exploitation, Social  engineering, Identity theft.

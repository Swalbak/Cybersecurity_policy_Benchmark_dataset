Executive summary  As information security management is becoming a key component of any modern organisation, the need for  relevant security data has seen a steady increase. But unlike traditional business data, in information security,  relevance and context may originate from both within and from outside the organisation. It is for this reason,  information sharing and the need for information sharing have become almost axiomatic in the world of  cybersecurity. Topics such as information exchange formats and tools remain on the agenda of the cybersecurity  community, in general, and of incident responders, in particular.  ENISA has been actively engaged in this dialog, by engaging communities interested in incident response  taxonomies1  or actionable threat information2 (see [1] [2] [3] [4]). This paper should be viewed as part of an on- going fine-tuning process.  Our aim is to engage the topic of information sharing and analysis from a different angle, by focusing on some of the  technical solutions proposed to share security relevant data within the community. We will collectively name these  solutions Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP).  Thus, the main objective of this report is to understand the limitations of threat information sharing and the analysis  tools that are currently in use. Moreover, the second objective is to provide the relevant recommendations so that  these limitations can be addressed and overcome. To achieve this, the report presents an overview of the users of  these platforms, the main functional areas of TIPs as well as the current landscape of the TIPs used by different  teams globally (CTI teams, SOCs, CSIRTs/CERTs, ISACs, etc.).  Finally, this report is meant to compliment the ENISA training material on incident and threat intelligence feed  management3, training material that focuses exclusively on the use of some of the TIPs mention in this report.  Among the main conclusion of this report, ENISA found that:   Organisation should focus on their specific requirements and needs when developing and deploying  TIP solutions;   Organisations are highly recommended to log their requirements and work on how different cyber  intelligence activities will be enabled by technology platforms;   Organisations are encouraged to invest time on Proof of Concepts with an open source TIPs to  familiarize themselves with the benefits of such systems, before making any significant financial  investment;   TIP developers and vendors are encouraged to focus on the enhancement of analysis capabilities of  TIP that would help the end users on more efficient, threat triage and relevancy determination as  well as threat analysis;   TIPs developers and vendors should provide flexible and usable trust modelling functionalities for  their solutions;  1 ENISA A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection  2 ENISA paper on Actionable information for security incident response,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/actionable-information-for-security  3 ENISA trainings, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/training-courses  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  06   TIPs developers and vendors are encouraged to provide consumers of threat information with  functionalities which would allow them to be informed in case the confidence and accuracy of the  shared information is not guaranteed by the source;   The research community and academia should continue to pursue and investigate the benefits of  TIPs and how these platforms may be further mature.  The main target audience of this report are: SOC analysts, Incident responders (and digital forensics), CTI analysts,  Threat researchers and intelligence producers, Cyber fraud analysts and Vulnerability analysts.  Main contributions  This report provides:  1. Overview of main users of TIPs  2. Overview of existing TIPs  3. Identified limitations of TIPs and conclusions  4. Functional areas of TIPs  5. An indicative maturity model for TIPs  Methodology and information collection  A desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources. ENISA deliverables have also taken  into account, in particular [1],  [2] and [3]. The focus was put on research papers, academic journals, publicly available  information on threat intelligence and threat information sharing practices as well as whitepapers provided by the  community. The intention is that the information provided, the findings and the recommendations should be vendor  agnostic.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  07  2. Threat Intelligence Platforms  TIP and Cyber Threat Intelligence  2.1.1 Current state of Cyber Threat Intelligence  During the past five years, the domain of cyber threat intelligence has emerged as a critical component of an  organization’s security operations capability. Cyber threat intelligence as a discipline has its roots in incident  response and traditional intelligence [5] and there are various definitions, e.g.  [6] [7]  [8].  One illustrative definition  of cyber threat intelligence is the below one:  “Cyber threat intelligence is the process and product resulting from the interpretation of raw data into  information that meets a requirement as it relates to the adversaries that have the intent, opportunity  and capability to do harm” [9].  According to the SANS CTI Survey 2017 [10],  60% of the responders already utilize threat intelligence for detection  and response and 78% of them felt that it had improved their security and response capabilities. The table below  presents some of the properties of threat intelligence, incident response and security operations practices [11]:  THREAT INTELLIGENCE INCIDENT RESPONSE SECURITY OPERATIONS  Adoption Early adoption phase Mainstream since ~2010 Mainstream since ~2005  Focus External threat monitoring  Security incidents and risk  escalation  Notable security event  monitoring  Best practices Evolving best practices Mature best practices Mature best practices  Technology enablement  Limited technology  enablement  Mature technology  enablement  Mature technology  enablement  Figure 1: Threat Intelligence, Incident Response and Security Operations practices [11]  Compared to incident response and security operations practices, threat intelligence is still in the early adoption  phase. It is also a fact that best practices and maturity models for threat intelligence exist and are still evolving [12]  [13] [10], while incident response and security operations have witnessed an improvement in terms of maturity.  Finally, a critical point is that technology enablement is limited in the threat intelligence practice, something that  pinpoints the need for technology tools (especially of TIPs) that will help the analysts and their workflows towards  efficient threat management. According to practitioners, lack of suitable technologies is one of the major factors  (together with lack of staff expertise and ownership) determining why threat intelligence is not used effectively by  organisations [14]. Moreover, organisations recognize that there is a need for tools that would help them manage  the collected information and convert it to actions and knowledge [15].  2.1.2 What is a TIP?  An increasing number of organisations have started establishing or expanding their threat intelligence  programs/practices. Threat intelligence programs implement processes that enable organisations to collect, analyse,  produce and integrate their own and external intelligence. The utmost goal of any threat intelligence program is to  produce intelligence that will be embedded into organisational workflows and would serve decision makers. The  latter may also end up in driving operations to achieving policy outcomes.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  08  Threat intelligence programs are comprised of people, processes and technology. A threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)  is an emerging technology discipline that supports organisations’ threat intelligence programs and helps them to  improve their cyber threat intelligence capabilities. TIPs enable organisations to easily bootstrap the core processes  of collecting, normalising, enriching, correlating, analysing, disseminating and sharing of threat related information.  The TIP’s critical role in threat management operations can be visually represented in the figure below [16]:  Figure 2: The ideal TIP [16]  2.1.3 Related work on TIPs  Despite the fact that TIP is quite a new technology toolset, there have been several publications and reports in this  area. The most authoritative ones include the below:  ENISA’s report on “Standards and tools for exchange and  processing of actionable information” [2], “From Cyber Security Information Sharing to Threat Management” [15],  “Threat Intelligence Sharing Platforms: An Exploratory Study of Software Vendors and Research Perspectives” [17],  “Towards improved cyber security information sharing” [18], “UX Aspects of Threat Information Sharing Platforms”  [19], “Technology Overview for Threat Intelligence Platforms” [20], “Data Quality Challenges and Future Research  Directions in Threat Intelligence Sharing Practice” [21] and “On the design of a cyber security data sharing system”  [22].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  09  Current TIPs solutions  This section provides an overview of the TIP landscape where major TIPs are presented.

They can provide in depth analysis results  from investigations and  malware/log/forensics analysis.  3. Share tools and practices that helped  them solve other problems.  1. Incident responders need tailored and ad-hoc  intelligence related to tools, modus operandi, associated  campaigns, actor intents and attributions, and forensic  data for their investigations.  2. They also need detailed context and enrichment over  the indicators provided.  3. Need to quickly identify if the investigated incident is  part of a targeted attack and any other information that  would help direct the response.  1. Lack of visibility into events  across different systems or  domains within the organisation.  Thus, it is difficult to build the  complete chain of the attack.  2.

Limitations  In this section, we present the limitations related to the current state and usage of Threat Intelligence Platforms. These  limitations are not prioritised and are based on desk research, literature and feedback from practitioners.  Shared threat information is too voluminous  According to a recent survey [14], 70% of the responders replied that threat information shared is often too voluminous  and/or complex to be actioned. One of the problems that this illustrates is the overload of threat information shared via  open source, commercial sources as well as the private communities and ISACs. Combining shared threat information  from different sources and industries makes the relevant intelligence hard to find and makes it difficult to generate value  out of it [21].  Limited technology enablement in threat triage and relevancy determination  The aforementioned volumes of shared threat information combined with the limited threat triage and relevancy  determination tools limit data accessibility [21]. There is limited technology enablement so that end users could  efficiently facilitate the relevancy determination process [15].  Currently, this process is done manually, in a very complex way and it is dependent on the analyst. TIP capabilities  that would help analysts are advanced searching, custom filtering, recommendation engines, (semi-)automated  threat triage and building triage workflow [15]. Nevertheless, the above capabilities are not provided in many  cases and the end users face the problem of managing and prioritizing the overwhelming threat information  received (“distilling the signal from noise”).  One would argue that while in previous years the major concern was providing incentives, standards and tools for  information sharing, currently the problem has moved onto effective threat information management.  Sharing of the low hanging fruit  Research has identified that the majority of the platforms are focused on the tactical indicators of compromise  [17]. There are cases that context is missing around the tactical indicators and this is something that hinders the  work that needs to be done by CTI analysts and the recipients of the information.  During information sharing, standardized communication protocols are not commonly used and mostly  unstructured PDFs or CSVs are exchanged [14].  On the other hand, whenever standards are used for threat  information sharing then STIX 1.x, OpenIOC and MISP JSON are the most common ones. There has been observed  an underutilisation of these standards when it comes to threat information sharing. For example, STIX 1.x is a  quite expressive data model regarding cyber threat information and has some core constructs that comprise the  STIX 1.x language. However, it has been observed that most of the tools share indicators of compromise that can  be described by just two constructs of the STIX 1.x standard, Indicators and Observables. Thus, a current limitation  is that that the low hanging fruit, tactical indicators of compromise, are mostly shared lacking comprehensive  threat information while underutilising STIX 1.x data model. Some practitioners also argue that STIX is quite  complex, that there is no common vocabulary for describing TTPs and that’s why most of the intelligence  producers focus on the Indicator and Observable constructs of STIX 1.x.  Data warehouses focusing on data collection  While technology is mostly focused on the collection phase of the intelligence, activities related to other phases of the  intelligence cycle have been mostly neglected [17]. Only small fraction of activities mapped to the Processing and  Exploitation, Analysis and Production as well as Dissemination phases could be adequately addressed by Threat  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  15  Intelligence platforms. Currently, Threat Intelligence platforms provide basic analysis capabilities which results in  constraining analysts’ capability to conduct comprehensive threat analysis, follow their intelligence workflows and usually  be the bottleneck by doing lots of manual tasks. Taking into account the large amount of shared threat information and  the limited analysis capabilities provided by TIPs, most of the current platforms end up being data warehouses rather than  platforms where threat information can be shared and analysed.  Trust related issues  Researchers have identified trust issues related to the users and the platform providers [17]. Organisations participating  in a Threat Intelligence platform (e.g. ISAC’s platform), should have certain levels of trust towards the platform provider  as well as the rest of the organisations and vice versa. The below trust relationships have been identified:  1. The organisation trusts the platform provider that the handling of the shared information and access controls  does not expose confidential data to unauthorized recipients.  2. The organisation trusts the rest of the participant organisations that their handling of the shared information  is done according to a predefined protocol e.g. TLP marking protocol [46], etc.  3. The platform provider (vendors, ISAC, etc.) and the rest of the organisations trust the organisation that the  information shared by the organisation is reliable and credible.  TIPs, on the other hand, mostly provide access controls based on groups. TIP end users need more flexibility so that they  can facilitate customizable, controlled and multilateral sharing among trusted peers.  The aforementioned trust relationships and limited TIP capabilities introduce several limitations in the way that  organisations interact and contribute to specific communities. Organisations may select to share only specific types of  threat data with specific communities and organisations moving closer to trusted and closed communities (or even peer  to peer connections) to share highly sensitive data.  In addition, TIP developers and users should examine whether new legislation conditions are respected when such large  data sets are being processed and used(for example, there are concerns in relation to GDPR).  Qualities of shared threat data and TIP limitations  Confidence is a property that is related to the quality of the shared information, something that is not provided by most  of the feeds. Moreover, related work pinpointed that most of the shared STIX 1.x and APT reports provide incomplete  information [47]. Context, quality data and confidence in shared data can help end users avoid undesired effects and not  put additional effort on evaluating and verifying the received data [17].  Information provenance is all about assuring the quality of the shared data by tracking its evolution and is one of the  hardest problems in information security [48]. Prior research has identified the TIP end users’ need that provenance (and  traceability) should be established [21].  Thus, there is a need to provide, track and handle confidence and provenance information (as metadata of the shared  data) from different perspectives (consumer, producer and community) [15]. Existing data quality validation problems  also stem from the inability to compare the different perspectives on the quality and confidence on the information  shared.  Limited analysis capabilities  Practitioners use more email and spreadsheets compared to TIPs in order to aggregate, analyse and present CTI  information [10]. This is indicative of the current limited intelligence analysis and management capabilities that are  provided by TIPs, something that has also been identified by prior research [17]. More specifically, capabilities such as  browsing, attribute based filtering, advanced searched information, pivoting, exploration and visualisation are some of  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  16  the major capabilities for which limitations have been observed [15]. Thus, the value of TIP is up to the analyst’s tradecraft  and ability to interpret, analyse, enrich and react to the threat information received.  Finally, only a small subset of the platforms provides integration with third party tools that could help addressing activities  during the analysis phase of the intelligence cycle. Most common third-party tools that provide the pivoting and analysis  capabilities are Paterva’s Maltego [49],  IBM’s i2 Analyst’s Notebook [50], Palantir [51], Tableau [52], Microsoft Excel [53],  etc.  Diverse data models and formats used  Another limitation for TIPs is the variety of standards and data formats used to exchange threat information.  While there are community efforts to provide connectors between different standards and formats [15], there  are still limitations for TIPs that should collect, exploit and exchange of information between non-compatible  standards and formats. Moreover, converting information without losing any elements or context from the  initial/source format (lossless conversion) is also a challenge in threat intelligence (even a conversion between  STIX 1.x and STIX 2.0 might lose information).  It is common practice that TIP owners are based on and support a specific framework and tend to stay with that  framework. This is something that limits the flexibility of the TIP users in terms of the framework they work on  and often results in a data model lock in.  Finally, it should be mentioned that the usage of different formats sometimes makes a lot of sense because they  fit a specific need or purpose, e.g. Yara [54], Sigma [55], Suricata [56] rulesets, etc.  Limited advanced analytics capabilities and tasks automation  According to prior research, TIPs have currently limited advanced analytics capabilities [15], something that practitioners  also verify [10].  These capabilities are related to the processing and exploitation phase of the intelligence cycle when new  data are ingested and need to be analysed, enriched and linked with the existing ones.  Advanced analytics are vital for the subsequent analysis of the data, threat triage and relevancy determination,  visualisation and pivoting. A TIP that has advanced analytics capabilities can generate complex relations between data  such as aggregation, composition, generalization as well as the capability to de-duplicate, automatically tag and classify  data.  Since most of the shared threat data is tactical, routine tasks can be derived from advanced analytics be and  automated. Some TIPs have introduced playbook/orchestration capabilities that can take further advantage of advanced  analytics and help CTI analysts in their daily operations.  Time-to-live for shared intelligence is missing  Time-to-live information (expiration) of tactical threat indicators is very dependent on the end users of the TIPs along on  the operative process of the organisation using the information [57]. It is critical, though, for the intelligence information  since it can be used by the intelligence consumers to prioritize and act during the time window provided [15]. Moreover,  the consumer could easily identify short-lived intelligence and could avoid taking action based on stale intelligence.  Currently, the time-to-live information is not provided by most of the feeds and TIPs have limited capabilities in handling  this type of metadata information. This is also verified by the practitioners that are not satisfied with the identification  and removal of expired indicators of compromise [10].  Wide variety of APIs, data formats and requirements for integration  TIPs, as the centralised place where most of the activities of the intelligence cycle take place, should provide  interfaces to the relevant third-party tools and services that are used by end users in the organisation. These  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  17  integration interfaces can be included in activities related to most of the phases of the intelligence cycle (from  collection to dissemination).  Related to enterprise integration and API usage, some TIPs are more mature than others. However, the need for  integration has extra challenges for TIPs that need to integrate with an ever-growing set of services and tools  (security controls and workflow systems) with diverse APIs and requirements [15]. As a result, TIPs integrate with  a (more or less) standard set of services and tools while requests for additional integrations are prioritized by TIP  vendors as well as open source developers.  Limited workflow enablement  Currently, TIPs provide limited workflow capabilities that would make the process of threat management more efficient.  Some specific examples include the capability of stakeholders to send RFIs (Requests for Information) to the analysts via  the TIP, collaboration tools during analysis and production phase with a wider set of SMEs and capability to import  iterative feedback loops on the intelligence product with the intended stakeholder. What is though encouraging is that  some TIP vendors add collaboration functionalities (“Tasking” for broader teams) with some limited alerting on Task  deadlines as well as chatting capability.  Threat knowledge management limitations  TIPs are also used as a threat knowledge management solution. Information about TTPs, threat actors and campaigns is  managed and analysts use this knowledge base to track the activity of the relevant threats, actors and tools. Nevertheless,  limitations have been identified in the way that this information is recorded within these platforms.  No common vocabulary is used for describing threat actors, TTPs as well as tools. A lot of freetext is provided even within  STIX 1.x documents something that makes a structured analysis not relevant. Moreover, TIPs provide limited flexibility to  use the vocabulary of other frameworks when needed e.g. MITRE’S ATT&CK framework [58].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  18  4. Conclusions  In this section, we present some conclusions related to Threat Intelligence platforms and their usage from Threat  Management teams. These recommendations are not prioritised and are based mostly on desk research, literature and  feedback from the practitioners.  Organisations  4.1.1 Focus on requirements  CTI best practices include 3 lists of requirements that would help organisations evolve and mature their cyber intelligence  programs. A lot of related work in this area gave insights on: collection requirements [59], defining requirements [60],  setting requirements [61]  how they fit into the intelligence cycle [62], defining collection priorities [63], how to collect  requirements [12] and use them to drive a threat intelligence program [64]. The 3 lists of requirements are the following  ones [65]:   Production requirements that include the finalised product that will be delivered to the intelligence  consumers and the stakeholders   Intelligence requirements include what is needed to be collected to meet production requirements.   Collection requirements include all the relevant data inputs to satisfy the intelligence requirements.  Maintaining and acting on these lists of requirements would help organisations prioritise resources, threat sources/data  inputs and technology enablement needed to deliver their finalised intelligence products to the stakeholders. The  requirements are very relevant to the role and the desired capabilities of the TIP so that it could play its central role in the  threat management process.  4.1.2 Technology enablement via a TIP solution  Technology enablement is critical to manage the threat information shared via the different threat sources. Threat  Intelligence Platforms are the means for collecting and managing this information as well as converting it into  knowledge and actions [15].  This is in accordance with one of the service findings [14]: most organisations already  use such platforms or plan to have one in the future and responders believe that handling and prioritizing this  information would have been much more difficult without such platforms.  Organisations are highly recommended to log their requirements and work on how different cyber intelligence  activities will be enabled by technology platforms. The utmost goal is that the TIP is not used as an indicator  repository but as a tool that help them manage the cyber threats they face. TIP should fit the needs, requirements  and use cases previously set and play a significant role, as a technology enablement, for the activities of the CTI  team as well as the successfulness of the cyber intelligence program.  Finally, organisations are highly recommended to invest time on PoCs with an open source TIPs (e.g. MISP) to  familiarize before making any significant financial investment.  4.1.3 Clear processes and policies on information sharing  Organisations should have clear processes and policies on what and how they facilitate information sharing [45]. A TIP  solution can act as enabler for effective information sharing but is not enough by itself (no silver bullet) unless proper  process, polices, sharing goals and objectives are established and clearly defined.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  19  4.1.4 Using a standard data model for threat information  When it comes to threat information management and sharing, organisations should select the standard that fits theirs  as well as their stakeholders’ needs. The selected data model should not depend on free-text fields and there should be  a common vocabulary [21]. The selected data model should be flexible enough to be adapted to stakeholders needs if  needed.  TIP Users  4.1.5 Feedback to TIP owners/developers  The domain of TIPs is quite new just like Cyber intelligence practice. During the past years, TIPs have gone through  massive development trying to cover the requirements of the TIP users that have different practices and  approaches for their daily activities. Thus, feedback related to the technology enablement is critical so that TIPs  can be further developed and satisfy the ever-growing list of requirements of the TIP users.  TIP users are highly recommended to work together with TIP owners so that a win-win situation can be achieved:  TIP users can effectively use TIPs for their daily activities (and get ROI as well) and TIP owners can further develop  the platforms and satisfy the requirements of TIP users. This can happen via Product Enhancement Requests for  the commercial TIPs and via issue creation and active contribution in GitHub [66] for the open source TIPs.  The MISP example is indicative of how feedback and active contribution has enhanced MISP capabilities  throughout the last years. There have been 2500 issues created in MISP GitHub page [67] from 12 April 2013 until  24 September 2017. The aforementioned feedback has played a significant role in MISP development, planning  and adoption.  TIP Developers/Vendors  4.1.6 Analysis capabilities and TIPs  One interesting result of the SANS CTI Survey 2017 was that practitioners use more email and spreadsheets rather than  TIP capabilities for aggregating and analysing threat information [10]. This is indicative of the limited analysis capabilities  of TIPs and it is a fact that lot of analysis requires manual effort with “old school” tools.  Currently, TIPs are shifting towards providing threat intelligence management capabilities. Some of the TIPs  already provide visualisation, advanced searching and workflow capabilities. Finally, there is also a need for TIPs  to include standard APIs that would enable easy integration with other threat analysis tools of choice [15].  TIP owners should focus on the enhancement of analysis capabilities of TIP that would help the end users on more  efficient, threat triage and relevancy determination as well as threat analysis.  4.1.7 Trust modelling functionalities  TIPs should focus on providing trust modelling functionalities [17]. Organisations should be enabled to form custom  trusted and closed communities, direct connections and be able to provide anonymised data. TIPs should also give to the  organisations the capability to control the security of the shared data (what information is shared, how much of it and  with whom). These capabilities would act as a trust bond between the TIP and the organisations, that the TIP could actually  be trusted and as a means of delivering, storing and managing sensitive threat data.  Finally, TIPs should finally enforce sharing back policies and verify what information is shared back to a community [15].  The latter would be something that will play a significant role in the trust building of the various information sharing  communities.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  20  4.1.8 Usage of APIs, integration and workflow enablement  Organisations and mostly TIP owners should focus on the widespread usage of APIs that would help towards enhanced  automation, less manual activities and more integration opportunities. However, the integration of TIPs with security  technologies and tools is still a big challenge according to practitioners [14].  Use of APIs should happen during almost every phase of the intelligence cycle. More specifically, extensive use of APIs is  critical so that automated workflows could be built, manual tasks could be reduced, TIP users could have more time to  focus on important tasks and be presented with enriched data with more context. For example, a good approach would  be to minimize manual data fusion operations especially the ones related to publicly available sources e.g. DNS-lookups,  WHOIS lookups [21].  Finally, focus should be also put on the workflow capability that can be enabled via the extensive usage of APIs. Integration  with organisational workflows as well as streamlined workflow for threat analysis and intelligence production are  capabilities that should be delivered via TIP in the next years. TIP should be the single pane of glass where the whole  threat analysis will be conducted and task/activities will be followed up (“ditching the need for email discussions on  threats and activities”).  4.1.9 Threat data quality enhancement  TIPs should provide the capability to automate data quality error detection and establish common entry data rules [21].  Thus, shared data will go through a (customizable) quality control process [18].  Moreover, TIPs (as a trusted party) should have the capability to provide contextual information to the recipients of the  shared information that is related to information provenance, quality and accuracy. Finally, consumers of threat  information should be informed in case the confidence and accuracy of the shared information is not guaranteed by the  source [12].  4.1.10 Flexible threat data management  TIPs should provide the capability to the end users to use the vocabulary and framework that fits their purpose. TIP owners  usually stick to one standard/framework so the end users of the TIP are locked in the framework / standard that TIP owner  uses. Towards the right direction is MISP Galaxy [68] as well as the data model of STIX 2.x that is really built for  extensibility. TIP owners are recommended to follow the “Galaxy” approach and take full advantage of the STIX 2.x  extensibility capabilities.  Intelligence Producers  4.1.11 Enhancing the quality of shared information  TIP users should provide confidence and accuracy metadata information related to the data they share [21]. It would be  also preferable that redundant (automated and manual) error checking should be conducted at source. Moreover, the  source of intelligence should also provide time-to-live indication of the shared data [15]. This is something that would  help the consumers prioritize and better manage the received information.  4.1.12 Coherent use of the standards  The majority of current threat information exchange does not include standardized protocols. This mostly happens  because current standard proposals have failed and the community prefer not to use any of those but to adapt to other  formats. Despite the adoption of some standardized protocols, their standard vocabulary is underutilised e.g. STIX v1  Observable and Indicator constructs are used much more frequently than the other ones  [17].  Intelligence producers should avoid using freetext in the shared information but rather put the information in the relevant  “buckets” of the standard so that fusion analysis would be more effective by the intelligence consumers.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  21  Intelligence producers are highly advised to take full advantage of vocabulary used in standards and use the wide variety  of constructs that would provide more context to the information shared. Finally, the extensibility of STIX 2.x will provide  even more opportunities for the STIX users to express the threats in a customisable and desired way.  CTI community and Researchers  4.1.13 Further research on TIPs  More research and evaluation studies are required in the field of TIPs since this new domain is still being  explored.  More specifically, three interesting topics for future research are the following:  o Scientific research and evaluation of TIP user interface, analysis options, visualisation  options and required functionalities [17].  o Empirical research on the value that TIP bring to the organisation and how data quality  impacts this value [21].  o Provide a standardised definition of TIPs as well as define and research on the  functional areas and capabilities of threat intelligence sharing platforms.  4.1.14 Further research on standards  CTI community members, researchers and OASIS CTI-TC [69] members could conduct research on some of the below  topics:   Researching on understanding the underutilisation of STIX 1.x.   Work on resolving STIX 1.x complexities and providing additional capabilities for STIX 2.x (e.g. built-in  extensibility, etc.).   Investigate how STIX 2.x includes metadata like accuracy, provenance and time-to-live information and  how can these practically be used via TIPs.   Provide the relevant tools, connectors and guidance so that organisations can adopt STIX 2.x.   Further research in lossless conversion between different formats/standards used in threat intelligence.  Converting information without losing any element or context between different formats is still a  challenge.   Further research on Unified Cyber Ontology [70]. The Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) is intended  to support information integration and cyber situational awareness in cybersecurity systems.   Further research on MISP Active Internet Drafts [71]. Currently, there are 4 MISP Active Internet Drafts  for MISP core format, MISP galaxy format, MISP object template format and MISP taxonomy format.   Further research on OpenDXL [72]. OpenDXL is an initiative to create adaptive systems of interconnected  services that communicate and share information for real-time, accurate security decisions and actions.   Further research on Sigma which is a generic signature format for SIEM systems [55].   Further research on IODEF [73].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  22  5.

In this section, a set of properties  enabled by TIPs is provided per intelligence cycle phase as Functional Areas (FA).  Figure 3: Intelligence cycle  6.1.1 Planning and direction  The planning and direction phase of the intelligence cycle is the first phase of the intelligence process and its main  focus is the definition of the priority intelligence requirements [74].  Currently, Threat Intelligence platforms have limited involvement in this phase of the intelligence cycle.  Nevertheless, TIP should act as a technology enablement so that users of TIP can perform the below activities [75]:  Requirements and gaps  - FA1.1 Collect and manage the identified requirements. Ideally, 3 requirements lists should be  managed: production requirements, intelligence requirements and collection requirements as  suggested in [76].  - FA1.2 Collect and manage the identified knowledge gaps that have been identified.  KPIs  - FA1.3 Provide and manage Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the intelligence program. The KPIs  can be the quality and quantity if finalized intelligence products, specific KPIs per intelligence phase,  etc.  RFIs  - FA1.4 Process and manage stakeholders’ Requests for Information (RFI). Stakeholders with or  without access to the TIP should be able to send a RFI to the TIP about a specific threat, so it can be  processed by the team.  6.1.2 Collection  The collection phase of the intelligence cycle is related to the gathering of the raw data required to produce the  finalized intelligence product [77].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  34  The collection phase of the intelligence cycle and its activities could be streamlined by the use of a TIP. More  specifically, the complete functionalities of the TIP that are related to this phase are the following ones:  Data Ingestion  - FA2.1 Capability to ingest threat data from different sources. What is challenging here is the wide  variety of different sources: open source feeds, Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs),  private communities, commercial intelligence providers, intelligence exchange platforms etc.  - FA2.2 Capability to ingest threat data in as many different data models and standards: STIX 1.x, STIX  2.x  [27], OpenIOC [78], CybOX [28], IODEF [29], custom, etc. [79].  - FA2.3 Capability to ingest threat data via a variety of different transport mechanisms: TAXII [80],  HTTPS, REST API, RSS, email, SFTP, shared folders (SMB), etc. TIP should also support the cases  where the information will be pushed to the platform as well as when the information should be  pulled by the TIP.  - FA2.4 Capability to import threat data in a variety of data formats (XML, JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV, PDF,  DOCX, TXT). This also includes emails, PDFs, via freetext, via browser plugins, etc.  - FA2.5 Capability to collect tactical, operational and strategic intelligence [3].  - FA2.6 TIPs should be also able to collect structured, semi-structured and unstructured intelligence.  - FA2.7 Capability to collect threat data from local and internal sources (e.g. internal organisation  sandbox).  - FA2.8 Capability for customizable polling of feed sources (customizable periodicity).  Storage  - FA2.9 Capability to store the collected data securely [18].  - FA2.10 Capability to store the collected data at scale [18].  - FA2.11 Capability to store collected data and apply retain based on policies.  - FA2.12 Capability to index collected data for faster searching functionality.  - FA2.13 Capability to store collected data and enforce privacy laws, regulations and other  restrictions.  6.1.3 Processing and exploitation  The processing and exploitation phase follows the execution of the collection plan. During this  intelligence cycle phase, the capabilities of the TIPs can be grouped in three super categories: data  normalization, data enrichment and access control. Regarding data normalisation capabilities of the  TIP, the below ones have been identified:  Normalisation and data models  - FA3.1 TIP should have the capability to normalise all stored data in a common  format/standard/data model.  - FA3.2 Capability to manage many different standards / data models and provide compatibility and  correlation functions among them.  - FA3.3 Capability to process and extract information from multiple special types of data: binaries,  PCAP, emails, certificates, etc. Indicative capabilities could be the extraction of DNS and HTTP data  from PCAPs, identification of similar binaries by fuzzy hashing, binaries unpacking, extraction of  metadata from multiple file types, etc.  - FA3.4 TIP should also be supported by a flexible data model where complex objects can be  expressed and linked together to express indicators, campaigns, threat actors, relationships, etc.  Marking, taxonomies and classification  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  35  - FA3.5 Capability to apply custom tagging/marking. This could happen in a manual or in an  automated and predefined way.  - FA3.6 TIP should be capable of applying (custom) taxonomies to threat data on a predefined or  manual way [81]. There should also be the capability that the taxonomies would remain local and  not shared.  - FA3.7 TIP should be capable of providing automatic classification of information.  - FA3.8 Capability to apply marking, tagging and confidence at event, attribute, feed and source  levels in a predefined way.  Access control  - FA3.9 TIP should have all the flexible access control mechanisms to ensure what it is presented and  shared, how much of it and with whom. The aforementioned access control mechanisms are critical  for the trust needed towards the platform operations.  - FA3.10 TIP should have the capability to manage marking information e.g. TLP.  Data enrichment  - FA3.11 TIP should be able to provide enrichment of data. Major enrichment  sources are Whois, DNS, PassiveDNS, malware intelligence, sandbox, PassiveSSL.  Thus, TIP should be able to conduct the aforementioned enrichment as a built-in  capability or via integration with the enrichment services:   Whois – e.g. built-in whois lookup, DomainTools [82], PassiveTotal [83],  Whois XML API [84], etc.   DNS – built-in DNS and reverse DNS lookup   PassiveDNS - DomainTools [82], PassiveTotal [83], Farsight [85], CIRCL [86],  mnemonic [87], BFK [88], etc.   PassiveSSL - [83], [89], etc.   Malware Intelligence and repositories – [90], etc.   Sandbox – Cuckoo [91], VxStream, [92], etc.   Geolocation – MaxMind [93], etc.   Reputation services – IPVoid [94],  Spamhaus [95], etc.   Public information leaks – AIL [96], etc.   Datasets about crawled information from the darknet – Hunchly [97],  OnionScan [98], Onion Investigator [99], etc.   Repositories based on backscatter in case of distributed denial of service  attacks and honeypot services –  organisation’s honeypots, Modern Honey  Network [100], etc.   OSINT services – Recorded Future [101], Shodan [102], Censys [103], etc.   ASN information – built-in ASN information lookup, etc.   Vulnerability intelligence – vfeed [104], etc.  - FA3.12 TIP should be able to provide enrichment in an automated way and based  on predefined requirements.  - FA3.13 Capability to easily expand the enrichment modules and authoring custom  ones.  Complex data processing and exploitation  - FA3.14 TIP should be able to (automatically) link brand new data to already existing  data via direct association bindings. The automatic correlation could also identify  relationships between attributes and indicators from malware, attacks campaigns  or analysis.  - FA3.15 Capability to match and link imported intelligence against custom rules and  signatures (e.g. regular expressions, whitelists, blacklists, Yara rules, etc.) and apply  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  36  subsequent predefined actions (e.g. identify internal IP addresses and do not tag  them as indicators).  - FA3.16 Taking into account the complexity of the cyber domain, TIP should be able  to (automatically) link brand new data to already existing data via complex bindings  such as aggregation, composition, generalization or realization [15].  - FA3.17 TIP should have the capability to de-duplicate threat information from  various data sets.  - FA3.18 Capability of processing that supports data fusion, clustering and analytics.  - FA3.19 Capability to extract objects and entities from structured data based on  common techniques.  - FA3.20 Capability to extract object and entities from unstructured data based on  common and advanced techniques (Natural Language Processing, etc.).  - FA3.21 Capability to dynamically generate indicator signatures.  - FA3.22 Capability to generate warnings based on custom signatures and rules,  before and after data enrichment.  - FA3.23 TIP should have the capability to determine provenance and confidence  information from different perspectives [15].  - FA3.24 Capability to provide sightings support and process sightings information.  6.1.4 Analysis and production  This is the phase where the TIP users analyse all the information that was collected and enriched during the previous  phases in order to produce intelligence.

TIP maturity model  Based on the functional areas of the TIP provided in the previous section, we hereby provide a TIP maturity model.  Thus, in this section we focus on the Technology part however Threat Management as a practice includes People  and Processes as well. This is critical for the success of the Cyber Threat Intelligence program of an organisation since  a common situation is organisation that have a mature TIP solution but are less mature with processes.  Relevant work regarding the Threat Intelligence Maturity Model has been conducted [12]  [106] [107] [108] [109]  [110] [111]. The threat intelligence program includes technology, processes and people, below the TIP maturity  model is focused mostly on the technology part where TIPs play a central role:   Level 1: Crawl  o At this level, the organisation is mostly on tactical intelligence collection and consumption and very  basic functionalities of a TIP platform are used. While consumption of a tactical feed is partially  implemented (integration with security controls), there is no ability to analyse the intelligence and  evaluate the threat sources. Sharing intelligence to the stakeholders is done in an ad-hoc way, based  on personal contacts and not in a standard way (no sharing policy defined). Intelligence and  intelligence products are somewhat integrated in the security controls.   Level 2: Walk  o At this level, the organisation starts actively taking advantage of TIP functionalities. TIP is used to  import internal intelligence and deploy indicators per device (security control). TIP also is the central  point where structured and unstructured intelligence from a wide range of sources: open source,  commercial, ISACs, community, etc. is stored and enriched. TIP provides the proper assurance for  access controls as well as secure storage and transport mechanisms. TIP has also the capability of  providing basic insights on the intelligence managed as well as basic analysis functionalities.  Intelligence products start being delivered consistent to stakeholders and standards are used when  sharing externally.   Level 3: Run  o At this level, the organisation uses the TIP as a strategic tool of choice for threat triage, management  and response.  Stakeholders requirements are clear and threat sources are evaluated periodically  via TIP provided capabilities. TIP provide awareness and insight on the processing that has already  been done. TIP provides a range of threat analysis and fusion capabilities as well as analyst workflow  building and collaboration functionalities. Dissemination is done in a systematic way to internal and  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  41  external stakeholders and integration into security controls and organisation workflow is fully  implemented.   Level 4: Fly  o At this level, TIP is the single pane of glass for the analysts and the stakeholders.  TIP provides  capabilities during all the phases of the intelligence cycle, automation is extensively used and  intelligence input is heavily embedded in the organisation. There are formal RFI, requirements,  intelligence policies, iterative evaluations and intelligence products. TIP is powerful in threat  management and analysis provided advanced awareness and analytics to the end users. Information  sharing is strategically done via the TIP and the organisation uses the TIP as the major workflow and  collaboration tool for the intelligence products.

Executive summary  As information security management is becoming a key component of any modern organisation, the need for  relevant security data has seen a steady increase. But unlike traditional business data, in information security,  relevance and context may originate from both within and from outside the organisation. It is for this reason,  information sharing and the need for information sharing have become almost axiomatic in the world of  cybersecurity. Topics such as information exchange formats and tools remain on the agenda of the cybersecurity  community, in general, and of incident responders, in particular.  ENISA has been actively engaged in this dialog, by engaging communities interested in incident response  taxonomies1  or actionable threat information2 (see [1] [2] [3] [4]). This paper should be viewed as part of an on- going fine-tuning process.  Our aim is to engage the topic of information sharing and analysis from a different angle, by focusing on some of the  technical solutions proposed to share security relevant data within the community. We will collectively name these  solutions Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP).  Thus, the main objective of this report is to understand the limitations of threat information sharing and the analysis  tools that are currently in use. Moreover, the second objective is to provide the relevant recommendations so that  these limitations can be addressed and overcome. To achieve this, the report presents an overview of the users of  these platforms, the main functional areas of TIPs as well as the current landscape of the TIPs used by different  teams globally (CTI teams, SOCs, CSIRTs/CERTs, ISACs, etc.).  Finally, this report is meant to compliment the ENISA training material on incident and threat intelligence feed  management3, training material that focuses exclusively on the use of some of the TIPs mention in this report.  Among the main conclusion of this report, ENISA found that:   Organisation should focus on their specific requirements and needs when developing and deploying  TIP solutions;   Organisations are highly recommended to log their requirements and work on how different cyber  intelligence activities will be enabled by technology platforms;   Organisations are encouraged to invest time on Proof of Concepts with an open source TIPs to  familiarize themselves with the benefits of such systems, before making any significant financial  investment;   TIP developers and vendors are encouraged to focus on the enhancement of analysis capabilities of  TIP that would help the end users on more efficient, threat triage and relevancy determination as  well as threat analysis;   TIPs developers and vendors should provide flexible and usable trust modelling functionalities for  their solutions;  1 ENISA A good practice guide of using taxonomies in incident prevention and detection,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/using-taxonomies-in-incident-prevention-detection  2 ENISA paper on Actionable information for security incident response,  https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/actionable-information-for-security  3 ENISA trainings, https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/training-courses  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  06   TIPs developers and vendors are encouraged to provide consumers of threat information with  functionalities which would allow them to be informed in case the confidence and accuracy of the  shared information is not guaranteed by the source;   The research community and academia should continue to pursue and investigate the benefits of  TIPs and how these platforms may be further mature.  The main target audience of this report are: SOC analysts, Incident responders (and digital forensics), CTI analysts,  Threat researchers and intelligence producers, Cyber fraud analysts and Vulnerability analysts.  Main contributions  This report provides:  1. Overview of main users of TIPs  2. Overview of existing TIPs  3. Identified limitations of TIPs and conclusions  4. Functional areas of TIPs  5. An indicative maturity model for TIPs  Methodology and information collection  A desk research was conducted based on publicly available information sources. ENISA deliverables have also taken  into account, in particular [1],  [2] and [3]. The focus was put on research papers, academic journals, publicly available  information on threat intelligence and threat information sharing practices as well as whitepapers provided by the  community. The intention is that the information provided, the findings and the recommendations should be vendor  agnostic.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  07  2. Threat Intelligence Platforms  TIP and Cyber Threat Intelligence  2.1.1 Current state of Cyber Threat Intelligence  During the past five years, the domain of cyber threat intelligence has emerged as a critical component of an  organization’s security operations capability. Cyber threat intelligence as a discipline has its roots in incident  response and traditional intelligence [5] and there are various definitions, e.g.  [6] [7]  [8].  One illustrative definition  of cyber threat intelligence is the below one:  “Cyber threat intelligence is the process and product resulting from the interpretation of raw data into  information that meets a requirement as it relates to the adversaries that have the intent, opportunity  and capability to do harm” [9].  According to the SANS CTI Survey 2017 [10],  60% of the responders already utilize threat intelligence for detection  and response and 78% of them felt that it had improved their security and response capabilities. The table below  presents some of the properties of threat intelligence, incident response and security operations practices [11]:  THREAT INTELLIGENCE INCIDENT RESPONSE SECURITY OPERATIONS  Adoption Early adoption phase Mainstream since ~2010 Mainstream since ~2005  Focus External threat monitoring  Security incidents and risk  escalation  Notable security event  monitoring  Best practices Evolving best practices Mature best practices Mature best practices  Technology enablement  Limited technology  enablement  Mature technology  enablement  Mature technology  enablement  Figure 1: Threat Intelligence, Incident Response and Security Operations practices [11]  Compared to incident response and security operations practices, threat intelligence is still in the early adoption  phase. It is also a fact that best practices and maturity models for threat intelligence exist and are still evolving [12]  [13] [10], while incident response and security operations have witnessed an improvement in terms of maturity.  Finally, a critical point is that technology enablement is limited in the threat intelligence practice, something that  pinpoints the need for technology tools (especially of TIPs) that will help the analysts and their workflows towards  efficient threat management. According to practitioners, lack of suitable technologies is one of the major factors  (together with lack of staff expertise and ownership) determining why threat intelligence is not used effectively by  organisations [14]. Moreover, organisations recognize that there is a need for tools that would help them manage  the collected information and convert it to actions and knowledge [15].  2.1.2 What is a TIP?  An increasing number of organisations have started establishing or expanding their threat intelligence  programs/practices. Threat intelligence programs implement processes that enable organisations to collect, analyse,  produce and integrate their own and external intelligence. The utmost goal of any threat intelligence program is to  produce intelligence that will be embedded into organisational workflows and would serve decision makers. The  latter may also end up in driving operations to achieving policy outcomes.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  08  Threat intelligence programs are comprised of people, processes and technology. A threat Intelligence Platform (TIP)  is an emerging technology discipline that supports organisations’ threat intelligence programs and helps them to  improve their cyber threat intelligence capabilities. TIPs enable organisations to easily bootstrap the core processes  of collecting, normalising, enriching, correlating, analysing, disseminating and sharing of threat related information.  The TIP’s critical role in threat management operations can be visually represented in the figure below [16]:  Figure 2: The ideal TIP [16]  2.1.3 Related work on TIPs  Despite the fact that TIP is quite a new technology toolset, there have been several publications and reports in this  area.

Limitations  In this section, we present the limitations related to the current state and usage of Threat Intelligence Platforms. These  limitations are not prioritised and are based on desk research, literature and feedback from practitioners.  Shared threat information is too voluminous  According to a recent survey [14], 70% of the responders replied that threat information shared is often too voluminous  and/or complex to be actioned. One of the problems that this illustrates is the overload of threat information shared via  open source, commercial sources as well as the private communities and ISACs. Combining shared threat information  from different sources and industries makes the relevant intelligence hard to find and makes it difficult to generate value  out of it [21].  Limited technology enablement in threat triage and relevancy determination  The aforementioned volumes of shared threat information combined with the limited threat triage and relevancy  determination tools limit data accessibility [21]. There is limited technology enablement so that end users could  efficiently facilitate the relevancy determination process [15].  Currently, this process is done manually, in a very complex way and it is dependent on the analyst. TIP capabilities  that would help analysts are advanced searching, custom filtering, recommendation engines, (semi-)automated  threat triage and building triage workflow [15]. Nevertheless, the above capabilities are not provided in many  cases and the end users face the problem of managing and prioritizing the overwhelming threat information  received (“distilling the signal from noise”).  One would argue that while in previous years the major concern was providing incentives, standards and tools for  information sharing, currently the problem has moved onto effective threat information management.  Sharing of the low hanging fruit  Research has identified that the majority of the platforms are focused on the tactical indicators of compromise  [17]. There are cases that context is missing around the tactical indicators and this is something that hinders the  work that needs to be done by CTI analysts and the recipients of the information.  During information sharing, standardized communication protocols are not commonly used and mostly  unstructured PDFs or CSVs are exchanged [14].  On the other hand, whenever standards are used for threat  information sharing then STIX 1.x, OpenIOC and MISP JSON are the most common ones. There has been observed  an underutilisation of these standards when it comes to threat information sharing. For example, STIX 1.x is a  quite expressive data model regarding cyber threat information and has some core constructs that comprise the  STIX 1.x language. However, it has been observed that most of the tools share indicators of compromise that can  be described by just two constructs of the STIX 1.x standard, Indicators and Observables. Thus, a current limitation  is that that the low hanging fruit, tactical indicators of compromise, are mostly shared lacking comprehensive  threat information while underutilising STIX 1.x data model. Some practitioners also argue that STIX is quite  complex, that there is no common vocabulary for describing TTPs and that’s why most of the intelligence  producers focus on the Indicator and Observable constructs of STIX 1.x.  Data warehouses focusing on data collection  While technology is mostly focused on the collection phase of the intelligence, activities related to other phases of the  intelligence cycle have been mostly neglected [17]. Only small fraction of activities mapped to the Processing and  Exploitation, Analysis and Production as well as Dissemination phases could be adequately addressed by Threat  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  15  Intelligence platforms. Currently, Threat Intelligence platforms provide basic analysis capabilities which results in  constraining analysts’ capability to conduct comprehensive threat analysis, follow their intelligence workflows and usually  be the bottleneck by doing lots of manual tasks. Taking into account the large amount of shared threat information and  the limited analysis capabilities provided by TIPs, most of the current platforms end up being data warehouses rather than  platforms where threat information can be shared and analysed.  Trust related issues  Researchers have identified trust issues related to the users and the platform providers [17]. Organisations participating  in a Threat Intelligence platform (e.g. ISAC’s platform), should have certain levels of trust towards the platform provider  as well as the rest of the organisations and vice versa. The below trust relationships have been identified:  1. The organisation trusts the platform provider that the handling of the shared information and access controls  does not expose confidential data to unauthorized recipients.  2. The organisation trusts the rest of the participant organisations that their handling of the shared information  is done according to a predefined protocol e.g. TLP marking protocol [46], etc.  3. The platform provider (vendors, ISAC, etc.) and the rest of the organisations trust the organisation that the  information shared by the organisation is reliable and credible.  TIPs, on the other hand, mostly provide access controls based on groups. TIP end users need more flexibility so that they  can facilitate customizable, controlled and multilateral sharing among trusted peers.  The aforementioned trust relationships and limited TIP capabilities introduce several limitations in the way that  organisations interact and contribute to specific communities. Organisations may select to share only specific types of  threat data with specific communities and organisations moving closer to trusted and closed communities (or even peer  to peer connections) to share highly sensitive data.  In addition, TIP developers and users should examine whether new legislation conditions are respected when such large  data sets are being processed and used(for example, there are concerns in relation to GDPR).  Qualities of shared threat data and TIP limitations  Confidence is a property that is related to the quality of the shared information, something that is not provided by most  of the feeds. Moreover, related work pinpointed that most of the shared STIX 1.x and APT reports provide incomplete  information [47]. Context, quality data and confidence in shared data can help end users avoid undesired effects and not  put additional effort on evaluating and verifying the received data [17].  Information provenance is all about assuring the quality of the shared data by tracking its evolution and is one of the  hardest problems in information security [48]. Prior research has identified the TIP end users’ need that provenance (and  traceability) should be established [21].  Thus, there is a need to provide, track and handle confidence and provenance information (as metadata of the shared  data) from different perspectives (consumer, producer and community) [15]. Existing data quality validation problems  also stem from the inability to compare the different perspectives on the quality and confidence on the information  shared.  Limited analysis capabilities  Practitioners use more email and spreadsheets compared to TIPs in order to aggregate, analyse and present CTI  information [10]. This is indicative of the current limited intelligence analysis and management capabilities that are  provided by TIPs, something that has also been identified by prior research [17]. More specifically, capabilities such as  browsing, attribute based filtering, advanced searched information, pivoting, exploration and visualisation are some of  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  16  the major capabilities for which limitations have been observed [15]. Thus, the value of TIP is up to the analyst’s tradecraft  and ability to interpret, analyse, enrich and react to the threat information received.  Finally, only a small subset of the platforms provides integration with third party tools that could help addressing activities  during the analysis phase of the intelligence cycle. Most common third-party tools that provide the pivoting and analysis  capabilities are Paterva’s Maltego [49],  IBM’s i2 Analyst’s Notebook [50], Palantir [51], Tableau [52], Microsoft Excel [53],  etc.  Diverse data models and formats used  Another limitation for TIPs is the variety of standards and data formats used to exchange threat information.  While there are community efforts to provide connectors between different standards and formats [15], there  are still limitations for TIPs that should collect, exploit and exchange of information between non-compatible  standards and formats. Moreover, converting information without losing any elements or context from the  initial/source format (lossless conversion) is also a challenge in threat intelligence (even a conversion between  STIX 1.x and STIX 2.0 might lose information).  It is common practice that TIP owners are based on and support a specific framework and tend to stay with that  framework. This is something that limits the flexibility of the TIP users in terms of the framework they work on  and often results in a data model lock in.  Finally, it should be mentioned that the usage of different formats sometimes makes a lot of sense because they  fit a specific need or purpose, e.g. Yara [54], Sigma [55], Suricata [56] rulesets, etc.  Limited advanced analytics capabilities and tasks automation  According to prior research, TIPs have currently limited advanced analytics capabilities [15], something that practitioners  also verify [10].  These capabilities are related to the processing and exploitation phase of the intelligence cycle when new  data are ingested and need to be analysed, enriched and linked with the existing ones.  Advanced analytics are vital for the subsequent analysis of the data, threat triage and relevancy determination,  visualisation and pivoting. A TIP that has advanced analytics capabilities can generate complex relations between data  such as aggregation, composition, generalization as well as the capability to de-duplicate, automatically tag and classify  data.  Since most of the shared threat data is tactical, routine tasks can be derived from advanced analytics be and  automated. Some TIPs have introduced playbook/orchestration capabilities that can take further advantage of advanced  analytics and help CTI analysts in their daily operations.  Time-to-live for shared intelligence is missing  Time-to-live information (expiration) of tactical threat indicators is very dependent on the end users of the TIPs along on  the operative process of the organisation using the information [57]. It is critical, though, for the intelligence information  since it can be used by the intelligence consumers to prioritize and act during the time window provided [15]. Moreover,  the consumer could easily identify short-lived intelligence and could avoid taking action based on stale intelligence.  Currently, the time-to-live information is not provided by most of the feeds and TIPs have limited capabilities in handling  this type of metadata information. This is also verified by the practitioners that are not satisfied with the identification  and removal of expired indicators of compromise [10].  Wide variety of APIs, data formats and requirements for integration  TIPs, as the centralised place where most of the activities of the intelligence cycle take place, should provide  interfaces to the relevant third-party tools and services that are used by end users in the organisation. These  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  17  integration interfaces can be included in activities related to most of the phases of the intelligence cycle (from  collection to dissemination).  Related to enterprise integration and API usage, some TIPs are more mature than others. However, the need for  integration has extra challenges for TIPs that need to integrate with an ever-growing set of services and tools  (security controls and workflow systems) with diverse APIs and requirements [15]. As a result, TIPs integrate with  a (more or less) standard set of services and tools while requests for additional integrations are prioritized by TIP  vendors as well as open source developers.  Limited workflow enablement  Currently, TIPs provide limited workflow capabilities that would make the process of threat management more efficient.  Some specific examples include the capability of stakeholders to send RFIs (Requests for Information) to the analysts via  the TIP, collaboration tools during analysis and production phase with a wider set of SMEs and capability to import  iterative feedback loops on the intelligence product with the intended stakeholder. What is though encouraging is that  some TIP vendors add collaboration functionalities (“Tasking” for broader teams) with some limited alerting on Task  deadlines as well as chatting capability.  Threat knowledge management limitations  TIPs are also used as a threat knowledge management solution. Information about TTPs, threat actors and campaigns is  managed and analysts use this knowledge base to track the activity of the relevant threats, actors and tools. Nevertheless,  limitations have been identified in the way that this information is recorded within these platforms.  No common vocabulary is used for describing threat actors, TTPs as well as tools. A lot of freetext is provided even within  STIX 1.x documents something that makes a structured analysis not relevant. Moreover, TIPs provide limited flexibility to  use the vocabulary of other frameworks when needed e.g. MITRE’S ATT&CK framework [58].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  18  4. Conclusions  In this section, we present some conclusions related to Threat Intelligence platforms and their usage from Threat  Management teams. These recommendations are not prioritised and are based mostly on desk research, literature and  feedback from the practitioners.  Organisations  4.1.1 Focus on requirements  CTI best practices include 3 lists of requirements that would help organisations evolve and mature their cyber intelligence  programs. A lot of related work in this area gave insights on: collection requirements [59], defining requirements [60],  setting requirements [61]  how they fit into the intelligence cycle [62], defining collection priorities [63], how to collect  requirements [12] and use them to drive a threat intelligence program [64]. The 3 lists of requirements are the following  ones [65]:   Production requirements that include the finalised product that will be delivered to the intelligence  consumers and the stakeholders   Intelligence requirements include what is needed to be collected to meet production requirements.   Collection requirements include all the relevant data inputs to satisfy the intelligence requirements.  Maintaining and acting on these lists of requirements would help organisations prioritise resources, threat sources/data  inputs and technology enablement needed to deliver their finalised intelligence products to the stakeholders. The  requirements are very relevant to the role and the desired capabilities of the TIP so that it could play its central role in the  threat management process.  4.1.2 Technology enablement via a TIP solution  Technology enablement is critical to manage the threat information shared via the different threat sources. Threat  Intelligence Platforms are the means for collecting and managing this information as well as converting it into  knowledge and actions [15].  This is in accordance with one of the service findings [14]: most organisations already  use such platforms or plan to have one in the future and responders believe that handling and prioritizing this  information would have been much more difficult without such platforms.  Organisations are highly recommended to log their requirements and work on how different cyber intelligence  activities will be enabled by technology platforms. The utmost goal is that the TIP is not used as an indicator  repository but as a tool that help them manage the cyber threats they face. TIP should fit the needs, requirements  and use cases previously set and play a significant role, as a technology enablement, for the activities of the CTI  team as well as the successfulness of the cyber intelligence program.  Finally, organisations are highly recommended to invest time on PoCs with an open source TIPs (e.g. MISP) to  familiarize before making any significant financial investment.  4.1.3 Clear processes and policies on information sharing  Organisations should have clear processes and policies on what and how they facilitate information sharing [45]. A TIP  solution can act as enabler for effective information sharing but is not enough by itself (no silver bullet) unless proper  process, polices, sharing goals and objectives are established and clearly defined.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  19  4.1.4 Using a standard data model for threat information  When it comes to threat information management and sharing, organisations should select the standard that fits theirs  as well as their stakeholders’ needs. The selected data model should not depend on free-text fields and there should be  a common vocabulary [21]. The selected data model should be flexible enough to be adapted to stakeholders needs if  needed.  TIP Users  4.1.5 Feedback to TIP owners/developers  The domain of TIPs is quite new just like Cyber intelligence practice. During the past years, TIPs have gone through  massive development trying to cover the requirements of the TIP users that have different practices and  approaches for their daily activities. Thus, feedback related to the technology enablement is critical so that TIPs  can be further developed and satisfy the ever-growing list of requirements of the TIP users.  TIP users are highly recommended to work together with TIP owners so that a win-win situation can be achieved:  TIP users can effectively use TIPs for their daily activities (and get ROI as well) and TIP owners can further develop  the platforms and satisfy the requirements of TIP users. This can happen via Product Enhancement Requests for  the commercial TIPs and via issue creation and active contribution in GitHub [66] for the open source TIPs.  The MISP example is indicative of how feedback and active contribution has enhanced MISP capabilities  throughout the last years. There have been 2500 issues created in MISP GitHub page [67] from 12 April 2013 until  24 September 2017. The aforementioned feedback has played a significant role in MISP development, planning  and adoption.  TIP Developers/Vendors  4.1.6 Analysis capabilities and TIPs  One interesting result of the SANS CTI Survey 2017 was that practitioners use more email and spreadsheets rather than  TIP capabilities for aggregating and analysing threat information [10]. This is indicative of the limited analysis capabilities  of TIPs and it is a fact that lot of analysis requires manual effort with “old school” tools.  Currently, TIPs are shifting towards providing threat intelligence management capabilities. Some of the TIPs  already provide visualisation, advanced searching and workflow capabilities. Finally, there is also a need for TIPs  to include standard APIs that would enable easy integration with other threat analysis tools of choice [15].  TIP owners should focus on the enhancement of analysis capabilities of TIP that would help the end users on more  efficient, threat triage and relevancy determination as well as threat analysis.  4.1.7 Trust modelling functionalities  TIPs should focus on providing trust modelling functionalities [17]. Organisations should be enabled to form custom  trusted and closed communities, direct connections and be able to provide anonymised data. TIPs should also give to the  organisations the capability to control the security of the shared data (what information is shared, how much of it and  with whom). These capabilities would act as a trust bond between the TIP and the organisations, that the TIP could actually  be trusted and as a means of delivering, storing and managing sensitive threat data.  Finally, TIPs should finally enforce sharing back policies and verify what information is shared back to a community [15].  The latter would be something that will play a significant role in the trust building of the various information sharing  communities.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  20  4.1.8 Usage of APIs, integration and workflow enablement  Organisations and mostly TIP owners should focus on the widespread usage of APIs that would help towards enhanced  automation, less manual activities and more integration opportunities. However, the integration of TIPs with security  technologies and tools is still a big challenge according to practitioners [14].  Use of APIs should happen during almost every phase of the intelligence cycle. More specifically, extensive use of APIs is  critical so that automated workflows could be built, manual tasks could be reduced, TIP users could have more time to  focus on important tasks and be presented with enriched data with more context. For example, a good approach would  be to minimize manual data fusion operations especially the ones related to publicly available sources e.g. DNS-lookups,  WHOIS lookups [21].  Finally, focus should be also put on the workflow capability that can be enabled via the extensive usage of APIs. Integration  with organisational workflows as well as streamlined workflow for threat analysis and intelligence production are  capabilities that should be delivered via TIP in the next years. TIP should be the single pane of glass where the whole  threat analysis will be conducted and task/activities will be followed up (“ditching the need for email discussions on  threats and activities”).  4.1.9 Threat data quality enhancement  TIPs should provide the capability to automate data quality error detection and establish common entry data rules [21].  Thus, shared data will go through a (customizable) quality control process [18].  Moreover, TIPs (as a trusted party) should have the capability to provide contextual information to the recipients of the  shared information that is related to information provenance, quality and accuracy. Finally, consumers of threat  information should be informed in case the confidence and accuracy of the shared information is not guaranteed by the  source [12].  4.1.10 Flexible threat data management  TIPs should provide the capability to the end users to use the vocabulary and framework that fits their purpose. TIP owners  usually stick to one standard/framework so the end users of the TIP are locked in the framework / standard that TIP owner  uses. Towards the right direction is MISP Galaxy [68] as well as the data model of STIX 2.x that is really built for  extensibility. TIP owners are recommended to follow the “Galaxy” approach and take full advantage of the STIX 2.x  extensibility capabilities.  Intelligence Producers  4.1.11 Enhancing the quality of shared information  TIP users should provide confidence and accuracy metadata information related to the data they share [21]. It would be  also preferable that redundant (automated and manual) error checking should be conducted at source. Moreover, the  source of intelligence should also provide time-to-live indication of the shared data [15]. This is something that would  help the consumers prioritize and better manage the received information.  4.1.12 Coherent use of the standards  The majority of current threat information exchange does not include standardized protocols. This mostly happens  because current standard proposals have failed and the community prefer not to use any of those but to adapt to other  formats. Despite the adoption of some standardized protocols, their standard vocabulary is underutilised e.g. STIX v1  Observable and Indicator constructs are used much more frequently than the other ones  [17].  Intelligence producers should avoid using freetext in the shared information but rather put the information in the relevant  “buckets” of the standard so that fusion analysis would be more effective by the intelligence consumers.  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  21  Intelligence producers are highly advised to take full advantage of vocabulary used in standards and use the wide variety  of constructs that would provide more context to the information shared. Finally, the extensibility of STIX 2.x will provide  even more opportunities for the STIX users to express the threats in a customisable and desired way.  CTI community and Researchers  4.1.13 Further research on TIPs  More research and evaluation studies are required in the field of TIPs since this new domain is still being  explored.  More specifically, three interesting topics for future research are the following:  o Scientific research and evaluation of TIP user interface, analysis options, visualisation  options and required functionalities [17].  o Empirical research on the value that TIP bring to the organisation and how data quality  impacts this value [21].  o Provide a standardised definition of TIPs as well as define and research on the  functional areas and capabilities of threat intelligence sharing platforms.  4.1.14 Further research on standards  CTI community members, researchers and OASIS CTI-TC [69] members could conduct research on some of the below  topics:   Researching on understanding the underutilisation of STIX 1.x.   Work on resolving STIX 1.x complexities and providing additional capabilities for STIX 2.x (e.g. built-in  extensibility, etc.).   Investigate how STIX 2.x includes metadata like accuracy, provenance and time-to-live information and  how can these practically be used via TIPs.   Provide the relevant tools, connectors and guidance so that organisations can adopt STIX 2.x.   Further research in lossless conversion between different formats/standards used in threat intelligence.  Converting information without losing any element or context between different formats is still a  challenge.   Further research on Unified Cyber Ontology [70]. The Unified Cybersecurity Ontology (UCO) is intended  to support information integration and cyber situational awareness in cybersecurity systems.   Further research on MISP Active Internet Drafts [71]. Currently, there are 4 MISP Active Internet Drafts  for MISP core format, MISP galaxy format, MISP object template format and MISP taxonomy format.   Further research on OpenDXL [72]. OpenDXL is an initiative to create adaptive systems of interconnected  services that communicate and share information for real-time, accurate security decisions and actions.   Further research on Sigma which is a generic signature format for SIEM systems [55].   Further research on IODEF [73].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  22  5.

In this section, a set of properties  enabled by TIPs is provided per intelligence cycle phase as Functional Areas (FA).  Figure 3: Intelligence cycle  6.1.1 Planning and direction  The planning and direction phase of the intelligence cycle is the first phase of the intelligence process and its main  focus is the definition of the priority intelligence requirements [74].  Currently, Threat Intelligence platforms have limited involvement in this phase of the intelligence cycle.  Nevertheless, TIP should act as a technology enablement so that users of TIP can perform the below activities [75]:  Requirements and gaps  - FA1.1 Collect and manage the identified requirements. Ideally, 3 requirements lists should be  managed: production requirements, intelligence requirements and collection requirements as  suggested in [76].  - FA1.2 Collect and manage the identified knowledge gaps that have been identified.  KPIs  - FA1.3 Provide and manage Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the intelligence program. The KPIs  can be the quality and quantity if finalized intelligence products, specific KPIs per intelligence phase,  etc.  RFIs  - FA1.4 Process and manage stakeholders’ Requests for Information (RFI). Stakeholders with or  without access to the TIP should be able to send a RFI to the TIP about a specific threat, so it can be  processed by the team.  6.1.2 Collection  The collection phase of the intelligence cycle is related to the gathering of the raw data required to produce the  finalized intelligence product [77].  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  34  The collection phase of the intelligence cycle and its activities could be streamlined by the use of a TIP. More  specifically, the complete functionalities of the TIP that are related to this phase are the following ones:  Data Ingestion  - FA2.1 Capability to ingest threat data from different sources. What is challenging here is the wide  variety of different sources: open source feeds, Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs),  private communities, commercial intelligence providers, intelligence exchange platforms etc.  - FA2.2 Capability to ingest threat data in as many different data models and standards: STIX 1.x, STIX  2.x  [27], OpenIOC [78], CybOX [28], IODEF [29], custom, etc. [79].  - FA2.3 Capability to ingest threat data via a variety of different transport mechanisms: TAXII [80],  HTTPS, REST API, RSS, email, SFTP, shared folders (SMB), etc. TIP should also support the cases  where the information will be pushed to the platform as well as when the information should be  pulled by the TIP.  - FA2.4 Capability to import threat data in a variety of data formats (XML, JSON, YAML, CSV, TSV, PDF,  DOCX, TXT). This also includes emails, PDFs, via freetext, via browser plugins, etc.  - FA2.5 Capability to collect tactical, operational and strategic intelligence [3].  - FA2.6 TIPs should be also able to collect structured, semi-structured and unstructured intelligence.  - FA2.7 Capability to collect threat data from local and internal sources (e.g. internal organisation  sandbox).  - FA2.8 Capability for customizable polling of feed sources (customizable periodicity).  Storage  - FA2.9 Capability to store the collected data securely [18].  - FA2.10 Capability to store the collected data at scale [18].  - FA2.11 Capability to store collected data and apply retain based on policies.  - FA2.12 Capability to index collected data for faster searching functionality.  - FA2.13 Capability to store collected data and enforce privacy laws, regulations and other  restrictions.  6.1.3 Processing and exploitation  The processing and exploitation phase follows the execution of the collection plan. During this  intelligence cycle phase, the capabilities of the TIPs can be grouped in three super categories: data  normalization, data enrichment and access control. Regarding data normalisation capabilities of the  TIP, the below ones have been identified:  Normalisation and data models  - FA3.1 TIP should have the capability to normalise all stored data in a common  format/standard/data model.  - FA3.2 Capability to manage many different standards / data models and provide compatibility and  correlation functions among them.  - FA3.3 Capability to process and extract information from multiple special types of data: binaries,  PCAP, emails, certificates, etc. Indicative capabilities could be the extraction of DNS and HTTP data  from PCAPs, identification of similar binaries by fuzzy hashing, binaries unpacking, extraction of  metadata from multiple file types, etc.  - FA3.4 TIP should also be supported by a flexible data model where complex objects can be  expressed and linked together to express indicators, campaigns, threat actors, relationships, etc.  Marking, taxonomies and classification  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  35  - FA3.5 Capability to apply custom tagging/marking. This could happen in a manual or in an  automated and predefined way.  - FA3.6 TIP should be capable of applying (custom) taxonomies to threat data on a predefined or  manual way [81].

TIP maturity model  Based on the functional areas of the TIP provided in the previous section, we hereby provide a TIP maturity model.  Thus, in this section we focus on the Technology part however Threat Management as a practice includes People  and Processes as well. This is critical for the success of the Cyber Threat Intelligence program of an organisation since  a common situation is organisation that have a mature TIP solution but are less mature with processes.  Relevant work regarding the Threat Intelligence Maturity Model has been conducted [12]  [106] [107] [108] [109]  [110] [111]. The threat intelligence program includes technology, processes and people, below the TIP maturity  model is focused mostly on the technology part where TIPs play a central role:   Level 1: Crawl  o At this level, the organisation is mostly on tactical intelligence collection and consumption and very  basic functionalities of a TIP platform are used. While consumption of a tactical feed is partially  implemented (integration with security controls), there is no ability to analyse the intelligence and  evaluate the threat sources. Sharing intelligence to the stakeholders is done in an ad-hoc way, based  on personal contacts and not in a standard way (no sharing policy defined). Intelligence and  intelligence products are somewhat integrated in the security controls.   Level 2: Walk  o At this level, the organisation starts actively taking advantage of TIP functionalities. TIP is used to  import internal intelligence and deploy indicators per device (security control). TIP also is the central  point where structured and unstructured intelligence from a wide range of sources: open source,  commercial, ISACs, community, etc. is stored and enriched. TIP provides the proper assurance for  access controls as well as secure storage and transport mechanisms. TIP has also the capability of  providing basic insights on the intelligence managed as well as basic analysis functionalities.  Intelligence products start being delivered consistent to stakeholders and standards are used when  sharing externally.   Level 3: Run  o At this level, the organisation uses the TIP as a strategic tool of choice for threat triage, management  and response.  Stakeholders requirements are clear and threat sources are evaluated periodically  via TIP provided capabilities. TIP provide awareness and insight on the processing that has already  been done. TIP provides a range of threat analysis and fusion capabilities as well as analyst workflow  building and collaboration functionalities. Dissemination is done in a systematic way to internal and  limits of tisps  PUBLIC  |  version 1.0  |  DEcember 2017  41  external stakeholders and integration into security controls and organisation workflow is fully  implemented.   Level 4: Fly  o At this level, TIP is the single pane of glass for the analysts and the stakeholders.  TIP provides  capabilities during all the phases of the intelligence cycle, automation is extensively used and  intelligence input is heavily embedded in the organisation. There are formal RFI, requirements,  intelligence policies, iterative evaluations and intelligence products.

Quickly adapting to new business models with  advanced threat actors leveraging the cybercrime ecosystem for a better distribution of labour,  ransomware has managed to increase its reach and impact significantly. No business is safe.  This report aims to bring new insights into the reality of ransomware incidents through mapping  and studying ransomware incidents from May 2021 to June 2022. The findings are grim.  Ransomware has adapted and evolved, becoming more efficient and causing more devastating  attacks. Businesses should be ready not only for the possibility of their assets being targeted by  ransomware but also to have their most private information stolen and possibly leaked or sold  on the Internet to the highest bidder.  The main highlights of the report include the following:  • A novel LEDS matrix (Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal) that accurately maps ransomware  capabilities based on the actions performed and assets targeted;  • A detailed and in-depth analysis of the ransomware life cycle: initial access,  execution, action on objectives, blackmail, and ransom negotiation;  • Collection and in-depth analysis of 623 ransomware incidents from May 2021 to  June 2022;  • More than 10 terabytes of data stolen monthly by ransomware from targeted  organisations;  • Approximately 58.2% of all the stolen data contains GDPR personal data based on  this analysis;  • In 95.3% of the incidents it is not known how threat actors obtained initial access into  the target organisation;  • It is estimated that more than 60% of affected organisations may have paid  ransom demands;  • At least 47 unique ransomware threat actors were found.  The report also highlights issues with the reporting of ransomware incidents and the fact  that we still have limited knowledge and information regarding such incidents. The  analysis in this report indicates that publicly disclosed incidents are just the tip of the iceberg.  Along with a general recommendation to contact the competent cybersecurity authorities and  law enforcement in cases of ransomware attacks, several other recommendations are put  forward, both to build resilience against such attacks and to mitigate their impact.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  6  1.  INTRODUCTION  The threat of ransomware has consistently ranked at the top in the ENISA Threat Landscape for  the past few years and, in particular, in 2021 it was assessed as being the prime cybersecurity  threat across the EU1. Motivated mainly by greed for money, the ransomware business model  has grown exponentially in the last decade2 and it is projected to cost more than $10 trillion by  20253. The evolution of the business model to a more specialised and organised distribution of  labour through a cybercrime-as-a-service model has turned ransomware into a commodity.  Nowadays, it seems simpler for anyone with basic technical skills to quickly perform  ransomware attacks. The introduction of cryptocurrency, the fact that affected companies  actually do pay the ransom, and the more efficient division of work, have greatly fuelled the  growth of ransomware, generating a catastrophic global effect4,5.  Even though ransomware is not new, technologies evolve and with them so do attacks and  vulnerabilities, thus pressurising organisations to be always prepared for a ransomware attack.  In many cases, staying in business requires difficult decisions, such as paying or not paying the  ransom6, since this money ends up fuelling ransomware activities. This is despite year-long and  consistent recommendation not to pay ransom demands and to contact the relevant  cybersecurity authorities to assist in handling such incidents.  This report brings new insights into the ransomware threat landscape through a careful study of  623 ransomware incidents from May 2021 to June 2022. The incidents were analysed in-depth  to identify their core elements, providing answers to some important questions such as how do  the attacks happen, are ransom demands being paid and which sectors are the most affected.  The report focuses on ransomware incidents and not on the threat actors or tools, aiming to  analyse ransomware attacks that actually happened as opposed to what could happen based  on ransomware capabilities. This ransomware threat landscape has been developed on the  basis of the recently published ENISA Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology7.  The report starts by clearly defining what ransomware is since it has proven to be an elusive  concept spanning various dimensions and including different stages. The definition is followed  by a novel description of the types of ransomware that breaks the traditional classification and  instead focuses on the four actions performed by ransomware, i.e. Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal  (LEDS), and the assets at which these actions are aimed. By defining the types of ransomware,  it is then possible to study the life cycle of ransomware and its business models. This  characterisation of ransomware leads into the core of this report which is the deep analysis of  623 incidents and its summary in precise statistics. The report ends by highlighting  recommendations for readers and key conclusions.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  8  2.  FOCUS ON RANSOMWARE  2.1  DEFINING RANSOMWARE  Defining what ransomware is has been elusive and has presented mismatching descriptions  that were modified as ransomware evolved. Therefore, based on previous work 8 9 10, in this  report ransomware is defined as follows.  Ransomware is a type of attack where threat actors take control of a target’s assets and  demand a ransom in exchange for the return of the asset’s availability and  confidentiality.  There are three key elements in every ransomware attack: assets, actions and blackmail.  Assets and actions will be discussed in the next section. Blackmail11 is the final key element of  ransomware attacks, where threat actors coerce the target through the use of threats  demanding something in return for asset availability. Many coercion methods are used to force  the target to comply with the ransom demands: publicity of the attack, partial or full data leaks,  distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the target infrastructure and others. While  blackmail is more commonly financially motivated, there is precedence for ransomware threat  actors demanding other things in exchange, such as a change in corporate policy, new software  features12, or asking targets to infect their social circle13.  Note that this definition does not depend on the action done, such as encrypt or steal, or the  type of demand done, monetary or not, and is inherently generic.  2.2  TYPES OF RANSOMWARE  Defining the types of ransomware is difficult because the concept of ransomware has evolved  and the technical capabilities of ransomware are similar to those of other malware. Up to the  mid-2010s, ransomware used to only focus on one or two actions, such as encryption or  locking. This made it easy to group ransomware in simple categories such as Encryption  Ransomware or Lock Screen Ransomware. However, ransomware is not tied to such  descriptions anymore and its evolution has made such simple categories no longer sufficient to  represent it.  This was further complicated by the lack of homogeneity in the naming of ransomware by the  cybersecurity industry, and the tradition in believing that the types where mutually exclusive,  e.g. Encryption Ransomware was only expected to encrypt files and not do anything else. We  therefore propose to talk about ransomware not in terms of type but in terms of actions they  perform and assets they target.  8 Ransomware Attack - What is it and How Does it Work?’ Check Point Software. https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber- hub/threat-prevention/ransomware /  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  9 ‘What Is Ransomware? - Definition, Prevention & More | Proofpoint US’. https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat- reference/ransomware  (accessed Jun. 28, 2022).  10 ENISA Threat Landscape 2021| https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 (accessed Jul. 5,  2022).  11 ‘BLACKMAIL | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com’, Lexico Dictionaries | English.  https://www.lexico.com/definition/blackmail  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  12 A.

We refer  to these four core actions as LEDS (Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal). Ransomware can lock  access to an asset, such as locking the screen, or lock access to a particular application. It can  encrypt an asset, making it unavailable to the target. It can steal an asset, compromising its  availability and in the end its confidentiality. Lastly, it can delete an asset, making it permanently  unavailable.  Assets are anything of value for a business or organisation. The most common targeted assets  by ransomware are files and folders. Most assets are technically a file in the majority of operating  systems, therefore the distinction needs to be made to show the differences between, for  example, ransomware that encrypts all the files in a target, compared with ransomware that only  encrypts parts of a file with the code to run a web server. However, it would be misleading to  assume that these are the only assets targeted. Other targeted assets may include databases,  web services, content management systems, screens, master boot records (MBR), master file  tables (MFT), and others.  Using actions and assets allows us to represent the capabilities of current ransomware in Table  1. This table only shows the capabilities of current ransomware as they were analysed, and it is  clear that many combinations are missing and there is room for variability as the threat  landscape evolves. Accordingly, this will be monitored by ENISA in future updates of this work.  Table 1: Capabilities of current ransomware in terms of actions they perform and assets they  target  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  10  2.3  LEDS ACTIONS  2.3.1 Lock  The action to lock an asset can imply very different things. In the case of mobile screens, it can  be simple to change the PIN of the mobile phone and lock the screen. In the case of an  application, it can be to change the credentials to access it, the same with hardware. In  particular, we don’t consider the act of encryption as locking since that is covered in the action  to encrypt.  2.3.2 Encrypt  Encrypt refers to the action of using an encryption algorithm to make the content of a file,  folder or text available only to those who know the encryption algorithm used and who possess  the encryption key to decrypt it. There are different types of encryption algorithms that can be  used, assets that can be encrypted partially, different encryption types and a difference  regarding where the encryption takes place: only in the client, or in the client and server.  2.3.3 Delete  The act of deletion refers to the action of ordering the operating system to delete a file by (i)  the official OS procedure (which only deletes the reference to the file in the folder structure in  most operating systems) or (ii) by deleting the file by rewriting its bytes. In the case of in- memory databases, deletion is the action of asking the database to delete the file. Deletion can  also be done to virtual machines in cloud environments using official dashboards, which do not  involve the operating system. Deletion of a file does not imply that the file was encrypted or  stolen.  2.3.4 Steal  The action of stealing refers to copying the asset into the control of the attacker. It can be by  exfiltrating data to the Internet, or by copying data to a secret local folder unknown to the  owner of the asset. In particular, stealing does not imply deleting, or encrypting.  2.4  ASSETS TARGETED BY RANSOMWARE  The following assets are the most commonly observed assets targeted by ransomware in our  study. The list will likely expand in the future as ransomware continues to exploit vulnerable  systems.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  11  Table 2: Commonly observed assets in Ransomware incidents  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  12  3.  RANSOMWARE LIFE CYCLE  The life cycle of ransomware remained unchanged until around 2018 when ransomware started  to add more functionality and blackmailing techniques matured. We can identify five stages of a  ransomware attack: initial access, execution, action on objectives, blackmail, and ransom  negotiation. These stages do not follow a strictly sequential path which can vary.  We need to clarify and highlight that ransom negotiation is not a suggested recommendation for  victims of ransomware attacks. Contacting the competent cybersecurity authority and/or law  enforcement is the recommended approach to handling such incidents. However, in describing  the life cycle of typical ransomware incidents, we opted to include this stage in order to be  inclusive as in several cases this stage did take place.  Figure 1 describes the life-cycle stages of a ransomware attack, following a typical flow of  events from initial access to ransom negotiation, including actions and assets, and what  constitutes blackmail. Each of these stages is further discussed in the following subsections.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  13  Figure 1: The five stages of the ransomware life cycle  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  14  3.1  INITIAL ACCESS  The first stage of a ransomware attack is the initial access to the target. Ransomware uses the  same techniques for getting access as other attacks may use, including exploiting software  vulnerabilities, access through stolen credentials, phishing and others. In this report, we will not  cover how these techniques have changed.  It is very challenging to find out what were the current initial access techniques used by  ransomware against targets. The problem is due to the lack of incident reporting by  compromised organisations which leads to reduced information sharing and relevant lessons  learned. Public statements reporting the incidents are rare, and in the few cases where they are  reported, they do not include details on how the attack happened, what ransomware attacked  them, what they possibly took and what ransom was demanded. Many times, information is not  shared because it may not be known or because the victims fear further adversarial actions by  the threat actors or, most commonly, because they wish to avoid perceived reputational  damages.  3.2  EXECUTION  After initial access, threat actors may study the target, move laterally to other computers and  employ attack techniques14 to ensure more assets are found to be exploited. This activity may  take several weeks depending on the threat actor and the size and defences in place by the  target. This movement is usually completed before the ransomware starts working, although  when the ransomware starts it can also move laterally inside the victim’s network.  Once the assets are located and before the ransomware is executed, there is usually a cleaning  part where some actions are taken to ensure the correct working of the ransomware, such as:  kill the security software, stop programs like databases that can interfere with the writing, stop  the recovery features of systems, shadow copies, logs, etc.  The next step is the deployment of the ransomware. The ransomware can be deployed directly  or it can be deployed by third parties using botnet-based malware delivery, such as in the case  of Ryuk ransomware that used TrickBot and Emotet as delivery mechanisms15.  3.3  ACTION ON OBJECTIVES  Once deployed, the ransomware attacks the availability and/or the confidentiality of the targeted  assets through a series of actions. This stage is traditionally known as Action on Objectives16.  The full capabilities of ransomware are discussed and mapped in Table 1. Ransomware actions  are not immediate and can take place weeks after the initial infection of the system, giving  attackers additional time to access more internal systems.  There is no guarantee that the encryption has been done correctly and that files could be  decrypted after payment is completed. This is one additional reason why paying a demand for  ransom is not a recommended approach, since there are no guarantees that it will be effective.  3.4  BLACKMAIL  After the availability of assets has been compromised, the threat actor then proceeds to  blackmail the target to obtain a ransom in return for the availability of the assets. The three main  components of blackmail are communication, threat and demand. Communication is the act of  informing the target what is happening, e.g. the asset is no longer available.

The demand is what the threat actor  expects to obtain from the situation.  The communication of ransom demands changed in the last decade, moving from private  communication to more public communication. Earlier, a ransom note was shown on the  affected systems with instructions on what to do to pay and get the data back, and how to  communicate privately with the threat actors to negotiate. Nowadays it is common for threat  actors to publicly showcase ransom incidents, including information on the assets affected, the  ransom demands, and often publicly discrediting the target. It is also nowadays common for  some threat actors to coerce not only the targets but also their customers, partners and  interested parties thus piling up the pressure on the target.  The threats made in ransom demands have also evolved, with new forms of coercion being  introduced. Currently, organisations are threatened with partial and full data leaks, deletion of  the assets, and reselling data to the highest bidder (oftentimes competitors of the target).  Targets are also threatened with distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) against an  organisation’s infrastructure, which will only stop after successful negotiation of the ransom  payment.  Ransomware demands have also evolved but in a smaller proportion. The primary demand is  still monetary, attempting to obtain a financial profit from the ransom payments. When the target  pays and the threats do not materialise, the threat actor gains reputation and notoriety with the  public, allowing them to continue their operations. However, demands are not always monetary.  There is ransomware that has requested companies to add or remove software features in their  products12 or ransomware that asks targets to infect other people in order to obtain free  decryption keys13.  3.5  RANSOM NEGOTIATION  The ransomware negotiation is generally a private communication, if any, between the target  and the threat actors. We need to stress again that this is not a recommended step,  nonetheless from an incident life cycle perspective we need to examine it since it has taken  place in some incidents. There are two outcomes to this negotiation: targets pay the ransom or  do not pay. It is not uncommon to hear that target organisations or individuals have successfully  negotiated with the threat actors to lower the ransom money demanded.  Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to quantify who paid or did not pay the ransom and in which  cases a lower ransom was agreed upon. This information is not commonly made publicly  available. Often, there are reports where the total earnings of the threat actors are reported but  not on an individual level. There are also threat actors that, after a successful payment, remove  the compromised target name from their public website. However, it is not safe to generalise  and assume that all targets that are no longer on the web page paid a ransom fee, as in many  cases ransomware websites are buggy and unstable. Moreover, basing assessments on the  claims of cyber criminals is not a reliable source.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  16  4.  RANSOMWARE BUSINESS  MODELS  Ransomware has significantly evolved, both technically and organisationally, since the first  incident was observed in 198917. The market has matured to such a degree that ransomware  has become a commodity18. With the new ransomware-as-a-service business models, almost  anyone can conduct a ransomware attack. You can buy it as a part of your larger operation, and  there are no significant differences between one ransomware family and another. However, the  ransomware organisation, like other malware underground, is complex, with multiple actors,  roles, problems, solutions and culture. Our exploration of the business models of ransomware  depicts a high level view of how threat actors create, organise and obtain value from  ransomware attacks19.  4.1  INDIVIDUAL ATTACKERS  Initially, ransomware attacks were conducted by single individuals or very small groups. These  ransomware attacks were less complex than attacks today, often focusing on automatic  encryption that did not require operational coordination. The focus of the attackers was on the  development and spread of the ransomware. It is very hard to know which groups started as  single individuals and how long they remained like that. Many threat actors probably started as  small groups as it seems the operation required plenty of work and coordination so eventually  all actors needed the organisation of a small group20.  4.2  GROUP THREAT ACTORS  In what is now considered the traditional ransomware business model, a single group  threat actor is composed of multiple individuals that share and split and coordinate all the  stages of the operation: picking the target, analysing the target for vulnerabilities, conducting the  attacks, producing the malware and infection, coordinating the file encryption keys, negotiating  the ransom payment, and getting the revenue. The same group also generally develops all their  tools, sets the payment system, and buys exploits or the information required to conduct  successful attacks. This business model is still the main organisational choice even though new  opportunities have appeared, such as ransomware-as-a-service.  4.3  RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE  Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) is a type of business model where threat actor groups offer  their software platform to external affiliates to conduct attacks21. Affiliate markets are well known  in the cybercrime organisation. The affiliate programme is operated by a threat actor group  (RaaS operator) and it incorporates external affiliates that use the malware and payment  platform. This RaaS model probably emerged due to the success in the Group Threat Actor type  17 KnowBe4, ‘AIDS Trojan | PC Cyborg | Original Ransomware | KnowBe4’. https://www.knowbe4.com/aids-trojan  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022).  18 ‘2021 the year of commodity ransomware, says Sophos’, ComputerWeekly.com.  https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252492290/2021-the-year-of-commodity-ransomware-says-Sophos  (accessed Jul.  02, 2022)  19 A.

The RaaS operators develop the ransomware and provide the software platform for affiliates to  operate. The RaaS affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks, the payment negotiation, collect  the ransom and also purchase additional exploits or information needed to conduct the  attacks22. This type of business model allows the RaaS operators to have multiple revenue  streams. One source of income is a percentage of the ransom payment to the affiliates, often  10-20% or more23. Other sources of income can be selling data about targets, monthly  subscriptions that affiliates pay to access the platform24, or consultancy to other threat actors25.  RaaS has lowered the entry-level barrier to conduct ransomware attacks. Attackers now do not  need to know how to write their own ransomware. They need to know only how to conduct an  attack, and the RaaS operators will provide the ransomware and the platform to operate.  Anyone can attack, and anyone can become a target. RaaS platforms also introduce a new  level of anonymity into the cybercrime operations, as it is rarely known who the attacker really is  while operating as an affiliate. It is now easier than ever to get into ransomware as an affiliate,  profit and retire quickly, as has already been witnessed with some threat actors25.  4.4  DATA BROKERAGE  Ransomware threat actors are moving towards a new business model referred as Data  Brokerage. In this model, threat actors take further advantage of the stolen data by selling it to  the highest bidders26. This also includes reselling the access obtained to the target to other  threat actors for additional exploitation2 27.  4.5  NOTORIETY AS KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL RANSOMWARE BUSINESS  Ransomware demands are mostly financially motivated. In order to succeed in the business,  ransomware needs to demonstrate a guarantee that decryption will work. Usually, threat actors  have mechanisms to show that the decryption works, such as decrypting sample files.  The ransomware operators need to maintain a certain reputation of notoriety, otherwise, victims  will not pay the ransom. The reputation of ransomware groups also depends on how well they  keep their word. Many attackers promise that upon payment they will remove the companies  from their websites, delete the stolen data and not leak data to the public. A report shows that in  18% of cases the companies that paid the ransom still got their data leaked, and 35% of the  victims that paid the ransomware were unable to retrieve their data28.  Notoriety and reputation is nearly impossible to measure, however, a 2021 report showed that  60% of respondents that reported ransomware incidents did actually negotiate with their  attackers, showing that victims perceive threat actors to be worthy interlocutors28.  Although ransomware threat actors seem to have kept their word in some cases, one needs to  realise that there is no guarantee that payment of a ransom will lead to solutions and standing  22 V.

Negotiating with cyber criminals is not recommended and, in  the case of ransomware incidents, contacting law enforcement and national cybersecurity  authorities is the recommended course of action.  Moreover, there are operational problems that directly impact the trust of the ransomware actors  and the whole ecosystem. Ransomware threat actors need infrastructure to work, but this  infrastructure has turned out to be very unreliable, with websites not updated, links to public  leaks expiring, data not available, and websites going down. This instability generates  uncertainty among victims, since it is not easy to confirm whether a ransomware attack actually  happened and whether files were really stolen, hence once again contacting authorities should  be pursued.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  19  5.  ANALYSIS OF  RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS  After presenting and defining ransomware, this section provides an analysis of sample incidents  between May 2021 and June 2022, showing the lay of the ransomware landscape and its  characteristics.  Before presenting the results it is important to clarify what is considered a ransomware incident  for the purposes of this analysis. A ransomware incident is a successful attack in which a threat  actor manages to access a target, perform any LEDS action (Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal) on  the target’s assets, and perform blackmail. Note that the ransom negotiation is not needed –  and certainly not encouraged – to consider an attack a ransomware incident.  Our analysis considers 623 ransomware incidents worldwide with a special focus on Europe,  the United Kingdom and the United States. These incidents were selected from news reports,  the reports of security companies, government reports and the original sites of the ransomware  threat actors. Each incident was explored in depth and confirmed from multiple sources.  5.1  DATA SAMPLING TECHNIQUE  It is important to understand the limitations of the data gathering process. To search, find and  collect the ransomware incidents in this report, different sources of data were used, such as  government reports, security company reports, news media reports, the dark web and  sometimes verified blogs. The sources were then processed, analysed and aggregated to  extract as much information about an incident as possible. In some ransomware incidents the  research has been a challenging task, as there was not enough available information.  The real total number of ransomware incidents in the period May 2021 to June 2022 is very  hard to estimate, due to many organisations not reporting the incidents and threat actors  deleting incidents from their pages.  Classifying the numbers of incidents on the basis of the source from which the relevant  information has been extracted is important, as it illustrates the level of trust in the collected  data.  Four types of number of incidents can be considered in this regard:  1. The real number of ransomware incidents  2. The number of ransomware incidents reported to governments  3. The number of ransomware incidents reported by news media and security companies  4. The number of ransomware incidents reported by ransomware groups on their web  pages  The real number of ransomware incidents is the real population of ransomware incidents in  the world. It is known that many organisations do not acknowledge incidents publicly, thus  making this number almost impossible to obtain.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  20  The number of ransomware incidents reported to governments is the number of  organisations that contacted a government to ask for assistance and report the attack. For  example, in 2021, the FBI Crime Report from the Internet Crime Complaint Centre (IC3)29  received 3,729 complaints identified as ransomware.  The number of ransomware incidents reported by news media and security companies is  more commonly reported but heavily biased towards the importance of the attacked  organisation. For example, from April 2021 to April 2022 the Sophos IT security company  indirectly reported 3,696 ransomware incidents (from 5,600 respondents in a survey of whom  66% had ransomware)30.  The number of ransomware incidents reported by ransomware groups on their web  pages is the most real account of incidents, but it is difficult to measure due to the instability of  the ransomware infrastructure. These incidents are often deleted or changed, web pages are  taken down or have migration issues. However, some organisations web-scraping threat actors'  websites31 reported 2,252 incidents in 2021, and 1,858 from January to June 2022.  We estimated that the total number of incidents from May 2021 to June 2022 was 3,64032 .  Since this report analyses 623 incidents, it therefore covers 17.11% of the total estimated cases  in that time frame. All results and conclusions as presented should take into account this  disclaimer concerning the number of incidents used in this analysis.  More importantly, it becomes evident from the varying numbers concerning how many  ransomware incidents took place that there is an issue with reporting such incidents.  Making detailed analysis and mitigating the ransomware threat necessitates a better  understanding of the threat landscape and to do so, more efficient and effective incident  reporting is necessary. In addition, the fact that we were able to find publicly available  information for 17.11% of the cases highlights that when it comes to ransomware, only  the tip of the iceberg is exposed and the impact is much higher than what is perceived.  5.2  STATISTICS ABOUT THE INCIDENTS  To qualitatively analyse the 623 incidents we studied each incident in further detail (using  publicly available information) and extracted information about the following categories.  Categories Description  Target Name of the organisation targeted.  Industry sector Industry sector of the target  Country Country of the target  Threat actor Name of the threat actor  Initial access techniques MITRE ATT&CK® category of the technique used to compromise  and access the target  29 ‘Internet Crime Report 2021’, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2021.

Ransomware Watch for 2021 reported  2,252, an average of 188 incidents per month. Sophos for Apr 2021 to Apr 2022 reported 3,696 incidents, an average of  308 incidents per month. Ransomware Watch from Jan 2021 to June 2022 reported 1,858 incidents, an average of 310  incidents per month. The average of the average incidents per month is (312 + 188 + 308 + 310) / 4, which equals 280  incidents per month. Therefore, from May 2021 to June 2022 (inclusive) there are 13 months and an estimated total of  280*13 = 3,640 incidents.  https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf https://www.sophos.com/en-us/content/state-of-ransomware https://www.sophos.com/en-us/content/state-of-ransomware https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/fe3b0cf47bf439b10c3e69581a47346404a491b3/posts.json  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  21  Was the ransom paid?

The total accumulated stolen data for all incidents is 136.3  TB with an average of 518 GB per incident and an average of 10 TB per month. The  maximum volume of stolen data found in one incident alone was 50 TB; this was stolen from  Brazil’s Ministry of Health (MoH) by the Lapsus$ threat actor33. The timeline shown in Figure 5  illustrates the cumulative amount of data stolen per month.  5.4  AMOUNT OF LEAKED DATA  There are two main ways in which data can be leaked in a ransomware incident. First, data can  be partially leaked by threat actors to prove that they actually stole the data or to blackmail  targets to pay the ransom. Second, as a result of a failed ransom negotiation where threat  actors usually do a full data leak of the stolen data. The full data leak usually contains all the  stolen data.  Many different platforms are used to leak the stolen data. Threat actors may use their own  websites, cloud providers, or the group’s Telegram channel. Cloud providers usually take down  the leaks due to privacy concerns, but the leaks hosted on the attackers’ website remain  available, as well as on Telegram.  Of the 623 incidents analysed, evidence was found of partially leaked data in 62  incidents, 9.95% of the total incidents. Similarly, evidence was found of fully leaked data  in 236 incidents, which is 37.88% of the incidents. In total, in almost half of the cases  (47.83%) stolen data was leaked.  5.5  TYPE OF LEAKED DATA  More than 136 terabytes of data was stolen in the 623 incidents analysed. In 31% of the  incidents, attackers provided an insight into the type of data stolen, which often included  personal and business information.  5.6  PERSONAL DATA  In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines personal data as ‘any  information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person’34.and protects them35.  33 ‘Brazilian Ministry of Health suffers cyberattack and COVID-19 vaccination data vanishes’, ZDNet.  https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-ministry-of-health-suffers-cyberattack-and-covid-19-vaccination-data-vanishes/  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  34 Personal Data’, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/  (accessed Jul.  02, 2022).  35 EUR-Lex - 32016R0679 - EN - EUR-Lex’. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022).  https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-ministry-of-health-suffers-cyberattack-and-covid-19-vaccination-data-vanishes/ https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  22  Our analysis shows that 58.2% of all the stolen data contains GDPR personal data. This  personal data ranges from protected health information (PHI), passport numbers and visas, to  addresses and covid status.  In countries outside the European Union, personal data is classified into two types, personal  identifiable information (PII) and personal protected information (PPI). PII is any data that could  potentially identify a specific individual36, whereas PPI is personal information that is important  but not necessarily used to identify an individual37.  Our analysis shows that 33% of the stolen data includes employee PII and 18.3%  includes customer PII. In contrast, only 0.4% of the stolen data includes employee PPI  and 3.8% includes customer PPI.  5.7  NON-PERSONAL DATA  Additionally, 41.7% of the stolen data contains non-personal data. Non-personal data is  any information that is not related to identifiable natural persons. This data contains information  that directly impacts the targeted business, such as financial information, blueprints, insurance,  market research, internal network data, and more.  Of the stolen data, 19% contains financial information. Financial information refers to  business data related specifically with the financial aspects of the business. This data may  include departmental budgets, receipts, income declarations, financial statements, and more.  More than 24% of the data stolen contains business information. Business information  refers to data that is important for the company business, such as production data,  administrative documents, legal files, commercial registrations, NDAs (Non-Disclosure  Agreements), and more.  5.8  INCIDENTS PER COUNTRY  The estimation of incidents per country (shown in Figure 2) is biased by our data selection  process since this report focuses on incidents primarily in Europe, the United States and the  United Kingdom. Accordingly, the results present an interesting yet not fully representative  overview, since as discussed above, reported incidents and publicly available information is  scarce.  Of the 623 incidents analysed, we found that the top three countries attacked are the  United States with 112 incidents, Germany with 96 incidents, and France with 78  incidents.  36 ‘What is PII (Personally Identifiable Information)?

We have summarised some of  the most common initial access techniques observed according to the MITRE ATT&CK  framework39.

It is understandable that targets don’t want to share how they were (or still are)  vulnerable for security reasons but at the same time the lack of information does not help others to realise what they  should improve or how they can also be a victim in the future.  From the rest of the known 29 incidents for which initial access was leaked, there is small amount of data  upon which to draw conclusions; the distribution is as follows.  INITIAL ACCESS according to MITRE No of Incidents  T1133 External Remote Services 12  T1566 Phishing 8  T1195 Supply Chain Compromise 4  T1078 Valid Accounts 4  T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation 1  5.10  PAID RANSOM  It is very difficult to know whether targets paid the ransom or not, since most targets do not  share this information publicly and in many countries it is illegal to pay and in any case it is  discouraged. Moreover, sometimes targets want to pay a smaller amount of ransom but the  threat actor refuses, and the data is leaked anyway41. From all the incidents analysed, it was  not possible to confirm whether a ransom was paid in 588 cases, which is 94.2%. Out of  the rest of the incidents in our analysis, 8 paid the ransom and 58 did not pay the  ransom. Once again, this gap in incident reporting limits our understanding and thus our ability  to perform a proper analysis and mitigate the threat of ransomware; therefore solutions to this  problem need to be examined.  Interestingly, from our previous analysis of leaked data, we found that 37.88% of the  targets had their data fully leaked on the Internet. This suggests, but does not imply, that  around 62.12% of the incidents might have actually paid the ransom, and that is why  their data was not leaked. Of course, there are many mitigating situations, such as targets that  paid and their data was leaked anyway, or targets that did not pay and their data was not  leaked. However, the estimation of 62.12% is very close to the result of a survey from the  Claroty security company that found that 62.14% of the respondents confirmed that their  company paid the ransom42. Although these numbers should not be taken as a guide because  they are merely indicators, they certainly bring the problem into focus.  5.11  INCIDENTS IN EACH TYPE OF SECTOR  A meaningful statistic can be derived from the number of ransomware incidents in each sector.  However, special attention must be paid to the fact that the categorisation process we did of  each target in a sector is slightly biased because a target can belong to many categories.  Figure 3 shows a comparison of the number of incidents in each sector. This graph  suggests that ransomware is targeting all sectors indiscriminately and that no type of  industrial sector is safe.  41 ‘Hackers post hundreds of pages of purported internal D.C. police documents’, Washington Post.

However, unlike other cyberthreat groups, when it comes to ransomware threat actors publicly share and  take attribution for their attacks. From the 623 incidents analysed, only 22 incidents show no confirmation of  which threat actor was behind the attack, amounting to only 3.5% of all incidents. Therefore the threat actor  was known in 96.5% of cases. This is in stark contrast to other cybersecurity threats, where the identity of the threat  actors is not actively published. However, the ransomware business model works on increasing the visibility and  notoriety of ransomware groups and actors, hence the difference.  Our analysis in Figure 4 shows that the incidents were carried out by 47 unique ransomware threat actors.  The top 3 attackers are Conti, LockBit and Hive, which should come as no surprise given how prolific these threat  actors have been in the past year43. However, these total numbers should not be taken as a strong guideline since  our selection process slightly biased this evaluation by choosing at least 5 incidents from each threat actor.  43 ‘LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat Lead Pack Amid Rise in Active RaaS and Extortion Groups: Ransomware in Q1 2022 -  Security News’. https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat- lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat-lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat-lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  26  Figure 4: Number of ransomware incidents caused by each threat actor  5.13  TIMELINE OF RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS  The 623 ransomware incidents analysed from May 2021 to June 2022 are shown in a  timeline in Figure 5. This timeline highlights the number of incidents and the cumulative data  stolen.  The number of incidents each month, shown in the vertical red colour bars above the horizontal  line, is built using the date of when the incident was reported and not when the attack  happened, which could have taken place weeks before. Curiously enough, researchers often  need to rely on ransomware websites to obtain this data due to the lack of transparency when it  comes to reporting ransomware incidents.  The cumulative amount of data stolen in terabytes (TB), shown in the vertical blue colour bars  below the horizontal line, should be understood as a base value, given that in more than 50% of  the incidents this information was unknown. The cumulative amount of data stolen should  also highlight the impact of ransomware, given that in at least 47% of the incidents the  stolen data was partially or fully leaked.

RECOMMENDATIONS  Ransomware attacks are a global problem, affecting organisations of all sizes across all sectors.  This threat landscape aims to identify the issues and challenges related to ransomware, to  highlight important trends and identify opportunities on how to improve the fight against  ransomware.  The reality shows that ransomware can have devastating effects on organisations if they are not  well prepared. In this section we present general recommendations that can help organisations  deal better with the problem of ransomware. The recommendations focus on several key  aspects: preparing against ransomware attacks and decreasing the impact of ransomware as  well as the decision to pay.  6.1  RESILIENCE AGAINST RANSOMWARE  The techniques attackers use are continuously evolving and they are finding new ways to  compromise targets. Organisations should not think whether they may suffer a ransomware  attack but when it will happen. These recommendations should help organisations prepare for a  ransomware attack before it happens and during its aftermath.  • Have a good and verified backup of all your business-critical files and personal data  and keep it updated, and isolated from the network44.  • Apply the 3-2-1 rule of backup. For all data: 3 copies, 2 different storage media, 1 copy  offsite45.  • Keep personal data encrypted according to the provisions of GDPR and using  appropriate risk-based controls46.  • Run security software in your endpoint devices that can detect most ransomware.  • Maintain your security awareness47, security policy, and privacy protection policy up to  date and working on your information systems and assets to accomplish desired  hygiene by industry best practices such as network segmentation, up to date patches,  regular backups, and appropriate identity, credential, and access management (ICAM)  preferably with support of MFA. This that basically result in a good security hygiene48  • Conduct regular risk assessment and consider taking out ransomware insurance49  based on this assessment.  • Restrict administrative privileges: use caution when handing out administrative  privileges as the admin account has access to everything, including changing  configurations or bypassing critical security settings. Always employ the Principle of  Least Privilege (PLOP) when granting any type of access50.  44 Simple Steps for Internet Safety’, Federal Bureau of Investigation. https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/simple-steps-for- internet-safety  (accessed Jul. 04, 2022)  45 ‘Backup’, Wikipedia.

Furthermore, sharing information with the authorities about the ransomware incident is highly  recommended. Such information sharing can lead to better lessons learned to assist other  potential victims, can assist the authorities and security researchers and responders to better  handle incidents and identify threat actors, and can provide more reliable data to map the threat  landscape and its evolution. Information sharing is one of the cornerstones of  cybersecurity.  When it comes to negotiating with threat actors about making ransom payments, this is not  recommended as repeatedly mentioned in this report. From a legal standpoint, organisations  should be aware of the current regulations about ransom payments. In some countries paying a  ransom is illegal. One should consult with the legal team and the local government agencies on  how to deal with ransomware attacks.  From a technical standpoint, it should be clear to every organisation that paying the ransom  does not always result in the recovery of the assets and a successful decryption. Businesses  should consider the cost of paying the ransom and not having the business back online.  Additionally, paying the ransom and recovering the assets does not mean that the stolen  information is not going to be leaked or sold afterwards; all stolen information should be  considered as compromised. Sophos reported that only 4% of the companies that paid the  ransom got all their data back and the majority that paid only got approximately 60% of their  data back53.  From a business standpoint, organisations should evaluate and consider the option of  recovering the business without the compromised assets, how much it would cost, and what is  the real impact of the stolen information being leaked even if the ransom is paid. Before  considering paying the ransom, organisations should consider the cost of a publicity backlash,  and be aware of the ethical standpoint.  From an ethical standpoint, organisations should be aware that they were attacked because of  ransomware’s fast growth, a growth caused primarily because organisations previously  infected paid the ransomware operators and funded their operations. Ransom payments  are undoubtedly fuelling the rapid growth of ransomware. Therefore, organisations should  51 ‘Report Ransomware | CISA’. https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/report-ransomware-0  (accessed Jul. 04, 2022)  52 No More Ransom’, The No More Ransom Project. https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/index.html  (accessed Jul. 02,  2022).  53 Sophos, ‘The State of Ransomware 2022’, Apr. 2022.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  31  7.  CONCLUSIONS  The analysis of the ransomware threat landscape from May 2021 to June 2022 resulted in some  conclusions that can be regarded as takeaways for the community.  7.1  LACK OF RELIABLE DATA  In general, ransomware security incidents are seldom reported. Most organisations prefer to  deal with the problem internally and avoid bad publicity. Some countries have laws regulating  the mandatory reporting of incidents, but in most cases a security attack is first disclosed by the  attacker.  A recent legislative initiative in the United States requires the reporting of all security incidents  and ransom payments to the Department of Justice Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency (CISA)54. In the EU, the arrival of the revised Network and Information Security  Directive 255 and the enhanced notification provisions for security incidents is expected to  support a better understanding of relevant incidents.  The lack of reliable data from targeted organisations makes it very hard to fully  understand the problem or even know how many ransomware cases there are. To this  day, the most reliable sources for finding out which organisations have been infected are the  web pages of the ransomware threat actors. This lack of transparency is not good for the  industry, since the majority of the data leaked, as was found in this report, is personal data that  belongs to employees and customers.  Even using the data from the web pages of threat actors (an undeniably unreliable source), it is  very hard to keep track of the number of attacks, particularly because a large majority is ignored  by the media, goes unreported by the victims and gets no coverage. The most important  information that is missing is the technical explanation as to how the attackers obtained access  to the targets. This is usually private data that describes the security posture of the target, so it  is never shared with the public. As a consequence, our learning as a community of the  problems to be solved remains fragmented and isolated.  Lastly, the trend in RaaS makes it hard to identify the threat actor behind an attack, since now  the ransomware tool and command and control are shared between many different affiliates  and threat actor groups.  7.2  THREAT LANDSCAPE  The study conducted on ransomware attacks from May 2021 to June 2022 showed that on  average more than 10 terabytes of data a month were stolen by ransomware threat  actors. Our research shows that 58.2% of the stolen data contains personal data from  employees. Given the sensitivity of such data, coordinated actions are needed to counter this  threat. Ransomware threat actors are motivated mostly in terms of the acquisition of money,  which increases the complexity of the attacks and, of course, the capabilities of the adversaries.  In 94.2% of the incidents it is not known whether the company paid the ransom or not.  However, 37.88% of the incidents had their data leaked on the webpages of the attackers,  indicating that the ransom negotiations failed. This allows us to estimate that  54 ‘Reporting of cyber incidents becomes law in the USA | Pen Test Partners’. https://www.pentestpartners.com/security- blog/reporting-of-cyber-incidents-becomes-law-in-the-usa/  (accessed Jul. 04, 2022)  55 See https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity- network-and-information-systems May 2022  https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/reporting-of-cyber-incidents-becomes-law-in-the-usa/ https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/reporting-of-cyber-incidents-becomes-law-in-the-usa/ https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  32  approximately 62.12% of the companies might somehow have come to an agreement or  solution concerning the ransom demand.  Ransomware is thriving, and our research shows that threat actors are conducting  indiscriminate attacks. Companies of every size across all sectors are affected. Anyone can  become a target. We urge organisations to prepare for ransomware attacks and consider  possible consequences before attacks occur.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  33  APPENDIX A: NOTABLE  INCIDENTS  This appendix presents the life cycles of two distinct cases. These two incidents resulted in  significant damage caused by the attacks and demands for quite large amounts of ransom.  Each of these cases helps illustrate the life cycle of ransomware incidents as explained in  Chapter 4.  A.1 COLONIAL PIPELINE RANSOMWARE INCIDENT  The Colonial Pipeline is the largest pipeline system for refined oil products in the United  States56 and provides roughly 45% of the United States East Coast's fuel, including gasoline,  diesel, home heating oil, jet fuel, and military supplies57.  On May 7, 2021, attackers gained initial access to the Colonial Pipeline network through  exposed VPN account credentials (T1078 58). The execution phase consisted of deploying  DarkSide ransomware59. The ransomware then proceeded to steal and encrypt files and folders  in the target. Nearly 100GBs of company data was stolen. The threat actor threatened to  publish leaked files if their demand was not met. The group demanded money, specifically 75  bitcoin in ransom, equivalent to approximately $4.4 million dollars, in exchange for a file  decryptor to restore the files. The result of the negotiations was that Colonial Pipeline paid the  ransom, received a file decryptor from the attackers, and used it to decrypt affected files and  folders. The life cycle is shown in Figure 6.  Although the payment of the ransom was made, the decryption tool had a very long processing  time so the company could not get the system back up quickly enough. This forced the Colonial  Pipeline Company to halt all pipeline operations and freeze IT systems to contain the attack.  Apart from the downtime, the ransomware attack also caused fuel shortages at several filling  stations and affected several airports leading to changes in flight schedules and more economic  loss.  The US Department of Justice stated that it had seized 63.7 Bitcoins from the original ransom  payment which was only $2.3 million because the trading price of Bitcoin had fallen since the  date the ransom was paid.  Darkside ransomware locks security software and event logging processes, deletes backups,  and steals and encrypts files and folders.  56 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack’, Wikipedia.

Their products are  installed on client workstations, endpoint management servers and managed services providers  (MSPs), which are companies that provide IT services to other companies. Each MSP has a  number of companies that they service and if one MSP is breached, it impacts all their clients,  which explains the widespread use of ransomware.  On July 3rd, 2021, attackers gained initial access to the supplier of Kaseya VSA servers by  exploiting a software vulnerability, specifically a SQL injection attack (T119061) 62 63. The SQL  attack resulted in the malicious payload by REvil being released and pushed to Kaseya  customers as a hotfix. A CVE was assigned for the vulnerability introduced by the attackers:  CVE-2021–3011664.  Attackers gained initial access to Kaseya customers, MSPs, by exploiting a trusted relationship  (T119965) on Kaseya software; attackers could send instructions and commands to the software  60 What is RMM - definition of remote monitoring and management system’, Atera - RMM software | PSA & Remote Access  for MSPs. https://www.atera.com/what-is-rmm/  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  61 Exploit Public-Facing Application, Technique T1190 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®’.  https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022).  62 J.

In the execution phase, the attackers deployed REvil ransomware  on the target. The ransomware then proceeded to encrypt files and folders.  The blackmail component of this incident was special. Due to the impact of the attack, threat  actors demanded from Kaseya and indirectly its customers, the sum of 70 million dollars in  exchange for a file decryptor that would allow restoration of the availability of the affected assets  in all affected systems66. There were also alternative demands to accommodate individual  needs; 5 million dollars were demanded from individual MSPs to get a decryptor, 50,000 dollars  were demanded from MSPs’ customers to get a decryptor, and 40,000-45,000 dollars were  demanded to decrypt specific file extensions per customer67. The threat actor threatened to  double ransom money if there was no payment.  The result of the negotiations was that neither Kaseya nor the affected customers paid the  ransom. A file decryptor was obtained, it is unknown how, and many systems were able to be  restored.  Overall, the supply chain incident, shown in Figure 7, resulted in the compromise and  encryption of over 50 MSPs and between 800 and 1500 companies which represents a total of  37,000 of Kaseya’s clients or 0.001% of their total customer base. The ransomware demand of  70 million dollars was the biggest ransom demand as of July 23rd, 2021. The REvil ransomware  encrypts files, but no data-stealing or deleting of capabilities were observed67. The life cycle is  shown in Figure 8.  66 D.

Quickly adapting to new business models with  advanced threat actors leveraging the cybercrime ecosystem for a better distribution of labour,  ransomware has managed to increase its reach and impact significantly. No business is safe.  This report aims to bring new insights into the reality of ransomware incidents through mapping  and studying ransomware incidents from May 2021 to June 2022. The findings are grim.  Ransomware has adapted and evolved, becoming more efficient and causing more devastating  attacks. Businesses should be ready not only for the possibility of their assets being targeted by  ransomware but also to have their most private information stolen and possibly leaked or sold  on the Internet to the highest bidder.  The main highlights of the report include the following:  • A novel LEDS matrix (Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal) that accurately maps ransomware  capabilities based on the actions performed and assets targeted;  • A detailed and in-depth analysis of the ransomware life cycle: initial access,  execution, action on objectives, blackmail, and ransom negotiation;  • Collection and in-depth analysis of 623 ransomware incidents from May 2021 to  June 2022;  • More than 10 terabytes of data stolen monthly by ransomware from targeted  organisations;  • Approximately 58.2% of all the stolen data contains GDPR personal data based on  this analysis;  • In 95.3% of the incidents it is not known how threat actors obtained initial access into  the target organisation;  • It is estimated that more than 60% of affected organisations may have paid  ransom demands;  • At least 47 unique ransomware threat actors were found.  The report also highlights issues with the reporting of ransomware incidents and the fact  that we still have limited knowledge and information regarding such incidents. The  analysis in this report indicates that publicly disclosed incidents are just the tip of the iceberg.  Along with a general recommendation to contact the competent cybersecurity authorities and  law enforcement in cases of ransomware attacks, several other recommendations are put  forward, both to build resilience against such attacks and to mitigate their impact.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  6  1.  INTRODUCTION  The threat of ransomware has consistently ranked at the top in the ENISA Threat Landscape for  the past few years and, in particular, in 2021 it was assessed as being the prime cybersecurity  threat across the EU1. Motivated mainly by greed for money, the ransomware business model  has grown exponentially in the last decade2 and it is projected to cost more than $10 trillion by  20253. The evolution of the business model to a more specialised and organised distribution of  labour through a cybercrime-as-a-service model has turned ransomware into a commodity.  Nowadays, it seems simpler for anyone with basic technical skills to quickly perform  ransomware attacks. The introduction of cryptocurrency, the fact that affected companies  actually do pay the ransom, and the more efficient division of work, have greatly fuelled the  growth of ransomware, generating a catastrophic global effect4,5.  Even though ransomware is not new, technologies evolve and with them so do attacks and  vulnerabilities, thus pressurising organisations to be always prepared for a ransomware attack.  In many cases, staying in business requires difficult decisions, such as paying or not paying the  ransom6, since this money ends up fuelling ransomware activities. This is despite year-long and  consistent recommendation not to pay ransom demands and to contact the relevant  cybersecurity authorities to assist in handling such incidents.  This report brings new insights into the ransomware threat landscape through a careful study of  623 ransomware incidents from May 2021 to June 2022. The incidents were analysed in-depth  to identify their core elements, providing answers to some important questions such as how do  the attacks happen, are ransom demands being paid and which sectors are the most affected.  The report focuses on ransomware incidents and not on the threat actors or tools, aiming to  analyse ransomware attacks that actually happened as opposed to what could happen based  on ransomware capabilities. This ransomware threat landscape has been developed on the  basis of the recently published ENISA Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Methodology7.  The report starts by clearly defining what ransomware is since it has proven to be an elusive  concept spanning various dimensions and including different stages. The definition is followed  by a novel description of the types of ransomware that breaks the traditional classification and  instead focuses on the four actions performed by ransomware, i.e. Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal  (LEDS), and the assets at which these actions are aimed. By defining the types of ransomware,  it is then possible to study the life cycle of ransomware and its business models. This  characterisation of ransomware leads into the core of this report which is the deep analysis of  623 incidents and its summary in precise statistics. The report ends by highlighting  recommendations for readers and key conclusions.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  8  2.  FOCUS ON RANSOMWARE  2.1  DEFINING RANSOMWARE  Defining what ransomware is has been elusive and has presented mismatching descriptions  that were modified as ransomware evolved. Therefore, based on previous work 8 9 10, in this  report ransomware is defined as follows.  Ransomware is a type of attack where threat actors take control of a target’s assets and  demand a ransom in exchange for the return of the asset’s availability and  confidentiality.  There are three key elements in every ransomware attack: assets, actions and blackmail.  Assets and actions will be discussed in the next section. Blackmail11 is the final key element of  ransomware attacks, where threat actors coerce the target through the use of threats  demanding something in return for asset availability. Many coercion methods are used to force  the target to comply with the ransom demands: publicity of the attack, partial or full data leaks,  distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the target infrastructure and others. While  blackmail is more commonly financially motivated, there is precedence for ransomware threat  actors demanding other things in exchange, such as a change in corporate policy, new software  features12, or asking targets to infect their social circle13.  Note that this definition does not depend on the action done, such as encrypt or steal, or the  type of demand done, monetary or not, and is inherently generic.  2.2  TYPES OF RANSOMWARE  Defining the types of ransomware is difficult because the concept of ransomware has evolved  and the technical capabilities of ransomware are similar to those of other malware. Up to the  mid-2010s, ransomware used to only focus on one or two actions, such as encryption or  locking. This made it easy to group ransomware in simple categories such as Encryption  Ransomware or Lock Screen Ransomware. However, ransomware is not tied to such  descriptions anymore and its evolution has made such simple categories no longer sufficient to  represent it.  This was further complicated by the lack of homogeneity in the naming of ransomware by the  cybersecurity industry, and the tradition in believing that the types where mutually exclusive,  e.g. Encryption Ransomware was only expected to encrypt files and not do anything else. We  therefore propose to talk about ransomware not in terms of type but in terms of actions they  perform and assets they target.  8 Ransomware Attack - What is it and How Does it Work?’ Check Point Software. https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber- hub/threat-prevention/ransomware /  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  9 ‘What Is Ransomware? - Definition, Prevention & More | Proofpoint US’. https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat- reference/ransomware  (accessed Jun. 28, 2022).  10 ENISA Threat Landscape 2021| https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/enisa-threat-landscape-2021 (accessed Jul. 5,  2022).  11 ‘BLACKMAIL | Meaning & Definition for UK English | Lexico.com’, Lexico Dictionaries | English.  https://www.lexico.com/definition/blackmail  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  12 A.

We refer  to these four core actions as LEDS (Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal). Ransomware can lock  access to an asset, such as locking the screen, or lock access to a particular application. It can  encrypt an asset, making it unavailable to the target. It can steal an asset, compromising its  availability and in the end its confidentiality. Lastly, it can delete an asset, making it permanently  unavailable.  Assets are anything of value for a business or organisation. The most common targeted assets  by ransomware are files and folders. Most assets are technically a file in the majority of operating  systems, therefore the distinction needs to be made to show the differences between, for  example, ransomware that encrypts all the files in a target, compared with ransomware that only  encrypts parts of a file with the code to run a web server. However, it would be misleading to  assume that these are the only assets targeted. Other targeted assets may include databases,  web services, content management systems, screens, master boot records (MBR), master file  tables (MFT), and others.  Using actions and assets allows us to represent the capabilities of current ransomware in Table  1. This table only shows the capabilities of current ransomware as they were analysed, and it is  clear that many combinations are missing and there is room for variability as the threat  landscape evolves. Accordingly, this will be monitored by ENISA in future updates of this work.  Table 1: Capabilities of current ransomware in terms of actions they perform and assets they  target  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  10  2.3  LEDS ACTIONS  2.3.1 Lock  The action to lock an asset can imply very different things. In the case of mobile screens, it can  be simple to change the PIN of the mobile phone and lock the screen. In the case of an  application, it can be to change the credentials to access it, the same with hardware. In  particular, we don’t consider the act of encryption as locking since that is covered in the action  to encrypt.  2.3.2 Encrypt  Encrypt refers to the action of using an encryption algorithm to make the content of a file,  folder or text available only to those who know the encryption algorithm used and who possess  the encryption key to decrypt it. There are different types of encryption algorithms that can be  used, assets that can be encrypted partially, different encryption types and a difference  regarding where the encryption takes place: only in the client, or in the client and server.  2.3.3 Delete  The act of deletion refers to the action of ordering the operating system to delete a file by (i)  the official OS procedure (which only deletes the reference to the file in the folder structure in  most operating systems) or (ii) by deleting the file by rewriting its bytes. In the case of in- memory databases, deletion is the action of asking the database to delete the file. Deletion can  also be done to virtual machines in cloud environments using official dashboards, which do not  involve the operating system. Deletion of a file does not imply that the file was encrypted or  stolen.  2.3.4 Steal  The action of stealing refers to copying the asset into the control of the attacker. It can be by  exfiltrating data to the Internet, or by copying data to a secret local folder unknown to the  owner of the asset. In particular, stealing does not imply deleting, or encrypting.  2.4  ASSETS TARGETED BY RANSOMWARE  The following assets are the most commonly observed assets targeted by ransomware in our  study. The list will likely expand in the future as ransomware continues to exploit vulnerable  systems.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  11  Table 2: Commonly observed assets in Ransomware incidents  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  12  3.  RANSOMWARE LIFE CYCLE  The life cycle of ransomware remained unchanged until around 2018 when ransomware started  to add more functionality and blackmailing techniques matured. We can identify five stages of a  ransomware attack: initial access, execution, action on objectives, blackmail, and ransom  negotiation. These stages do not follow a strictly sequential path which can vary.  We need to clarify and highlight that ransom negotiation is not a suggested recommendation for  victims of ransomware attacks. Contacting the competent cybersecurity authority and/or law  enforcement is the recommended approach to handling such incidents. However, in describing  the life cycle of typical ransomware incidents, we opted to include this stage in order to be  inclusive as in several cases this stage did take place.  Figure 1 describes the life-cycle stages of a ransomware attack, following a typical flow of  events from initial access to ransom negotiation, including actions and assets, and what  constitutes blackmail. Each of these stages is further discussed in the following subsections.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  13  Figure 1: The five stages of the ransomware life cycle  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  14  3.1  INITIAL ACCESS  The first stage of a ransomware attack is the initial access to the target. Ransomware uses the  same techniques for getting access as other attacks may use, including exploiting software  vulnerabilities, access through stolen credentials, phishing and others. In this report, we will not  cover how these techniques have changed.  It is very challenging to find out what were the current initial access techniques used by  ransomware against targets. The problem is due to the lack of incident reporting by  compromised organisations which leads to reduced information sharing and relevant lessons  learned. Public statements reporting the incidents are rare, and in the few cases where they are  reported, they do not include details on how the attack happened, what ransomware attacked  them, what they possibly took and what ransom was demanded. Many times, information is not  shared because it may not be known or because the victims fear further adversarial actions by  the threat actors or, most commonly, because they wish to avoid perceived reputational  damages.  3.2  EXECUTION  After initial access, threat actors may study the target, move laterally to other computers and  employ attack techniques14 to ensure more assets are found to be exploited. This activity may  take several weeks depending on the threat actor and the size and defences in place by the  target. This movement is usually completed before the ransomware starts working, although  when the ransomware starts it can also move laterally inside the victim’s network.  Once the assets are located and before the ransomware is executed, there is usually a cleaning  part where some actions are taken to ensure the correct working of the ransomware, such as:  kill the security software, stop programs like databases that can interfere with the writing, stop  the recovery features of systems, shadow copies, logs, etc.  The next step is the deployment of the ransomware. The ransomware can be deployed directly  or it can be deployed by third parties using botnet-based malware delivery, such as in the case  of Ryuk ransomware that used TrickBot and Emotet as delivery mechanisms15.  3.3  ACTION ON OBJECTIVES  Once deployed, the ransomware attacks the availability and/or the confidentiality of the targeted  assets through a series of actions. This stage is traditionally known as Action on Objectives16.  The full capabilities of ransomware are discussed and mapped in Table 1. Ransomware actions  are not immediate and can take place weeks after the initial infection of the system, giving  attackers additional time to access more internal systems.  There is no guarantee that the encryption has been done correctly and that files could be  decrypted after payment is completed. This is one additional reason why paying a demand for  ransom is not a recommended approach, since there are no guarantees that it will be effective.  3.4  BLACKMAIL  After the availability of assets has been compromised, the threat actor then proceeds to  blackmail the target to obtain a ransom in return for the availability of the assets. The three main  components of blackmail are communication, threat and demand. Communication is the act of  informing the target what is happening, e.g. the asset is no longer available.

The demand is what the threat actor  expects to obtain from the situation.  The communication of ransom demands changed in the last decade, moving from private  communication to more public communication. Earlier, a ransom note was shown on the  affected systems with instructions on what to do to pay and get the data back, and how to  communicate privately with the threat actors to negotiate. Nowadays it is common for threat  actors to publicly showcase ransom incidents, including information on the assets affected, the  ransom demands, and often publicly discrediting the target. It is also nowadays common for  some threat actors to coerce not only the targets but also their customers, partners and  interested parties thus piling up the pressure on the target.  The threats made in ransom demands have also evolved, with new forms of coercion being  introduced. Currently, organisations are threatened with partial and full data leaks, deletion of  the assets, and reselling data to the highest bidder (oftentimes competitors of the target).  Targets are also threatened with distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) against an  organisation’s infrastructure, which will only stop after successful negotiation of the ransom  payment.  Ransomware demands have also evolved but in a smaller proportion. The primary demand is  still monetary, attempting to obtain a financial profit from the ransom payments. When the target  pays and the threats do not materialise, the threat actor gains reputation and notoriety with the  public, allowing them to continue their operations. However, demands are not always monetary.  There is ransomware that has requested companies to add or remove software features in their  products12 or ransomware that asks targets to infect other people in order to obtain free  decryption keys13.  3.5  RANSOM NEGOTIATION  The ransomware negotiation is generally a private communication, if any, between the target  and the threat actors. We need to stress again that this is not a recommended step,  nonetheless from an incident life cycle perspective we need to examine it since it has taken  place in some incidents. There are two outcomes to this negotiation: targets pay the ransom or  do not pay. It is not uncommon to hear that target organisations or individuals have successfully  negotiated with the threat actors to lower the ransom money demanded.  Unfortunately, it is extremely hard to quantify who paid or did not pay the ransom and in which  cases a lower ransom was agreed upon. This information is not commonly made publicly  available. Often, there are reports where the total earnings of the threat actors are reported but  not on an individual level. There are also threat actors that, after a successful payment, remove  the compromised target name from their public website. However, it is not safe to generalise  and assume that all targets that are no longer on the web page paid a ransom fee, as in many  cases ransomware websites are buggy and unstable. Moreover, basing assessments on the  claims of cyber criminals is not a reliable source.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  16  4.  RANSOMWARE BUSINESS  MODELS  Ransomware has significantly evolved, both technically and organisationally, since the first  incident was observed in 198917. The market has matured to such a degree that ransomware  has become a commodity18. With the new ransomware-as-a-service business models, almost  anyone can conduct a ransomware attack. You can buy it as a part of your larger operation, and  there are no significant differences between one ransomware family and another. However, the  ransomware organisation, like other malware underground, is complex, with multiple actors,  roles, problems, solutions and culture. Our exploration of the business models of ransomware  depicts a high level view of how threat actors create, organise and obtain value from  ransomware attacks19.  4.1  INDIVIDUAL ATTACKERS  Initially, ransomware attacks were conducted by single individuals or very small groups. These  ransomware attacks were less complex than attacks today, often focusing on automatic  encryption that did not require operational coordination. The focus of the attackers was on the  development and spread of the ransomware. It is very hard to know which groups started as  single individuals and how long they remained like that. Many threat actors probably started as  small groups as it seems the operation required plenty of work and coordination so eventually  all actors needed the organisation of a small group20.  4.2  GROUP THREAT ACTORS  In what is now considered the traditional ransomware business model, a single group  threat actor is composed of multiple individuals that share and split and coordinate all the  stages of the operation: picking the target, analysing the target for vulnerabilities, conducting the  attacks, producing the malware and infection, coordinating the file encryption keys, negotiating  the ransom payment, and getting the revenue. The same group also generally develops all their  tools, sets the payment system, and buys exploits or the information required to conduct  successful attacks. This business model is still the main organisational choice even though new  opportunities have appeared, such as ransomware-as-a-service.  4.3  RANSOMWARE-AS-A-SERVICE  Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) is a type of business model where threat actor groups offer  their software platform to external affiliates to conduct attacks21. Affiliate markets are well known  in the cybercrime organisation. The affiliate programme is operated by a threat actor group  (RaaS operator) and it incorporates external affiliates that use the malware and payment  platform.

The RaaS operators develop the ransomware and provide the software platform for affiliates to  operate. The RaaS affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks, the payment negotiation, collect  the ransom and also purchase additional exploits or information needed to conduct the  attacks22. This type of business model allows the RaaS operators to have multiple revenue  streams. One source of income is a percentage of the ransom payment to the affiliates, often  10-20% or more23. Other sources of income can be selling data about targets, monthly  subscriptions that affiliates pay to access the platform24, or consultancy to other threat actors25.  RaaS has lowered the entry-level barrier to conduct ransomware attacks. Attackers now do not  need to know how to write their own ransomware. They need to know only how to conduct an  attack, and the RaaS operators will provide the ransomware and the platform to operate.  Anyone can attack, and anyone can become a target. RaaS platforms also introduce a new  level of anonymity into the cybercrime operations, as it is rarely known who the attacker really is  while operating as an affiliate. It is now easier than ever to get into ransomware as an affiliate,  profit and retire quickly, as has already been witnessed with some threat actors25.  4.4  DATA BROKERAGE  Ransomware threat actors are moving towards a new business model referred as Data  Brokerage. In this model, threat actors take further advantage of the stolen data by selling it to  the highest bidders26. This also includes reselling the access obtained to the target to other  threat actors for additional exploitation2 27.  4.5  NOTORIETY AS KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL RANSOMWARE BUSINESS  Ransomware demands are mostly financially motivated. In order to succeed in the business,  ransomware needs to demonstrate a guarantee that decryption will work. Usually, threat actors  have mechanisms to show that the decryption works, such as decrypting sample files.  The ransomware operators need to maintain a certain reputation of notoriety, otherwise, victims  will not pay the ransom. The reputation of ransomware groups also depends on how well they  keep their word. Many attackers promise that upon payment they will remove the companies  from their websites, delete the stolen data and not leak data to the public. A report shows that in  18% of cases the companies that paid the ransom still got their data leaked, and 35% of the  victims that paid the ransomware were unable to retrieve their data28.  Notoriety and reputation is nearly impossible to measure, however, a 2021 report showed that  60% of respondents that reported ransomware incidents did actually negotiate with their  attackers, showing that victims perceive threat actors to be worthy interlocutors28.  Although ransomware threat actors seem to have kept their word in some cases, one needs to  realise that there is no guarantee that payment of a ransom will lead to solutions and standing  22 V.

Negotiating with cyber criminals is not recommended and, in  the case of ransomware incidents, contacting law enforcement and national cybersecurity  authorities is the recommended course of action.  Moreover, there are operational problems that directly impact the trust of the ransomware actors  and the whole ecosystem. Ransomware threat actors need infrastructure to work, but this  infrastructure has turned out to be very unreliable, with websites not updated, links to public  leaks expiring, data not available, and websites going down. This instability generates  uncertainty among victims, since it is not easy to confirm whether a ransomware attack actually  happened and whether files were really stolen, hence once again contacting authorities should  be pursued.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  19  5.  ANALYSIS OF  RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS  After presenting and defining ransomware, this section provides an analysis of sample incidents  between May 2021 and June 2022, showing the lay of the ransomware landscape and its  characteristics.  Before presenting the results it is important to clarify what is considered a ransomware incident  for the purposes of this analysis. A ransomware incident is a successful attack in which a threat  actor manages to access a target, perform any LEDS action (Lock, Encrypt, Delete, Steal) on  the target’s assets, and perform blackmail. Note that the ransom negotiation is not needed –  and certainly not encouraged – to consider an attack a ransomware incident.  Our analysis considers 623 ransomware incidents worldwide with a special focus on Europe,  the United Kingdom and the United States. These incidents were selected from news reports,  the reports of security companies, government reports and the original sites of the ransomware  threat actors. Each incident was explored in depth and confirmed from multiple sources.  5.1  DATA SAMPLING TECHNIQUE  It is important to understand the limitations of the data gathering process. To search, find and  collect the ransomware incidents in this report, different sources of data were used, such as  government reports, security company reports, news media reports, the dark web and  sometimes verified blogs. The sources were then processed, analysed and aggregated to  extract as much information about an incident as possible. In some ransomware incidents the  research has been a challenging task, as there was not enough available information.  The real total number of ransomware incidents in the period May 2021 to June 2022 is very  hard to estimate, due to many organisations not reporting the incidents and threat actors  deleting incidents from their pages.  Classifying the numbers of incidents on the basis of the source from which the relevant  information has been extracted is important, as it illustrates the level of trust in the collected  data.  Four types of number of incidents can be considered in this regard:  1. The real number of ransomware incidents  2. The number of ransomware incidents reported to governments  3. The number of ransomware incidents reported by news media and security companies  4. The number of ransomware incidents reported by ransomware groups on their web  pages  The real number of ransomware incidents is the real population of ransomware incidents in  the world. It is known that many organisations do not acknowledge incidents publicly, thus  making this number almost impossible to obtain.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  20  The number of ransomware incidents reported to governments is the number of  organisations that contacted a government to ask for assistance and report the attack. For  example, in 2021, the FBI Crime Report from the Internet Crime Complaint Centre (IC3)29  received 3,729 complaints identified as ransomware.  The number of ransomware incidents reported by news media and security companies is  more commonly reported but heavily biased towards the importance of the attacked  organisation. For example, from April 2021 to April 2022 the Sophos IT security company  indirectly reported 3,696 ransomware incidents (from 5,600 respondents in a survey of whom  66% had ransomware)30.  The number of ransomware incidents reported by ransomware groups on their web  pages is the most real account of incidents, but it is difficult to measure due to the instability of  the ransomware infrastructure. These incidents are often deleted or changed, web pages are  taken down or have migration issues. However, some organisations web-scraping threat actors'  websites31 reported 2,252 incidents in 2021, and 1,858 from January to June 2022.  We estimated that the total number of incidents from May 2021 to June 2022 was 3,64032 .  Since this report analyses 623 incidents, it therefore covers 17.11% of the total estimated cases  in that time frame. All results and conclusions as presented should take into account this  disclaimer concerning the number of incidents used in this analysis.  More importantly, it becomes evident from the varying numbers concerning how many  ransomware incidents took place that there is an issue with reporting such incidents.  Making detailed analysis and mitigating the ransomware threat necessitates a better  understanding of the threat landscape and to do so, more efficient and effective incident  reporting is necessary. In addition, the fact that we were able to find publicly available  information for 17.11% of the cases highlights that when it comes to ransomware, only  the tip of the iceberg is exposed and the impact is much higher than what is perceived.  5.2  STATISTICS ABOUT THE INCIDENTS  To qualitatively analyse the 623 incidents we studied each incident in further detail (using  publicly available information) and extracted information about the following categories.  Categories Description  Target Name of the organisation targeted.  Industry sector Industry sector of the target  Country Country of the target  Threat actor Name of the threat actor  Initial access techniques MITRE ATT&CK® category of the technique used to compromise  and access the target  29 ‘Internet Crime Report 2021’, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2021.

Ransomware Watch for 2021 reported  2,252, an average of 188 incidents per month. Sophos for Apr 2021 to Apr 2022 reported 3,696 incidents, an average of  308 incidents per month. Ransomware Watch from Jan 2021 to June 2022 reported 1,858 incidents, an average of 310  incidents per month. The average of the average incidents per month is (312 + 188 + 308 + 310) / 4, which equals 280  incidents per month. Therefore, from May 2021 to June 2022 (inclusive) there are 13 months and an estimated total of  280*13 = 3,640 incidents.  https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf https://www.sophos.com/en-us/content/state-of-ransomware https://www.sophos.com/en-us/content/state-of-ransomware https://github.com/joshhighet/ransomwatch/blob/fe3b0cf47bf439b10c3e69581a47346404a491b3/posts.json  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  21  Was the ransom paid?

The total accumulated stolen data for all incidents is 136.3  TB with an average of 518 GB per incident and an average of 10 TB per month. The  maximum volume of stolen data found in one incident alone was 50 TB; this was stolen from  Brazil’s Ministry of Health (MoH) by the Lapsus$ threat actor33. The timeline shown in Figure 5  illustrates the cumulative amount of data stolen per month.  5.4  AMOUNT OF LEAKED DATA  There are two main ways in which data can be leaked in a ransomware incident. First, data can  be partially leaked by threat actors to prove that they actually stole the data or to blackmail  targets to pay the ransom. Second, as a result of a failed ransom negotiation where threat  actors usually do a full data leak of the stolen data. The full data leak usually contains all the  stolen data.  Many different platforms are used to leak the stolen data. Threat actors may use their own  websites, cloud providers, or the group’s Telegram channel. Cloud providers usually take down  the leaks due to privacy concerns, but the leaks hosted on the attackers’ website remain  available, as well as on Telegram.  Of the 623 incidents analysed, evidence was found of partially leaked data in 62  incidents, 9.95% of the total incidents. Similarly, evidence was found of fully leaked data  in 236 incidents, which is 37.88% of the incidents. In total, in almost half of the cases  (47.83%) stolen data was leaked.  5.5  TYPE OF LEAKED DATA  More than 136 terabytes of data was stolen in the 623 incidents analysed. In 31% of the  incidents, attackers provided an insight into the type of data stolen, which often included  personal and business information.  5.6  PERSONAL DATA  In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines personal data as ‘any  information which is related to an identified or identifiable natural person’34.and protects them35.  33 ‘Brazilian Ministry of Health suffers cyberattack and COVID-19 vaccination data vanishes’, ZDNet.  https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-ministry-of-health-suffers-cyberattack-and-covid-19-vaccination-data-vanishes/  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  34 Personal Data’, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/  (accessed Jul.  02, 2022).  35 EUR-Lex - 32016R0679 - EN - EUR-Lex’. https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022).  https://www.zdnet.com/article/brazilian-ministry-of-health-suffers-cyberattack-and-covid-19-vaccination-data-vanishes/ https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/personal-data/ https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  22  Our analysis shows that 58.2% of all the stolen data contains GDPR personal data. This  personal data ranges from protected health information (PHI), passport numbers and visas, to  addresses and covid status.  In countries outside the European Union, personal data is classified into two types, personal  identifiable information (PII) and personal protected information (PPI). PII is any data that could  potentially identify a specific individual36, whereas PPI is personal information that is important  but not necessarily used to identify an individual37.  Our analysis shows that 33% of the stolen data includes employee PII and 18.3%  includes customer PII. In contrast, only 0.4% of the stolen data includes employee PPI  and 3.8% includes customer PPI.  5.7  NON-PERSONAL DATA  Additionally, 41.7% of the stolen data contains non-personal data. Non-personal data is  any information that is not related to identifiable natural persons. This data contains information  that directly impacts the targeted business, such as financial information, blueprints, insurance,  market research, internal network data, and more.  Of the stolen data, 19% contains financial information. Financial information refers to  business data related specifically with the financial aspects of the business. This data may  include departmental budgets, receipts, income declarations, financial statements, and more.  More than 24% of the data stolen contains business information. Business information  refers to data that is important for the company business, such as production data,  administrative documents, legal files, commercial registrations, NDAs (Non-Disclosure  Agreements), and more.  5.8  INCIDENTS PER COUNTRY  The estimation of incidents per country (shown in Figure 2) is biased by our data selection  process since this report focuses on incidents primarily in Europe, the United States and the  United Kingdom. Accordingly, the results present an interesting yet not fully representative  overview, since as discussed above, reported incidents and publicly available information is  scarce.  Of the 623 incidents analysed, we found that the top three countries attacked are the  United States with 112 incidents, Germany with 96 incidents, and France with 78  incidents.  36 ‘What is PII (Personally Identifiable Information)?

We have summarised some of  the most common initial access techniques observed according to the MITRE ATT&CK  framework39.

It is understandable that targets don’t want to share how they were (or still are)  vulnerable for security reasons but at the same time the lack of information does not help others to realise what they  should improve or how they can also be a victim in the future.  From the rest of the known 29 incidents for which initial access was leaked, there is small amount of data  upon which to draw conclusions; the distribution is as follows.  INITIAL ACCESS according to MITRE No of Incidents  T1133 External Remote Services 12  T1566 Phishing 8  T1195 Supply Chain Compromise 4  T1078 Valid Accounts 4  T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation 1  5.10  PAID RANSOM  It is very difficult to know whether targets paid the ransom or not, since most targets do not  share this information publicly and in many countries it is illegal to pay and in any case it is  discouraged. Moreover, sometimes targets want to pay a smaller amount of ransom but the  threat actor refuses, and the data is leaked anyway41. From all the incidents analysed, it was  not possible to confirm whether a ransom was paid in 588 cases, which is 94.2%. Out of  the rest of the incidents in our analysis, 8 paid the ransom and 58 did not pay the  ransom. Once again, this gap in incident reporting limits our understanding and thus our ability  to perform a proper analysis and mitigate the threat of ransomware; therefore solutions to this  problem need to be examined.  Interestingly, from our previous analysis of leaked data, we found that 37.88% of the  targets had their data fully leaked on the Internet. This suggests, but does not imply, that  around 62.12% of the incidents might have actually paid the ransom, and that is why  their data was not leaked. Of course, there are many mitigating situations, such as targets that  paid and their data was leaked anyway, or targets that did not pay and their data was not  leaked. However, the estimation of 62.12% is very close to the result of a survey from the  Claroty security company that found that 62.14% of the respondents confirmed that their  company paid the ransom42. Although these numbers should not be taken as a guide because  they are merely indicators, they certainly bring the problem into focus.  5.11  INCIDENTS IN EACH TYPE OF SECTOR  A meaningful statistic can be derived from the number of ransomware incidents in each sector.  However, special attention must be paid to the fact that the categorisation process we did of  each target in a sector is slightly biased because a target can belong to many categories.  Figure 3 shows a comparison of the number of incidents in each sector. This graph  suggests that ransomware is targeting all sectors indiscriminately and that no type of  industrial sector is safe.  41 ‘Hackers post hundreds of pages of purported internal D.C. police documents’, Washington Post.

However, unlike other cyberthreat groups, when it comes to ransomware threat actors publicly share and  take attribution for their attacks. From the 623 incidents analysed, only 22 incidents show no confirmation of  which threat actor was behind the attack, amounting to only 3.5% of all incidents. Therefore the threat actor  was known in 96.5% of cases. This is in stark contrast to other cybersecurity threats, where the identity of the threat  actors is not actively published. However, the ransomware business model works on increasing the visibility and  notoriety of ransomware groups and actors, hence the difference.  Our analysis in Figure 4 shows that the incidents were carried out by 47 unique ransomware threat actors.  The top 3 attackers are Conti, LockBit and Hive, which should come as no surprise given how prolific these threat  actors have been in the past year43. However, these total numbers should not be taken as a strong guideline since  our selection process slightly biased this evaluation by choosing at least 5 incidents from each threat actor.  43 ‘LockBit, Conti, and BlackCat Lead Pack Amid Rise in Active RaaS and Extortion Groups: Ransomware in Q1 2022 -  Security News’. https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat- lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat-lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022 https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/ransomware-by-the-numbers/lockbit-conti-and-blackcat-lead-pack-amid-rise-in-active-raas-and-extortion-groups-ransomware-in-q1-2022  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  26  Figure 4: Number of ransomware incidents caused by each threat actor  5.13  TIMELINE OF RANSOMWARE INCIDENTS  The 623 ransomware incidents analysed from May 2021 to June 2022 are shown in a  timeline in Figure 5. This timeline highlights the number of incidents and the cumulative data  stolen.  The number of incidents each month, shown in the vertical red colour bars above the horizontal  line, is built using the date of when the incident was reported and not when the attack  happened, which could have taken place weeks before. Curiously enough, researchers often  need to rely on ransomware websites to obtain this data due to the lack of transparency when it  comes to reporting ransomware incidents.  The cumulative amount of data stolen in terabytes (TB), shown in the vertical blue colour bars  below the horizontal line, should be understood as a base value, given that in more than 50% of  the incidents this information was unknown. The cumulative amount of data stolen should  also highlight the impact of ransomware, given that in at least 47% of the incidents the  stolen data was partially or fully leaked.

RECOMMENDATIONS  Ransomware attacks are a global problem, affecting organisations of all sizes across all sectors.  This threat landscape aims to identify the issues and challenges related to ransomware, to  highlight important trends and identify opportunities on how to improve the fight against  ransomware.  The reality shows that ransomware can have devastating effects on organisations if they are not  well prepared. In this section we present general recommendations that can help organisations  deal better with the problem of ransomware. The recommendations focus on several key  aspects: preparing against ransomware attacks and decreasing the impact of ransomware as  well as the decision to pay.  6.1  RESILIENCE AGAINST RANSOMWARE  The techniques attackers use are continuously evolving and they are finding new ways to  compromise targets. Organisations should not think whether they may suffer a ransomware  attack but when it will happen. These recommendations should help organisations prepare for a  ransomware attack before it happens and during its aftermath.  • Have a good and verified backup of all your business-critical files and personal data  and keep it updated, and isolated from the network44.  • Apply the 3-2-1 rule of backup. For all data: 3 copies, 2 different storage media, 1 copy  offsite45.  • Keep personal data encrypted according to the provisions of GDPR and using  appropriate risk-based controls46.  • Run security software in your endpoint devices that can detect most ransomware.  • Maintain your security awareness47, security policy, and privacy protection policy up to  date and working on your information systems and assets to accomplish desired  hygiene by industry best practices such as network segmentation, up to date patches,  regular backups, and appropriate identity, credential, and access management (ICAM)  preferably with support of MFA. This that basically result in a good security hygiene48  • Conduct regular risk assessment and consider taking out ransomware insurance49  based on this assessment.  • Restrict administrative privileges: use caution when handing out administrative  privileges as the admin account has access to everything, including changing  configurations or bypassing critical security settings. Always employ the Principle of  Least Privilege (PLOP) when granting any type of access50.  44 Simple Steps for Internet Safety’, Federal Bureau of Investigation. https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/simple-steps-for- internet-safety  (accessed Jul. 04, 2022)  45 ‘Backup’, Wikipedia.

Furthermore, sharing information with the authorities about the ransomware incident is highly  recommended. Such information sharing can lead to better lessons learned to assist other  potential victims, can assist the authorities and security researchers and responders to better  handle incidents and identify threat actors, and can provide more reliable data to map the threat  landscape and its evolution. Information sharing is one of the cornerstones of  cybersecurity.  When it comes to negotiating with threat actors about making ransom payments, this is not  recommended as repeatedly mentioned in this report. From a legal standpoint, organisations  should be aware of the current regulations about ransom payments. In some countries paying a  ransom is illegal. One should consult with the legal team and the local government agencies on  how to deal with ransomware attacks.  From a technical standpoint, it should be clear to every organisation that paying the ransom  does not always result in the recovery of the assets and a successful decryption. Businesses  should consider the cost of paying the ransom and not having the business back online.  Additionally, paying the ransom and recovering the assets does not mean that the stolen  information is not going to be leaked or sold afterwards; all stolen information should be  considered as compromised. Sophos reported that only 4% of the companies that paid the  ransom got all their data back and the majority that paid only got approximately 60% of their  data back53.  From a business standpoint, organisations should evaluate and consider the option of  recovering the business without the compromised assets, how much it would cost, and what is  the real impact of the stolen information being leaked even if the ransom is paid. Before  considering paying the ransom, organisations should consider the cost of a publicity backlash,  and be aware of the ethical standpoint.  From an ethical standpoint, organisations should be aware that they were attacked because of  ransomware’s fast growth, a growth caused primarily because organisations previously  infected paid the ransomware operators and funded their operations. Ransom payments  are undoubtedly fuelling the rapid growth of ransomware. Therefore, organisations should  51 ‘Report Ransomware | CISA’. https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/report-ransomware-0  (accessed Jul. 04, 2022)  52 No More Ransom’, The No More Ransom Project. https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/index.html  (accessed Jul. 02,  2022).  53 Sophos, ‘The State of Ransomware 2022’, Apr. 2022.

ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  31  7.  CONCLUSIONS  The analysis of the ransomware threat landscape from May 2021 to June 2022 resulted in some  conclusions that can be regarded as takeaways for the community.  7.1  LACK OF RELIABLE DATA  In general, ransomware security incidents are seldom reported. Most organisations prefer to  deal with the problem internally and avoid bad publicity. Some countries have laws regulating  the mandatory reporting of incidents, but in most cases a security attack is first disclosed by the  attacker.  A recent legislative initiative in the United States requires the reporting of all security incidents  and ransom payments to the Department of Justice Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency (CISA)54. In the EU, the arrival of the revised Network and Information Security  Directive 255 and the enhanced notification provisions for security incidents is expected to  support a better understanding of relevant incidents.  The lack of reliable data from targeted organisations makes it very hard to fully  understand the problem or even know how many ransomware cases there are. To this  day, the most reliable sources for finding out which organisations have been infected are the  web pages of the ransomware threat actors. This lack of transparency is not good for the  industry, since the majority of the data leaked, as was found in this report, is personal data that  belongs to employees and customers.  Even using the data from the web pages of threat actors (an undeniably unreliable source), it is  very hard to keep track of the number of attacks, particularly because a large majority is ignored  by the media, goes unreported by the victims and gets no coverage. The most important  information that is missing is the technical explanation as to how the attackers obtained access  to the targets. This is usually private data that describes the security posture of the target, so it  is never shared with the public. As a consequence, our learning as a community of the  problems to be solved remains fragmented and isolated.  Lastly, the trend in RaaS makes it hard to identify the threat actor behind an attack, since now  the ransomware tool and command and control are shared between many different affiliates  and threat actor groups.  7.2  THREAT LANDSCAPE  The study conducted on ransomware attacks from May 2021 to June 2022 showed that on  average more than 10 terabytes of data a month were stolen by ransomware threat  actors. Our research shows that 58.2% of the stolen data contains personal data from  employees. Given the sensitivity of such data, coordinated actions are needed to counter this  threat. Ransomware threat actors are motivated mostly in terms of the acquisition of money,  which increases the complexity of the attacks and, of course, the capabilities of the adversaries.  In 94.2% of the incidents it is not known whether the company paid the ransom or not.  However, 37.88% of the incidents had their data leaked on the webpages of the attackers,  indicating that the ransom negotiations failed. This allows us to estimate that  54 ‘Reporting of cyber incidents becomes law in the USA | Pen Test Partners’. https://www.pentestpartners.com/security- blog/reporting-of-cyber-incidents-becomes-law-in-the-usa/  (accessed Jul. 04, 2022)  55 See https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity- network-and-information-systems May 2022  https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/reporting-of-cyber-incidents-becomes-law-in-the-usa/ https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/reporting-of-cyber-incidents-becomes-law-in-the-usa/ https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-welcomes-political-agreement-new-rules-cybersecurity-network-and-information-systems  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  32  approximately 62.12% of the companies might somehow have come to an agreement or  solution concerning the ransom demand.  Ransomware is thriving, and our research shows that threat actors are conducting  indiscriminate attacks. Companies of every size across all sectors are affected. Anyone can  become a target. We urge organisations to prepare for ransomware attacks and consider  possible consequences before attacks occur.  ENISA THREAT LANDSCAPE FOR RANSOMWARE ATTACKS  July 2022  33  APPENDIX A: NOTABLE  INCIDENTS  This appendix presents the life cycles of two distinct cases. These two incidents resulted in  significant damage caused by the attacks and demands for quite large amounts of ransom.  Each of these cases helps illustrate the life cycle of ransomware incidents as explained in  Chapter 4.  A.1 COLONIAL PIPELINE RANSOMWARE INCIDENT  The Colonial Pipeline is the largest pipeline system for refined oil products in the United  States56 and provides roughly 45% of the United States East Coast's fuel, including gasoline,  diesel, home heating oil, jet fuel, and military supplies57.  On May 7, 2021, attackers gained initial access to the Colonial Pipeline network through  exposed VPN account credentials (T1078 58). The execution phase consisted of deploying  DarkSide ransomware59. The ransomware then proceeded to steal and encrypt files and folders  in the target. Nearly 100GBs of company data was stolen. The threat actor threatened to  publish leaked files if their demand was not met. The group demanded money, specifically 75  bitcoin in ransom, equivalent to approximately $4.4 million dollars, in exchange for a file  decryptor to restore the files. The result of the negotiations was that Colonial Pipeline paid the  ransom, received a file decryptor from the attackers, and used it to decrypt affected files and  folders. The life cycle is shown in Figure 6.  Although the payment of the ransom was made, the decryption tool had a very long processing  time so the company could not get the system back up quickly enough. This forced the Colonial  Pipeline Company to halt all pipeline operations and freeze IT systems to contain the attack.  Apart from the downtime, the ransomware attack also caused fuel shortages at several filling  stations and affected several airports leading to changes in flight schedules and more economic  loss.  The US Department of Justice stated that it had seized 63.7 Bitcoins from the original ransom  payment which was only $2.3 million because the trading price of Bitcoin had fallen since the  date the ransom was paid.  Darkside ransomware locks security software and event logging processes, deletes backups,  and steals and encrypts files and folders.  56 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack’, Wikipedia.

Their products are  installed on client workstations, endpoint management servers and managed services providers  (MSPs), which are companies that provide IT services to other companies. Each MSP has a  number of companies that they service and if one MSP is breached, it impacts all their clients,  which explains the widespread use of ransomware.  On July 3rd, 2021, attackers gained initial access to the supplier of Kaseya VSA servers by  exploiting a software vulnerability, specifically a SQL injection attack (T119061) 62 63. The SQL  attack resulted in the malicious payload by REvil being released and pushed to Kaseya  customers as a hotfix. A CVE was assigned for the vulnerability introduced by the attackers:  CVE-2021–3011664.  Attackers gained initial access to Kaseya customers, MSPs, by exploiting a trusted relationship  (T119965) on Kaseya software; attackers could send instructions and commands to the software  60 What is RMM - definition of remote monitoring and management system’, Atera - RMM software | PSA & Remote Access  for MSPs. https://www.atera.com/what-is-rmm/  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022)  61 Exploit Public-Facing Application, Technique T1190 - Enterprise | MITRE ATT&CK®’.  https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/  (accessed Jul. 02, 2022).  62 J.

In the execution phase, the attackers deployed REvil ransomware  on the target. The ransomware then proceeded to encrypt files and folders.  The blackmail component of this incident was special. Due to the impact of the attack, threat  actors demanded from Kaseya and indirectly its customers, the sum of 70 million dollars in  exchange for a file decryptor that would allow restoration of the availability of the affected assets  in all affected systems66. There were also alternative demands to accommodate individual  needs; 5 million dollars were demanded from individual MSPs to get a decryptor, 50,000 dollars  were demanded from MSPs’ customers to get a decryptor, and 40,000-45,000 dollars were  demanded to decrypt specific file extensions per customer67. The threat actor threatened to  double ransom money if there was no payment.  The result of the negotiations was that neither Kaseya nor the affected customers paid the  ransom. A file decryptor was obtained, it is unknown how, and many systems were able to be  restored.  Overall, the supply chain incident, shown in Figure 7, resulted in the compromise and  encryption of over 50 MSPs and between 800 and 1500 companies which represents a total of  37,000 of Kaseya’s clients or 0.001% of their total customer base. The ransomware demand of  70 million dollars was the biggest ransom demand as of July 23rd, 2021. The REvil ransomware  encrypts files, but no data-stealing or deleting of capabilities were observed67. The life cycle is  shown in Figure 8.  66 D.
